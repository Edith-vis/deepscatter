In this paper, we consider MVs to optimize complex scenarios where many heterogeneous nodes with different resource constraints (e.g., CPU, IO and network bandwidth) query and update numerous tables on different nodes. Such problems are typical for large enterprises, e.g., global retailers storing thousands of relations on hundreds of nodes at different subsidiaries.  Choosing which views to materialize in a distributed, complex scenario is NP-hard. Furthermore, the solution space is huge, and the large number of input factors results in non-monotonic cost models. This prohibits the straightforward use of brute-force algorithms, greedy approaches or proposals from organic computing. For the same reason, all solutions for choosing MVs we are aware of do not consider either distributed settings or update costs.  In this paper we describe an algorithmic framework which restricts the sets of considered MVs so that a genetic algorithm can be applied. In order to let the genetic algorithm converge quickly, we generate initial populations based on knowledge on database tuning, and devise a selection function which restricts the solution space by taking the similarity of MV configurations into account. We evaluate our approach both with artificial settings and a real-world RFID scenario from retail. For a small setting consisting of 24 tables distributed over 9 nodes, an exhaustive search needs 10 hours processing time. Our approach derives a comparable set of MVs within 30 seconds. Our approach scales well: Within 15 minutes it chooses a set of MVs for a real-world scenario consisting of 1,000 relations, 400 hosts, and a workload of 3,000 queries and updates.	brute-force search;central processing unit;centralized computing;converge;database tuning;distributed database;feasible region;genetic algorithm;greedy algorithm;materialized view;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;non-monotonic logic;optimization problem;organic computing;population;radio-frequency identification;relational database	Leonardo Weiss Ferreira Chaves;Erik Buchmann;Fabian Hueske;Klemens Böhm	2009		10.1145/1516360.1516484	materialized view;genetic algorithm;relational database;computer science;theoretical computer science;brute-force search;data mining;database;distributed database	DB	19.99305432355181	-2.7620082364034877	43700

This paper proposes a new dynamic multiobjective benchmark test suite which contains a number of component functions with clearly defined properties to assess the diversity maintenance and tracking ability of a dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). Time-varying fitness landscape modality, tradeoff connectedness, and tradeoff degeneracy are considered as these properties rarely exist in the current benchmark test instances. Cross-problem comparative study is presented to analyze the sensitivity of a given algorithm to certain fitness landscape properties. To demonstrate the use of the proposed benchmark test suite, three evolutionary multiobjective algorithms, namely nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, decomposition-based MOEA, and recently proposed Kalman-filter-based prediction approach, are analyzed and compared. Besides, two problem-specific performance metrics are designed to assess the convergence and diversity performances, respectively. By applying the proposed test suite and performance metrics, microscopic performance details of these algorithms are uncovered to provide insightful guidance to the algorithm designer.	additive model;benchmark (computing);convergence (action);degeneracy (graph theory);evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary computation;genetic algorithm;kalman filter;moea framework;mathematical optimization;modality (human–computer interaction);modular design;multi-objective optimization;pareto efficiency;program optimization;software performance testing;sorting;test suite	Sen Bong Gee;Kay Chen Tan;Hussein A.

81736c090b8576974714d3140c8895628ff93b61	a mixed load capacitated rural school bus routing problem with heterogeneous fleet: algorithms for the brazilian context	meta heuristic methods;mixed loading;capacitated rural school bus routing problem;random variable neighborhood descent;heterogeneous fleet;multiple schools	A capacitated rural school bus routing problem featuring mixed loads, a heterogeneous fleet, and the same school starting time is here addressed. This is an important problem of the routing literature which has been attracting the attention of many researchers recently. The mixed load feature allows students from different schools to ride the same bus at the same time. Five meta-heuristic based algorithms were devised to solve the problem, and evaluated on solving four different datasets, one of them being based on a real case from Brazil. Four traditional local search neighborhood structures for vehicle routing problems were adapted and specialized to handle mixed loads and a heterogeneous fleet simultaneously. To the best of the authors knowledge, it is the first time that both features are treated jointly within an algorithm, and not as a post processing optimization step. The attained cost savings and reduction of fleet sizes suggest the suitability of a mixed load, heterogeneous fleet approach for sparsely populated rural areas. Moreover the devised framework has been embedded into a decision support system which is assisting several municipalities of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, to better plan their routes and reduce transportation costs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

For this reason, there has been a growing interest in Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) in the past years. Several alternative approaches have been proposed to cope with the occurring problems, e.g. how to compare and rank the different elements. The available techniques produce very good results, but they have mainly been studied for problems of “low dimension”, i.e. with less than 10 optimization objectives. In this paper we study MOO for high dimensional spaces. We first review existing techniques and discuss them in our context. The pros and cons are pointed out. A new relation called -Preferred is presented that extends existing approaches and clearly outperforms these for high dimensions. Experimental results are presented for a very complex industrial scheduling problem, i.e. a utilization planning problem for a hospital. This problem is also well known as nurse rostering, and in our application has more than 20 optimization targets. It is solved using an evolutionary approach. The new algorithms based on relation -Preferred do not only yield better results regarding quality, but also enhances the robustness significantly.	algorithm;display resolution;experiment;industrial engineering;iterative and incremental development;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;nurse scheduling problem;optimizing compiler;program optimization;robustness (computer science);scheduling (computing)	André Sülflow;Nicole Drechsler;Rolf Drechsler	2006		10.1007/978-3-540-70928-2_54	nurse scheduling problem;probabilistic-based design optimization;optimization problem;mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;simulation;operations management;multi-objective optimization;mathematics;metaheuristic	DB	21.733753535359927	-3.547686669319799	44191

It receives new VMs on the Cloud and organises them by relocating their placements based on the Multiple-Objectives of the environment. These Objectives are represented by Rules, Qualifiers and Costs, which can be easily added, extended and prioritised. Based on Evolutionary and Greedy Searches, Order@Cloud theoretically guarantees the adoption of a better set of Placements. More specifically, it seeks the non-dominated solutions (Pareto Set) and compares them considering the implementation cost of the scenario and its benefits. In contrast to existing solutions, that address specific objectives, our framework was devised to be objective-agnostic and easily extensible, which enables the implementation of new and generic prioritised elements. To understand the applicability and performance of our solution we conducted experiments using a real Cloud environment and discuss its performance, flexibility and optimality.	cloud computing;experiment;greedy algorithm;mathematical optimization;pareto efficiency;virtual machine	Guilherme Arthur Geronimo;Rafael Brundo Uriarte;Carlos Becker Westphall	2016	NOMS 2016 - 2016 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium	10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502854	real-time computing;convergence;cloud computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computational model;radio frequency;computer network	Embedded	20.899281631704103	-2.595984841271019	44225

This company receives periodically a set of orders for the production of specific items (jobs) through a number of specialised production (assembly) lines. The paper presents a non compensatory approach based on an interactive implementation of the ε-constraint method that enables the decision maker to achieve a satisfactory goal for each objective separately. In fact, the method generates and evaluates a large number of non dominated solutions that constitute a representative sample of the criteria ranges. The experience with a specific numerical example shows the efficiency and usefulness of the proposed model in solving large scale bicriterion industrial integer programming problems, highlighting at the same time the modelling limitations.	assembly language;computation;decision analysis;decision support system;decision theory;emoticon;fits;integer programming;interactivity;iterative method;job stream;mathematical optimization;nanosat mo framework;numerical analysis;pareto efficiency;scheduling (computing);time complexity	Ioanna Makarouni;John E.

Equity is one of its most important constraints with the aim to ensure the value of one or several interesting spatial attributes at a certain level and to provide solutions to specific requirements in applications. This paper tackles a new regionalization scenario in which the threshold used in equity constraint is a regional mean measurement and depends on an unknown amount of regions. A novel nonlinear mixed integer programming model is developed. For the solution of the model a parallel genetic algorithm capable of solving large-scale, real-world instances, is designed. Our efforts in designing a genetic algorithm that integrates an upper bound heuristic are reported. A group of 30 synthetic lattice data is generated according to the spatial auto regressive function to evaluate the proposed genetic algorithm. Equity attributes with both Uniform distribution and Poisson distribution are considered to make a comparison. This work makes an original contribution in the solution of the regionalization problem with adaptive equity constraint.	approximation algorithm;constraint logic programming;constraint programming;genetic algorithm;greedy algorithm;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;nonlinear system;programming model;requirement;synthetic intelligence	Linqing Wang;Jun Zhao;Wei Wang;Zili Zhan	2015	2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244475	econometrics;mathematical optimization;machine learning;genetic representation;mathematics	AI	20.833557271484068	-2.815932154883674	44345
2bc0eacb9070937c64a290a242c00be164c76def	setting up particle swarm optimization by decision tree learning out of function features		This work describes an approach for the computation of function fea- tures out of optimization functions to train a decision tree. This decision tree is used to identify adequate parameter settings for Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The function features describe different characteristics of the fitness land- scape of the underlying function. We distinguish between three types of features: The first type provides a short overview of the whole search space, the second describes a more detailed view on a specific range of the search space and the remaining features test an artificial PSO behavior on the function. With these fea- tures it is possible to classify fitness functions and to identify a parameter set which leads to an equal or better optimization process compared to the standard parameter set for Particle Swarm Optimization.	decision tree learning;particle swarm optimization	Tjorben Bogon;Georgios Poursanidis;Andreas D.

In this paper, we compare the operational productivities of the two types of vehicles when used in combination with the quay cranes of various performances. We assume a flexible path layout in which the vehicles can move almost freely in any vertical and horizontal directions. The traffic control scheme employed in our simulation finds a minimum- time route and schedules the travel to avoid deadlocks. Simulation experiments show that the ALVs reach the same productivity level as the AGVs using much less number of vehicles due to its self-lifting capability. However, the results also reveal that the AGVs eventually catch up the performance of the ALVs in most cases if the number of vehicles given is large enough. An exception is when the tandem double-trolley QCs are used for loading, in which case the AGVs cannot catch up the ALVs no matter how many more vehicles are added.

In this research, a mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to configure a closed-loop supply chain network. The network includes multiple products, plants, recovery technologies, demand markets, and collection centres. The objective function is minimisation of the total cost. The model can determine number and locations of open facilities, and flows of products in the network. In addition, we develop the model to multi-objectives by considering minimisation of defect rates and time of operations in collection centres. To solve the model, weighted-sums and distance methods are applied in copier remanufacturing example and the results are analysed. Moreover, value path approach is applied to compare the results of different methods.	mathematical model;supply chain network	Saman Hassanzadeh Amin;Guoqing Zhang	2014	IJBPSCM	10.1504/IJBPSCM.2014.058890	mathematical optimization;simulation;operations management	ECom	10.95684670836232	-3.100825556197005	44435

The scope is focused on optimally deploying firefighting aircrafts on aerodromes and airports existing over an area based on fire risk predictions. This scenario is formulated as a capacity-constrained multi-objective optimisation problem where the utility of the deployed resources with respect to fire forest risk predictions is to be maximised, and expenditures associated with the reallocation of aircrafts must be minimised. This formulation is further complemented by including the impact of the distance from the wildfire to water sources in the firefighting utility function. To efficiently tackle this problem a multi-objective harmony search solver is designed and tested in synthetically generated and real scenarios for the Iberian Peninsula. The results obtained pave the way towards the utilisation of this tool by decision makers when outlining their firefighting logistics.	harmony search;heuristic (computer science);logistics;mathematical optimization;software deployment;solver;utility	Miren Nekane Bilbao;Javier Del Ser;Sancho Salcedo-Sanz;Carlos Casanova-Mateo	2015	IJBIC	10.1504/IJBIC.2015.072257	mathematical optimization;simulation;harmony search;computer science	AI	10.83718064662727	-5.49961935646537	44603

While large number of scenarios brings significant challenge to computations, the scenario reduction aims at selecting a small number of representative scenarios that can capture the wide range of possible scenarios. A novel scenario reduction algorithm is proposed in this paper to incorporate the consideration of both input data and output performance of decision making. The proposed optimal scenario reduction algorithm, OSCAR, is formulated as a mixed integer linear optimization problem. It minimizes not only the probptimal scenario reduction robabilistic distance ixed integer linear optimization abilistic distance between the original and reduced input scenario distribution, but also minimizes the differences between the best, worst and expected performances of the output measure of the original and the reduced scenario distributions. The proposed method leads to reduced distribution not only closer to the original distribution in terms of the transportation distance, but also captures the performance of the output. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A novel multiobjective optimization algorithm, namely the non-dominated sorting multiobjective particle swarm optimization (NS-MOPSO), has been proposed and employed efficiently to solve this important problem. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with four multiobjective evolution algorithms (MOEAs), based on non-dominated sorting, and one MOEA algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). The performance results obtained from the study are also compared with those of single objective evolutionary algorithms, such as the genetic algorithm (GA), tabu search (TS), simulated annealing (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The comparisons of the performance include three error measures, four performance metrics, the Pareto front and computational time. A nonparametric statistical analysis, using the Sign test and Wilcoxon signed rank test, is also performed, to demonstrate the superiority of the NS-MOPSO algorithm. On examining the performance metrics, it is observed that the proposed NS-MOPSO approach is capable of identifying good Pareto solutions, maintaining adequate diversity. The proposed algorithm is also applied to different cardinality constraint conditions, for six different market indices, such as the Hang-Seng in Hong Kong, DAX 100 in Germany, FTSE 100 in UK, S&P 100 in USA, Nikkei 225 in Japan, and BSE-500 in India.	algorithm	Sudhansu Kumar Mishra;Ganapati Panda;Ritanjali Majhi	2014	Swarm and Evolutionary Computation	10.1016/j.swevo.2014.01.001	mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;operations management;mathematics;welfare economics	AI	19.768839567214194	-3.8693294189998673	44662

094d1aca0d2e60322ca225b8083db6bcb48f528e	efficient evolutionary algorithm for single-objective bilevel optimization		Bilevel optimization problems are a class of challenging optimization problems, which contain two levels of optimization tasks. In these problems, the optimal solutions to the lower level problem become possible feasible candidates to the upper level problem. Such a requirement makes the optimization problem difficult to solve, and has kept the researchers busy towards devising methodologies, which can efficiently handle the problem. Despite the efforts, there hardly exists any effective methodology, which is capable of handling a complex bilevel problem. In this paper, we introduce bilevel evolutionary algorithm based on quadratic approximations (BLEAQ) of optimal lower level variables with respect to the upper level variables. The approach is capable of handling bilevel problems with different kinds of complexities in relatively smaller number of function evaluations. Ideas from classical optimization have been hybridized with evolutionary methods to generate an efficient optimization algorithm for generic bilevel problems. The efficacy of the algorithm has been shown on two sets of test problems. The first set is a recently proposed SMD test set, which contains problems with controllable complexities, and the second set contains standard test problems collected from the literature. The proposed method has been evaluated against two benchmarks, and the performance gain is observed to be significant.	approximation;benchmark (computing);bilevel optimization;evolutionary algorithm;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;program optimization;service mapping description;test set;turing test	Ankur Sinha;Pekka Malo;Kalyanmoy Deb	2013	CoRR		optimization problem;mathematical optimization;bilevel optimization;algorithm	AI	22.84058246128098	-3.4929985686903064	44958

DUE and SUE are two well known transportation problems where the transportation demand has to be assigned to an underlying network (supply in transportation terminology) according to single user satisfaction rather than aiming at some global optimum. ACS-TA turns the classic ACS meta-heuristic for discrete optimization into a technique for equilibrium computation. ACS-TA can be easily adapted to take into account all aspects characterizing the traffic assignment problem: multiple origin-destination pairs, link congestion, non-separable cost link functions, elasticity of demand, multiple classes of demand and different user cost models including stochastic cost perception. Applications to different networks, including a non-separable costs case study and the standard Sioux Falls benchmark, are reported. Results show good performance and wider applicability with respect to conventional approaches especially for stochastic user equilibrium computation.	algorithm;ant colony;assignment problem;benchmark (computing);choice modelling;complex network;computation;converge;discrete optimization;elasticity (cloud computing);feasible region;generalized linear model;global optimization;heuristic;iteration;loss function;mathematical optimization;network congestion;optimization problem;time complexity;vergence	Matteo Matteucci;Lorenzo Mussone	2013	Swarm Intelligence	10.1007/s11721-013-0083-x	mathematical optimization;simulation;artificial intelligence;operations research	AI	17.54816155969082	2.576827571438573	44988

By exploiting problem-specific characteristics, classical heuristic methods--such as constructive and iterative local search methods--aim at a relatively limited exploration of the search space, thereby producing acceptable-quality solutions in modest computing times. In a major departure from a classical heuristic, a metaheuristic method exploits not only the problem characteristics but also ideas based on artificial intelligence methodologies, such as different types of memory structures and learning mechanisms, as well as analogies with optimization methods found in nature. Solutions produced by metaheuristics typically are of a much higher quality than those obtained with classical heuristic approaches.This article is part of a special issue on advanced heuristics in transportation and logistics.	heuristic;logistics	Christos D.

4e50e73d1edae65d4830fe6ee255b879785603e0	design of passengers' circulation areas at the transfer station: an automated hybrid simulation-differential evolution framework		Abstract The capacity design of passengers’ circulation areas at the transfer stations is a crucial issue from the designers’ point of view. An adequate design reflects the better performance while inadequacy leads to the congestion issues at the transfer stations. To overcome the shortcomings in the design guide (TCRP-165 Report) and existing exponential-based (M/G( n )/N/N) design model, this paper reports a novel Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) model based on the Phase-Type (PH)-distributed random variates for the circulation areas (passageways and stairways), integrated with the Differential Evolution (DE) optimization approach. This hybrid simulation-optimization model is an automated framework that simultaneously works to provide optimal widths of the passengers’ circulation areas, under a desirable Level-of-Service (LOS) and blocking probability criteria. The passengers’ arrival and service time pattern of the circulation areas in the DES model is described by the PH distribution, which accurately takes into account the variation of passengers’ arrival at different instants as well as randomness and state-dependent service time of the circulation areas. The comparison of proposed model with exponential-based (M/G( n )/N/N) model and TCRP-165 Report reveals that: (1) the optimal widths of circulation areas obtained by proposed model are greater than both M/G( n )/N/N and TCRP-100 Report; (2) the optimal width increases with the increase in squared coefficient of variation for all the passengers’ arrival rates, LOS and lengths of the circulation areas; (3) the optimal width values drop from LOS B towards D; (4) our proposed simulation-DE optimization outperforms the simulation-GA optimization approach in term of the speed of convergence. This novel hybrid simulation-DE optimization framework is an effective tool for the designers of transfer stations in decision making process and analyzing the complex facilities with ease.	differential evolution;simulation	Afaq Khattak;Yangsheng Jiang;Arshad Hussain	2018	Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory	10.1016/j.simpat.2018.07.012	square (algebra);randomness;differential evolution;computer science;real-time computing;transfer station;mathematical optimization;coefficient of variation;convergence (routing);exponential function	AI	10.313423739094029	-9.259447489987632	45175

Current European projects aim partial or total automation of air traffic control to deal with the constant growth of air traffic. Technological advances on flight management system allows us to consider an automatic conflict resolution using continuous trajectories. In this paper, we present a new methodology that, first, relies on B-splines to model trajectories, secondly models air-traffic conflict resolution as an optimization problem whose decision variables are the spline control points. Finally, we use genetic algorithms to tackle this optimization problem in order to generate optimal conflict-free situations.	ambiguous name resolution;b-spline;bandwidth management;conn;derivative-free optimization;flight management system;genetic algorithm;global optimization;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;optimizing compiler;software release life cycle;spline (mathematics)	Clement Peyronne;Daniel Delahaye;Marcel Mongeau;Laurent Lapasset	2010			automation;genetic algorithm;simulation;air traffic control;flight management system;conflict resolution;optimization problem;computer science;spline (mathematics)	AI	14.500646019260639	1.5452343268607158	45354

Our basic strategy is to run some 105 independent search paths simultaneously using PVM on a vector supercomputer VPP800, which consists of 40 vector processors. Using the above parallelization and vectorization together with some improvement of data structure, we obtained 600-times speedup in terms of the number of flips the local search can make per second, compared to the original GSAT by Selman and Kautz. We ran our parallel GSAT for benchmark instances and compared the running time with those of existing SAT programs. We could observe an apparent benefit of parallelization: Especially, we were able to solve two instances that have never been solved before this paper. We also tested parallel local search for the SAT encoding of the class scheduling problem. Again we were able to get almost the best answer in reasonable time.	automatic vectorization;benchmark (computing);boolean satisfiability problem;central processing unit;conjunctive normal form;data structure;local search (optimization);parallel virtual machine;parallel computing;scheduling (computing);search algorithm;speedup;supercomputer;time complexity;vector processor;yahoo! answers	Kazuo Iwama;Daisuke Kawai;Shuichi Miyazaki;Yasuo Okabe;Jun Umemoto	2002	ACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics	10.1145/944618.944620	mathematical optimization;parallel computing;data structure;computer science;local search;theoretical computer science;algorithm	AI	22.282005505702646	3.361329245818038	45754
ae7b7a0cd1e2e53665bfe55745bacb8b101bbb22	multiple and nonuniform time grids in discrete-time mip models for chemical production scheduling	modeling of time;chemical production scheduling;mixed integer programming	The modeling of time plays a key role in the formulation of mixed-integer programming (MIP) models for scheduling, production planning, and operational supply chain planning problems. It affects the size of the model, the computational requirements, and the quality of the solution. While the development of smaller continuous-time scheduling models, based on multiple time grids, has received considerable attention, no truly different modeling methods are available for discrete-time models. In this paper, we challenge the long-standing belief that employing a discrete modeling of time requires a common uniform grid. First, we show that multiple grids can actually be employed in discrete-time models. Second, we show that not only unit-specific but also task-specific and material-specific grids can be generated. Third, we present methods to systematically formulate discrete-time multi-grid models that allow different tasks, units, or materials to have their own time grid. We present two different algorithms to find the grid. The first algorithm determines the largest grid spacing that will not eliminate the optimal solution. The second algorithm allows the user to adjust the level of approximation; more approximate grids may have worse solutions, but many fewer binary variables. Importantly, we show that the proposed models have exactly the same types of constraints as models relying on a single uniform grid, which means that the proposed models are tight and that known solution methods can be employed. The proposed methods lead to substantial reductions in the size of the formulations and thus the computational requirements. In addition, they can yield better solutions than formulations that use approximations. We show how to select the different time grids, state the formulation, and present computational results.	approximation algorithm;computation;integer programming;linear programming;requirement;scheduling (computing)	Sara Velez;Christos T.

Water supply systems are studied as spatially organized networks for which the practical applications of abstract evaluation methods are critically evaluated. Empirical data from benchmark networks are used to study the interplay between network structure and operational efficiency, reliability, and robustness. Structural measurements are undertaken to quantify properties such as redundancy and optimal-connectivity, herein proposed as constraints in network design optimization problems. The role of the supply demand structure toward system efficiency is studied, and an assessment of the vulnerability to failures based on the disconnection of nodes from the source(s) is undertaken. The absence of conventional degree-based hubs (observed through uncorrelated nonheterogeneous sparse topologies) prompts an alternative approach to studying structural vulnerability based on the identification of network cut-sets and optimal-connectivity invariants. A discussion on the scope, limitations, and possible future directions of this research is provided.	benchmark (computing);complex network;mathematical optimization;network planning and design;reliability engineering;robustness (computer science);social network analysis;sparse matrix	A.

These methods are the result of systemic analysis of the decision rule nearest neighbor, to which he was found on systems archetype “Solutions counterproductive.” The SCA is based on the traveler used in the TSP, resign at any time to overnight stop near the city immediately, and moved to the second city nearest available. From this change, the traveler continues with the nearest neighbor rule. Each SCA is performed (global search) a local search is performed 2_opt. The two heuristics reflect a good performance in efficiency and effectiveness in comparison with various metaheuristics in the categories of ant colonies, genetic algorithms, simulated annealing and other. Emerging questions are provided that enable a greater understanding and improvement of the study. These questions are also invited to continue integrating elements of clasic optimization with systems thinking.	2-opt;ant colony;genetic algorithm;heuristic (computer science);local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;simulated annealing	Jorge Iván Pérez Rave;Gloria Patricia Jaramillo Álvarez	2011	RASI			AI	24.072552672878746	0.6985888824867148	46005

Most of them use the standard activity list representation, given that it seems to perform best in solving the RCPSP independently of the paradigm employed (genetic algorithms, tabu search, simulated annealing, ...). However, we have designed an innovative representation, one which has not been used before and which includes a lot of problem-specific knowledge. Based on that representation we have developed a new competitive and robust hybrid genetic algorithm, which uses genetic operators and an improvement mechanism specially designed to work on that representation and exploit, in a very efficient way, the information contained in it. We have compared this algorithm with the best algorithms published so far, using the standard benchmark of PSPLIB. The results show the excellent performance of our algorithm.	genetic algorithm;scheduling (computing)	Javier Alcaraz;Concepción Maroto	2007			nurse scheduling problem;mathematical optimization;knowledge base;genetic algorithm;simulated annealing;hybrid algorithm;tabu search;computer science;artificial intelligence;genetic operator;machine learning;two-level scheduling;distributed computing;schedule;population-based incremental learning	Robotics	21.89900958083271	-0.6287022554957657	46072

c744e700b9871f0584d7f747c90b458bae4c70b8	analyzing tie-breaking strategies for the a* algorithm		For a given state space and admissible heuristic function h there is always a tie-breaking strategy for which A∗ expands the minimum number of states [Dechter and Pearl, 1985]. We say that these strategies have optimal expansion. Although such a strategy always exists it may depend on the instance, and we currently do not know a tie-breaker that always guarantees optimal expansion. In this paper, we study tie-breaking strategies for A∗. We analyze common strategies from the literature and prove that they do not have optimal expansion. We propose a novel tie-breaking strategy using cost adaptation that has always optimal expansion. We experimentally analyze the performance of A∗ using several tie-breaking strategies on domains from the IPC and zero-cost domains. Our best strategy solves significantly more instances than the standard method in the literature and more than the previous state-of-the-art strategy. Our analysis improves the understanding of how to develop effective tie-breaking strategies and our results also improve the state-of-the-art of tie-breaking strategies for A∗.	admissible heuristic;algorithm;effective domain;experiment;heuristic (computer science);rounding;state space	Augusto B.

Their availability has been reduced with the more evident effects of climate change. Addressing this challenge necessitates more and efficient purification plants which can be realised by optimal design at conceptual stage. In this work, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for the synthesis and optimisation of water treatment processes is proposed. Due to its numerous non-linearities and consequently, its non-stability, various linearisation, approximation and reformulation techniques have been implemented. Consequently, two improved formulations are derived, i.e. a partially linearised MINLP (plMINLP) and a mixed integer linear fractional programming (MILFP) models. The applicability of the mathematical formulations are investigated in case studies of seawater desalination and surface water treatment for the production of potable water. Finally, the models performance is analysed and compared against each other.	mathematical optimization	Mariya N. Koleva;Craig A. Styan;Lazaros G.

It reformulates test data generation as a metaheuristic search. A well- designed fitness function is essential to the efficiency of evolutionary search. Many efforts have been directed at the design and implementation of fitness function in recent years. However, previous work has just focused on the control dependency of the target on the branches in the same function. When function calls exist in the desired execution trace to the target, the evaluation of the test data on the coverage of these function calls, which should be provided to the evolutionary search, is not captured by the existing fitness function. In this case, the existing fitness function can not fairly evaluate the test data. And the evolutionary search will be hampered or even fail in severe cases. In this paper, a new term is first proposed to incorporate into the existing fitness function. It is applied to evaluate the test data's coverage of function calls along the desired path to the target. The new fitness function can evaluate the test data more fairly, resulting in a better guidance to the evolutionary search. This can be seen by the experiments carried out on two cases.	experiment;fitness function;metaheuristic;subroutine;test data generation	Xiyang Liu;Miao Zhang;Zhiwen Bai;Lei Wang;Wen Du;Yan Wang	2007	14th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC'07)	10.1109/ASPEC.2007.13	evolutionary programming;reliability engineering;evolutionary music;test data generation;interactive evolutionary computation;human-based evolutionary computation;computer science;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;data mining;fitness approximation;evolutionary robotics;fitness function;evolutionary computation	SE	21.043860237792835	-7.695330622919725	47192

Neither an algorithmic nor a procedural layout design methodology is usually effective in solving a practical design problem. This paper proposed a hierarchical analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to solve a plant layout design problem. A computer-aided layout-planning tool was used to generate a considerable numbers of layout alternatives as well as to generate quantitative decision-making unit (DMU) outputs. The qualitative performance measures were weighted by AHP. DEA was then used to solve the multiple-objective layout problem. Empirical illustrations from a practical case study illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

We observe that in spite of an apparently very insular search space, we consistently obtain the best results when using a repair mechanism, effectively eliminating infeasible solutions.

This is a simple and efficient algorithm which is used for both single and multi-objective problems. It can easily be utilized for real life applications. The proposed algorithm makes use of the principle of Pareto solutions. It mines the Pareto archive to extract the most repetitive sequences, and constitutes artificial chromosome for generation of the next population. In order to guide the search direction, this approach coupled with variable neighborhood search.

Under the framework of timed Petri nets model, the scheduling problem can be formulated as finding a feasible transition firing sequence to avoid the deadlock situation and to minimize the makespan. In the genetic algorithm, Petri net transition sequence is coded and a deadlock detection method based on siphon technology is addressed to reschedule the sequence of transitions, and thus the quality of solutions can be improved. In the fitness computation procedure, a penalty item for the infeasible solution is involved to prevent the search process from converging to the infeasible solutions. The method proposed In this work can get a feasible scheduling strategy as well as enable the system to achieve good performance, and this is shown by simulation results.	automation;computation;deadlock;genetic algorithm;genetic operator;makespan;petri net;scheduling (computing);simulation	Zhonghua Huang;Zhiming Wu	2004	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2004.

However, despite the large volume of work on search-based test data generation, the literature contains little work that concerns this problem. In this paper, by analysis of the clauses of the program, in addition to proposing a new search space reduction strategy, a new seeding approach is introduced.

One important objective of planning is to find an activity sequence so as to minimize the sum of superdiagonal numbers in a DSM. It is known that the problem is NP-complete and is difficult to solve. In this study, we prove several structural properties of the problem, and propose a heuristic for obtaining good feasible solutions. We find that based on the fold operation, a block of activities can be treated as a single activity. A novel hybrid algorithm is then presented for solving large activity sequencing problems. Finally, we perform a number of experiments and show that good solutions can be easily obtained by our approach. Moreover, the improvement achieved by the proposed approach is significant.	bell test experiments;design structure matrix;experiment;heuristic;hybrid algorithm;np-completeness	Yanjun Qian;Jun Lin;Thong Ngee Goh;Min Xie	2011	IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management	10.1109/TEM.2011.2107558	project management;mathematical optimization;heuristic;economics;computer science;operations management;iterative method;management;algorithm	SE	19.721018553260407	1.0529976494598887	47894

534edee6ad11e63ae4154f65b2350853846954ff	an optimization-simulation approach to chance constraint programming		A stochastic programming problem with a number of random parameters in the set of constraints is considered. An iterative optimization-simulation approach is applied as solving method. It consists of two phases: optimization phase, which includes solving a deterministic counterpart of the original chance-constrained problem, and a simulation phase in which the original constraints are checked using Monte Carlo simulation. One iteration corresponds to one scenario. If the decision maker is not satisfied with results, new scenario is generated in which the deterministic values of stochastic parameters are changed in the direction that will provide a more robust solution. Deterministic counterpart in the new scenario is formulated depending on the result of previous iteration. For that purpose, different heuristics are considered. The main goal is to provide a good insight on the optimization problem under uncertainty by performing relatively small number of iterations. General approach and results of the proposed framework will be illustrated on an advertisement placement example.

The β-acceptable solution probability is introduced that captures how effectively an algorithm has performed to date and how effectively an algorithm can be expected to perform in the future. Using this probability, the necessary conditions for a local search algorithm to converge in probability to β-acceptable solutions are derived. To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of local search algorithms, two estimators for the expected number of iterations to visit a β-acceptable solution are obtained. Computational experiments are reported with simulated annealing and tabu search applied to four small traveling salesman problem instances, and the Lin-KernighanHelsgaun algorithm applied to eight medium to large traveling salesman problem instances (all with known optimal solutions), to illustrate the application of these estimators.

3d93fb3cf7d86095feb2dff6530841c3e35b5fb6	a study on auto-configuration of multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm		Researches point out to the importance of automatic design of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Because in general, algorithms automatically designed outperform traditional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms from the literature. Nevertheless, until fairly recently, most of the researches have been focused on a small group of algorithms, often based on evolutionary algorithms. On the other hand, mono-objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) have been widely used due to its flexibility and competitive results in different applications. Besides, as PSO performance depends on different aspects of design like the velocity equation, its automatic design has been targeted by many researches with encouraging results. Motivated by these issues, this work studies the automatic design of Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO). A framework that uses a context-free grammar to guide the design of the algorithms is implemented. The framework includes a set of parameters and components of different MOPSOs, and two design algorithms: Grammatical Evolution (GE) and Iterated Racing (IRACE). Evaluation results are presented, comparing MOPSOs generated by both design algorithms. Furthermore, the generated MOPSOs are compared to the Speed-constrained MOPSO (SMPSO), a well-known algorithm using a set of Multi-Objective problems, quality indicators and statistical tests.	auto-configuration;benchmark (computing);context-free grammar;context-free language;distributed computing;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;grammatical evolution;iterated function;particle swarm optimization;recursion;velocity (software development);verification and validation	Ricardo Henrique Remes de Lima;Aurora Trinidad Ramirez Pozo	2017	2017 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2017.7969381	computer science;iterated function;machine learning;multi-swarm optimization;artificial intelligence;mathematical optimization;algorithm design;metaheuristic;genetic programming;grammatical evolution;evolutionary algorithm;algorithm;particle swarm optimization	EDA	24.014675982869328	-6.527462469231964	48580

In this paper, an optimization procedure is proposed, which is based on three sequential phases. In the first phase, the number of AGVs to be allocated to each arrived truck is determined; in the second phase, an AGV-to-truck assignment problem is solved; in the third phase, the single tasks are assigned to and sequenced on the AGVs. All phases are based on the formalization and solution of a specific mathematical programming problem, and a heuristic procedure is also proposed to solve a part of the third phase.	assignment problem;decision problem;heuristic;mathematical optimization;scheduling (computing)	Davide Giglio	2014	Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE Emerging Technology and Factory Automation (ETFA)	10.1109/ETFA.2014.7005360	job shop scheduling;transport;real-time computing;logic gate;schedule;computer science;engineering;engineering drawing	EDA	12.438123975213552	3.606512137705331	48707
f4e4a69a58afcd282e2f6569d86b381f4022fdfd	on preparedness resource allocation planning for natural disaster relief under endogenous uncertainty with time-consistent risk-averse management		Abstract A preparedness resource allocation model and an algorithmic approach are presented for a three-stage stochastic problem for managing natural disaster mitigation. That preparedness consists of warehouse location and capacity assignment and the procurement of commodities on the one hand and refurbishing the rescue network infrastructure on the other. Two types of uncertainty are considered: exogenous uncertainty which is due to the lack of full knowledge about the probability and intensity of the disaster for each focal point in a given network; and endogenous uncertainty which is based on the decision-maker’s investment to obtain greater accuracy in regard to the occurrence of the disaster and to reinforcing the network infrastructure. A stochastic mixed 0-1 bilinear optimization model is presented. Additionally, a time-consistent stochastic dominance-based risk-averse measure for a set of profiles in a multifunction setting is introduced. Both types of elements imply large-sized problems, so some kind of decomposition algorithmic should be used. Based on the special features of the three-stage problem subject of this work, we introduce the Cluster Dual Descent Algorithm for obtaining feasible solutions based on duality theory. Computational results are reported for a well-known real-life case by comparing the performance of the models based on the alternatives given by the risk-neutral and risk-averse versions jointly with exogenous and endogenous uncertainty.	risk aversion;time consistency	Laureano F.

39b1d7e532a43056436ff9c5db616117e6bcd4e3	a genetic local search algorithm for optimal testing resource allocation in module software systems		As modern software systems have been expanded continuously, the problem of how to optimally allocate the limited testing resource during the software testing phase attracted lots of attention. The Optimal Testing Resource Allocation Problems (OTRAPs) involve seeking for an optimal allocation of limited testing resource. There are two major objectives in the OTRAPs: reli- ability and cost. Since the designers pay more and more attention to reducing the cost, in this paper, we studied OTRAPs with the latter objective. In previous work, approaches based on genetic algorithms have been claimed to be strong alternatives in solving the problem. Hence, in this paper we proposed a new algorithm based on genetic algorithm and local search strategy (GLSA) to solve the OTRAPs. Experimental results show that the algorithm proposed can obtain better performance than some existing approaches for solving the software testing resource problem.	local search (optimization);search algorithm;software system	Ruimin Gao;Siyan Xiong	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22186-1_2	mathematical optimization;test data generation;simulation;computer science	AI	21.87035014121673	-4.193811442712825	48865
613f3cb7c0d07e7a9273a7cd9ccfb9909a60eeb2	thematic issue on hybrid nature-inspired algorithms: concepts, analysis and applications		Optimization represents a crucial task in many application domains; in science, engineering, business and social activities, industrial designs, and so on. Usually, it is necessary to find the appropriate values of variables and parameters to improve systems’ performance under different working conditions. Nevertheless, since computational resources, time, and money are always limited in real-world applications, the optimization task could be particularly hard to be accomplished and, as a consequence, it is necessary to identify opportune strategies to “optimize” the optimization processes. In this context, bio-inspired algorithms are assuming an increasingly important role thanks to their capabilities to emulate nature in its organizational complexity and in creating the dynamics, interactions and feedbacks to produce desired outcomes capable of maintaining the right balance in a given ecosystem. Genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, bee colony optimization are only few examples of bio-inspired optimization algorithms successfully applied to numerous real-world applications. However, these algorithms can suffer from premature convergence due to their strong “exploration” features. During the past few years, a novel research trend is focusing on hybrid nature-inspired algorithms. These innovative strategies are aimed at merging together the benefits provided by different bio-inspired optimization algorithms in order to find the appropriate trade-off between exploration and exploitation features, and identify a breakthrough optimization process in a given application scenario. The objective of this special issue is to highlight the ongoing research on concepts and analysis of hybrid nature inspired algorithms, as well as their applications to various domains. This volume contains six papers that consider different aspects of research on the hybridization of bio-inspired optimization algorithms. The paper titled “Recognition of Archaic Lanna Handwritten Manuscripts Using a Hybrid Bio-inspired Algorithm” by Arit Thammano and Sakkayaphop Pravesjit introduces a new character recognition system for archaic Lanna handwritten characters based on the hybridization between artificial immune systems and particle swarm optimization. Experiments show that the proposed approach is able to accurately recognize all tested text databases, and it outperforms the recent state-of-the-art approaches. The paper entitled “Group based swarm evolution algorithm (GSEA) driven mental task classifier” by Saurabh Kumar Agarwal, Saatvik Shah and Rajesh Kumar introduces the GSEA driven neural classifier, a bio-inspired methodology aimed at classifying mental tasks by analyzing EEG data provided by BCI Competition III. Experiments highlight that the proposed approach yields better performance than individual swarm or differential search based algorithms and many other algorithms. In their paper entitled “A Computational Ecosystem for Optimization”, Rafael Stubs Parpinelli and Heitor Silvèrio Lopes review the theoretical foundations and applications of a computational ecosystem for optimization, named ECO. In particular, the main discussion presented in this article is related to the cooperative use of populations of candidate solutions, co-evolving in an ecological context. The main features of the ECO framework is that it opens the possibility to integrate different meta-heuristics, the topological structure for communication between populations is dynamically defined using information from the populations during the optimization process, there are two levels of communications, namely intra-habitats and inter-habitats communication, that favors co-evolution.

The system was applied in experiments that test meta-heuristic algorithms for solving such optimization task. The engine of this system is based on a bee behavior based algorithm, called KAPI, designed by the authors. In order to make a comparison of the results obtained by KAPI, the Ants Colony System and Tabu Search algorithms were also applied. The eTransport simulator can generate real-life scenarios on Google Maps, while configuring and running tested algorithms, and finally, displaying the solutions found. Some illustrative examples of experiments are presented and discussed. The analysis of results of multi-scenario simulations shows the advantages of the KAPI algorithm, and justifies the conclusion that KAPI is much better and more effective at finding solutions to problems of this kind than other known algorithms.	algorithm	Adam Kakol;Iwona Pozniak-Koszalka;Leszek Koszalka;Andrzej Kasprzak;Keith J.

The recently proposed stable matching-based selection provides a new perspective to handle this balance under the framework of decomposition multiobjective optimization. In particular, the one-one stable matching between subproblems and solutions, which achieves an equilibrium between their mutual preferences, is claimed to strike a balance between convergence and diversity. However, the original stable marriage model has a high risk of matching a solution with an unfavorable subproblem, which finally leads to an imbalanced selection result. In this paper, we introduce the concept of incomplete preference lists into the stable matching model to remedy the loss of population diversity. In particular, each solution is only allowed to maintain a partial preference list consisting of its favorite subproblems. We implement two versions of stable matching-based selection mechanisms with incomplete preference lists: one achieves a two-level one-one matching and the other obtains a many-one matching. Furthermore, an adaptive mechanism is developed to automatically set the length of the incomplete preference list for each solution according to its local competitiveness. The effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed methods are validated and compared with several state-of-the-art EMO algorithms on 62 benchmark problems.	approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);many-one reduction;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;stable marriage problem	Mengyuan Wu;Ke Li;Sam Kwong;Yu Zhou;Qingfu Zhang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation	10.1109/TEVC.2017.2656922	mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;3-dimensional matching;machine learning;data mining;mathematics;stable roommates problem;algorithm	DB	23.455904472414637	-3.330704423631384	49117

In this work, we model the scheduling problem for the OKP firm who promises due-date-guaranteed delivery to its customers. The firm schedules its jobs to minimize its total cost concerning the constraint of components delivery from its supplier. We develop a pair-wise scheduling algorithm to model. The simulation test shows that the proposed pair-wise scheduling algorithm can find the near optimal solution.	algorithm;computation;control theory;job stream;loss function;mathematical model;optimization problem;scheduling (computing);simulation;time complexity	Jian Zhang;Yiliu Tu	2012			total cost;scheduling (computing);job shop scheduling;real-time computing;supply chain;business;operations management;schedule	Embedded	11.834766544030765	1.965795361370332	49418

The main goal of this evolutionary algorithm is to find a non-dominated front containing the most robust non-dominated solutions also ensuring diversity along the front. A concept of degree of robustness is incorporated into the evolutionary algorithm, which intervenes in the computation of the fitness value assigned to solutions. Two objective functions of technical and economical nature are explicitly considered in the mathematical model: minimization of system losses and minimization of capacitor installation costs. Constraints refer to quality of service, power flow, and technical requirements. It is assumed that some input data are subject to perturbations, both concerning the objective functions and the constraints coefficients.	coefficient;computation;evolutionary algorithm;loss function;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;perturbation theory;quality of service;radial (radio);requirement	Carlos Barrico;Carlos Henggeler Antunes;Dulce Fernão Pires	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-01009-5_19	control engineering;mathematical optimization;interactive evolutionary computation;engineering;operations management	Robotics	16.959731069435065	-3.520917990045815	49553

In this algorithm in order to search the problem space two control variables are used. Also an intelligent mutation operator is presented to approximate to the projectpsilas optimal point.

In particular, there is a need for efficient algorithms for finding safest evacuation routes, which would take into account the 3D structure of buildings, their relevant semantics and the nature and shape of hazards. In this paper, we propose algorithms for safest routes and balanced routes in buildings, where an extreme event with many epicentres is occurring. In a balanced route, a trade-off between route length and hazard proximity is made.

The novel aspect of our solution approach is that we intend to use simulation to derive a more realistic objective function and use Memetic algorithms to find an optimal solution.

Since cloud providers offer various cloud services in different forms, there is a large potential of optimizing the selection of those services from the consumer perspective. In this paper, we address the Cloud Resource Management Problem that is a recent optimization problem aimed at reducing the payment cost and the execution time of consumer applications. In the related literature, there is one approach that successfully addresses this problem based on a Greedy Random- ized Adaptive Search Procedure. Due to the fact that consumers require fast and high-quality solutions to economically automate cloud resource management and deployment processes, we propose an efficient Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm. The computational experiments over a benchmark suite generated based on real cloud market offerings indi- cate that the performance of our approach outperforms the approaches proposed in the literature.	genetic algorithm	Leonard Heilig;Eduardo Lalla-Ruiz;Stefan Voß	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-16468-7_1	simulation;engineering;operations management;management science	HPC	19.545015653799258	-3.369041036061489	50096

Design/methodology/approach – Three systematic optimal design procedures are proposed to solve the engineering design problems for the Gough-Stewart platform used as motion simulators. In these systematic optimal design procedures, two contradicting design optimality criteria with good representations of performances of the Gough-Stewart platforms are chosen as the objective functions. In addition, the two objective function optimization problems are solved by using the multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Findings – In the systematic optimal design procedures, multiple compromised design solutions are found by using Elitist Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm version II in the primary design stage, and many candidates can be used in the secondary design stage for higher decisions. Two higher decision methods have been presented to choose the final solutions. Originality/value – This paper proposes three systematic optimal design procedures to solve the practical design problems of the Gough-Stewart platforms used as motion simulators, which are very important for the engineering designers.	engineering design process;evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;motion simulator;optimal design;optimization problem;performance;simulation;sorting	Guojun Liu;Zhiyong Qu;Junwei Han;Xiaochu Liu	2013	Industrial Robot	10.1108/IR-12-2012-457	control engineering;mathematical optimization;simulation;probabilistic design;computer science;engineering;parallel	EDA	18.273884400303213	-5.702481153559977	50249

The goal is to reduce the total EV cost and station congestion due to temporary shortage in supply of available batteries. We show that the problem is reducible to the minimum weight perfect bipartite matching problem. This leads to an efficient solution based on the Hungarian algorithm. Numerical results suggest that the proposed solution provides a significant improvement over a greedy heuristic that assigns EVs to nearest stations.	assignment problem;extended validation certificate;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);hungarian algorithm;matching (graph theory);minimum weight;network congestion;numerical method;paging;referring expression generation;time complexity	Pengcheng You;Youxian Sun;John Z.

The idea is to represent a family of “push/pull” heuristics that are based upon inserting and removing tasks in a current solution, with an algebra. We then let a learning algorithm search for the best possible algebraic term, which represents a hybrid algorithm for a given set of problems and an optimization criterion. In a previous paper, we described this algebra in detail and provided a set of preliminary results demonstrating the utility of this approach, using vehicle routing with time windows (VRPTW) as a domain example. In this paper we expand upon our results providing a more robust experimental framework and learning algorithms, and report on some new results using the standard Solomon benchmarks. In particular, we show that our learning algorithm is able to achieve results similar to the best-published algorithms using only a fraction of the CPU time. We also show that the automatic tuning of the best hybrid combination of such techniques yields a better solution than hand tuning, with considerably less effort.	central processing unit;heuristic (computer science);hybrid algorithm;machine learning;mathematical optimization;microsoft windows;vehicle routing problem	Yves Caseau;Glenn Silverstein;François Laburthe	2001	TPLP		mathematical optimization;simulation;hybrid algorithm;computer science;artificial intelligence;vehicle routing problem;machine learning;programming language	AI	20.611926322104537	-7.625779003274173	50607

It focuses on detecting non-linear local dependencies among variables of the objective function by analyzing the manifold in the search space that contains the current population and transforming individuals to a reduced search space defined by the Kernel Principal Components.

Generalized best-matching problem (BMP) has a variety of applications in areas such as team and network design, scheduling, transportation, routing, production planning, facility location, allocation, and logistics. The problem is indeed analogous to the capacitated clustering problem, where a set of individuals are partitioned into disjoint clusters with certain capacities. This work defines, formulates, and analyzes an important behavior associated with the generalized BMP: The mutual influence of the elements of the same set on each other's preferences, if matched to the same element of the other set. Such preferences are referred to as interdependent preferences (IP). A binary program is developed to formulate the problem and provide the basis for analyzing the impact of IP on generalized best-matching decisions from two perspectives: Optimal cluster formation (fixed sets) and evolution (emergent sets). A set of evolutionary algorithms is then developed to handle the complexity of the cluster formation problem, and enable the network of clusters to autonomously adapt to random changes, recover, and evolve. Results from several experiments indicate (a) significant impact of IP on the optimality of cluster formation and evolution decisions, and (b) efficiency of the developed evolutionary algorithms in handling the problem's complexity, and the emergent behavior of matching. The notion of interdependent preferences is introduced to the generalized best matching problem.The problem (BMP-IP) is analogous to the capacitated clustering problem.A novel binary quadratic programming formulation is developed for the BMP-IP.Efficient evolutionary heuristics are developed to handle the formation and evolution of clusters.Results show significant impacts of IP on the static and dynamic BMP.	interdependence	Mohsen Moghaddam;Shimon Y.

Because of these features and to the fact that HC with the classical operators guarantees to obtain a minimal I-map, this approach is really appropriate to deal with high dimensional domains. In this paper we revisited a previously developed HC algorithm (termed constrained HC, or CHC in short) that takes advantage of some scoring metrics properties in order to restrict during the search the parent set of each node. The main drawback of CHC is that there is no warranty of obtaining a minimal I-map, and so the algorithm includes a second stage in which an unconstrained HC is launched by taking as initial solution the one returned by the constrained search stage. In this paper we modify CHC in order to guarantee that its output is a minimal I-map and so the second stage is not needed. In this way we save a considerable amount of CPU time, making the algorithm best suited for high dimensional datasets. A proof is provided about the minimal I-map condition of the returned network, and also computational experiments are reported to show the gain with respect to CPU requirements.		José A.

The multiobjective route planning problem in multi-hop ridesharing is categorized as NP-complete. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms have received a growing interest in solving the multiobjective optimization problems. In this work, we compare the behaviour of different multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for solving the multiobjective route planning in dynamic multi-hop ridesharing. Comparison results indicate that there is no single algorithm, as in literature, that wins all the tournaments regarding all the quality indicators. However, a subset of the algorithms is recommended with better quality and runtime.	categorization;crown group;evolution strategy;evolutionary algorithm;gd-rom;genetic algorithm;local optimum;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;np-completeness;network congestion;time complexity	Wesam Herbawi;Michael Weber	2011	2011 IEEE Congress of Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2011.5949874	mathematical optimization;simulation;genetic algorithm;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;evolutionary computation	AI	17.562156516117344	-0.05393862837377968	51330

We give a formal definition of this optimization problem and introduce three encodings. The encodings make possible to formulate a very wide set of different scheduling requirements. The problem is solved by using SAT, MaxSAT, PB, SMT, CSP and ILP solvers. In combination with these solvers, three different optimization techniques are presented, a basic technique and its two modifications. The modifications use local search to modify some parts of the initial solution. Results indicate that SAT-related approaches outperform other solving methods used and that one of the introduced techniques which uses local search can significantly outperform the basic technique. We have successfully used these approaches to make shift schedules for one air traffic control center.	boolean satisfiability problem;encode;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;modeling language;nurse scheduling problem;optimization problem;petabyte;requirement;scheduling (computing);simultaneous multithreading;solver	Mirko Stojadinovic	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-10428-7_63	embedded system;real-time computing;mathematics;distributed computing	AI	21.14807948566064	3.8659495982445904	51716

The objective of the GTSP consists in visiting each cluster exactly once in a tour, while minimizing the sum of the routing costs. This paper addresses the solution of the GTSP using a Memetic Algorithm. The originality of our approach rests on the crossover procedure that uses a large neighborhood search. This algorithm is compared with other algorithms on a set of 54 standard test problems with up to 217 clusters and 1084 cities.

The goal is to nd the shortest tour that visits each city in a given list exactly nce and then returns to the starting city. This is a typical NPard problem [2–4], which has extremely large search spaces and s very difficult to solve. Apart from its theoretical approach, TSP s widely used as a model in many fields such as vehicle routng [5], scheduling problems [6], design of integrated circuits [7], hysical mapping problems [8], constructing phylogenetic trees [9], achine flow shop scheduling [10] and so on. Hence, solving TSP as significant practical implications. There have been many studes of intelligent algorithms for TSP since K. Menger first presented Please cite this article in press as: J. Wang, et al., Multi-offspring geneti Appl. Soft Comput. J. (2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2016.02. t in 1932 [11]. In 1985, Goldberg and Grefenstette first used the enetic algorithm for solving the TSP problem, and put forward hree crossover methods [12,13].

One category involves distances between cities which are symmetrical. In other words, supposing the distance between city i and city j is dij, then, we have dij = dji. The other category involves distance between two cities which are non-symmetrical, i.e. dij / = dji. In this paper, we discuss the symmetrical TSP problem. A good reference for a detailed discussion of TSP is by Lawer et al. [14]. An excellent review article on GA for TSP is by Larranaga et al. [15]. In recent years, many scholars came up with some improved GA algorithms. In 1991, Whitley D., Starkweather T., and Shaner D. proposed a new solution for TSP using GA in their “The Traveling Salesman and Sequence Scheduling: Quality Solutions Using Genetic Edge Recombination”. In 2003, Lalena M. similarly solved the TSP using GA. In 2005, Takahashi R. solved the TSP through genetic algorithms with changing crossover operators. In 2007, Ding chao, Cheng ye and He Miao presented a paper for solving another type of TSP called the clustered traveling salesman problem. In 2009, Vahdati Go., Yaghoubi M. Poostchi M., Naghibi M.B. presented a GA with heuristic crossover and mutation operator. In 2009, Jinqiu Yang, Jiangang Yang, Genlang Chen presented an adaptive clustering method and a novel genetic algorithm for TSP. In 2011, Kaya Y., Uyar M. and Tekin R. presented a ring crossover c algorithm and its application to the traveling salesman problem, 021 operator. In 2011, Deep K., Mebrahtu H. presented combined mutation operators of GA for TSP. In 2013, Chunhui Zhou, Shijun Hu, Yuanqiao introduced the idea of simulated annealing to improve the mutation operator of GA.

The problem is always known as a standard inverse optimal value problem. When multiple criteria are adopted to determine cost vectors, a multi-criteria inverse optimal value problem arises, which is more general than the standard case. This paper focuses on the algorithmic approach for this class of problems, and develops an evolutionary algorithm based on a dynamic weighted aggregation method. First, the original problem is converted into a bilevel program with multiple upper level objectives, in which the lower level problem is a linear program for each fixed cost vector. In addition, the potential bases of the lower level program are encoded as chromosomes, and the weighted sum of the upper level objectives is taken as a new optimization function, by which some potential nondominated solutions can be generated. In the design of the evolutionary algorithm some specified characteristics of the problem are well utilized, such as the optimality conditions. Some preliminary computational experiments are reported, which demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is efficient and robust.	bilevel optimization;evolutionary algorithm;mathematical optimization;optimization problem	Hecheng Li	2014	Appl.

Over the last two decades, many different evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been introduced for solving constrained optimization problems (COPs). Due to the variability of the characteristics in different COPs, no single algorithm performs consistently over a range of practical problems. To design and refine an algorithm, numerous trial-and-error runs are often performed in order to choose a suitable search operator and the parameters. However, even by trial-and-error, one may not find an appropriate search operator and parameters. In this paper, we have applied the concept of training and testing with a self-adaptive multi-operator based evolutionary algorithm to find suitable parameters. The training and testing sets are decided based on the mathematical properties of 60 problems from two well-known specialized benchmark test sets. The experimental results provide interesting insights and a new way of choosing parameters.	constrained optimization;evolutionary algorithm;mathematical optimization	Saber M. Elsayed;Ruhul A.

A popular metric of achieving this is the so-called “move history”, that is, prioritizing moves that have performed well, earlier in the search. The literature reports a number of techniques, such as the Killer Moves and History heuristics, that employ such a philosophy. Inspired by techniques from the field of Adaptive Data Structures (ADSs), we1 have previously introduced the History-ADS heuristic, which uses an adaptive list to record moves, and to improve move ordering based on move history. The History-ADS heuristic has been proven to produce substantial gains in tree pruning in a wide variety of cases. However, it made use of a relatively naive application of an unbounded, single adaptive list. In this work, we attempt to refine the History-ADS heuristic, by examining its performance by constraining the length of its adaptive list, and applying multiple ADSs for each level of the tree. Our results show that the vast majority of the savings from the History-ADS heuristic remain even with a very short list, which can be applied to mitigate the drawbacks of an unbound data structure. Although results for multiple ADSs did not outperform single ADSs, we show that they provide some insight into how similar techniques may be applied in the context of the History-ADS heuristic.	alpha–beta pruning;data structure;heuristic (computer science);killer heuristic;multi-level governance;reduction (complexity)	Spencer Polk;B.

5145e595d0c3736f72f9fb17101b679802b72149	multiobjective optimization method based on adaptive parameter harmony search algorithm		The present trend in industries is to improve the techniques currently used in design and manufacture of products in order to meet the challenges of the competitive market. The crucial task nowadays is to find the optimal design and machining parameters so as to minimize the production costs. Design optimization involves more numbers of design variables with multiple and conflicting objectives, subjected to complex nonlinear constraints. The complexity of optimal design of machine elements creates the requirement for increasingly effective algorithms. Solving a nonlinear multiobjective optimization problem requires significant computing effort. From the literature it is evident that metaheuristic algorithms are performing better in dealing with multiobjective optimization. In this paper, we extend the recently developed parameter adaptive harmony search algorithm to solve multiobjective design optimization problems using the weighted sum approach. To determine the best weightage set for this analysis, a performance index based on least average error is used to determine the index of each weightage set. The proposed approach is applied to solve a biobjective design optimization of disc brake problem and a newly formulated biobjective design optimization of helical spring problem. The results reveal that the proposed approach is performing better than other algorithms.	harmony search;multi-objective optimization;search algorithm	Pandurengan Sabarinath;M. R. Thansekhar;R.

In this chapter, the main significant contributions are formulation of a new non-linear membership function using fuzzy approach to capture and describe vagueness in the technological coefficients of constraints in the industrial production planning problems. This non-linear membership function is flexible and convenience to the decision makers in their decision making process. Secondly, a nonlinear objective function in the form of cubic function for fuzzy optimization problems is successfully solved by two hybrid optimization techniques from the area of soft computing and classical approaches. Among the two techniques, one outstanding technique is selected based on the quality of the solution. An intelligent performance analysis is adapted to the convenience of decision makers and implementers to select the niche optimization techniques to apply in real word problem solving approach particularly related to industrial engineering problems.	genetic algorithm;line search;optimizing compiler	P.

To this end, it is necessary to develop quick and efficient ways to schedule manufacturing operations to cope with this type of demand. This paper presents a Genetic Algorithm optimiser used for dynamic product routing in agile manufacturing environments. Unlike approaches from the past, we optimise for both energy reduction and machine utilisation during production, guaranteeing relatively lower costs. Overall, our approach has shown better energy performance while maintaining slightly better production time over traditional load balancing method.	agile software development;david cope;experiment;genetic algorithm;load balancing (computing);reconfigurable computing;routing;software release life cycle	Pawel Ladosz;Olatunde Banjo;Samuele De Guido;Chris S.

Many studies have proposed various methods for solving the two-dimensional TSP. In this study, we extend the two-dimensional TSP to the three-dimensional TSP, namely the spherical TSP in which all points (cities) and paths (solutions) are on the surface of a sphere. A hybrid algorithm based on the glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) and the complete 2-opt algorithm is proposed, in which the carriers of the luciferin are transformed from glowworms to edges between cities, and the probabilistic formula and the luciferin updating formula are modified. In addition, the complete 2-opt algorithm is performed to optimize the selected optimal routes every few iterations. Numerical experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a better performance than the basic GSO in solving the spherical TSP. Meanwhile, the complete 2-opt algorithm can speed up the convergence rate.	2-opt;approximation algorithm;combinatorial optimization;complex system;computation;computational intelligence;google summer of code;hybrid algorithm;iteration;list of metaphor-based metaheuristics;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical method;rate of convergence;swarm;travelling salesman problem	Xin Chen;Yongquan Zhou;Zhonghua Tang;Qifang Luo	2017	Appl.

However, an optimization model based on selective cuttingthe cutting technique utilized in tropical countrie s-has rarely been described in the literature. The aim of this study was to propose an optimization model for THP based on selective cutting and subject to a maximum number of trees to be harvested and a minim um number of trees to be damaged during each planning period. The model was solved using three o ptimization techniques to identify the most suitable technique for use in the process of harves t area formation: Monte Carlo Programming (MCP), Simulated Annealing (SA) and Threshold Acceptance ( TA). The obtained results indicate that the SA method provides better solutions than the MCP and T A methods, regardless of problem size. As a conclusion, the proposed model provides a tool to g enerate timber harvest plans with the improved monitoring and control techniques used in harvestin g operations in tropical countries.	analysis of algorithms;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;mental substance;monte carlo method;program optimization;simulated annealing;the forest;unified model	Munaisyah Abdullah;Salwani Abdullah;Abdul Razak Hamdan;Roslan Ismail	2014	JCS	10.3844/jcssp.2014.54.65	selection cutting;operations research	AI	11.641803038479223	-5.113566395975429	54115
f4c4b30792937d9149d48d26ffcdee7321924ef1	an improved multiobjectivization strategy for hp model-based protein structure prediction	multiobjectivization;hp model;protein structure prediction	Through multiobjectivization, a single-objective problem is restated in multiobjective form with the aim of enabling a more efficient search process. Recently, this transformation was applied with success to the hydrophobic-polar (HP) lattice model, which is an abstract representation of the protein structure prediction problem. The use of alternative multiobjective formulations of the problem has led to significantly better results. In this paper, an improved multiobjectivization for the HP model is proposed. By decomposing the HP model’s energy function, a twoobjective formulation for the problem is defined. A comparative analysis reveals that the new proposed multiobjectivization evaluates favorably with respect to both the conventional single-objective and the previously reported multiobjective formulations. Statistical significance testing and the use of a large set of test cases support the findings of this study. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional lattices are considered.	horizontal pitch;lattice model (physics);mathematical optimization;protein structure prediction;qualitative comparative analysis;test case	Mario Garza-Fabre;Eduardo Rodriguez-Tello;Gregorio Toscano Pulido	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-32964-7_9	mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;protein structure prediction;algorithm	Comp.	24.4905556443662	-2.8505709133673727	54139
502a0818813014f4d5272c4abaea56432617c4c3	an efficient simulated annealing algorithm for the redundancy allocation problem with a choice of redundancy strategies	simulated annealing algorithm;reliability optimization;series parallel systems;redundancy strategies	The redundancy allocation problem (RAP) is an important reliability optimization problem. This paper studies a specific RAP in which redundancy strategies are chosen. To do so, the choice of the redundancy strategies among active and cold standby are considered as decision variables. The goal is to select the redundancy strategy, component, and redundancy level for each subsystem such that the system reliability is maximized. Since RAP is a NP-hard problem, we propose an efficient simulated annealing algorithm (SA) to solve it. In addition, to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, it is compared with well-known algorithms in the literature for different test problems. The results of the performance analysis show a relatively satisfactory efficiency of the proposed SA algorithm.	algorithm;decision theory;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;rapid refresh;simulated annealing	Amirhossain Chambari;Amir Abbas Najafi;Seyed Habib A.

In this paper we call such situation ‘global product family,’ and first characterizes its components and complexity. Following this, we proposes a mathematical model for the simultaneous design problem of module commonalization strategies under the given product architecture and supply chain configuration through selection of manufacturing sites for module production, assembly and final distribution as an instance of the problems. In the model, the choice of modules and various sites are represented with 0-1 design variables with the volume of production and transportation represented with non-negative continuous design variables, and the objective defined on total cost. An optimization method is configured with a genetic algorithm and a simplex method for such a mixed integer programming problem. Some numerical case studies are included to determine the validity and promise of the developed mathematical model and algorithm. Finally, we conclude with some discussion of future work.	continuous design;genetic algorithm;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;simplex algorithm	Kikuo Fujita;Hirofumi Amaya;Ryota Akai	2013	J.

The problem is NP-hard which makes difficult finding quality solution in short amount of time. Recently a new kind of TTP has been proposed ‘The Relaxed Travelling Tournament Problem’. This version of the problem allows teams to have some days off during the tournament. In this paper, we propose an immune algorithm that is able to solve both problem versions. The algorithm uses moves which are based on the team home/away patterns. One of these moves has been specially designed for the relaxed travel tournament instances. We have tested the algorithm using well-known problem benchmarks and the results obtained are very encouraging.	c++;clonal selection algorithm;computation;control theory;experiment;fitness function;interaction;iteration;linux;local optimum;np-hardness;neighbourhood (graph theory);operating system;random-access memory;scheduling (computing);trusted third party	Leslie Pérez Cáceres;María Cristina Riff	2015	Connect.

b0cd48010eca874600dca0c210ebfdd3f7a523d6	a discrete firefly algorithm to solve a rich vehicle routing problem modelling a newspaper distribution system with recycling policy	research outputs;research publications	A real-world newspaper distribution problem with recycling policy is tackled in this work. In order to meet all the complex restrictions contained in such a problem, it has been modeled as a rich vehicle routing problem, which can be more specifically considered as an asymmetric and clustered vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and deliveries, variable costs and forbidden paths (AC-VRP-SPDVCFP). This is the first study of such a problem in the literature. For this reason, a benchmark composed by 15 instances has been also proposed. In the design of this benchmark, real geographical positions have been used, located in the province of Bizkaia, Spain. For the proper treatment of this AC-VRP-SPDVCFP, a discrete firefly algorithm (DFA) has been developed. This application is the first application of the firefly algorithm to any rich vehicle routing problem. To prove that the proposed DFA is a promising technique, its performance has been compared with two other well-known techniques: an evolutionary algorithm and an evolutionary simulated annealing. Our results have shown that the DFA has outperformed these two classic meta-heuristics.	ac adapter;benchmark (computing);evolutionary algorithm;firefly (cache coherence protocol);firefly algorithm;heuristic (computer science);logistics;metaheuristic;multimodal interaction;simulated annealing;time complexity;vehicle routing problem	Eneko Osaba;Xin-She Yang;Fernando Díaz;Enrique Onieva;Antonio D.

In this paper, a fuzzy integer optimization model is established for the CSP problem with the improved decision variables, which will reduce the space complexity. Then the fuzzy objective weight of a directed path is introduced in the objective function, and the penalty function method is adopted to deal with the constraints. Hence, an unconstrained programming is proposed for the CSP problem, which is solved by a simulated annealing algorithm. Finally, the computational results demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of the algorithm.	algorithm;computation;dspace;decision theory;logistics;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;path (graph theory);penalty method;shortest path problem;simulated annealing	Jie Su;Aihua Li	2009	2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering	10.1109/CSIE.2009.24	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;supply chain management;integer programming;simulated annealing;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;shortest path problem	AI	20.883550068707798	1.7883770013992848	54587

Traditional network planning technology encountered great obstacles in project risk management issues, and often unable to accurately forecast the risk, resulting great loss of costs. To address the cost-time optimization problem considering the risk elements, this paper established a network planning risk element model, which divides risk elements into discrete model and continuous model to be discussed separately. In the discrete model costs and risk element matrix is introduced to get the corresponding programming model; In Continuous model the idea of machine learning model is used to minimum the desired risk. Based on this model, by using genetic algorithm's efficient and rapid global search capability, this paper improves the genetic algorithm developed by Feng and others, increases the risk elements and eventually gets the cost-time curve considering risk elements. This effectively solves the network planning cost optimization problem.	genetic algorithm;machine learning;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;programming model;risk management	Cunbin Li;Kecheng Wang	2007	Third International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2007)	10.1109/ICNC.2007.739	engineering;operations management;machine learning;management science	AI	14.5776747292127	-5.068870617235393	54638

New schemes that introduce a spatial separation between the members of the population gave significantly better results than any other scheme considered. These schemes slow down considerably the flow of genetic information between different regions of the population, which makes possible for distant regions to evolve more or less independently. This way many distinct possibilities can be explored simultaneously and a high degree of diversity can be maintained, which is very important for most multimodal problems.	genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization	Károly F.

Its performance has a great influence on subsequent tasks. Evolutionary Computation EC techniques have been introduced to the area of image segmentation due to their high search capacity. However, there are rarely comprehensive surveys on EC based image segmentation methods, which can enable researchers to get a quick understanding of this area and compare the existing methods. Therefore, this paper provides an overview of EC based image segmentation methods, and discusses the remaining issues in this area. It is observed that among all EC techniques, four of them genetic algorithms, genetic programming, differential equation and partial swarm optimization are more frequently used and GAs are the most popular technique. It is noted that low generalization capacity and computational complexity are two common problems in EC techniques applied to image segmentation.	evolutionary computation;image segmentation	Yuyu Liang;Mengjie Zhang;Will N.

The collection and the disposal of IHW are highly visible and important services that involve large expenditures in the world and particularly in Tunisia. This paper discusses two main problems in the current solid IHW management practices in Sfax governorate (Tunisia). The first problem is about how choose the best waste treatment and disposal scenario, using a multiple criteria decision making analysis. The Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) implemented with Expert choice software, confirms that the best scenario is to apply central steam sterilization equipment, which will be used by all hospitals. Accordingly, the second problem concerns the off-site transport of IHW from the twelve hospitals (public and private) in the governorate of Sfax to this overall center. This problem of transportation is modeled as a capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). Experimental results are reported for the design of the routing system for IHW transportation, using the solver CPLEX 9.0 software. Future legislation concerning IHW management is supposed to take into account the various results of this research.	cplex;off-site data protection;online and offline;solver;steam;vehicle routing problem;waste;on-line system	Dorra Baati;Mariam Mellouli;Wafik Hachicha	2014	2014 International Conference on Advanced Logistics and Transport (ICALT)	10.1109/ICAdLT.2014.6866337	engineering management;knowledge management;health care;computer science	Robotics	10.575066438059753	-5.149680454603855	54978
368bd7456e80fa2f1cc43690d8be6ca15a536365	an innovative approach to jointly scheduling and assigning a consultation time to patients arriving in the emergency department	emergencies;health care rationing;waiting lists	Emergency departments (ED) are facing problems related to the growing demand of care. Patients' management is carried out according to the type of patient and care required: already scheduled patients and non-scheduled urgent and non-urgent patients arriving in the ED. One of the main problems confronted in hospitals is the permanent interference between these different types of patients to be treated under the stochastic behaviors of consultation time and arrival flows, which prevents any prior planning. The present work proposes a dynamic scheduling method, considering the impact of new patients' arrivals on the treatment of patients already scheduled to minimize the mean waiting time of patients in the ED. The originality of this work is to assign, at the time of arrival, a scheduled time to each patient in order to reduce their stress. The performance of the proposed method is examined through a concrete application in the Pediatric Emergency Department of CHRU of Lille.	accident and emergency department;behavior;computer emergency response team;emergency medical service;erectile dysfunction;flow;interference (communication);patients;schedule (document type);schedule (project management);scheduling (computing);scheduling - hl7 publishing domain;time of arrival	Faten Ajmi;Sarah Ben Othman;Hayfa Zgaya;Slim Hammadi;Jean-Marie Renard	2017	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-830-3-989	emergency department;emergency medicine;scheduling (computing);delegation (computing);medicine	HCI	12.456621283846998	-1.3677672187947858	55122

Except for adopting new equipment or techniques, scheduling is crucial to reduce the total energy consumption of manufacturing systems. This paper focuses on the scheduling problem for flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption, and proposes a novel scheduling algorithm for FMSs based on Petri net models and genetic algorithm. Considering that energy consumptions in different states of resources are different, this paper takes two ways for calculating total energy consumptions. In the proposed genetic algorithm, a potential schedule is represented by a chromosome consisting of route selection and operation sequence. Crossover and mutation operations are performed on the operation sequence to guarantee the population diversity. For deadlock-prone FMSs, not all chromosomes can be directly decoded to a feasible schedule. To check the feasibility of chromosomes and convert infeasible chromosomes into feasible ones, a repair algorithm is developed with the help of the deadlock avoidance policy. Experiment results on a typical FMS and an industrial stamping system are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed scheduling algorithm.

Unfortunately, these sets are often large and can become difficult to comprehend and consider. Two methods are presented as practical approaches to reduce the size of the Pareto optimal set for multiple-objective system reliability design problems. The first method is a pseudo-ranking scheme that helps the decision maker select solutions that reflect his/her objective function priorities. In the second approach, we used data mining clustering techniques to group the data by using the k-means algorithm to find clusters of similar solutions. This provides the decision maker with just k general solutions to choose from. With this second method, from the clustered Pareto optimal set, we attempted to find solutions which are likely to be more relevant to the decision maker. These are solutions where a small improvement in one objective would lead to a large deterioration in at least one other objective. To demonstrate how these methods work, the well-known redundancy allocation problem was solved as a multiple objective problem by using the NSGA genetic algorithm to initially find the Pareto optimal solutions, and then, the two proposed methods are applied to prune the Pareto set. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that random blocking of the tail of the tabu list always improved performance; but that the use of frequency-based penalties to discourage frequently selected moves did not. Hash coding without conflict resolution was an effective way to represent solutions on the tabu list. We also found that the most effective length of the tabu list depended on features of the algorithm being used, but not on the size and complexity of the problem being solved. The best combination of features included random blocking of the tabu list, tasks as tabus and a greedy local search. An algorithm using these features was found to outperform a recently published algorithm solving a similar problem.	blocking (computing);boolean algebra;greedy algorithm;local search (optimization);multiprocessing;multiprocessor scheduling;scheduling (computing);search algorithm;tabu search	Arne Thesen	1998	J.

Several generic approaches have been introduced in the literature that returns a ”one-size-fits-all” parameter configuration for all instances. This is unsatisfactory since different instances may require the algorithm to use very different parameter configurations in order to find good solutions. There have been approaches that perform instance-based automated tuning, but they are usually problem-specific. In this paper, we propose CluPaTra, a generic (problem-independent) approach to perform parameter tuning, based on CLUstering instances with similar PAtterns according to their search TRAjectories. We propose representing a search trajectory as a directed sequence and apply a well-studied sequence alignment technique to cluster instances based on the similarity of their respective search trajectories. We verify our work on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). Experimental results show that CluPaTra offers significant improvement compared to ParamILS (a one-size-fits-all approach). CluPaTra is statistically significantly better compared with clustering using simple problem-specific features; and in comparison with the tuning of QAP instances based on a well-known distance and flow metric classification, we show that they are statistically comparable.	adaptive grammar;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;best, worst and average case;cluster analysis;fits;feature selection;heuristic (computer science);lionsolver;local optimum;quadratic assignment problem;run time (program lifecycle phase);search algorithm;sequence alignment;synergy;test set;time complexity;travelling salesman problem	Lindawati;Hoong Chuin Lau;David Lo	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-25566-3_10	mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;pattern recognition;sequence alignment;mathematics	AI	22.748412559991298	-2.475946942895922	55397

To solve the NRP, the authors used a multiobjective mathematical programming model and proposed a methodology for the adaptation of a Multiobjective Directed Bee Colony Optimization (MODBCO). MODBCO is used successfully for solving the multiobjective problem of optimizing the scheduling problems. This MODBCO is an integration of deterministic local search, multiagent particle system environment, and honey bee decision-making process. The performance of the algorithm is assessed using the standard dataset INRC2010, and it reflects many real-world cases which vary in size and complexity. The experimental analysis uses statistical tools to show the uniqueness of the algorithm on assessment criteria.	acclimatization;agent-based model;apis mellifera;aspartate transaminase;bees algorithm;breast feeding;combinatorial optimization;conflict (psychology);decision making;emoticon;environment variable;heuristic;international neuroblastoma response criteria;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;mathematics;metaheuristic;monte carlo method;multi-objective optimization;nelder–mead method;nurse scheduling problem;particle system;programming model;projections and predictions;scheduling (computing);scheduling - hl7 publishing domain;silo (dataset);sixty nine	M.

Furthermore, we introduce preference possibilities for each option, and aim for finding solutions that balance minimizing total travel costs and customer or operator dissatisfaction. We compare an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search metaheuristic with solving the problem exactly. Simulation experiments indicate that a multiple-location scenario is highly beneficial compared to the corresponding single-location scenario and that the metaheuristic always finds the optimum if this could be computed by the exact solver.

We first present a generic procedure that detects the feasibility of one system in the presence of one constraint and extend it to the case of two or more systems and constraints. To accelerate the elimination of infeasible systems, a method that reuses collected observations and its variance-updating version are discussed.

A through connection at a station is a connection between an arrival flight and a departure flight at the station, both of which have the same fleet type assigned to them that ensures that the same plane flies both legs. Typically, passengers are willing to pay a premium for through connections. The through assignment model (TAM) identifies a set of profitable throughs between arrival and departure flights flown by the same fleet type at each station to maximize the through benefits. The through assignment model is usually solved after obtaining the solution from a fleet assignment model. In this current sequential approach, the through assignment model cannot change the fleeting in order to get a better through assignment, and the fleet assignment model does not take into account the through benefits. The goal of the combined through and fleet assignment model (ctFAM) is to come up with a fleeting and through assignment that achieves the maximum combined benefit of the integrated model. We give a mixed integer programming formulation of ctFAM that is too large to be solved to optimality or near-optimality within allowable time for the data obtained by a major US airline. We thus focus on neighborhood search algorithms for solving ctFAM, in which we start with the solution obtained by the previous sequential approach (that is, solving FAM first and followed by TAM) and improve it successively. Our approach is based on generalizing the swap-based neighborhood search approach of Talluri [1996] for FAM which proceeds by swapping the fleet assignment of two flight paths flown by two different plane types that originate and terminate at the same stations and the same times. An important feature of our approach is that the size of the neighborhood defined by us is very large; hence the suggested algorithm falls in the category of Very Large-Scale Neighborhood (VLSN) Search Algorithms. Another important feature of our approach is that we use integer programming to identify improved neighbors. We provide computational results which indicate that the neighborhood search approach for ctFAM provides substantial savings over the sequential approach of solving FAM and TAM. 1 Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA. 2 Information Services Division, United Airlines World Headquarters WHQKB, Chicago, IL 60666, USA. 3 Information Services Division, United Airlines World Headquarters WHQKB, Chicago, IL 60666, USA. 4 Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. 5 Operations Research Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.	chomsky hierarchy;computation;cycle (graph theory);downstream (software development);emoticon;full scale;fuzzy associative matrix;graph (discrete mathematics);heuristic;ibm notes;ibm tivoli access manager;integer programming;linear programming;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;michael garey;np-completeness;nsa product types;operations research;paging;polynomial;prototype;random-access memory;scheduling (computing);search algorithm;solver;systems engineering;tabu search;terminate (software);time complexity;very large-scale neighborhood search	Ravindra K.

To improve the tolerance design, the designer could first try to decrease the sensitive components by moving the nominal values to a less sensitivity portion. Second, the cost-based optimal machining tolerances are allocated. Differential Evolution (DE) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) are used for minimising the critical dimensions deviation and manufacturing cost with optimal machining tolerances.

ffc5f4eb17698f96b803caa50e00ece10bf8406c	a distributed evolutionary simulation optimization approach for the configuration of multiproduct kanban systems	simulation optimization	The performance of multiproduct kanban systems is strongly dependent on a set of numerical and non-numerical parameters, such as the number of kanbans between machines, the transport lot sizes, the safety storage sizes and the sequencing rules. Configuring such systems consists of determining a value for each parameter in order to optimize a performance criterion. The authors propose a distributed simulation optimization method based on evolutionary principles, which is capable of simultaneously taking into account various parameters involved in the configuration of multiproduct kanban systems. In order to improve the quality of the results and to reduce computing time, concurrent searches are managed through a network of workstations. This approach is illustrated by the configuration of a kanban system comprising four machines in line, which process three types of product.	mathematical optimization;simulation	Jean-Luc Paris;Henri Pierreval	2001	Int.

8e237b410362cb8910f6b3574c191e10c41a4d3c	an optimization model for qualification management in wafer fabs		The individual tools of a tool group need to be qualified to run lots of certain families in wafer fabs. A qualification time window is associated with each family and each tool. This window lasts typically from a couple of days to few weeks. The time window can be re-initialized with separate qualification effort on a need by basis and can be extended by on-time processing of qualifying families. In this paper, we propose a mixed integer programming formulation for this problem assuming a given demand for a planning horizon of several periods. The objective function takes into account qualification costs, backlog costs, and inventory holding costs among others. Results of computational experiments based on randomly generated problem instances are presented that demonstrate that a tradeoff between production objectives and qualification costs can be reached by an appropriate configuration of the model.	computation;experiment;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;linear programming;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;procedural generation;protein family;qualification problem;semiconductor fabrication plant;simulation;wafer (electronics)	Denny Kopp;Lars Mönch;Detlef Pabst;Marcel Stehli	2016	2016 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)		planning;semiconductor device modeling;simulation;engineering;linear programming;mathematical model;mathematics;computational model;engineering drawing	AI	13.48559314935141	4.066898234237205	56640

Valid layouts should comply with certain road design regulations that normally depend on design parameters such as road speed and type (e.g. highway, or conventional road). The paper presents a discrete state space for this problem that approximates real layouts, and discusses heuristic estimates that allow searching for the shortest approximation in such space using the A* heuristic search algorithm. These ideas have been implemented and tested in a road layout editor.	a* search algorithm;approximation algorithm;experiment;heuristic (computer science);state space;topography	Lawrence Mandow;José-Luis Pérez-de-la-Cruz	2004			mathematical optimization;simulation	HCI	17.87511164819031	2.58865762087491	56720

Although a plethora of models, methods and visions is found, it is still difficult to compare them because they use different terminologies and some authors insist on the fact there are a multitude of close but different problems. This paper presents the main concepts of multi-echelon distribution with cross-docks and the notation standards for cost optimization in this field on an attempt of unification, in order to provide a guide to researchers and practitioners. A literature review is first presented, in order to list the main problems and methods that are found in the literature. Then, by a hybrid systematic analysis method combining a lexical and a meta-narrative analysis, the main concepts and standards of multi-echelon based vehicle routing optimization problems are presented. A theoretical model as well as a classification of solving methods, both exact and heuristic, is presented. Finally, research paths are proposed to support both scientists and outbound logistics practitioners.	approximation;cvpr;chao (sonic);decision support system;docking (molecular);heuristic;heuristic (computer science);logistics;mathematical optimization;operability;operations research;optimization problem;real life;requirement;row echelon form;scientific literature;standard-definition television;test case;theory;unification (computer science);vehicle routing problem	Jesús González-Feliu	2013	Computer and Information Science	10.5539/cis.v6n3p28	mathematical optimization;simulation;combinatorial optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;operations research;computer security;algorithm	AI	17.202395496554416	2.5092311925511304	57124

To construct a collaborative optimization model for strategic performance, it should be based on the overall optimization framework of collaborative optimization technology with the chaotic optimization method. The objective of system-level optimization is strategic performance optimization.

First, a mathematical model is developed to deal with a disruption at any stage while maximizing total profit during the recovery-time window. The model is solved after the occurrence of a disruption event, with changed data used to generate a revised plan. We also propose a new and efficient heuristic for solving the developed mathematical model. Second, multiple disruptions are considered, where a new disruption may or may not affect the recovery plans of earlier disruptions. The heuristic, developed for a single disruption, is extended to deal with a series of disruptions so that it can be implemented for disruption recovery on a real-time basis. We compare the heuristic solutions with those obtained by a standard search algorithm for a set of randomly generated disruption test problems, and that show the consistent performance of our developed heuristic with lower computational times. Finally, some numerical examples and a real-world case study are presented to demonstrate the benefits and usefulness of our proposed approach.	denial-of-service attack;disaster recovery plan	Sanjoy Kumar Paul;Ruhul A.

9138fbe70689b2c9a7636bfa326b3bf25728472a	smart parking pricing: a machine learning approach		Crowded streets are a major problem in large cities. A large part of the problem stems from drivers seeking on-street parking. Cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle have tackled this problem with smart parking systems that aim to maintain the on-street parking occupancy rates around a target level, thus ensuring that empty spots are spread across the city rather than clustered in a single area. In this study, we use the San Francisco's SFpark system as a case study. Specifically, in each given parking area, the SFpark uses occupancy rate data from the previous month to adjust the price in the current month. Instead, we propose a machine learning approach that predicts the occupancy rate of a parking area based on past occupancy rates and prices from an entire neighborhood (which covers many parking areas). We further formulate an optimization problem for the prices in each parking area that minimize the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the predicted occupancy rates of all areas in the neighborhood and the target occupancy rates. This approach is novel in that 1) it responds to a predicted level of occupancy rate rather than past data and 2) it find prices that optimize the total occupancy rate of all neighborhoods, taking under account that prices in one area can impact the demand in adjacent areas. We conduct a numerical study, using data collected from the SFpark study, that shows that the prices obtained from our optimization lead to occupancy rates that are very close to the desired target level.	algorithm;machine learning;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;numerical analysis;optimization problem;smart tv	Eran Simhon;Christopher Liao;David Starobinski	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2017.8116452	sfpark;single area;occupancy;parking guidance and information;machine learning;computer science;mean squared error;optimization problem;artificial intelligence	ML	11.37250033646921	-7.215609503535164	57368

While the conventional versions of nullmove pruning use reduction values of R ≤ 3, we use an aggressive reduction value of R = 4 within a verified adaptive configuration which maximizes the benefit from the more aggressive pruning, while limiting its tactical liabilities. Our experimental results using our grandmasterlevel chess program, Falcon, show that our null-move reductions (NMR) outperform the conventional methods, with the tactical benefits of the deeper search dominating the deficiencies. Moreover, unlike standard null-move pruning, which fails badly in zugzwang positions, NMR is impervious to zugzwangs. Finally, the implementation of NMR in any program already using null-move pruning requires a modification of only a few lines of code.	alpha–beta pruning;chess engine;falcon;null-move heuristic;source lines of code	Omid David;Nathan S.

4334c0aa0af006e0b31169791eb43ce7bdecaaf0	a new approximate evaluation method for two-echelon inventory systems with emergency shipments	emergency shipments;approximate evaluation;spare parts;two echelon system	We consider the control of repairable spare parts in a network consisting of a central warehouse, a central repair facility, and multiple local warehouses. Demands for spare parts occur at the local warehouses. If a local warehouse is out of stock, then an arriving demand is satisfied by an emergency delivery from the central warehouse or the central repair facility. Such emergency shipments are common practice for networks that support technical systems with high downtime costs, and it is important to take them into account when the inventory is optimized. Our main contribution consists of the development of a new approximate evaluation method. This method gives accurate approximations for the key performance measures, as we show via numerical analysis. The method is also fast and thus can easily be incorporated in existing (greedy) heuristic optimization methods. Our method outperforms the approximate evaluation method of Muckstadt and Thomas (1980), as we also show via the numerical analysis. Finally, we show that the performance of the system is rather insensitive to the leadtime distribution of the repairs at the central repair facility, which implies that our method works well for generally distributed repair leadtimes.	approximation algorithm;downtime;greedy algorithm;heuristic;lateral thinking;mathematical optimization;newton's method;numerical analysis;row echelon form;tridiagonal matrix algorithm	Erhun Özkan;Geert-Jan van Houtum;Yasemin Serin	2015	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-013-1401-9	operations management;spare part	DB	10.77941440392328	-1.658681680436323	57443
e8113fac69051fbddb5ec315e8522be4a4c67850	symbiotic organisms search and two solution representations for solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem	symbiotic organisms search;solution representation;metaheuristics;capacitated vehicle routing problem	This paper presents the symbiotic organism search (SOS) heuristic for solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), which is a well-known discrete optimization problem. The objective of CVRP is to decide the routes for a set of vehicles to serve a set of demand points while minimizing the total routing cost. SOS is a simple and powerful metaheuristic that simulates the symbiotic interaction strategies adopted by an organism for surviving in an ecosystem. As SOS is originally developed for solving continuous optimization problems, we therefore apply two solution representations, SR-1 and SR-2, to transform SOS into an applicable solution approach for CVRP and then apply a local search strategy to improve the solution quality of SOS. The original SOS uses three interaction strategies, mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism, to improve a candidate solution. In this improved version, we propose two new interaction strategies, namely competition and amensalism. We develop six versions of SOS for solving CVRP. The first version, SOSCanonical, utilizes a commonly used continuous to discrete solution representation transformation procedure. The second version is an improvement of canonical SOS with a local search strategy, denoted as SOSBasic. The third and fourth versions use SR1 and SR-2 with a local search strategy, denoted as SOSSR-1 and SOSSR-2. The fifth and sixth versions, denoted as ISOSSR-1 and ISOSSR-2, improve the implementation of SOSSR-1 and SOSSR-2 by adding the newly proposed competition and amensalism interaction strategies. The performances of SOSCanonical, SOSBasic, SOSSR-1, and SOSSR2 are evaluated on two sets of benchmark problems. First, the results of the four versions of SOS are compared, showing that the preferable result was obtained from SOSSR-1 and SOSSR-2. The performances of SOSSR-1, SOSSR-2, ISOSSR-1, and ISOSSR-2 are then compared, presenting that ISOSSR-1 and ISOSSR-2 offer a better performance. Next, the ISOSSR-1 and ISOSSR-2 results are compared to the best-known solutions. The results show that ISOSSR-1 and ISOSSR-2 produce good VRP solutions under a reasonable computational time, indicating that each of them is a good alternative algorithm for solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;benchmark (computing);computation;continuous optimization;discrete optimization;ecosystem;heuristic;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;microsoft windows;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;performance;time complexity;vehicle routing problem;psos	Vincent F.

For this case, an entropy maximization model with chance constraint is proposed, and is proved to be convex. In order to solve this model, fuzzy simulation, stochastic simulation and a genetic algorithm are integrated to produce a hybrid intelligent algorithm. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the application of the model and the algorithm.	entropy maximization	Xiang Li;Zhongfeng Qin;Lixing Yang;Keping Li	2011	J.

7144717eb6c038796157c0ebd09968c29d572dcf	an adaptive memetic algorithm for the architecture optimisation problem	optimisation;adaptive memetic algorithm	Architecture design is one of the most important steps in software development, since design decisions affect the quality of the final system (e.g. reliability and performance). Due to the ever-growing complexity and size of software systems, deciding on the best design is a computationally intensive and complex task. This issue has been tackled by using optimisation method, such as local search and genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms work well in rugged fitness landscapes, whereas local search methods are successful when the search space is smooth. The strengths of these two algorithms have been combined to create memetic algorithms, which have shown to be more efficient than genetic algorithms and local search on their own. A major point of concern with memetic algorithms is the likelihood of loosing the exploration capacity because of the ‘exploitative’ nature of local search. To address this issue, this work uses an adaptive scheme to control the local search application. The utilised scheme takes into account the diversity of the current population. Based on the diversity indicator, it decides whether to call local search or not. Experiments were conducted on the component deployment problem to evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with and without the adaptive local search algorithm.	mathematical optimization;memetic algorithm	Nasser R.

The time-varying characteristics of these DMO problems (DMOPs) pose new challenges to evolutionary algorithms. Considering the importance of a representative and diverse set of benchmark functions for DMO, in this paper, we propose a new benchmark generator that is able to tune a number of challenging characteristics, including mixed Pareto-optimal front (convexity-concavity), nonmonotonic and time-varying variable-linkages, mixed types of changes, and randomness in type change, which have rarely or not been considered or tested in the literature. A test suite of ten instances with different dynamic features is produced from the generator in this paper. Additionally, a few new performance measures are proposed to evaluate algorithms for DMOPs with different characteristics. Six representative multiobjective evolutionary algorithms from the literature are investigated based on the proposed DMO test suite and performance measures. The experimental results facilitate a better understanding of strengths and weaknesses of these compared algorithms for DMOPs.	9,10-dimethoxyanthracene-2-sulfonate;benchmark (computing);concave function;crowding;directx;distribution (mathematics);evolutionary algorithm;exclusion;generic drugs;moea framework;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;multi-objective optimization;multimodal imaging;niche blogging;ovarian failure, premature;pareto efficiency;photon correlation spectroscopy;program optimization;randomness;reliability engineering;robustness (computer science);software metric;test suite;warhammer 40,000: dark millennium;weakness	Shouyong Jiang;Shengxiang Yang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics	10.1109/TCYB.2015.2510698	benchmark;mathematical optimization;text mining;benchmark;shape;computer science;artificial intelligence;optical fiber;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;data mining	SE	23.421306332451817	-5.1761364325611305	57912

Unlike the traditional chopper based solution, an improved offshore AC voltage drop FRT strategy, which is communication free and ensures robust faulted dynamic response is proposed to achieve FRT compliance. The calculation of the best parameters which enable successful FRT compliance is formulated as an optimization problem. The objective function aims at minimizing the electrical stresses imposed at the HVDC system and at the offshore wind power plants during the FRT and the post-FRT period, while simultaneously ensuring FRT compliance for the HVDC system and the wind power plants. The optimization is tackled based on an iterative procedure that combines dynamic EMT-type modelling of the VSC-HVDC system and the connected type 4 offshore wind power plants, with a genetic algorithm based search process. Numerical results for a point-to-point connection that is extended to the three terminal HVDC grid connection case are demonstrated.	chopper (electronics);genetic algorithm;iterative method;mathematical optimization;nsa product types;numerical method;optimization problem;point-to-point protocol;requirement;shadow copy	Mario Ndreko;José L.

In this paper, we present a new meta-heuristic that uses the EM methodology to solve the single machine scheduling problem. Single machine scheduling is a combinatorial optimization problem. Schedule representation for our problem is based on random keys. Because there is little research in solving the combinatorial optimization problem (COP) by EM, the paper attempts to employ the random-key concept enabling EM to solve COP in single machine scheduling problem. We present a hybrid algorithm that combines the EM methodology and genetic operators to obtain the best/optimal schedule for this single machine scheduling problem, which attempts to achieve convergence and diversity effect when they iteratively solve the problem. The objective in our problem is minimization of the sum of earliness and tardiness. This hybrid algorithm was tested on a set of standard test problems available in the literature. The computational results show that this hybrid algorithm performs better than the standard genetic algorithm.	combinatorial optimization;computation;genetic algorithm;genetic operator;heuristic;hybrid algorithm;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;optimization problem;scheduling (computing);single-machine scheduling	Pei-Chann Chang;Shih-Hsin Chen;Chin-Yuan Fan	2009	Expert Syst.

(2006), for instance—is a powerful technology to model and solve combinatorial (optimization) problems, which are ubiquitous in industry. CP works either via systematic tree search interleaved with constraint propagation (the elimination of impossible values) at every node of the search tree, or via constraint-based local search. CP is an ideal integration technology for hybrid solving, including methods from classical operations research as well, such as mixed integer programming (IP), and Boolean satisfiability. CP is now a mature technology and has been successfully used for tackling a wide range of real-life complex applications, especially for short-term scheduling, personnel rostering, and configuration problems.	boolean satisfiability problem;combinatorial optimization;constraint programming;integer programming;linear programming;local consistency;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;nurse scheduling problem;operations research;real life;scheduling (computing);schema (genetic algorithms);search tree	Pierre Flener;Justin Pearson;Marc Bourgois	2012	Knowledge Eng.

In addition, the diversity of hierarchical optimization problems requires different types of multilevel relations between sub-problems. Thus, the approximate and accurate representations and solutions can be integrated. That is, to address the how partial solutions of sub-problems can be reintegrated to build a solution for the main problem. The nature of relations between components differs from one decomposition strategy to another.

Recently, this has become particularly important for the conceptual design of biorefineries. This work introduces a shortcut method for the synthesis and screening of integrated biorefineries. A structural representation (referred to as the chemical species/conversion operator) is introduced. It is used to track individual chemicals while allowing for the processing of multiple chemicals in processing technologies. The representation is used to embed potential configurations of interest. An optimization approach is developed to screen and determine optimum network configurations for various technology pathways using simple data. The solution to the optimization formulation provides a quick and effective method for screening and interconnecting the technological pathways and to distributing the flows over the network. Case studies are solved to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach.	keyboard shortcut;mathematical optimization	Buping Bao;Denny Kok Sum Ng;Douglas H. S.

This results in essentiofly two unidirectional starches and poorer performance. In this paper we present an efficient olge rithm for bidirectional heuristic search which overcomes this difficulty.

In this paper, an improved method based on the weighted Voronoi diagram and transportation model for substation planning is proposed, which can optimize the location, capacity, and power supply range for each substationwith theminimum investment which contains the cost of the lines, substations, and annual operation expense. The weighted Voronoi diagram (WVD) whose weights can be adaptively adjusted can calculate the location and the capacity for each substation with good performance of global convergence and better convergence speed. Transportation model can simulate the best correspondence relationship between the loads and substations. The impact of geographical factors is also considered in this paper. Large amount of experiments show that the improved method can get more reasonable and more optimized planning result within shorter time than the original WVD and other algorithms.	algorithm;collocation;experiment;local convergence;mathematical optimization;power supply;simulation;traction substation;weighted voronoi diagram;wiring	Shiju Wang;Zhiying Lu;Shaoyun Ge	2014	J.

0480680e4394af479badb25a5e47b6a692173c92	including robustness considerations in the search phase of many-objective robust decision making		Many-Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM) is a prominent model-based approach for dealing with deep uncertainty. MORDM has four phases: a systems analytical problem formulation, a search phase to generate candidate solutions, a trade-off analysis where different strategies are compared across many objectives, and a scenario discovery phase to identify the vulnerabilities. In its original inception, the search phase identifies optimal strategies for a single reference scenario for deep uncertainties, which may result in missing locally near-optimal, but globally more robust strategies. Recent work has addressed this issue by generating candidate strategies for multiple policy-relevant scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate a systematic scenario selection procedure in the search phase to consider both policy relevance and scenario diversity. The results demonstrate an increased tradeoff variety besides higher robustness, compared to the solutions found for a reference scenario. Future research can routinize multi-scenario search in MORDM with the aid of software packages. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This problem still attracts a considerable amount of interest even after the sheer amount of available results. More precisely, the optimizat ion objective of total flowtime min imization has been actively studied and many effect ive algorithms have been proposed in the last few years. New best solutions have been found for common benchmarks at a rapid pace. However, these improvements many times come at the cost of sophisticated algorithms. Complex methods hinder potential applications and are difficult to extend to small problem variations. Replicability of results is also a challenge. In this paper we examine simple and easy to implement methods that at the same time result in state-of-the-art performance. The first two proposed methods are based in the well known Iterated Local Search (ILS) and Iterated Greedy Algorithm (IGA) frameworks, which have been applied with great success to other flowshop problems. Additionally, we present extensions of these methods that work over populations, something that we refer to as population-based ILS (pILS) and population-based IGA (pIGA ), respectively. We calibrate the presented algorithms by means of the Design of Experiments (DOE) approach. Extensive comparative evaluations are carried against the most recent state-of-the-art techniques for the considered problem in the literature. The results show that the presented algorithms are very effective after comprehensive computational and statistical analyses. Furthermore, we show that, despite their simplicity, the presented methods are able to improve 12 out of 120 best known solutions of Taillard’s flowshop benchmark with total flowtime criterion.	benchmark (computing);computation;convex optimization;design of experiments;experiment;greedy algorithm;in-game advertising;iterated function;iterated local search;local search (optimization);maxima and minima;population;scheduling (computing);whole earth 'lectronic link	Quan-Ke Pan;Rubén Ruiz	2012	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2012.04.034	mathematical optimization;computer science;local search;operations management;mathematics;operations research;scheduling;metaheuristic	DB	22.559512487807574	-2.475955727874519	59277
c17feb3d3a28f77367c0d461ec626d4fd29308f6	a hybrid evolutionary multiobjective optimization strategy for the dynamic power supply problem in magnesia grain manufacturing	manufacture process of magnesia grain;journal;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;dynamic multiobjective optimization;case based reasoning;hybrid strategy;article	The supply trajectory of electric power for submerged arc magnesia furnace determines the yields and grade of magnesia grain during the manufacture process. As the two production targets (i.e., the yields and the grade of magnesia grain) are conflicting and the process is subject to changing conditions, the supply of electric power needs to be dynamically optimized to track the moving Pareto optimal set with time. A hybrid evolutionary multiobjective optimization strategy is proposed to address the dynamic multiobjective optimization problem. The hybrid strategy is based on two techniques. The first one uses case-based reasoning to immediately generate good solutions to adjust the power supply once the environment changes, and then apply a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to accurately solve the problem. The second one is to learn the case solutions to guide and promote the search of the evolutionary algorithm, and the best solutions found by the evolutionary algorithm can be used to update the case library anufacture process of magnesia grain to improve the accuracy of case-based reasoning in the following process. Due to the effectiveness of mutual promotion, the hybrid strategy can continuously adapt and search in dynamic environments. Two prominent multiobjective evolutionary algorithms are integrated into the hybrid strategy to solve the dynamic multiobjective power supply optimization problem. The results from a series of experiments show that the proposed hybrid algorithms perform better than their component multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for the tested problems.	case-based reasoning;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;power supply	Weijian Kong;Tianyou Chai;Shengxiang Yang;Jinliang Ding	2013	Appl.

In Constraint Programming, constraint propagation is aimed at removing from variable domains combinations of values which are proven infeasible. Pruning derives from feasibility reasoning. When coping with optimization problems, pruning can be performed also on the basis of costs, i.e., optimality reasoning. Cost-based filtering removes combination of values which are proven sub-optimal. For this purpose, we encapsulate in global constraints optimization components representing suitable relaxations of the constraint itself. These components embed efficient Operations Research algorithms computing the optimal solution of the relaxed problem and a gradient function representing the estimated cost of each variable-value assignment. We exploit these pieces of information for pruning and for guiding the search. We have applied these techniques to a couple of ILOG Solver global constraints (a constraint of difference and a path constraint) and tested the approach on a variety of combinatorial optimization problems such as Timetabling, Travelling Salesman Problems and Scheduling Problems with sequence dependent setup times. Comparisons with pure Constraint Programming approaches and related literature clearly show the benefits of the proposed approach.	algorithm;backpropagation;branch and bound;combinatorial optimization;constraint logic programming;constraint programming;dynamic programming;global serializability;gradient;ilog;local consistency;mathematical optimization;operations research;optimization problem;reduced cost;scheduling (computing);shared variables;software propagation;solver;travelling salesman problem	Filippo Focacci;Andrea Lodi;Michela Milano	2002	Constraints	10.1023/A:1020589922418	constraint logic programming;concurrent constraint logic programming;optimization problem;job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;constraint programming;combinatorics;binary constraint;constraint satisfaction;constraint learning;computer science;constraint graph;constraint satisfaction dual problem;mathematics;constraint;constraint satisfaction problem;algorithm;hybrid algorithm;local consistency;3-opt;backtracking;quadratic assignment problem	AI	22.660171405603265	3.452398368667325	59507

In traditional CSP and Fuzzy CSP, values for the variables are chosen from the discrete domains. However, this is often inconvenient when one wants to express real world problems. We show that this model, called HDFCSP(Hybrid Domain Fuzzy CSP), can be solved by Spread-Repair, an extension of the well known iterative improvement algorithms. Experimental results on some test problems show that the algorithm actually has an ability of finding partial approximate solutions with high probability in a computation time much shorter than the traditional, discretedomain FCSP.	approximation algorithm;computation;constraint satisfaction problem;iterative method;time complexity;turing test;whole earth 'lectronic link;with high probability	Yasuhiro Sudo;Masahito Kurihara;Tamotsu Mitamura	2006	JACIII	10.20965/jaciii.2006.p0465	constraint logic programming;mathematical optimization;constraint programming;decomposition method;constraint satisfaction;fuzzy transportation;computer science;constraint graph;constraint satisfaction dual problem;complexity of constraint satisfaction;constraint;constraint satisfaction problem;fuzzy set operations;hybrid algorithm;local consistency;backtracking	AI	23.541119169330575	1.839076558348359	59553

Many heuristics for optimal and satisficing planning approximate the h heuristic, which is well-informed and admissible but intractable to compute. In this work, branch-and-bound and IDA∗ search are used in a search space tailored to delete-free planning together with an incrementally computed version of the LMcut heuristic.

Apart from the hardware requirements for programs used by large companies or smaller groups, the wide applications and hardware load are games and graphics. Increasing the quality of games by improving their story quality requires a lot of more efficient and effective algorithms. In this work, we propose the use of a hybrid approach to the management of opponents’ movements on the classic two-dimensional game called the Tron. Our solution is based on the use of the idea of a simulated annealing algorithm in order to select the agent’s movement technique depending on the cost function. The algorithm has been implemented and tested depending on the used parameters. Obtained results were discussed depending on the advantages and disadvantages of using this type of solution in more complex games.

f3996fb02eda825d11214f8f29c9db8809d61432	online scheduling problems with flexible release dates: applications to infrastructure restoration		Abstract We consider scheduling problems with the new concept of flexible release dates under an online optimization framework. A flexible release date is one where the traditional release date of a specific operation can be moved earlier in time, specifically to the completion time of an associated supplementary operation. In this context, we examine two classes of parallel identical machines: those that perform supplementary operations to alter release dates and those that perform installation operations to change the network characteristics. We further consider multi-function machines that can perform both supplementary and installation operations. The release date of an operation is often determined by events outside the knowledge of the decision-maker. Therefore, we consider scheduling problems in an online setting to model the lack of- and evolution of information about the release dates of tasks. Motivated by infrastructure restoration after an extreme event, we consider flexible release dates for an integrated network design and scheduling problem that seeks to improve the performance of a network over time by selecting and scheduling operations that will change the network characteristics. To solve these problems, we propose heuristic dispatching rules whose solutions are benchmarked against the solutions of a mixed integer programming formulation. Using a realistic infrastructure network, we perform computational tests; the results of these tests demonstrate the ability of the dispatching rule to find high-quality solutions in real time and quickly adapt to the arrival of new information. From the analysis of these results, we deduce policy insights regarding the role of flexible release dates and the machine fleet configuration.	circuit restoration;scheduling (computing)	Sarah G.

The proposed algorithm is inspired in the logic of the beam search, although it remains a fast constructive heuristic.#R##N##R##N#The results obtained by the proposed algorithm outperform those obtained by other constructive heuristics in the literature for the problem, thus modifying substantially the state-of-the-art of efficient approximate procedures for the problem. In addition, the proposed algorithm even outperforms two of the best metaheuristics for many instances of the problem, using much lesser computation effort. The excellent performance of the proposal is also proved by the fact that the new heuristic found new best upper bounds for 35 of the 120 instances in Taillard’s benchmark.	beam search;constructive heuristic	Victor Fernandez-Viagas;Jose M.

0a419dbcffc3f3bc8ee28f7b155fb7e4a0d0dc4c	honeybees-inspired heuristic algorithms for numerical optimisation		Swarm intelligence is all about developing collective behaviours to solve complex, ill-structured and large-scale problems. Efficiency in collective behaviours depends on how to harmonise the individual contributions so that a complementary collective effort can be achieved to offer a useful solution. The main points in organising the harmony remains as managing the diversification and intensification actions appropriately, where the efficiency of collective behaviours depends on blending these two actions appropriately. In this study, two swarm intelligence algorithms inspired of natural honeybee colonies have been overviewed with many respects and two new revisions and a hybrid version have been studied to improve the efficiencies in solving numerical optimisation problems, which are well-known hard benchmarks. Consequently, the revisions and especially the hybrid algorithm proposed have outperformed the two original bee algorithms in solving these very hard numerical optimisation benchmarks.	algorithm;heuristic;mathematical optimization	Muharrem Dügenci	2015	CoRR		mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;machine learning;management science	Robotics	23.18089981182976	-4.254358083001405	60147

The parameters of the system components are actually imprecise or uncertain quantity since those are generally guessed by the designers during the design-time. Thus, important features of the designed system, viz. reliability, costs, weight etc very suitably qualifies to be considered as fuzzy quantity. Our problem formulation considers these parameters as type-2 fuzzy quantity. There are few reports where the problem has been studied under type-1 fuzzy uncertainty. As far as we know, no research has been reported where the problem has been addressed with a particle swam optimization based approach in a type-2 fuzzy environment. Suitable examples are included to demonstrate our approach. Results are compared showing that the type-2 fuzzy uncertainty based approach outperforms other recently reported results.	mathematical optimization;viz: the computer game	Zubair Ashraf;Pranab K.

1de23fd466078489217a6d712b06c8429d11a61f	tsp solver: an integrated framework for solving traveling salesman problems consistent with tsplib		The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the subject of study in operational research for more than 30 years. The TSP is considered as NP-complete; consequently, many heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms have been developed to cope with the intractable nature of the problem. Although the problem is well-studied, lack of integrated software that harnesses the new computersu0027 computational power and provides an easy comparison between heuristic algorithms is sensible. TSP solver is the state-of-the-art software that provides a common framework to compare the performance of different algorithms over TSPLIB library. Academicians can focus on developing new methodologies without concerning the availability and correctness of reported algorithms in the literature. Practitioners may also benefit from provided transparency by our software solution and build their own customized packages to flourish their businesses. The proposed software can be a foundation for the future implementations in which users design their algorithm and results would be uploaded automatically on a public server together with the source code.	concorde tsp solver	Bihter Avsar;Danial Esmaeili Aliabadi;Edris Esmaeili Aliabadi	2017		10.3233/978-1-61499-828-0-70	theoretical computer science;integrated software;correctness;software;source code;metaheuristic;heuristic;travelling salesman problem;solver;computer science	EDA	22.45668273725736	1.0344407592095775	60450

The existing approaches based on graphs can generate solutions that are sub-optimal, and do not consider the different factors and measures that can affect the stubbing process. To overcome this limitation, solutions based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) have presented promising results. However, the determination of a cost function, which is able to generate the best solutions, is not always a trivial task, mainly for complex systems with a great number of measures. Therefore, we introduce, in this paper, a multi-objective optimization approach to better represent the CITO problem. The approach generates a set of good solutions that achieve a balanced compromise between the different measures (objectives). It was implemented by a Pareto Ant Colony (P-ACO) algorithm, which is described in detail. The algorithm was used in a set of real programs and the obtained results are compared to the GA results. The results allow discussing the difference between single and multi-objective approaches especially for complex systems with a greater number of dependencies among the classes.	ant colony optimization algorithms;approximation;benchmark (computing);complex systems;experiment;genetic algorithm;integration testing;loss function;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;pareto efficiency;software engineering;software release life cycle;sorting;test plan	Rafael da Veiga Cabral;Aurora Trinidad Ramirez Pozo;Silvia Regina Vergilio	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16573-3_3	mathematical optimization;ant colony optimization algorithms;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics	AI	19.637489572372512	-5.013970859995089	60515

The main idea is to take advantages of both the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) framework and our previously proposed S-CLPSO method for discrete optimization. Consistent to MOEA/D, a multiobjective problem is decomposed into a set of subproblems, each of which is represented as a weight vector and solved by a particle. Thus the objective vector of a solution or the cost vector between two cities will be transformed into real fitness to be used in S-CLPSO for the exemplar construction, the heuristic information generation and the update of pBest. To validate the proposed method, experiments based on TSPLIB benchmark are conducted and the results indicate that the proposed algorithm can improve the solution quality to some degree.	benchmark (computing);discrete optimization;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;heuristic;moea framework;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;particle swarm optimization;travelling salesman problem	Xue Yu;Wei-neng Chen;Xiaomin Hu;Jun Zhang	2015		10.1145/2739480.2754672	2-opt;mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics	AI	24.298781407939416	-2.0887220728015996	60605

However, recent studies on the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) have considered only simple constraints. They also do not scale well to real-world problems that are encountered in the logistics industry. In this paper, we introduce a novel vehicle routing problem with time window and pallet loading constraints; this problem accounts for the actual needs of businesses in the logistics industry such as the delivery of consumer goods and agricultural products. To solve this new VRP, we propose a hybrid approach by combining Tabu search and the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. A new benchmark data set is generated to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm because the proposed VRP has never been reported in the literature. Experiments are performed for a data set of Solomon’s 56 vehicle routing problem with time windows. Our approach is superior to a number of other heuristic algorithms in a comparison on Solomon’s VRPTW instances.	artificial bee colony algorithm;benchmark (computing);heuristic;hybrid algorithm;logistics;microsoft windows;tabu search;vehicle routing problem	Defu Zhang;Sifan Cai;Furong Ye;Yain-Whar Si;Trung Thanh Nguyen	2017	Inf.

To this end, a mixed-integer linear formulation (compact) is obtained by piecewise-linearizing the nonlinear curves, using binary variables to express the linearization and routing decisions. A new formulation (integrated) combining the decisions on linearization and routing is developed by using a single binary variable. The structures of both formulations are explored to generate lifted cover cuts. Numerical tests show that the solution of the integrated formulation using cutting-plane generation is faster in spite of having more variables than the compact formulation.	integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;routing	Andres Codas;Eduardo Camponogara	2012	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2011.08.027	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;integer programming;piecewise linear function;linear programming;mathematics;cutting-plane method	Theory	17.094371756239585	4.021464438577477	60852

However, due to climate change and the fast population growth, the quality and quantity of groundwater resources have been continuously decreasing. Therefore, sustainable management strategies should be developed for groundwater systems by decision makers. This chapter provides a brief review dealing with the use of Harmony Search (HS) optimization algorithm for solving the groundwater management problems. Review results indicate that HS can successively solve the groundwater management problems and provides identical or better results than the other nonheuristic and heuristic optimization algorithms.	discretization;global optimization;hs algorithm;harmony search;heuristic;iteration;loss function;mathematical optimization;natural language processing;optimization problem;polynomial-time approximation scheme;pumping (computer systems);scalable cluster environment;search algorithm;simulation;software release life cycle;user agent	M.

A more recent approach to reduce automobile ownership is through the use of vehicle sharing programs (VSPs). A VSP involves a fleet of vehicles located strategically at stations across the transportation network. In its most flexible form, users are free to check out vehicles at any station and return them to stations close to their destinations. Vehicle fleets can be comprised of bicycles, low emission cars or electric vehicles. Such systems offer innovative, low-cost, and flexible solutions to the larger mobility problem and can have positive impacts on the transportation system as a whole by reducing urban congestion. To match automobile flexibility, users are free to determine all trip characteristics (where to checkout and return vehicles, duration of travel and time of travel). This places exceptional logistical challenges on operators who must ensure demand in the near future is met. Since flow from one station to another is seldom equal to flow in the opposing direction, the VSP fleet can become spatially imbalanced. To meet near-future demand, operators must then redistribute vehicles to correct this asymmetry. The focus of this report is to provide efficient, cost-effective operational strategies for fleet management. A stochastic, mixed-integer program (MIP) involving joint chance constraints is developed that generates least-cost vehicle redistribution plans for shared-vehicle systems such that a proportion of all near-term demand scenarios are met. The model aims to correct short term demand asymmetry in shared-vehicle systems, where flow from one station to another is seldom equal to the flow in the opposing direction. The model accounts for demand stochasticity and generates partial redistribution plans in circumstances when demand outstrips supply. This stochastic MIP has a non-convex feasible region that poses computational challenges. To solve the proposed program two solution procedures are developed. The first procedure is based on enumerating p-efficient points, used to transform the problem into a set of disjunctive, convex MIPs. A novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for generating p-efficient points that handles dual-bounded chance constraints is developed. Our technique has a smaller memory and computational footprint than previously proposed methods. Since this method can be computationally prohibitive for large shared-vehicle systems, we develop a faster cone-generation method that assumes that the random demand at each station is independent.

This paper utilizes context-aware recommendation to facilitate personalized education and assist students in selecting courses (or in non-traditional curricula, learning artifacts) that meet curricular requirements, leverage their skills and background, and are relevant to their interests. The research contribution described in this paper is a methodology that generates a schedule of courses (and associated course content) that takes into consideration a student's profile, while meeting curricular and prerequisite requirements and aiming to reduce attributes such as cost and time-to-degree. The optimization problem - multiple integer linear programming problems and a single scheduling problem - is solved in stages using a known linear solver as well as graph-based heuristics. The efficacy of the algorithm is demonstrated through a case study.	ata over ethernet;evolutionary algorithm;http 404;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;numerical linear algebra;optimization problem;personalization;recommender system;relevance;requirement;schedule (project management);scheduling (computing);selection algorithm;solver	Tyler Morrow;Ali R.

6998b0e87ed7f3f2cd3973a14b04b0c130adc47b	short portfolio training for csp solving		Many different approaches for solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) and related Constraint Optimization Problems (COPs) exist. However, there is no single solver (nor approach) that performs well on all classes of problems and many portfolio approaches for selecting a suitable solver based on simple syntactic features of the input CSP instance have been developed. In this paper we first present a simple portfolio method for CSP based on k-nearest neighbors method. Then, we propose a new way of using portfolio systems --- training them shortly in the exploitation time, specifically for the set of instances to be solved and using them on that set. Thorough evaluation has been performed and has shown that the approach yields good results. We evaluated several machine learning techniques for our portfolio. Due to its simplicity and efficiency, the selected k-nearest neighbors method is especially suited for our short training approach and it also yields the best results among the tested methods. We also confirm that our approach yields good results on SAT domain.

The design of the algorithms takes into consideration load balancing, processor synchronisation reduction, communication overhead reduction and memory contention elimination. In addition, the algorithms are designed to avoid the problem of premature convergence which exists in some previous parallel genetic algorithms. The algorithms are implemented on an i860 processor in a simulated environment and are applied to a short-term hydrothermal scheduling problem. The scheduling results are presented and are compared to those found by sequential GAs, by parallel simulated-annealing algorithm and by some earlier parallel genetic algorithms.	genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;simulated annealing	Kit Po Wong;S.

fd0710e9f085e0fb77764b0bdb50847ce8874de8	an efficient vector-growth decomposition algorithm for cooperative coevolution in solving large scale problems		By taking the idea of divide-and-conquer, cooperative coevolution provides a powerful architecture for large scale optimization problems, but its efficiency depends heavily on the decomposition strategy. Existing decomposition algorithms either cannot obtain correct decomposition results or require a large number of Fitness Evaluations (FEs). To alleviate these limitations, this paper proposes a novel decomposition algorithm by exploring interdependency from the view of vectors. It is good at discovering both direct and indirect interdependency and can significantly reduce FEs, which was verified by conducting experiments on CEC'2010 large scale benchmark functions.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);cooperative coevolution;experiment;fitness function;interdependence;mathematical optimization	Zhigang Ren;An Chen;Lin Wang;Yongsheng Liang;Bei Pang	2017		10.1145/3067695.3082048	machine learning;artificial intelligence;cooperative coevolution;mathematical optimization;architecture;computer science;algorithm;optimization problem	AI	23.530790004466596	-4.191138751040492	61058

In view of this inherent limitation of models, solutions that are nearly optimal, i.e. deviating less than a predefined percentage from the optimal value of the quantified objective functions, can constitute interesting alternatives for stakeholders. The aim of this paper is to extend the analysis of nearly optimal solutions to mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models. Two branch-and-bound algorithms are described to generate nearly optimal solutions, and methods are discussed to summarise and to present nearly optimal solutions. A case study is introduced with an MILP model developed to design farming systems in the Netherlands. This case study shows that the presentation of nearly optimal solutions provides relevant information to resolve complex decision problems.	integer programming;linear programming;systems design	David Makowski;Eligius M.

According to the characteristics of the considered problem, a discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) is adapted, based on which a cooperative optimization method with multiple discrete particle swarms (CPSO) is proposed for MRCPSP. Two swarms are distinctively adopted to the mode assignment and activity sequencing sub-problem. Once a mode list and an activity list are obtained, the two swarms cooperatively search for better solutions. In other words, one swarm updates the mode list in terms of the given activity list and the activity list is improved by the updated mode list by the other swarm. As the same time, a local search procedure is investigated to balance the exploration and exploitation. Computation results of Project Scheduling Problem Library (PSPLIB) sets show CPSO is efficient to solve complicated combination optimization problems.	activity tracker;algorithm;assignment problem;benchmark (computing);computation;convex optimization;exploit (computer security);local search (optimization);makespan;mathematical optimization;oneswarm;pdf/a;particle swarm optimization;scheduling (computing)	Hong Shen;Xiaoping Li	2013	Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE 17th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD)	10.1109/CSCWD.2013.6580935	project management;minimisation;mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;particle swarm optimization;management;scheduling;metaheuristic	Robotics	20.924412290932477	-0.1735360201125554	61166
3c44a2b3a5aeed43de91bc09c0dbf9dbb3e95b49	solving ga-hard problems with emmrs and gpgpus	hard problems;genotype and phenotype mapping	Different techniques have been proposed to tackle GA-Hard problems. Some techniques work with different encodings and representations, other use reordering operators and several, such as the Evolutionary Mapping Method (EMM), apply genotype-phenotype mappings. EMM uses multiple chromosomes in a single cell for mating with another cell within a single population. Although EMM gave good results, it fails on solving some deceptive problems. In this line, EMMRS (EMM with Replacement and Shift) adds a new operator, consisting on doing a replacement and a shift of some of the bits within the chromosome. Results showed the efficiency of the proposal on deceptive problems. However, EMMRS was not tested with other kind of hard problems. In this paper we have adapted EMMRS for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The encodings and genetic operators for solving the TSP are quite different to those applied on deceptive problems. In addition, execution times recommended the parallelization of the GA. We implemented a GPU parallel version. We present here some preliminary results proving that Evolutionary Mapping Method with Replacement and Shift gives good results not only in terms of quality but also in terms of speedup on its GPU parallel version for some instances of the TSP problem.	evolutionary algorithm;general-purpose computing on graphics processing units;genetic operator;graphics processing unit;karp's 21 np-complete problems;parallel computing;software release life cycle;speedup;travelling salesman problem	José Ignacio Hidalgo;J.

22f5fea92da04c18c422bf3cb4036bef73920d71	a surrogate assisted approach for single-objective bilevel optimization	optimization computational modeling approximation algorithms linear programming genetic algorithms search problems evolutionary computation	Bilevel optimization refers to a hierarchical problem in which optimization needs to be performed at two nested levels, namely the upper level and the lower level. The aim is to identify the optimum of the upper level problem, subject to optimality of the corresponding lower level problem. Several problems from the domain of engineering, logistics, economics, and transportation have inherent nested structure which requires them to be modeled as bilevel optimization problems. Bilevel optimization usually requires inordinate amount of function evaluations since a lower level search needs to be conducted for evaluating each upper level solution. The evaluations are especially high when the problems are not suited for exact techniques and evolutionary techniques are employed instead. Reducing this computational effort has been one of the key pursuits in this domain recently. However, the use of surrogate modeling to achieve this goal has so far been scarcely studied. In this paper, we present a surrogate assisted optimization approach toward addressing this research gap. The approach uses surrogates of multiple types in order to provide flexibility of approximating different types of functions more accurately. The algorithm is further strengthened through the use of selective re-evaluation of promising solutions and periodic nested local search. The performance of the proposed algorithm is presented on twenty five standard benchmark problems. The results are compared with a number of other established evolutionary and hybrid algorithms to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in obtaining competitive results using relatively fewer function evaluations.	analysis of algorithms;approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;benchmark (computing);bilevel optimization;computation;experiment;hybrid algorithm;kriging;local search (optimization);logistics;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;program optimization;radial (radio);radial basis function;surrogate model;surrogates	Md Monjurul Islam;Hemant Kumar Singh;Tapabrata Ray	2017	IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation	10.1109/TEVC.2017.2670659	quality control and genetic algorithms;mathematical optimization;interactive evolutionary computation;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;genetic representation;imperialist competitive algorithm;l-reduction;metaheuristic;evolutionary computation	AI	23.12274476056375	-3.3416615188093495	61350

We aim to minimize the costs of assembly line reconstruction, achieve the production load equalization, and minimize the delayed workload using this model. However, the proposed multi-objective optimization model is significantly complex for conventional mathematical optimization methods. Thus, we present an efficient solution approach based on a distance sorting particle swarm optimization. Finally, a case study is conducted to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method. Experimental results indicate that our proposed approach can significantly improve the production efficiency (i.e. increased production load balance, minimized reconstruction cost, and minimized delayed workload).	cloud manufacturing;scheduling (computing)	Minghai Yuan;Kun Deng;W.

005c4e5d619e676440cc94fafb0c654d1b93a255	strategic air traffic flow management under uncertainties using scalable sampling-based dynamic programming and q-learning approaches		Many Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) demonstrate high-dimensional environmental uncertainties that modulate the physical system dynamics and complicate the computational decision-making tasks. As an example, strategic air traffic flow management (ATFM) aims to resolve air traffic congestion through managing traffic flows at a long look-ahead time. The convective weather, a dominant factor of traffic congestion, is very uncertain and significantly complicates the decision-making process. Other uncertainties such as traffic demands further expand the uncertainty space and complicate the design of optimal control solutions that are robust to uncertainties. In this paper, we formulate the strategic ATFM as a stochastic optimal control problem, and use scalable sampling based dynamic programming and Q-learning approaches to address high-dimensional uncertainties. Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches. These approaches generally apply to CPSs that operate under high-dimensional environmental uncertainties.	computation;cyber-physical system;dynamic programming;network congestion;optimal control;q-learning;sampling (signal processing);scalability;simulation;system dynamics	Junfei Xie;Yan Wan;Frank L.

Facility location and committee selection are classic embodiments of this problem. We propose a class of percentile mechanisms, a form of generalized median mechanisms, that are strategy-proof, and derive worst-case approximation ratios for social cost and maximum load for L1 and L2 cost models. More importantly, we propose a samplebased framework for optimizing the choice of percentiles relative to any prior distribution over preferences, while maintaining strategy-proofness. Our empirical investigations, using social cost and maximum load as objectives, demonstrate the viability of this approach and the value of such optimized mechanisms vis-à-vis mechanisms derived through worst-case analysis.	approximation;best, worst and average case;experiment;heuristic;ibm notes;lu decomposition;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;program optimization;sample complexity;scalability;sonic user interface;visual instruction set;with high probability;word lists by frequency	Xin Sui;Craig Boutilier;Tuomas Sandholm	2013			econometrics;mathematical optimization;computer science;statistics	AI	16.856737152699928	-9.118372162383453	61685

The bees algorithm can be used as a new method to determine the sequence in which to apply the partition in the fix-and-optimize approach. This new manner of choosing the partition adds diversity to the solution pool and yields different local optima solutions after some iterations. The bees-and-fix-and-optimize (BFO) algorithm attempts to avoid these local optima by performing random search in accordance with the concept of bees algorithm. The BFO has yielded good results for instances from the literature and, in most cases, the results are superior to the best results provided by approaches presented in recent literature. They show that this construction concept is advantageous and illustrate the efficiency of hybrid methods composed of matheuristics and metaheuristics. Furthermore, the BFO approach is a generalpurpose heuristic that can be applied to solve other types of production planning problems.	basic formal ontology;bees algorithm;cplex;computation;grasp;heuristic;heuristic (computer science);iteration;lp-type problem;local optimum;matheuristics;maxima and minima;metaheuristic;population;random search;solver;tabu search;test set	Marcos Furlan;Maristela Oliveira Santos	2017	J.

This article extends the work by Jotshi, A. and Batta, R. (2008) ‘Search for an immobile entity on a network’, European Journal of Operational Research, Vol. 192, pp.347–359 – search for a single entity. The problem is first examined for the case where re-optimisation is not allowed, i.e. we are not allowed to change the path once we have started traversing it. In the second case, re-optimisation is allowed after the discovery of the first entity. For both cases, the objective is to minimise the expected search time to find both entities. Heuristic algorithms are introduced and computational results are presented showing the benefits of allowing re-optimisation.	algorithm;aqua;average-case complexity;comment (computer programming);computation;entity;graph (discrete mathematics);heuristic (computer science);iteration;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical integration;operations research;scalability;search problem;simulated annealing;time complexity	Arun Jotshi;Rajan Batta	2009	IJMOR	10.1504/IJMOR.2009.022875	artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;mathematics	ML	23.906350884129118	2.322144582795681	61790

Several mono or multi-objective optimization methods exist to find the best traffic signals settings, such as evolutionary algorithms, fuzzy logic algorithms, or even particle swarm optimizations. However, they are generally dedicated to very specific traffic configurations. In this paper, we introduce the SIALAC benchmark bringing together about 24 real-world based study cases, and investigate fitness landscapes structure of these problem instances.	benchmark (computing);evolutionary algorithm;fuzzy logic;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;optimizing compiler;swarm	Florian Leprêtre;Cyril Fonlupt;Sébastien Vérel;Virginie Marion	2018		10.1145/3205651.3205776	fitness landscape;machine learning;mathematical optimization;business process discovery;artificial intelligence;fuzzy logic;computer science;evolutionary algorithm;multi-objective optimization;algorithm;particle swarm optimization	AI	22.650438806004278	-2.927849380043617	61949

Sampling techniques become computationally expensive if a large reliability is desired. In this paper, first we present a brief review of statistical reliability-based optimization procedures. Thereafter, for the first time, we extend and apply multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for solving two different reliability-based optimization problems for which evolutionary approaches have a clear niche in finding a set of reliable, instead of optimal, solutions. The use of an additional objective of maximizing the reliability index in a multi-objective evolutionary optimization procedure allows a number of trade-off solutions to be found, thereby allowing the designers to find solutions corresponding to different reliability requirements. Next, the concept of single-objective reliability-based optimization is extended to multi-objective optimization of finding a reliable frontier, instead of an optimal frontier. These optimization tasks are illustrated by solving test problems and a well-studied engineering design problem. The results should encourage the use of evolutionary optimization methods to more such reliability-based optimization problems.	evolutionary algorithm;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization	Kalyanmoy Deb;Dhanesh Padmanabhan;Sulabh Gupta;Abhishek Kumar Mall	2006		10.1007/978-3-540-70928-2_9	probabilistic-based design optimization;discrete optimization;optimization problem;mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;engineering optimization;multidisciplinary design optimization;test functions for optimization;meta-optimization;combinatorial optimization;computer science;derivative-free optimization;stochastic optimization;multi-objective optimization;machine learning;management science;continuous optimization;imperialist competitive algorithm;vector optimization;bilevel optimization;random optimization;metaheuristic;evolutionary computation	AI	21.942891197755802	-4.094238278092578	61973

The significant consideration is given to show the effectiveness of hybrid approaches and how they can be used to improve the performance of integrated design optimization applications. The proposed approach is based on two-stages which are (1) the use of neural networks (NNs) and genetic algorithm (GA) with feature technology for integrated design activities and (2) the use of Taguchi's method and GA for design parameters optimization. The first stage resulted in better integrated design solutions in terms of computational complexity and later resulted in a solution, which leads to better and more robust parameter values for multi-objective shape design optimization. The effectiveness and validity of the proposed approach are evaluated with examples.	program optimization	Nursel Öztürk;Ali Riza Yildiz;Necmettin Kaya;Ferruh Öztürk	2006	Concurrent Engineering: R&A	10.1177/1063293X06063314	control engineering;probabilistic-based design optimization;multi-swarm optimization;topology optimization;engineering optimization;multidisciplinary design optimization;genetic algorithm;probabilistic design;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;machine learning;artificial neural network	EDA	14.93151174800606	-6.200697786363581	61989

This paper investigates the short-term manpower planning problem regarding transhipment container terminals. It consists of determining shifts, tasks and activities of the manpower working in these terminals in order to serve vessels in time intervals, which typically do not overlap with personnel shifts. This complex problem is modelled by an integer linear programming formulation. The optimal solutions of the model are compared with the decisions made in accordance with the manpower policy adopted by a real transhipment container terminal. The experimentation sheds light on when its policy is effective or when there is room for optimisation. The computational tests indicate that the model can be optimally solved even in the case of huge transhipment container terminals.	mathematical optimization	Massimo Di Francesco;Nuria Díaz-Maroto Llorente;Simone Zanda;Paola Zuddas	2016	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2016.04.012	engineering;operations management;mathematical model;mathematics;transport engineering;operations research;statistics	Robotics	14.231698238421275	2.049937510038614	62213

The result is a dynamic logistics planning problem where in each delivery period the vehicle dispatcher needs to design a multi-stop vehicle route while determining the container quantities to be picked up at each stop. This research is unique in that route design and pickup strategies are developed simultaneously, where stop volumes are known only probabilistically over a planning horizon. A heuristic procedure is developed for treating the route design-pickup strategy planning problem.	logistics	Ahmad Alshamrani;Kamlesh Mathur;Ronald H.

In solutions presented in the literature costs of travel between nodes (cities) are based on Euclidean distances, the problem is symmetric and the costs are constant and crisp values. Practical application in road transportation and supply chains are often fuzzy. The risk attitude depends on the features of the given operation. The model presented in this paper handles the fuzzy, time dependent nature of the TSP and also gives solution for the asymmetric loss aversion by embedding the risk attitude into the fitness function of the bacterial memetic algorithm. Computational results are presented as well.	memetic algorithm;memetics;risk aversion;travelling salesman problem	Péter Földesi;János Botzheim	2010	Memetic Computing	10.1007/s12293-010-0037-4	mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;euclidean distance;mathematics;supply chain;travelling salesman problem;fitness function;memetic algorithm	EDA	17.210606061320696	1.4644395918531472	62993

Rostering problems are highly constrained and require extensive experience to solve manually. The decisions made by expert rosterers are often subjective and are difficult to represent systematically. This paper presents a formal description of a new technique for capturing rostering experience using case-based reasoning methodology.

The development of intelligent transportation systems such as the use of information technologies reduces the level of uncertainties and makes the use of more appropriate dynamic formulations and solutions feasible. In this paper, a truck route planning problem called stochastic traveling salesman problem with time windows (STSPTW) in which traveling times along roads and service times at customer locations are stochastic processes is investigated. A methodology is developed to estimate the truck arrival time at each customer location. Using estimated arrival times, an approximate solution method based on dynamic programming is proposed. The algorithm finds the best route with minimum expected cost while it guarantees certain levels of service are met.

Therefore, each supplier will bid strategically for choosing the bidding coefficients to counter the competitors bidding strategy. In this paper optimal bidding strategy problem is solved using a novel algorithm based on Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA). It is memetic meta-heuristic that is designed to seek a global optimal solution by performing a heuristic search. It combines the benefits of the Genetic-based Memetic Algorithm (MA) and the social behavior-based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Due to this it has better precise search which avoids premature convergence and selection of operators. Therefore, the proposed method overcomes the short comings of selection of operators and premature convergence of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and PSO method. Important merit of the proposed SFALA is that faster convergence. The proposed method is numerically verified through computer simulations on IEEE 30-bus system consist of 6 suppliers and practical 75-bus Indian system consist of 15 suppliers. The result shows that SFLA takes less computational time and producing higher profits compared to Fuzzy Adaptive PSO (FAPSO), PSO and GA.	algorithm;blue frog	J. Vijaya Kumar;D. M.

The objective is to determine a cost minimizing production plan for discrete products on multiple resources. The time-varying demand is assumed to be given for each product in each period and has to be completely fulfilled. The production is located on capacity constrained resources for the different production stages. In an iterative fashion, our Fix-and-Optimize approach solves a series of mixed-integer programs. In each of these programs all real-valued variables are treated, but only a small and iteration-specific subset of binary setup variables is optimized. All remaining binary variables are fixed. A numerical study shows that the algorithm provides high-quality results and that the computational effort is moderate.

Mathematical models for optimization can contribute to achieve this, but they also pose some challenges. Not only expertise in mathematics is needed to apply these optimization models, but furthermore expertise in programming is needed for implementation and integration into the software landscape of the company. Additionally most optimization algorithms are computationally very expensive and finding a solution takes a long time. Parallelization reduces the time and can lead to better results, but makes implementation even more challenging. How the high-level pattern-based approach of ParaPhrase [5] and its provided tools reduces this challenges will be described in this paper using a real-world example from industry.	algorithm;automatic parallelization;discrete optimization;high- and low-level;mathematical optimization;parallel computing;planning;program optimization	Michael Rossbory;Werner Reisner	2013	2013 24th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications	10.1109/DEXA.2013.32	stochastic programming;discrete optimization;mathematical optimization;robust optimization;basic solution;integer programming;reactive programming;computer science;linear programming;branch and price;parallel algorithm;inductive programming;cutting;profitability index	HPC	16.772028111994658	-0.4533968691520219	63461

For an efficient management and support, the UBRS infrastructure requires the optimation of vehicle routes connecting several bicycle base stations and storage centers. In this study, we model this real-world optimization problem as a capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with multiple depots and the simultaneous need for pickup and delivery at each base station location. Based on the VRP model specification, two nature-inspired computational techniques, evolutionary algorithms and ant colony systems, are presented and their performance in tackling the UBRS problem is investigated. In the evolutionary approach, individuals are encoded as permutations of base stations and then translated to a set of routes subject to the constraints related to vehicle capacity and node demands. In the ant-based approach, ants build complete solutions formed of several subtours servicing a subset of base stations using a single vehicle based on both apriori (the attractiveness of a move based on the known distance or other factors) and aposteriori (pheromone levels accumulated on visited edges) knowledge. Both algorithms are engaged for the UBRS problem using real data from the cities of Barcelona and Valencia. Computational experiments for several scenarios support a good performance of both population-based search methods. Comparative results indicate that better solutions are obtained on the average by the ant colony system approach for both considered cities.	mathematical optimization;urban computing	Camelia Chira;Javier Sedano;José Ramón Villar;Monica Camara;Emilio Corchado	2014	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2013.07.051	simulation;computer science;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm	Robotics	17.366034739378282	0.5957504360628503	63534

6ad46cfb6e68e5cc9339f6e581ccdc955053f019	design of fuzzy logic traffic controller for isolated intersections with emergency vehicle priority system using matlab simulation		Traffic is the chief puzzle problem which every country faces because of the enhancement in number of vehicles throughout the world, especially in large urban towns. Hence the need arises for simulating and optimizing traffic control algorithms to better accommodate this increasing demand. Fuzzy optimization deals with finding the values of input parameters of a complex simulated system which result in desired output. This paper presents a MATLAB simulation of fuzzy logic traffic controller for controlling flow of traffic in isolated intersections. This controller is based on the waiting time and queue length of vehicles at present green phase and vehicles queue lengths at the other phases. The controller controls the traffic light timings and phase difference to ascertain sebaceous flow of traffic with least waiting time and queue length. In this paper, the isolated intersection model used consists of two alleyways in each approach. Every outlook has different value of queue length and waiting time, systematically, at the intersection. The maximum value of waiting time and vehicle queue length has to be selected by using proximity sensors as inputs to controller for the ameliorate control traffic flow at the intersection. An intelligent traffic model and fuzzy logic traffic controller are developed to evaluate the performance of traffic controller under different pre-defined conditions for oleaginous flow of traffic. Additionally, this fuzzy logic traffic controller has emergency vehicle siren sensors which detect emergency vehicle movement like ambulance, fire brigade, Police Van etc. and gives maximum priority to him and pass preferred signal to it.

95a0e2728310fc5ef9c172ad9c1de55db10672c1	synchronizing vehicles for multi-vehicle and one-cargo transportation		Abstract In ship manufacturing and big-size cargo transportation, several flat vehicles are usually cooperated to transport one big-size ship segment or cargo, namely “multi-vehicle and one-cargo transportation” (MVOC). It is distinctly different from general transportation scenarios where a vehicle is used to load and transport several cargos, namely “one-vehicle and multi-cargo transportation” (OVMC). The MVOC generates the difficulty in synchronizing several vehicles for transporting a cargo. A mathematical program that can be solved by existing mixed-integer linear program solver is formulated, by considering the synchronization constraint among the unit-load flat vehicles under the minimization of makespan. To improve the computation performance of the solution methods, a sequential insert algorithm is developed as the basic procedure for a greedy insert algorithm and as the decoding scheme of a proposed genetic algorithm. These three methods (the mathematical program, the greedy insert algorithm and the genetic algorithm) are compared by numerical studies considering the effects of instance scales and synchronization complexity on the optimality and computation performances. The genetic algorithm performed better for solving small- and medium-scale instances with lower complexity, and the greedy insert algorithm is very fast and suitable for solving large-scale and complex instances.

The contribution is twofold. Firstly, the selection criterion is the quality (minimal cost) in expectation of the solution found after a fixed amount of time, as opposed to the expected runtime. Secondly, the presented approach, based on supervised Machine Learning algorithms, considers the original description of the protein structure problem, as opposed to the features related to the SAT or CSP encoding of the problem.	algorithm;boolean satisfiability problem;constraint satisfaction;machine learning;protein structure prediction	Alejandro Arbelaez;Youssef Hamadi;Michèle Sebag	2010			mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics	AI	21.081397523108794	-7.191530252510186	63741

Firstly, where the unavailability information is available in advance (predictive) and, secondly, where the information is known after a real breakdown (reactive). We have shown that the revised schedule is mostly able to recover if the disruptions occur during the early stages of a schedule.	combinatorial optimization;downtime;genetic algorithm;hercules graphics card;javaserver pages;job scheduler;job shop scheduling;makespan;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;requirement;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);software release life cycle;unavailability	S.

Here a multi-item balanced transportation problem (MIBTP) is formulated where unit transportation costs are imprecise. Also available spaces and budgets at destinations are limited but imprecise. The objective is to find a shipment schedule for the items that minimizes the total cost subjected to imprecise warehouse and budget constraints at destinations. The proposed model is reduced to a multi-objective optimization problem using tolerances, then to a crisp single-objective one using fuzzy non-linear programming (FNLP) technique and Zimmermann's method. The above fuzzy MIBTP is also reduced to another form of deterministic one using modified sub-gradient method (MSM). These two crisp optimization problems are solved by Genetic Algorithm (GA). As an extension, fuzzy multi-item balanced solid transportation problems (STPs) with and without restrictions on some routes and items are formulated and reduced to deterministic ones following FNLP and Zimmermann's methods. These models are also solved by GA. Models are illustrated numerically, optimum results of fuzzy MIBTP from two deductions are compared. Results are also presented for different GA parameters.	transportation theory (mathematics)	Anupam Ojha;Barun Das;Shyamal Kumar Mondal;Manoranjan Maiti	2013	Appl.

It has been shown to be an e±cient approach for global optimization. Moreover, its application for solving Multi-objective Optimization (MOO) shows very promising results as well. In multi-objective context, a bounded archive is required to store the set of nondominated solutions. But, what is the best archiving strategy to use in order to maintain a bounded set with good characteristics is a critical issue that may lead to a questionable choice. In this work, the behavior of the developed multi-objective CS is studied under several archiving strategies. An extensive experimental study has been conducted using several test problems and two performance metrics related to convergence and diversity. A nonparametric test for statistical analysis is performed. In addition, we used a Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) for further analysis and comparison. The results revealed that archiving strategies play an important role as they can impact di®erently on the quality of obtained fronts depending on the problem's characteristics. Also, this study con ̄rms that the proposed MOCS algorithm is a very promising approach for MOPs compared to the widely used MOPSO.	algorithm;archive;cluster analysis;cuckoo search;experiment;global optimization;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;minimax;multi-objective optimization;nl (complexity);naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;numerical aperture;pareto efficiency;particle swarm optimization;process-centered design;program optimization;software performance testing;statistical model;system controller hub	Kamel Zeltni;Souham Meshoul	2016	International Journal of Computational Intelligence and Applications	10.1142/S1469026816500206	mathematical optimization;simulation;density estimation;swarm intelligence;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;cuckoo search	SE	23.96890151684896	-4.981014715034068	64013

The outcome of a GA is largely based on the choice of search operator, problem representation and tunable parameters (crossover and mutation rates, etc). In particular, given a problem representation the choice of search operator will determine, along with the fitness function, the structure of the landscape that the GA will search upon. Statistical and information theoretic measures have been proposed that aim to quantify properties (ruggedness, smoothness, etc) of this landscape. In this paper we concentrate on the utility of information theoretic measures to predict algorithm output for various instances of the capacitated and time-windowed vehicle routing problem.

2cd42fc5983544adcebe7d69aa03922766bb710e	a hybrid heuristic based on iterated local search for multivehicle inventory routing problem		We study a multivehicle inventory routing problem (MIRP) in which supplier delivers one type of product along a finite planning horizon, using a homogeneous fleet of vehicles. The main objective is to minimize the total cost of storage and transportation. In order to solve MIRP, we propose an algorithm based on iterated local search (ILS) metaheuristic, using a variable neighborhood descent with random neighborhood ordering (RVND) in the local search phase. Moreover, we combined this algorithm with an exact procedure based on mathematical programming to solve specifically the inventory management as a subproblem. To validate our approach, computational tests were performed on 560 benchmark instances, achieving very competitive results in comparison to the best known algorithms.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);heuristic;inventory;iterated function;iterated local search;iteration;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;routing	Edcarllos Santos;Luiz Satoru Ochi;Luidi Simonetti;Pedro Henrique González Silva	2016	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2016.03.026	mathematical optimization;simulation;mathematics	AI	16.632680591575866	1.7029978049278456	64132

The collaboration and real-time control of multiple radio frequency identification(RFID) in tracking patients and facilities in a hospital can dramatically improve hospital management. However, there are collisions occurring between readers which cause the faulty or missing reads in the network of RFID readers. Layout of the readers to reduce the total system transaction time or response time is known to be complex problem. In this research, a RFID network layout method is proposed which integrates genetic algorithms and binary particle swarm optimization. The proposed method is utilized to solve RFID network problems. Finally, a Client/Server model with 15 RFID readers is proposed and solved by GA-BPSO which minimizes the total transaction time.	genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;real-time transcription;response time (technology);software release life cycle;transaction time	Chui-Yu Chiu;Po-Chou Shih;I-Ting Kuo;Cheng-Hsin Ke	2014	Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE 18th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD)	10.1109/CSCWD.2014.6846913	simulation;operations research	Visualization	13.367375470983053	-1.4705906250753804	64280

A number of individuals (solutions) as sport teams compete in an artificial league for several weeks (iterations). Based on the league schedule in each week, teams play in pairs and their game outcome is determined in terms of win or loss, given known the playing strength (fitness value) along with the teams' intended formations. Modeling an artificial match analysis, each team devises a new formation/ playing strategy (a new solution) for the next week contest and this process is repeated for a number of seasons (stopping condition). Performance of the proposed algorithm is measured using test functions from a well-known benchmark commonly adopted to validate new constraint-handling techniques/ algorithms. Results obtained by the proposed approach are very competitive with respect to other comparator algorithms already developed for constrained optimization and testify that the new algorithm can be regarded as an efficient tool for optimization in the presence of constraints.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);comparator;constrained optimization;distribution (mathematics);dynamic energy budget;genetic algorithm;iteration;mathematical optimization;online and offline;penalty method	Ali Husseinzadeh Kashan;Behrooz Karimi	2010	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	10.1109/CEC.2010.5586364	mathematical optimization;constrained optimization;simulation;computer science;sport;mathematical model;operations research;seasonality;statistics	AI	21.485944089800388	-0.7329095613197444	64330

The problem has some features of the integrated production and distribution scheduling problem in that we seek to determine the fleet size and the trucks’ routes subject to a planning horizon constraint. In particular, this research differs because the product has a limited lifetime, the total demand must be satisfied within a planning horizon, multiple trucks can be used, and the production schedule and the distribution sequence are considered. A mixed integer programming model is formulated to solve the problem and, then, heuristics based on evolutionary algorithms are provided to resolve the models.	scheduling (computing)	Priyantha Devapriya;William G.

With the increasing complexity of fabrication techniques and scales, scheduling and control activities are inevitably confronted with each other and shall be integrated correspondingly. In particular scheduling and control are mutually dependent as control requires decisions from schedules, and scheduling should take control information into account. Based on a literature survey, we propose a general review and an outlook of the expected improvements related to binding scheduling decisions and information/constraints coming from Advanced Process Control systems in semiconductor manufacturing. Potential issues and tasks concerning this integration are addressed in this paper in order to stimulate more work in research and industrial practices.	advanced process control;microsoft outlook for mac;scheduling (computing);semiconductor device fabrication	Claude Yugma;Jakey Blue;Stéphane Dauzère-Pérès;Philippe Vialletelle	2014		10.1109/CoASE.2014.6899310	flow shop scheduling;dynamic priority scheduling;engineering;operations management;industrial engineering;genetic algorithm scheduling;two-level scheduling;scheduling;manufacturing engineering	Robotics	10.63679882677372	3.6204706988903625	64868

Several factors such as quadratic cost functions with valve point loading is considered in the computation models. The Fuzzy particle swarm optimization (FPSO) provides a new mechanism to avoid premature convergence problem with optimum solution. The proposed method has been applied to 3 and 40 generator power system whose cost functions are non-convex in nature.

Much of this research focuses on computing epidemic threshold tests, and in practice several different tests are often used interchangeably. We summarize recent literature that attempts to clarify the relationships among different threshold criteria, systematize the incorporation of population structure into a general infection framework, and discuss conditions under which interaction topology and infection characteristics can be decoupled in the computation of the basic reproductive ratio, R0. We then present methods for making predictions about disease spread when only partial information about the routes of transmission is available. These methods include approximation techniques and bounds obtained via spectral graph theory, and are applied to several data sets. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These constraints may result from factors such as practicality, safety and functionality of the design and/or limit on time and resources. In addition, for many design problems, each function evaluation may be a result of an expensive computational procedure (such as CFD, FEA etc.), which imposes a limitation on the number of function evaluations that can be carried out to find a near optimal solution. Consequently, there is a significant interest in the optimization community to develop efficient algorithms to deal with constraint optimization problems. In this paper, a new memetic algorithm is presented, which incorporates two mechanisms to expedite the convergence towards the optimum. First is the use of marginally infeasible solutions to intensify the search near constraint boundary, where optimum solution(s) are most likely to be found. Second is performing local search from promising solutions in order to inject good quality solutions in the population early during the search. The performance of the presented algorithm is demonstrated on a set of engineering design problems, using a low computation budget (1000 function evaluations).	computation;computational fluid dynamics;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);engineering design process;federal enterprise architecture;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;memetic algorithm;memetics;multi-objective optimization	Hemant Kumar Singh;Tapabrata Ray;Warren Smith	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-17432-2_43	optimization problem;mathematical optimization;engineering optimization;computer science;local search;machine learning;mathematics;algorithm;engineering design process;metaheuristic;memetic algorithm	AI	21.62511213001543	-3.176383172837342	65067

Hence, it is appropriate to locate such facilities so that the rate at which users are lost is limited. Each facility will here be modelled as an M/Er/m/N queueing system subject to a loss restriction constraint and the single-server case (m=1) will be treated in detail. Introduction of the Erlang distribution for service times allows a better fit of the model to actual values of both mean and variance than do currently available models that use an exponential distribution. Location of facilities will be such that the average travel time to a facility is minimized. It is shown how a deterministic constraint, equivalent to the loss constraint, can be generated resulting in an integer linear program, and values of a parameter ρc which facilitates this linearization are tabulated for various values of r, N and service level demanded. Numerical experiments are performed including an application loosely related to the location of neonatal clinics in the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro. Finally, there is a discussion of how further improved modelling of the service time distribution might be effected.	server (computing)	Brian Boffey;Roberto D. Galvão;V.

The proposal works towards keyword classification techniques to obtain the most valuable information via suitable content prefixes in ICN. In this study, we have achieved the intelligent function using Artificial Intelligence (AI) implementation. Particularly, to find the most suitable and promising intelligent approach for maintaining QoS matrices, we have evaluated various AI algorithms, including evolutionary algorithms (EA), swarm intelligence (SI), and machine learning (ML) by using the cost function to assess their classification performances. With the goal of enabling a complete ICN prefix classification solution, we also propose a hybrid implementation to optimize classification performances by integration of relevant AI algorithms. This hybrid mechanism searches for a final minimum structure to prevent the local optima from happening. By simulation, the evaluation results show that the proposal outperforms EA and ML in terms of network resource utilization and response delay for QoS performance optimization.	artificial intelligence;critical point (network science);evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;icn gps;local optimum;loss function;machine learning;mathematical optimization;network packet;performance;premature convergence;programming paradigm;quality of service;rl (complexity);simulated annealing;simulation;software release life cycle;swarm intelligence	Cutifa Safitri;Yoshihide Yamada;Sabariah Baharun;Shidrokh Goudarzi;Quang Ngoc Nguyen;Keping Yu;Takuro Sato	2018	Future Internet	10.3390/fi10040033	computer science;computer network;swarm intelligence;local optimum;evolutionary algorithm;performance improvement;quality of service;information-centric networking;machine learning;response delay;prefix;artificial intelligence	AI	22.010969817791093	-2.5203630411337157	65852
7baa655a0661d0d7710548db2a92e3bd3b3bafa8	trafforithm: a traffic-aware shortest path algorithm in real road networks with traffic influence factors		The shortest path computation between two given locations in a road network is an important problem that finds applications in a wide range of fields. There has been a lot of research efforts targeting at the preciseness and performance of finding shortest paths in road networks. However, rarely of them have really taken into account the influence of traffic factors such as traffic lights, road conditions, traffic jams and turning cost. In other words, existing approaches are rather purely based on the topology of the network, but forgot that there are multiple factors in a real road network that impact the accuracy of the algorithm. The contribution of our paper is twofold. First, we present a generic two-layered framework for moving objects in road networks environment and demonstrate the important role of traffic factors on path finding and route planning. Second, we develop an efficient parallel shortest path algorithm in road networks with the consideration of traffic influence factors. Detailed analysis presented shows that our parallel TRAFFic-aware shortest path algORITHM (Trafforithm), is accurate and practical.	computation;dijkstra's algorithm;experiment;pathfinding;shortest path problem	Lin Qi;Markus Schneider	2015	2015 1st International Conference on Geographical Information Systems Theory, Applications and Management (GISTAM)		canadian traveller problem;floating car data;constrained shortest path first;average path length;computer science;pathfinding;machine learning;distributed computing;transport engineering;shortest path problem;k shortest path routing	DB	12.098516927428662	-8.258688976526877	65957

This paper presents a new hybrid technique for modeling and solving RPP problem taking into account the static voltage stability constraint. First, the uncertain fuzzy clustering theory is employed to select new candidate VAr source locations. Then, modified gray code is applied and used to represent a series of nonuniform VAr capacity intervals at different candidate buses. Based on the new ordering of the VAr capacity intervals, a simplified piecewise linear function between the total transfer capability and new VAr capacity is derived and applied as static voltage stability constraint in RPP problem. Last, the RPP optimization problem is solved by a self adaptive fuzzy chaotic interactive honey bee mating optimization (FCIHBMO) technique taking advantage of the modified gray code.

This paper presents an improved bee colony optimisation algorithm with Big Valley landscape exploitation (BCBV) as a biologically inspired algorithm to solve the JSSP problem. The BCBV algorithm mimics the bee foraging behaviour where information of newly discovered food source is communicated via waggle dances. In the algorithm, the dances are treated as clusters of solutions to the JSSP. These clusters of solutions are distributed as a Big Valley landscape structure. Via a dance accumulation strategy as well as an effective search in multiple clusters in the entire landscape, the proposed algorithm is able to generate relatively good solutions for the JSSP. Experimental results comparing our proposed algorithm with the shifting bottleneck heuristic (SBP), the tabu search algorithm (TS) and the parameter-free genetic algorithm (PfGA) on the Taillard JSSP benchmark show that it is comparable to these approaches.	algorithm;job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;scheduling (computing)	Li-Pei Wong;Chi Yung Puan;Malcolm Yoke-Hean Low;Yi Wen Wong;Chin Soon Chong	2010	IJBIC	10.1504/IJBIC.2010.032125	job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;artificial bee colony algorithm	ML	22.05473590258179	-0.48271257727967104	66451
5737f4cdaf693c5db976813ce36a83cbf7abaea3	improving the efficiency of evolutionary algorithms for large-scale optimization with multi-fidelity models		Large scale optimization problems are often with complex systems and large solution space, which significantly increase their computing cost. The idea of ordinal transformation (OT) is proposed in the method MO2TOS which can improve the efficiency of solving optimization problems with limited scale solution space by using multi-fidelity models. In this paper, we integrate OT with evolutionary algorithms to speed up the solving of large-scale problems. Evolutionary algorithms are employed to search the solutions of low-fidelity model from a large solution space and provide a good direction to the OT procedure. Meanwhile, evolutionary algorithms need to determine how to select solutions from multi-fidelity models after the OT procedure to update the next generation. We theoretically show the improvement by using multi-fidelity models and employ genetic algorithm (GA) as an example to exhibit the detailed implementation procedure.

This paper presents multi-objectivization of the short-term unit commitment problem in uncertain environment by considering reliability as an additional objective along with the economic objective. The uncertainties occurring due to unit outage and load forecast error are incorporated using loss of load probability (LOLP) and expected unserved energy (EUE) reliability indices. The multi-objectivized unit commitment problem in uncertain environment is solved using our earlier proposed multi-objective evolutionary algorithm [1]. Simulations are performed on a test system of 26 thermal generating units and the results obtained are benchmarked against the study [2] where the unit commitment problem was solved as a reliability-constrained single-objective optimization problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multi-objectivized approach can find solutions with considerably lower cost than those obtained in the benchmark. Further, the efficiency and consistency of the proposed algorithm for multi-objectivized unit commitment problem is demonstrated by quantitative performance assessment using hypervolume indicator.	benchmark (computing);computer simulation;downtime;evolutionary algorithm;load profile;mathematical optimization;optimization problem	Anupam Trivedi;Deepak Sharma;Dipti Srinivasan	2012	2012 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	10.1109/CEC.2012.6256148	database index;mathematical optimization;uncertainty;computer science;multi-objective optimization;power system simulation;reliability;statistics;evolutionary computation	Robotics	15.660701238366446	-2.8772100264655416	66661

With the purpose of understanding different levels of instance difficulties, instances for the current State of the Art heuristic TSP solvers LKH+restart and EAX+restart are presented which are evolved using a sophisticated evolutionary algorithm. More specifically, the performance differences of the respective solvers are maximized resulting in instances which are easier to solve for one solver and much more difficult for the other. Focusing on both optimization directions, instance features are identified which characterize both types of instances and increase the understanding of solver performance differences.	artificial intelligence;computation;evolutionary algorithm;fitness function;heuristic;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;solver;travelling salesman problem;x86	Marco Maratea	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-49130-1	computer science;artificial intelligence	AI	23.82694839875805	-0.5118644586879717	66683

The tracking portfolio is expected to replicate the performance of a benchmark index return with a part of its component stocks while reducing the cost of transaction by limiting the number of rebalancing and unnecessary investment on less influential component stocks. The mathematical model being proposed is based on a hybrid genetic algorithm with a self-adaptive evolving mechanism. In order to enhance ndex tracking enetic algorithm areto efficiency oal programming the model efficiency, we optimize the original genetic algorithm by applying Pareto efficiency as utility measure and goal programming for the inevitable conflicts of multiple objectives/interests. The proposed approach provides a comprehensive solution to index tracking problem by considering as many practical issues as possible. The constructed portfolio has a satisfactory performance on experiments based on CSI300, FTSE100 and HSI data. The proposed formulation of index tracking is therefore believed to be a good alternative to many current techniques.	benchmark (computing);experiment;genetic algorithm;goal programming;heuristic;horizontal situation indicator;mathematical model;memetic algorithm;pareto efficiency;self-replicating machine	He Ni;Yongqiao Wang	2013	Appl.

51dec9b367dd803faba7cfda2a72f40531acf741	a tangible collaborative decision support system for various variants of the vehicle routing problem		The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem where a number of customers must be served with a fleet of vehicles. The classical variation of the VRP is the Capacicated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with the additional constraint that each vehicle must have uniform capacity. Many Decision Support Systems (DSS) have been implemented to solve real life problems of the VRP and its’ variants, but they do not allow multiple decision makers to explore several scenarios of a given problem simultaneously and collaborate with each other in order to find the best possible solution. In this paper, we extend our previous work [35] and incorporate in our spatial DSS four variants of the CVRP: (i) Distance Constrained Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP), (ii) Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), (iii) Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls (VRPB), and (iv) Vehicle Routing Problem With Pickup and Delivery (VRPPD). This extension allows decision makers to solve specific routing problems according to their needs. The proposed collaborative spatial DSS allows two decision makers to collaborate with each other in order to find the best possible solution through a tangible interface. The locations are added through interactive Google Maps and other parameters through user-friendly forms that can be manipulated via tangible interfaces. The proposed DSS has been implemented using Java, TUIO protocol, jsprit, and Google Maps.	decision support system;vehicle routing problem	Nikolaos Ploskas;Ioannis Athanasiadis;Jason Papathanasiou;Nikolaos Samaras	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-18533-0_7	operations management;transport engineering	ECom	16.250701832935484	0.8036103830035245	67597

Two approximate algorithms based on the local search and tabu search principles are adopted to solve the problem. Numerical results show that """"good"""" solutions are found with the proposed heuristics. Results demonstrate that the local search algorithm produces solutions that are, on average, at 4.98% of the optimal solution, and in the worst case at 11.31% of the optimal solution. Better solutions are obtained using the tabu search algorithm. Indeed, tabu search is able to provide solutions with an average gap of 2.82% and a maximum gap of 7.51% from the optimal solution."""	approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;heuristic (computer science);local search (optimization);mathematical model;numerical method;search algorithm;tabu search	Mohammad Reza Pasandideh;Marc St-Hilaire	2013	Computers & OR	10.1016/j.cor.2013.02.017	mathematical optimization;network planning and design;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;heuristics;customised applications for mobile networks enhanced logic;computer network	AI	17.46863495131274	1.9377687943813073	67750

However, due to the increasing number of vehicles and the high dynamic of the traffic network, conventional traffic signal timing methods does not result in an efficient control. One alternative is to let traffic signal controllers learn how to adjust the lights based on the traffic situation. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-objective traffic light control system that is based on an Intelligent Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) method. We take the average junction waiting time and the flow rate of vehicles on the congested road as two objectives. In the proposed method, we granted the ability of selecting appropriate MOPSO parameters to each agent of the swarm via a novel multi-objective Q-Learning approach. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed system.	control system;mathematical optimization;network congestion;particle swarm optimization;q-learning;simulation	Chaimae El Hatri;Jaouad Boumhidi	2016	2016 4th IEEE International Colloquium on Information Science and Technology (CiSt)	10.1109/CIST.2016.7804996	control engineering;multi-swarm optimization;simulation;engineering;transport engineering	Robotics	11.781107607040044	-9.051845382592697	67832

In DOPs, at least one part of the problem changes as time passes. These changes may affect the objective function(s) and/or constraint(s). In this paper, we propose and define a novel type of DOP in which dimensions change as time passes. It is called DOP with variable dimensions (DOPVD). We also propose a mask detection procedure to help algorithms in solving single objective unconstrained DOPVDs. This procedure is used to try to detect ineffective and effective dimensions while solving DOPVDs. In this paper, this procedure is added to Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to be tested. The results in this paper demonstrate that GAs which use the mask detection procedure outperform GA without it especially Periodic GA 5 (PerGA5).	genetic algorithm;loss function;mathematical optimization;software release life cycle	Josef Kittler	2012		10.1007/978-3-319-13563-2	data science;computer science;machine learning;artificial intelligence;knowledge extraction;information system	AI	23.91219000874934	-1.7217663209404277	67910

An overview of the current status in 3D printing in the electronics packaging sector is provided. Subsequently, a surrogate modelling approach for correlating thermomechanical stresses within a package to a number of design parameters is presented. This approach enables the design of a package to be considered in a more insightful manner and can additionally be integrated into condition based monitoring tools capable of enhancing product robustness. An overview of an advanced electronics packaging system capable of 3D printing electronics packages is presented. The system combines inkjet printing and curing of multiple materials, including conductive silver inks, with precision component placement, multi-material dispensing and 3D inspection systems to provide a highly flexible solution for rapid manufacture of electronics packages. Test structures manufactured using the system were subjected to a vigorous set of reliability tests. Details of the test regime and related results are presented. All tests were passed, indicating the robustness of the described manufacturing process. The key originality of the work is that it provides a comprehensive overview of the journey from design assessment an optimisation, through the manufacturing process and on to reliability testing. Areas of novelty in this work are associated with the development of fast, accurate surrogate models able to predict key reliability factors in response to a range of design parameters and insight into the development of a 3D manufacturing system for electronics packaging.	3d printing;printed electronics	Tim Tilford;Stoyan Stoyanov;Jessica B.

Besides, the time-criticality of emergencies also requires an efficient computation method, and how to efficiently optimize crowd guidance considering the social bond effect is then identified as a problem to be addressed. By extending the egress model of Wang et al., 2008, this paper parameterizes the relation between the social bond of evacuees and the blocking event in egress. The optimization problem is then formulated to optimize crowd guidance with such advance of modeling. To efficiently optimize the guidance, our original computation method is improved in several aspects: reducing decision variables by infrequent update of guidance, reducing the decision space based on the prior information on the building layout, and approximating the state transition probability by discretizing probability measures. An example in the literature is tested to demonstrate improvement on our modeling and methods.	blocking (computing);computation;criticality matrix;egress filtering;markov chain;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;real-time clock;state transition table;time complexity;wang and landau algorithm	Peter B.

94b6086856699c4302106acef15b637f45459919	from genetic to bacteriological algorithms for mutation-based testing	mutation analysis;genetics;optimization problem;software component;evolutionist algorithms;automatic test generation;genetic algorithm;object oriented testing	SUMMARY The level of confidence in a software component is often linked to the quality of its test cases. This quality can in turn be evaluated with mutation analysis: faults are injected into the software component (making mutants of it) to check the proportion of mutants detected (‘killed’) by the test cases. But while the generation of a set of basic test cases is easy, improving its quality may require prohibitive effort. This paper focuses on the issue of automating the test optimization. The application of genetic algorithms would appear to be an interesting way of tackling it. The optimization problem is modelled as follows: a test case can be considered as a predator while a mutant program is analogous to a prey. The aim of the selection process is to generate test cases able to kill as many mutants as possible, starting from an initial set of predators, which is the test cases set provided by the programmer. To overcome disappointing experimentation results, on .Net components and unit Eiffel classes, a slight variation on this idea is studied, no longer at the ‘animal’ level (lions killing zebras, say) but at the bacteriological level. The bacteriological level indeed better reflects the test case optimization issue: it mainly differs from the genetic one by the introduction of a memorization function and the suppression of the crossover operator. The purpose of this paper is to explain how the genetic algorithms have been adapted to fit with the issue of test optimization. The resulting algorithm differs so much from genetic algorithms that it has been given another name: bacteriological algorithm.

The main objective of this paper is to show that the above assumption is frequently false. Therefore, the examples of evolutionary methods that use problem encoding which allows for significant optimization of the fitness computation process are pointed out and analyzed. The definition of Problem Encoding Allowing Cheap Fitness Computation of Mutated Individuals (PEACh) is proposed. Another objective of the paper is to start a discussion concerning the computation load measurement in the evolutionary computation field. As shown, the Fitness Function Evaluation number is not always a fair measure and may be significantly affected by the quality of method implementation.	class implementation file;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary computation;fitness function;mathematical optimization	Michal Witold Przewozniczek	2017	2017 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2017.7969328	machine learning;interactive evolutionary computation;mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;fitness approximation;evolutionary algorithm;human-based evolutionary computation;learnable evolution model;fitness function;mathematics;model of computation;evolutionary robotics	Theory	23.949451905686598	-6.940687312034971	68751

In particular, we focus on the journey optimization sub-problem, considering sequences of trips from a user’s appointment to another one. Solutions provide the best alternatives in terms of time and energy consumption, including route sequences and possible charging events.	constraint logic programming;declarative programming;mathematical optimization;real life;semantics (computer science)	Giacoma Valentina Monreale;Ugo Montanari;Nicklas Hoch	2012	CoRR		constraint logic programming;concurrent constraint logic programming;constraint programming;real-time computing;simulation;constraint satisfaction;artificial intelligence	AI	14.834183622068215	0.3198545797174033	68782
69919ac72ae1ceadd544129116cc309ae026d3cd	integrated optimization and simulation models for the locomotive refueling system configuration problem		This paper introduces the locomotive refueling system configuration problem, which arises when railroad companies aim to improve efficiency in refueling yards through new technologies or policies. Refueling speed is important to freight railroad operational efficiency; faster refueling can increase rail network capacity without the infrastructure cost associated with new terminals or tracks. We propose a method that integrates integer programming and discrete event simulation to inform these decisions, and we demonstrate the method on data derived from industry. Specifically, the models determine the best location (denoted the “strike line”) to align trains at the refueling platform and measure the impact on refueling yard throughput associated with adopting the optimal strike lines in combination with new refueling equipment. Results using realistic parameters demonstrate a statistically significant improvement over intuitive policies.	align (company);integer programming;mathematical optimization;simulation;system configuration;throughput	Lucas Verschelden;Jessica L.

459ffb10372977d71c8cc3e2ae26f1ed5590df6d	two-echelon logistics distribution routing optimization problem based on colliding bodies optimization with cue ball		Two-echelon logistics distribution routing problem is an important optimization problem of the logistics distribution networks. It is composed of distribution center location problem and distribution routing problem. Distribution center location problem aims to find the best locations of distribution centers from all the distribution points. Meanwhile, the distribution center needs to be assigned to serve the distribution points. The goal of distribution routing problem is to decrease the total cost of delivery. In this paper, an improved version, colliding bodies optimization with cue ball (CBCBO), is proposed to tackle two-echelon logistics distribution routing problem. The new algorithm improves the lack of the colliding bodies optimization (CBO) algorithm which the number of populations must be even. The new approach based cue ball enhanced exploration ability. A strategy, elite opposition strategy, is used to promote exploitation ability. In the last, the effectiveness of the new algorithm is tested by simulation experiment. The proposed approach demonstrates its capability to optimize two-echelon logistics distribution routing problem.	logistics;optimization problem;program optimization;routing;row echelon form	Xiaopeng Wu;Yongquan Zhou;Mengyi Lei;Pengchuan Wang;Yanbiao Niu	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-95930-6_82	mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;total cost;distribution center;optimization problem	EDA	18.026852850481987	1.3282665415943278	68909

Yet, little research has been done that explores the design of delivery networks and accounts for these time-definite services. In this paper, we explore such design problems for networks with a specified number of edges B > n − 1. We present a two-phase heuristic solution approach that first constructs a network and then improves the network via local search. For the improvement phase, we extend neighborhood structures that have proven effective for tree-structured solutions and also identify a new search neighborhood that takes advantage of specific features of subgraph solutions. We present a computational analysis of our solution approach as well as managerial insights.	heuristic;local search (optimization);two-phase locking	Hui Chen;Ann Melissa Campbell;Barrett W.

Remanufactured products have proven to be high quality and low cost. Due to their unique characteristics, remanufacturing processes have many differences compared to manufacturing processes. These characteristics, which make remanufacturing complex, require good performance from Production Planning and Control (PPC) activities. The goal of the paper is to propose a mathematical model for disassembly master production scheduling considering stochastic routings in the remanufacturing environment. The proposed model is based on stochastic dynamic programming and it is applied to a real case of automotive clutch remanufacturing. The results contribute to the development of theory and practice by filling a gap in knowledge of the use of PPC systems, developing a mathematical method that can be easily implemented in a spreadsheet. The findings also show some decisions that are counterintuitive. For example, in some situations disassemble more products than necessary to meet the demand can result in a lower expected total cost.	disassembler;scheduling (computing)	Muris Lage Junior;Moacir Godinho Filho	2017	CEJOR	10.1007/s10100-015-0428-1	operations management	Robotics	10.147068647210567	1.845584180313363	69055

It introduces a novel cuckoo search (CS)-based approach to optimize the objective function which combines the minimization of the makespan and the project cost. The proposed approach takes the priority coding scheme to code for each job, and adopts the serial schedule generation scheme to sequentially allocate the start time and resources for one job with highest priority at a time. To match the discrete nature of the solution, the Lévy flight operator of CS algorithm, which is originally suitable for continuous variable, has been modified. The CS-based approach has been implemented by using MATLAB R2010b and tested by a project taken from the literature, which contains 18 jobs and 6 multi-skilled workers. The results yielded by the CS-based approach have been found to significantly outperform genetic algorithm. This demonstrates that the cuckoo search algorithm based approach is suitable for scheduling the complicated resource constrained project with multi-skilled workforces.	cuckoo search;genetic algorithm;job stream;loss function;lévy flight;matlab;makespan;optimization problem;scheduling (computing);search algorithm;software industry	Hui Nie;Bo Liu;Pumo Xie;Zhenbing Liu;Huihua Yang	2014	JNW	10.4304/jnw.9.5.1346-1353	real-time computing;simulation;dynamic priority scheduling	AI	20.37900000928682	-0.6162219107055981	69062

An operation schedule for berth and quay cranes can significantly affect turnaround time of ships, which is an important objective of all schedules in a port. This paper addresses the problem of determining the berthing position and time of each ship as well as the number of quay cranes assigned to each ship. The objective of the problem is to minimize the sum of the handling time, waiting time and the delay time for every ship. We introduce a formulation for the simultaneous berth and quay crane scheduling problem. Next, we combine genetic algorithm with heuristic to find an approximate solution for the problem.

We propose a two-stage stochastic programming formulation where design decisions make up the first stage, while a series of recourse decisions are made in the second stage to distribute the commodities according to observed demands. The overall objective is to optimize the cost of the first-stage design decisions plus the total expected distribution cost incurred in the second stage. To solve this formulation, we propose a metaheuristic framework inspired by the progressive hedging algorithm of Rockafellar and Wets. Following this strategy, scenario decomposition is used to separate the stochastic problem following the possible outcomes, or scenarios, of the random event. Each scenario subproblem then becomes a deterministic CMND problem to be solved. Our progressive hedging strategy takes advantage of specialized methods to solve effectively deterministic CMND problems. We also propose and compare different strategies aimed at penalizing non-consensus amongst scenario subproblems to approximate the global design. These strategies are then embedded into a parallel solution method, which is numerically qualified on a set of problem instances that also provide the means to examine the effects of demand correlations on the behavior of the proposed algorithm.	approximation algorithm;cplex;embedded system;heuristic;metaheuristic;network planning and design;numerical analysis;queueing theory;recursion;stochastic programming	Teodor Gabriel Crainic;Xiaorui Fu;Michel Gendreau;Walter Rei;Stein W.

The implementation of DAM algorithms leads to additional movements of ambulance vehicles compared to the reactive paradigm, where ambulances depart from the base station when an incident is reported. In practice, proactive relocations are only acceptable when the number of additional movements is limited. Motivated by this trade-off, we study the effect of the number of relocations on the response-time performance. We formulate the relocations from one configuration to a target configuration by the Linear Bottleneck Assignment Problem, so as to provide the quickest way to transition to the target configuration. Moreover, the performance is measured by a general penalty function, assigning to each possible response time a certain penalty. We extensively validate the effectiveness of relocations for a wide variety of realistic scenarios, including a day and night scenario in a critically and realistically loaded system. The results consistently show that already a small number of relocations lead to near-optimal performance, which is important for the implementation of DAM algorithms in practice.

Designing an optimized supply chain can support the corresponding processes to integrate the resources. However, one of the most important obstacles is the resource limitation. Recycling the second-hand products is one of the approaches to cope with this issue. Reverse logistics is a system of collecting products from end-users to the manufacturing centers for obtaining values from collected materials. In this research, the collection and distribution process of engine oil, which is derived from one of the most valuable natural resources, is considered. A mixed-integer linear programming model for a closed-loop supply chain of used engine oil is proposed and a case study of an oil refinery company is proposed to explore the applicability of the model. Due to uncertainty in the amounts of collected oil in the engine oil reverse logistics, the robust optimization approach is chosen to deal with uncertainty. Two objective functions of maximizing profit and minimizing the risk of the collection are considered. To solve the bi-objective model, augmented e-constraint approach is utilized. The results depict the merit of the current research.

Up to now, the NEH algorithm is the best heuristic approach to solve FSP. However, in large-scale problems, it takes quite long time for the NEH algorithm to find an approximate optimal solution. In this paper, two new techniques are proposed to improve the NEH algorithm. Firstly, to reduce the running time, block properties are developed and introduced to NEH algorithm. Secondly, to obtain solutions with smaller makespan, tie-break rules are applied. Simulation results show that these two techniques perform well in improving the NEH algorithm.

A mixed-integer programming model and a heuristic-based solution method are proposed for preparing the shipment plan.

b2c079e2db718bf01bc0f74d93b1a1dee8e7eedf	a learning-guided multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for constrained portfolio optimization		Portfolio optimization involves the optimal assignment of limited capital to different available financial assets to achieve a reasonable trade-off between profit and risk objectives. In this paper, we studied the extended Markowitz’s mean-variance portfolio optimization model. We considered the cardinality, quantity, pre-assignment and round lot constraints in the extended model. These four real-world constraints limit the number of assets in a portfolio, restrict the minimum and maximum proportions of assets held in the portfolio, require some specific assets to be included in the portfolio and require to invest the assets in units of a certain size respectively. An efficient learning-guided hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve the constrained portfolio optimization problem in the extended mean-variance framework. A learning-guided solution generation strategy is incorporated into the multi-objective optimization process to promote the efficient convergence by guiding the evolutionary search towards the promising regions of the search space. The proposed algorithm is compared against four existing stateof-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II), Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA-2), Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm (PESA-II) and Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES). Computational results are reported for publicly available OR-library datasets from seven market indices involving up to 1318 assets. Experimental results on the constrained portfolio optimization problem demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the four well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with respect to the quality of obtained efficient frontier in the conducted experiments. © 2014 The Authors.

Because of their utility-independent nature, these complementary and conflicting objectives are represented by a multiplicative total utility function model, based on multi-attribute utility theory. In addition to theoretic foundations, this paper also present a hybrid evolutionary algorithm based technique to solve the sensor placement problem. It includes specialized operators for hybridization, which are problem-specific heuristics for initial population generation, intelligent variation operators which comprise problem specific knowledge, and a local search phase. The experimental study validates finding the optimal balance among the visibility, the stealth and the cost related objectives.	computation;computer vision;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;function model;global positioning system;heuristic (computer science);local search (optimization);robotics;sensor;stealth;theory;utility	Haluk Topcuoglu;Murat Ermis;Mesut Sifyan	2009	2009 Ninth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications	10.1109/ISDA.2009.127	orbital hybridisation;mathematical optimization;simulation;genetic algorithm;computer science;artificial intelligence;local search;machine learning;g factor;mathematical model;mathematics;permeability;utility;statistics;evolutionary computation	Robotics	13.823319731234918	-7.9374056890225555	70101

The proposed technique aims to divide the initial problem into a number of easier subproblems, which can then be solved either independently or in sequence respecting the constraints between them. Finally, partial subproblems solutions are recomposed into a solution of the original problem. Our results focus on the COST-259 MI-FAP instances, for which some good assignments produced by local search meta-heuristics are widely available. However, standard implementations do not usually produce the best performance and, in particular, no good results have been previously obtained using evolutionary techniques. We show that problem decomposition can improve standard heuristics, both in terms of solution quality and runtime. Furthermore, genetic algorithms seem to benefit more from this approach, showing a higher percentage improvement, therefore reducing the gap with other local search methods.	assignment problem;face animation parameter;genetic algorithm;heuristic (computer science);interference (communication);local search (optimization)	Gualtiero Colombo;Stuart M.

The specific interest lies in determining the relative contribution of diversity and aging heuristics to the maintenance of the Pareto archive. Pareto archiving, in turn, is responsible for targeting data (and therefore champion individuals) as appropriate for retention beyond the limiting scope of the sliding window interface to the data stream. Fitness sharing alone is considered most effective under a non-stationary stream characterized by continuous (incremental) changes. Fitness sharing with an aging heuristic acts as the preferred heuristic when the stream is characterized by non-stationary stepwise changes.	archive;concept drift;genetic programming;heuristic (computer science);pareto efficiency;stationary process;stepwise regression	Aaron Atwater;Malcolm I.

This uncertainty can be addressed by coupling simulation models with multi-objective optimisation algorithms driven by stochastically generated hydrological timeseries but the computational effort required imposes barriers to the exploration of the solution space. The paper addresses this by (a) employing a parsimonious multi-objective parameterization-simulation-optimization (PSO) framework, which incorporates hydrological uncertainty through stochastic simulation and allows the use of probabilistic objective functions and (b) by investigating the potential of multi-objective surrogate based optimisation (MOSBO) to significantly reduce the resulting computational effort. Three MOSBO algorithms are compared against two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Results suggest that MOSBOs are indeed able to provide robust, uncertainty-aware operation rules much faster, without significant loss of neither the generality of evolutionary algorithms nor of the knowledge embedded in domain-specific models.

However, it sometimes costs seriously to compute the Fréchet distance while making correspondences to on a path on the graph in the order from the beginning of the trajectory as a naive method (as the definition) since it often occurs to backtrack and recompute. We developed an incremental technique for updating the Fréchet distance between the trajectory and a path to overcome the problem stated above. It enables the proposed algorithm to evaluate distances for any candidate paths faster than the naive one. In addition, we can adopt Dijkstra's graph searching manner due to the technique and omit to search and evaluate some useless candidates which have no relations with the solution. That also contributes to accelerate the algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm was more than fifty times faster than the algorithm of Alt (J. Algorithms 2003), which is formulated as a optimization problem repeating to solve decision problems with a binary search on a set of candidates of the Fréchet distance.	backtrack;binary search algorithm;decision problem;fréchet distance;mathematical optimization;optimization problem	Junichi Shigezumi;Tatsuya Asai;Hiroaki Morikawa;Hiroya Inakoshi	2015		10.1145/2835185.2835186	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;machine learning;mathematics	AI	15.057117360453432	-8.186447982841516	70731
df1f0571e186198b2fb1ccb3ff6223fb5a42a5c5	an efficient differential evolution algorithm for solving 0–1 knapsack problems		The traditional differential evolution algorithm was originally, and still is mainly, used to solve continuous optimization problems. As a result, it has not commonly been considered as applicable for several real-world problems in the permutation-based domain. In this paper, a novel differential evolution algorithm, which incorporates several effective components, is introduced. These components increase search effectiveness by providing a good balance between exploration (discovering new solutions) and exploitation (further exploring current solutions) processes. Moreover, a dual representation of solutions, which has the capability to allow normal continuous handling of variables by differential evolution operators, and at same time provide binary variables for fitness measurement, is employed. To judge the performance of the proposed algorithm, 14 instances of 0–1 knapsack problems have been solved and the results have been compared with those obtained from 11 state-of-the-art algorithms. Results show that the proposed algorithm was able to outperform other algorithms in solving small and medium sized knapsack problems and is competitive in large-sized problems.	algorithm;continuous optimization;differential evolution;exploit (computer security);knapsack problem;mathematical optimization;process (computing)	Ismail M.

Early research efforts, however, are devoted to study them separately. This paper investigates the integration of the two problems focusing on the unloading process in an automated container terminal, where all or part of the equipment are built in automation. We formulate the integrated problem as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model to minimise ship’s berth time. We determine the detailed schedules for all vehicles to be used during the unloading process and the storage location to be assigned for all containers. A series of experiments are carried out for small-sized problems by using commercial software. A genetic algorithm (GA) is designed for solving large-sized problems. The solutions from the GA for the small-sized problems are compared with the optimal solutions obtained from the commercial software to verify the effectiveness of the GA. The computational results show that the model and solution methods proposed in this paper are efficient in solving the integrated unloading problem for the automated container terminal.

30bdc577d4e058fd115d44d6665c636e64b92a38	a preliminary study on designing a benchmark problem for analysis of sparsely-synchronized heterogeneous coevolution		Cooperative coevolution evolutionary algorithms (CCEAs) that divide a target problem into subproblems and optimize them using multiple component solvers have attracted attention in recent years because they solve large-scale optimization problems. On the other hand, sparsely-synchronized heterogeneous coevolution (SSHC) which solves subproblems with different characteristics has also been proposed and expected to optimize various problem combinations that have not been solved simultaneously so far. SSHC simultaneously optimizes subproblems that depend on each other, and sometimes requires different types of component optimizers due to the difference in their properties, solution structures, etc. Unlike general CCEAs, SSHC algorithms cannot dynamically change problem decomposition way during optimization. Then, there is concern that inter-subproblem dependency deeply affects SSHC performance. In general, benchmark problems are indispensable to investigate algorithm dynamics and behavior. However, no benchmark problems for cooperative coevolution in continuous domain that allow changing dependency strength have been proposed so far. Therefore, this paper attempts to design a benchmark problem named Continuous NK Landscape for Cooperative Coevolution (CNKLcc), which allows arbitrarily changing inter-and intra-subproblem dependencies. A Continuous NK landscape problem is employed to design CNKLcc so that both dependency type and strength between subproblems can be controlled. This paper also analyzes SSHC performance using CNKLcc to verify the effectiveness of their parameter adjustment. Experimental results showed that the performance of SSHC algorithms would be improved by devising appropriate collaboration model as with general CCEAs.	benchmark (computing);cooperative coevolution;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;global optimization;linkage (software);mathematical optimization;synchronization (computer science)	Jun-ichi Matsuoka;Yuki Nakashima;Satoshi Ono	2017	2017 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)	10.1109/SSCI.2017.8285405	cooperative coevolution;mathematical optimization;evolutionary algorithm;coevolution;computer science;optimization problem	AI	23.997525434100787	-4.3964724826362165	71297

As energy demands are mostly met by fossil fuels, the world-wide consciousness grows about their negative impact on the environment. Therefore, it becomes necessary to design sustainable energy systems by introducing renewable energies. Because of the intermittent availability of different renewable resources, the designing of a sustainable energy system should find an optimal mix of different resources. However, the optimization of this combination has to deal with a number of possibly contradictory objectives. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) are widely used to solve this kind of problems. As optimizing an energy system by using a MOEA is computationally costly, it is necessary to solve the problem efficiently. For this purpose, we propose the incorporation of domain knowledge related to energy systems into different phases (i.e., initialization and mutation) of a MOEA run. The proposed approaches are implemented for two widely used MOEAs and evaluated on the Danish Aalborg test problem. The experimental results show that each approach individually achieves significant improvements of the energy systems, which is expressed in better trade-off sets. Moreover, a state-of-theart stopping criterion is adapted to detect the convergence in order to save ∗Corresponding author Email addresses: mahbub@fbk.eu (Md Shahriar Mahbub), markus.wagner@adelaide.edu.au (Markus Wagner), crema@fbk.eu (Luigi Crema) Preprint submitted to Applied Soft Computing May 17, 2016 computational resources.

Here we investigate the role of process-symmetry in CAs that solve the DCT, in particular the idea of conceptual similarity, which defines a novel search space for CA rules. We report on two new process-symmetric onedimensional rules for the DCT which have the highest “balanced” performance observed to date on this task, as well as the highest-performing CA known to perform the DCT in two dimensions. Finally, we investigate the more general problem of assessing how different learning strategies (based on evolution and coevolution, with and without spatial distribution), previously compared by [2], are suited to exploit conceptual structure in learning CAs to perform collective computation.	automata theory;cellular automaton;computation;discrete cosine transform;evolutionary algorithm;gnu nano;majority problem (cellular automaton);occam's razor;performance	Manuel Marques-Pita;Melanie Mitchell;Luis Mateus Rocha	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-85194-3_13	artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics	ML	24.27423727663053	-9.660733034351457	71667
faa8cc62acaec97716550a50a28db6ff154cbece	designing fair, efficient, and interpretable policies for prioritizing homeless youth for housing resources		We consider the problem of designing fair, efficient, and interpretable policies for prioritizing heterogeneous homeless youth on a waiting list for scarce housing resources of different types. We focus on point-based policies that use features of the housing resources (e.g., permanent supportive housing, rapid rehousing) and the youth (e.g., age, history of substance use) to maximize the probability that the youth will have a safe and stable exit from the housing program. The policies can be used to prioritize waitlisted youth each time a housing resource is procured. Rather than focusing on a specific policy structure and fairness criteria, our framework provides the policy-maker the flexibility to select both their desired structure for the policy and their desired fairness requirements. Our approach can thus explicitly trade-off interpretability and efficiency while ensuring that fairness constraints are met. We propose a flexible data-driven mixed-integer optimization formulation for designing the policy, along with an approximate formulation which can be solved efficiently for broad classes of interpretable policies using Bender’s decomposition. We evaluate our framework using real-world data from the United States homeless youth housing system. We show that our framework results in policies that are more fair than the current policy in place and than classical interpretable machine learning approaches while achieving a similar (or higher) level of overall efficiency.	approximation algorithm;fairness measure;machine learning;mathematical optimization;requirement	Mohammad Javad Azizi;Phebe Vayanos;Bryan Wilder;Eric Rice;Milind Tambe	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-93031-2_3	housing program;mathematical optimization;operations research;supportive housing;computer science;interpretability	ML	10.095026724333556	-4.078078684099052	71775

There are already a number of algorithms to solve such problems, now the next challenge is to interpret the results produced by those algorithms. In this paper, we propose an alternative way to visualize high-dimensional Pareto fronts where the goal is to present the Pareto front in terms of a decision maker's perspective. A decision maker is more interested in the different aspects of the end results instead of the convergence and spread of a Pareto front solutions. They are interested in Pareto-optimal solutions that offer the most trade-off. They are also interested to know the boundary solutions of a Pareto front. In this paper, we present a way to visualize the Pareto front in high dimension by keeping those criteria in mind.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;pareto efficiency	A.

We define an experiment design and analysis method to determine relative importance and effective settings for control parameters of any evolutionary algorithm, and we apply this method to a classic binary-encoded genetic algorithm (GA). Subsequently, as reported elsewhere, we applied the GA, with the control parameter settings determined here, to steer a population of cloud-computing simulators toward behaviors that reveal degraded performance and system collapse. GA-steered simulators could serve as a design tool, empowering system engineers to identify and mitigate low-probability, costly failure scenarios. In the existing GA literature, we uncovered conflicting opinions and evidence regarding key GA control parameters and effective settings to adopt. Consequently, we designed and executed an experiment to determine relative importance and effective settings for seven GA control parameters, when applied across a set of numerical optimization problems drawn from the literature. This paper describes our experiment design, analysis, and results. We found that crossover most significantly influenced GA success, followed by mutation rate and population size and then by rerandomization point and elite selection. Selection method and the precision used within the chromosome to represent numerical values had least influence. Our findings are robust over 60 numerical optimization problems.	behavior;cns disorder;cloud computing;computation (action);conflict (psychology);design of experiments;design tool;engineering;evolutionary algorithm;execution;genetic selection;genetic algorithm;liver failure, acute;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;population parameter;research design;selection (genetic algorithm);simulators;software release life cycle	Kevin Mills;James J.

Nonetheless, travelers still find it difficult to identify routes of a specific topology on the maps because it is usually hidden behind the conventional octilinear layout of the entire map. In this paper, we present an approach to designing schematic maps with loop lines, which are drawn as circles together with annotation labels for guiding different traveling purposes. Our idea here is to formulate the aesthetic criteria as mathematical constraints in the mixed-integer programming model, which allows us to either align stations on the loop line at a grid if they are interchange stations or noninterchange stations on a circle otherwise. We then distribute the annotation labels associated with stations on the loop line evenly to the four side boundary of the map domain in order to make full use of the annotation space, while maximally avoiding intersections between leader lines and the metro network by employing a flow network algorithm. Finally, we present several experimental results generated by our prototype system to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.	algorithm;align (company);cartography;exploratory testing;flow network;integer programming;javaserver pages;linear programming;map;maximum flow problem;metro (design language);national supercomputer centre in sweden;programming model;prototype;schematic;usability testing;user interface	Hsiang-Yun Wu;Sheung-Hung Poon;Shigeo Takahashi;Masatoshi Arikawa;Chun-Cheng Lin;Hsu-Chun Yen	2015	2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation	10.1109/iV.2015.14	simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;engineering drawing	Robotics	14.8108579000869	-0.7307394300819526	71968

In the proposed AMCC-DE, several superior individuals are employed as the multiple context vectors (CV) to provide robust and effective coevolution, and these CVs are selected by each individual based on their adaptive probabilities. To keep the diversity of these CVs, the mutation operation of CV is defined and conducted in each generation. Moreover, a new mutation operator is also proposed and employed in the AMCC-DE to generate promising individuals. On a comprehensive set of 1000-dimensional LSGO benchmarks, the performance of AMCC-DE compared favorably against some state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms. Experimental results indicate that the proposed AMCC-DE is effective on LSGO problems, and the proposed mechanisms in AMCC-DE can also be generally extended to other EAs.	concurrent versions system;differential evolution;evolutionary algorithm;global optimization;image scaling;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;ski combinator calculus	Ruo-Li Tang;Xin Li	2017	Applied Intelligence	10.1007/s10489-017-1113-y	machine learning;differential evolution;operator (computer programming);global optimization;cooperative coevolution;computer science;coevolution;new mutation;evolutionary algorithm;artificial intelligence	AI	24.433012574946147	-4.705371739221704	72064

One important operator in these algorithms is the selection scheme, for which in this paper a new description model, based on fitness distributions, is introduced. With this, a mathematical analysis of tournament selection, truncation selection, ranking selection, and exponential ranking selection is carried out that allows an exact prediction of the fitness values after selection. The correspondence of binary tournament selection and ranking selection in the expected fitness distribution is proved. Furthermore, several properties of selection schemes are derived (selection intensity, selection variance, loss of diversity), and the three selection schemes are compared using these properties.	evolutionary algorithm;fitness model (network theory);mathematical optimization;time complexity;tournament selection;truncation selection	Tobias Blickle;Lothar Thiele	1996	Evolutionary Computation	10.1162/evco.1996.4.4.361	truncation selection;mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;fitness proportionate selection;computer science;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;pattern recognition;mathematics;feature selection;selection	AI	20.867829938192802	-4.755944786311816	72323

This paper presents a test problem, called the Rectangle problem, to aid the visual investigation of high-dimensional multiobjective search. Key features of the Rectangle problem are that the Pareto optimal solutions 1) lie in a rectangle in the two-variable decision space and 2) are similar (in the sense of Euclidean geometry) to their images in the four-dimensional objective space. In this case, it is easy to examine the behavior of objective vectors in terms of both convergence and diversity, by observing their proximity to the optimal rectangle and their distribution in the rectangle, respectively, in the decision space. Fifteen algorithms are investigated. Underperformance of Pareto-based algorithms as well as most state-of-the-art many-objective algorithms indicates that the proposed problem not only is a good tool to help visually understand the behavior of multiobjective search in a high-dimensional objective space but also can be used as a challenging benchmark function to test algorithms' ability in balancing the convergence and diversity of solutions.	approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);converge;distribution (mathematics);moea framework;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;pareto efficiency	Miqing Li;Shengxiang Yang;Xiaohui Liu	2014	2014 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2014.6900306	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;visualization;convergence;computer science;multi-objective optimization;machine learning;mathematics;vector optimization	AI	22.887268874104155	-4.4454403079552645	72474

Hence, identifying and planning for strengthening of critical facilities have become a priority for more security and safety. This paper presents a bi-level formulation of the rinterdiction median problemwith fortification for critical hierarchical facilities. In the developed bi-level formulation, the defender, as the leader, decides to protect a certain number of facilities in each level of the hierarchical system in order to minimize the impact of the most disruptive attacks to unprotected facilities. On the other hand the attacker, as the follower, with full information about protected facilities, makes his interdiction plan to maximize the total post-attack cost incurred to the defender. We develop three metaheuristic algorithms and an exhaustive enumeration method to solve the introduced problem. Extensive computational tests on a set of randomly generated instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed algorithms. & 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As there is a lack of study on the central warehouse via delivering cost in VMI literature, this paper presents a VMI model in SCM including single-vendor, multi-retailer, and single-warehouse. While the vendor confronts with two constraints, namely the number of orders and budget, the purpose of this research is to find order size, the shortest possible route, and replenishment frequencies for the vendor and the retailers to minimize the total inventory cost. As the proposed model is an NP-hard problem, a meta-heuristics namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to optimize the proposed model. Since there is no available benchmark for evaluation of the proposed method, a genetic algorithm is used to validate and verify the solution presented by PSO. Moreover, Taguchi method in the design of experiments calibrates the parameters of the algorithm to provide the reliable solution. Finally, the conclusion and further studies are presented.	benchmark (computing);design of experiments;dual-flashlight plot;experiment;genetic algorithm;heuristic (computer science);inventory;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimizing compiler;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;response surface methodology;row echelon form;software release life cycle;stochastic process;taguchi methods	Javad Sadeghi;Mahziar Taghizadeh;Ahamd Sadeghi;Reza Jahangard;Reza Tavakkoli-Moghaddam	2015	Int.

As the solution to this prob lem has wide applicability in many practical fields , this NP Hard problem highly raises the need for an efficient solution. The problem is determining a se t of routes for the salesmen that jointly visit a set of given cities which are facing difficulty becaus e of road congestion. Selection of proper route is based on the road capacity, which is the deciding factor in the opt vehicle usage. The objective of the study i s to optimize the vehicle utilization and minimize the time of travel by salesman based on the road capaci ty. The solution to this problem is achieved in 3 steps; the first step is by assigning addresses to cities by Ad-assignment algorithm. The second step is by assigning cities and vehicles to salesman by Slassignment algorithm. The third step is by using Parallel Shortest Path Multiple Salesman (PSPMS) al gorithms to obtain the shortest path. The PSPMS algorithm runs in parallel for each salesman. The s olutions to the problem are known to possess an exponential time complexity. From the result we obs erve that PSPMS is one of the best approximate algorithms used to solve MTSP.	approximation algorithm;dijkstra's algorithm;discrete optimization;map (parallel pattern);mathematical optimization;np-hardness;network congestion;optimizing compiler;shortest path problem;time complexity;travelling salesman problem	Ranjana Ponraj;George Amalanathan	2014	JCS	10.3844/jcssp.2014.680.688	nearest neighbour algorithm;2-opt;mathematical optimization;christofides algorithm;computer science;lin–kernighan heuristic;shortest path problem;travelling salesman problem;algorithm;3-opt	Theory	17.653540142708348	1.959151660849074	73340

27d456e2dc0abe0bf3dcde5ef1f8dc6d0ccb5c73	hybrid test redundancy reduction strategy based on global neighborhood algorithm and simulated annealing		Software testing is a critical part of software development. Often, test suite sizes grow significantly with subsequent modifications to the software over time resulting into potential redundancies. Test redundancies are undesirable as they incur costs and are not helpful to detect new bugs. Owing to time and resource constraints, test suite minimization strategies are often sought to remove those redundant test cases in an effort to ensure that each test can cover as much requirements as possible. There are already many works in the literature exploiting the greedy computational algorithms as well as the meta-heuristic algorithms, but no single strategy can claim dominance in terms of test data reduction over their counterparts. Furthermore, despite much useful work, existing strategies have not sufficiently explored the hybrid based meta-heuristic strategies. In order to improve the performance of existing strategies, hybridization is seen as the key to exploit the strength of more than one meta-heuristic algorithm. Given such prospects, this research explores a hybrid test redundancy reduction strategy based on Global Neighborhood Algorithm and Simulated Annealing, called GNA_SA. Overall, GNA_SA offers better reduction as compared to the original GNA and many existing works.	gna!;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);reduction strategy (lambda calculus);requirement;simulated annealing;software bug;software development;software testing;test case;test data;test suite	Kamal Z.

Phylogenetic inference represents one of the key research topics in this area. Throughout the years, controversy among biologists has arisen when dealing with this well-known problem, as different optimality criteria can give as a result discordant genealogical relationships. Current research efforts aim to apply multiobjective optimization techniques in order to infer phylogenies that represent a consensus between different principles. In this work, we apply a multiobjective swarm intelligence approach inspired by the behaviour of fireflies to tackle the phylogenetic inference problem according to two criteria: maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood. Experiments on four real nucleotide data sets show that this novel proposal can achieve promising results in comparison with other approaches from the state-of-the-art in Phylogenetics.	firefly algorithm;phylogenetics	Sergio Santander-Jiménez;Miguel A.

62ff3382d3db1438c45351dd2ba55d8503e70131	a methodology to restructure a pipeline system for an oilfield in the mid to late stages of development		Abstract One important issue in the mid to late development stages of oilfields is maintaining stable production, especially when the existing gathering pipeline system cannot fully satisfy the development of low pressures and low production rates. In these cases, it is necessary to restructure the original gathering pipeline system. In this study, an optimal design method is proposed to restructure a pipeline system in an oilfield in the mid to late development stages. Based on the demand of stable production and the existing structure of the pipeline system, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model with an objective function that minimizes the total cost is developed. Hydraulic, technical and economic constraints are considered. The model is linearized based on a piecewise method and solved by the branch-and-bound algorithm. This method is applied to a real case study of a pipeline system in an oilfield.	pipeline (computing)	Bohong Wang;Yongtu Liang;Jianqin Zheng;Tiantian Lei;Meng Yuan;Haoran Zhang	2018	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2018.04.008	optimal design;piecewise;control engineering;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;total cost;erikson's stages of psychosocial development;mathematics	SE	12.67380195749787	3.126037228585492	73918

Although a number of performance metrics existed, many are applicable to low objective problems (2-3 objectives). In addition, most of the existed metrics are only applied to the final non-dominated set. In this paper, we suggest a running metric which evaluates the uniformity of solutions at every generation of a MOEA run. In particular, this metric can compare the uniformity of population with different size in any number of objectives. With an agglomeration of generation-wise populations, the metric reveals the change of uniformity in a MOEA run or helps provide a comparative evaluation of two or more MOEAs.	approximation;circuit complexity;evolutionary algorithm;moea framework;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;pareto efficiency;population	Miqing Li;Jinhua Zheng;Guixia Xiao	2008	2008 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence)	10.1109/CEC.2008.4630861	evolutionary programming;mathematical optimization;dominating set;interactive evolutionary computation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;management science;evolutionary computation	Vision	23.5599976002312	-5.650600803461951	74376

Demand forecasting is essential for analyzing existing cargo flight schedules and identifying future facility requirements of air cargo companies. We use the Potluck Problem approach to propose a multiproducer/multiconsumer solution for predicting the cargo demand of a specific airline in a given route, and the cargo load factor for a given flight schedule on that route. This solution considers each airline as a producer and the users of air cargo services as consumers, with a producer having no explicit communication with other producers/airlines. The model analyzes the existing cargo capacity plan, highlights drawbacks, and proposes a new capacity plan to demonstrate the effectiveness of using the solution.

78e1290b1b909bcc448a473f49aeaa661cb56cf3	integrated yard space allocation and yard crane deployment problem in resource-limited container terminals		Yard storage space and yard crane equipment are the core resources in the container terminal yard area. This paper studies the integrated yard space allocation (outbound container space) and yard crane deployment problem in resource-limited container terminals where yard space and yard cranes are extremely scarce. Two corresponding counterstrategies are introduced, respectively, and the integrated problem is solved as mixed integer programming. The model this paper formulated considers the container volume fluctuation of the service line, and the objective is a trade-off between yard sharing space and terminal operation cost. In numerical experiments, this paper tries to reveal the management meaning in practical operation of container terminal and provides decision support for terminal managers; therefore a series of scenarios are presented to analyze the relations among the yard sharing space, the number of yard cranes, the size of yard subblock, and the cost of terminal operation.

fc51ee71e3330c697d7f5f081762862a0dfa2bb6	an evolutionary approach to schedule deadline constrained bag of tasks in a cloud		Bag of tasks (BoT) is an application model which consists of a large number of independent tasks. In cloud, computing power is offered as virtual machines (VMs) which differ in terms of speed, memory and cost. When such applications are executed on cloud, an optimal allocation of VMs is needed so that the application executes to completion within the deadline and the cost incurred is minimal. Here, the main challenge is to find an optimal trade-off between execution time and execution cost. Genetic algorithms (GA) are evolutionary algorithms which enable to solve multi-objective problems. This paper proposes a novel deadline constrained bi-objective genetic algorithm based scheduler (DBOGA) to schedule a BoT application onto a cloud. A new fitness function is defined. Exploration and exploitation of search space is carried out based on this. An extensive study on the applicability of DBOGA by considering various scenarios is explored.	iterative and incremental development	S.

The topic has been under extensive research, which has resulted in several formulations and solution algorithms for systematic tolerance design considering various aspects. An optimal tolerance design problem involving alternative manufacturing processes for realization of a dimension can be referred to as the advanced tolerance design problem, where the optimal selection of a set of manufacturing processes is also considered in addition to the optimal set of tolerances. Such a nonlinear multivariate optimal tolerance design problem results in a nonconvex combinatorial solution surface. Optimal solution of the advanced tolerance design problem is difficult with the traditional optimization techniques. The problem becomes more complex with the assemblies involving interrelated dimension chains, and manufacturing processes bracketed by precision bounds. The focus of this work is on the optimal solution of the aforementioned advanced tolerance design problem. Genetic algorithm, a non-traditional global optimization technique has been proposed as the solution methodology for its inherent advantages. Application of the methodology has been demonstrated with the help of suitable examples. Concept of the set up reduction constraints has also been introduced, wherein all the similar dimensions on a single part are manufactured on a single machine, resulting in a single value of design tolerance associated to all such dimensions.

Like other surgical branches, anesthesia and reanimation departments provide 24 h continuous service and the residents are the main providers of this service. The residents are assigned for on-call shifts during their training, as well as working during the regular day shifts. These schedules must address several considerations like preferences of the residents and coverage requirements of two different locations: the intensive care unit (ICU) and the surgery room (SR). In this study we develop a goal programming (GP) model for scheduling the shifts of the residents in the Anesthesia and Reanimation Department of Bezmialem Vakif University Medical School (BUMS). The rules that must be strictly met, like the number of on-duty shifts or preventing block shifts, are formulated as hard constraints. The preferences of the residents like increasing the number of weekends without shifts and assigning duties on the same night to the same social groups are formulated as soft constraints. The penalties for the deviation from the soft constraints are determined by the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). We are able to solve problems of realistic size to optimality in a few seconds. We showed that the proposed formulation, which the department uses currently, has yielded substantial improvements and much better schedules are created with less effort. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, most experimental algorithm evaluations in the literature limit themselves to simple statistics for comparing end results. Furthermore, comparisons between algorithms from different “families” are rare. In this study, we use the TSP Suite - an open source software framework - to investigate the performance of the Branch and Bound (BB) algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We compare this BB algorithm to an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) approach, as well as three different Local Search (LS) algorithms. Our comparisons are based on a variety of different performance measures and statistics computed over the entire optimization process. The experimental results show that the BB algorithm performs well on very small TSP instances, but is not a good choice for any medium to large-scale problem instances. Subsequently, we investigate whether hybridizing BB with LS would give rise to similar positive results like the hybrid versions of EA and ACO have. This turns out to be true - the “Memetic” BB algorithms are able to improve the performance of pure BB algorithms significantly. It is worth pointing out that, while the results presented in this paper are consistent with previous findings in the literature, our results have been obtained through a much more comprehensive and solid experimental procedure.	ant colony optimization algorithms;branch and bound;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary computation;experiment;genetic algorithm;least squares;lin–kernighan heuristic;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;memetics;metaheuristic;open-source software;software framework;travelling salesman problem	Yan Jiang;Thomas Weise;Jörg Lässig;Raymond Chiong;Rukshan Athauda	2014	2014 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Production and Logistics Systems (CIPLS)	10.1109/CIPLS.2014.7007174	mathematical optimization;ant colony optimization algorithms;computer science;machine learning;algorithm;3-opt;metaheuristic;memetic algorithm	AI	22.221205376334627	-2.9276118342071458	74983

An embedding imposes a well-structured hypercube topology on the search space, endows it with a semantic-aware neighborhood, and enables convenient search using Cartesian coordinates. The embedding algorithm consists in locality-driven optimization and operates in abstraction from a specific fitness function, improving locality of all possible fitness landscapes simultaneously. We experimentally validate the approach on a large sample of symbolic regression tasks and show that it provides better search performance than the original program space. We demonstrate also that semantic embedding of small programs can be exploited in a compositional manner to effectively search the space of compound programs.	algorithm;embedded system;experiment;fitness function;genetic programming;locality of reference;mathematical optimization;symbolic regression	Krzysztof Krawiec	2011		10.1145/2001576.2001762	genetic programming;mathematical optimization;fitness landscape;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;fitness function;algorithm	PL	22.38806444360781	-8.777098699641229	75137

In a previous article, we proposed a new approach of the parallel B&B algorithm for distributed systems using the farmer-worker paradigm. However, the new farmer-worker approach has a disadvantage: some nodes of the B&B tree can be explored by several B&B processes. To prevent this redundant work and speed up, we propose a new P2P approach inspired from the strategies of existing P2P systems like Napster and JXTA. Validation is performed by experimenting the two approaches on mono-objective flow-shop problem benchmarks using 500 processors belonging to the French national grid, Grid'5000. The obtained results prove the efficiency of the proposed P2P approach. Indeed, the execution time obtained with the P2P version, even if more communicative, is better than the farmer-worker's one.	mathematical optimization	Malika Mehdi;Mohand-Said Mezmaz;Nouredine Melab;El-Ghazali Talbi;Pascal Bouvry	2009	IJGUC	10.1504/IJGUC.2009.027652	flow shop scheduling;combinatorial optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;distributed computing;algorithm	HPC	21.808833076324692	3.8644712769358143	75291

Most of the studies only describe the interaction under static assumptions, which do not consider possible temporal flow distribution. These assumptions limit the applicability in real-time management and control. This paper focuses on finding equilibrium under the interaction of signal setting and traffic assignment. The problem is constructed and solved through a bi-level framework. The upper level solves for signal setting parameters based on flow distributions, including cycle length and green splits. The lower level solves for user equilibrium dynamic traffic assignment (UEDTA) flows in a traffic network. The signal setting parameters are adjusted through pretimed and actuated signal controls. UEDTA flow patterns are generated through a simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model, DynaTAIWAN. Numerical experiments based on a real network in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, are conducted to study the dynamic equilibrium. The numerical results indicate the existence of equilibrium flow under signal control and route assignment in a dynamic aspect. The results show that the average travel times under the pretimed signal policy are, in general, better than the times under the actuated signal policy.	algorithm;black and burst;central processing unit;computation;digital television adapter;experiment;flow network;global optimization;iteration;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;metaheuristic;network performance;numerical analysis;powell's method;real-time clock;simulation;tabu search;the times;time complexity	Li-Wen Chen;Ta-Yin Hu	2012	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2012.2188392	simulation;engineering;transport engineering	Mobile	14.883040983976437	1.4071893530047606	75624

In particular, we utilize Sequencing by Hybridization. We believe that this is the first time that hyper-heuristics have been investigated in this domain. A hyperheuristic is provided with a set of low-level heuristics and the aim is to decide which heuristic to call at each decision point. We investigate three types of hyper-heuristics. Two of these (simulated annealing and tabu search) draw their inspiration from meta-heuristics. The choice function hyper-heuristic draws its inspiration from reinforcement learning. We utilize two independent sets of low-level heuristics. The first set is based on a previous tabu search method, with the second set being a significant extension to this basic set, including utilizing a different representation and introducing the definition of clusters. The datasets we use comprises two randomly generated datasets and also a publicly available biological dataset. In total, we carried out experiments using 70 different combinations of heuristics, using the three datasets mentioned above and investigating six different hyper-heuristic algorithms. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of a hyper-heuristic approach to this problem domain. It is necessary to provide a good set of low-level heuristics, which are able to both intensify and diversify the search but this approach has demonstrated very encouraging results on this extremely difficult and important problem domain.	heuristic;hyper-heuristic	Jacek Blazewicz;Edmund K.

We consider an investment model, where an agent decides the percentage of budget to risk at each time step. Afterwards, agent's investment is evaluated in the market via a return on investment (RoI), which we assume is a stochastic process with unknown periodicities and different levels of noise. To control the risk exposure, we investigate approaches based on: technical analysis (Moving Least Squares, MLS), and evolutionary computation (Genetic Algorithms, GA). In our comparison, we also consider two reference strategies for zero-knowledge and complete-knowledge behaviors, respectively. In our approach, the performance of a strategy corresponds to the average budget that can be obtained with this strategy over a certain number of time steps. To this end, we perform some computer experiments, where for each strategy the budget obtained after a certain number of time steps is averaged over a large number of trials. To make the comparison fair, we first tune the parameters of each strategy. Afterwards, we compare the performance of these strategies for RoIs with different levels of noise and different periodicities.	computer experiment;evolutionary computation;genetic algorithm;image noise;moving least squares;stochastic process;zero-knowledge proof	Emeterio Navarro	2007	CoRR		genetic algorithm;periodic graph (geometry);injector;computer science;mechanical engineering	AI	18.279119859626096	0.23268334662611875	75781
cb896092ff13fafea98125fb8e7aa8f2fcc1aa27	structural learning of bayesian networks via constrained hill climbing algorithms: adjusting trade-off between efficiency and accuracy		Learning Bayesian networks is known to be an NP-hard problem, and this, combined with the growing interest in learning models from high-dimensional domains, leads to the necessity of finding more efficient learning algorithms. Recent papers have proposed constrained approaches of successfully and widely used local search algorithms, such as Hill Climbing. One of these algorithms families, called constrained Hill Climbing CHC, greatly improves upon the efficiency of the original approach, obtaining models with slightly lower quality but maintaining their theoretical properties. In this paper, we propose three different modifications to the most scalable version of these algorithms, fast constrained Hill Climbing, to improve the quality of its output by relaxing the constraints imposed to include some diversification in the search process. The aim of these new approaches is to adjust the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm, as they do not modify its complexity and only imply a few more search iterations. We perform an intensive experimental evaluation of the modifications proposed with an extensive comparison between the original algorithms and the new modifications covering several scenarios with quite large data sets.

afb2235eeafc893c1f6709cb3866d0938c2cfe3b	an optimization model for electric vehicle battery charging at a battery swapping station		A new model for a viable battery swapping station is proposed to minimize its cost by determining the optimized charging schedule for swapped electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The aim is to minimize an objective function considering three factors: the number of batteries taken from stock to serve all the swapping orders from incoming EVs, potential charging damage with the use of high-rate chargers, and electricity cost for different time period of the day. A mathematical model is formulated for the charging process following the constant-current/constant-voltage charging strategy. An integrated algorithm is proposed to determine an optimal charging schedule, which is inspired by genetic algorithm, differential evolution, and particle swarm optimization. A series of simulation studies are executed to assess the feasibility of the proposed model and compare the performance between the proposed algorithm and the typical evolutionary algorithms.	battery charger;differential evolution;evolutionary algorithm;extended validation certificate;genetic algorithm;hot swapping;loss function;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;paging;particle swarm optimization;simulation	Hao Wu;Grantham Pang;King Lun Choy;Hoi Yan Lam	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2758404	real-time computing;battery (electricity);electronic engineering;simulation;differential evolution;genetic algorithm;electric-vehicle battery;computer science;electric vehicle;evolutionary algorithm;schedule;particle swarm optimization	EDA	16.184648640931123	-1.8571088831833382	75993

We propose an effective stochastic method, called Simulated Allocation, which is able to find almost optimal allocation patterns in a short computation time. The method is simple to implement and can be used to the whole class of multicommodity flow problems, including the one considered in the paper.

df39c029520f6c26d477497c7c0e5a5bd31ece38	hybrid heuristic-based artificial immune system for task scheduling		Task scheduling problem in heterogeneous systems is the process of allocating tasks of an application to heterogeneous processors interconnected by high-speed networks, so that minimizing the finishing time of application as much as possible. Tasks are processing units of application and have precedenceconstrained, communication and also, are presented by Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Evolutionary algorithms are well suited for solving task scheduling problem in heterogeneous environment. In this paper, we propose a hybrid heuristic-based Artificial Immune System (AIS) algorithm for solving the scheduling problem. In this regard, AIS with some heuristics and Single Neighbourhood Search (SNS) technique are hybridized. Clonning and immune-remove operators of AIS provide diversity, while heuristics and SNS provide convergence of algorithm into good solutions, that is balancing between exploration and exploitation. We have compared our method with some state-of-the art algorithms. The results of the experiments show the validity and efficiency of our method.	artificial immune system;central processing unit;directed acyclic graph;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;heuristic (computer science);multi-core processor;scheduling (computing)	Masoomeh sanei;Nasrollah Moghaddam Charkari	2011	CoRR		directed acyclic graph;operator (computer programming);heuristics;artificial immune system;scheduling (computing);evolutionary algorithm;job shop scheduling;heuristic;distributed computing;computer science	HPC	22.058227266079147	1.176370014023976	76194
895466423b6cb54129661c45281e3aa14eff7e58	a hybrid-coded human learning optimization for mixed-variable optimization problems		This paper proposes a new hybrid-coded HLO (HcHLO) framework to tackle mix-coded problems more efficiently and effectively.A new continuous human learning optimization algorithm is presented based on the linear learning mechanism of humans.The results show that the HcHLO achieves the best-known overall performance so far on the tested mix-coded problems. Human Learning Optimization (HLO) is an emerging meta-heuristic with promising potential, which is inspired by human learning mechanisms. Although binary algorithms like HLO can be directly applied to mixed-variable problems that contains both continuous values and discrete or Boolean values, the search efficiency and the performance of those algorithms may be significantly spoiled due to the curse of dimensionality caused by the binary coding strategy especially when the continuous parameters of problems require high accuracy. Therefore, this paper extends HLO and proposes a novel hybrid-coded HLO (HcHLO) framework to tackle mix-coded problems more efficiently and effectively, in which real-coded parameters are optimized by a new continuous HLO (CHLO) based on the linear learning mechanism of humans and the other variables are handled by the binary learning operators of HLO. Finally, HcHLO is adopted to solve 14 benchmark problems and its performance is compared with that of recent meta-heuristic algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed HcHLO achieves the best-known overall performance so far on the test problems, which demonstrates the validity and superiority of HcHLO.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);binary number;cognitive science;curse of dimensionality;heuristic;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;program optimization	Ling Wang;Ji Pei;Muhammad Ilyas Menhas;Jiaxing Pi;Minrui Fei;Panos M.

We report the results of some computational experiments on a large-scale hydrothermal scheduling model developed for Brazil. We find that the best improvements in computation time are obtained from an implementation that increases the number of scenarios in the forward pass with each iteration and selects cuts to be included in the stage problems in each iteration. This gives an order of magnitude decrease in computation time with little change in solution quality.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;dynamic programming;experiment;iteration;scheduling (computing);time complexity	Vitor L. de Matos;Andrew B.

We propose here a hybrid algorithm (MC-FC) that combines two different search methods, where a problem is solved partially with a random answer using Min-conflict algorithm (MC) and then the partial solution guides the systematic search algorithm (Forward-checking, FC) to solve the remainder of the problem. The specific problems used for this study are primarily the graph coloring problems with various degree of connectivity. The time complexity of the MC-FC is much better than the pure MC and FC under many circumstances. Furthermore, its time-complexity is more predictable over multiple experiments compared to that of the pure MC or FC, and the former algorithm uses less storage than the pure algorithms. We attempt to motivate our heterogeneous hybridization technique with some preliminary experiments and simple manual calculations.	constraint satisfaction;experiment;graph coloring;hybrid algorithm;look-ahead (backtracking);search algorithm;time complexity	Debasis Mitra;Hyoung-rae Kim	2004			hybrid algorithm (constraint satisfaction);machine learning;artificial intelligence;hybrid algorithm;min-conflicts algorithm;constraint satisfaction dual problem;constraint satisfaction problem;mathematical optimization;constraint learning;computer science;best-first search;search algorithm	AI	23.26720291243053	4.066344630131818	76896

Its relevance in this environment arises from the performed coverage of the main stages when solving optimization problems. Its modular architecture, graphical functionalities, interaction level, and wide flexibility give rise to its educational interest, allowing its adaptation to multitude of educational environments, being an assistant during the theoretical lectures as well as a transversal tool over the practical sessions. PMHS has been used during an undergraduate optimization course. The results obtained from the experience suggest that the tool improves the understanding of the theoretical concepts and reduces the workload of the students when implementing optimization methods. 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The considered problem consists of determining appropriate wafer quantities for several products, facilities, and time periods by taking demand fulfillment (i.e., confirmed orders and forecasts) and capacity constraints into account. In addition, fixed costs are used to reduce production partitioning. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation is presented and the problem is shown to be NP-hard. As a consequence, two heuristic procedures are proposed: a product based decomposition scheme and a genetic algorithm. The performance of both heuristics is assessed using randomly generated test instances. It turns out that the decomposition scheme is able to produce high-quality solutions, while the genetic algorithm achieves results with reasonable quality in a short amount of time. & 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The stored information facilitates the communication among swarms in the population space. It also assists in selecting the leading particles using a three-level PSO: personal, swarm and global levels. Simulation results of the proposed heuristics over a number of benchmark problems demonstrate that this novel cultural framework helps the multiple swarm CPSO to perform very efficiently.	benchmark (computing);constrained optimization;heuristic (computer science);inter-process communication;knowledge management;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;simulation;swarm robotics	Moayed Daneshyari;Gary G.

That is, the scheduling optimization of the path is regarded as a process scheduling. The starting of the vehicle entering the path is regarded as the beginning of the process, and the return of the vehicle to the general station is regarded as the ending of the process. The purpose of saving scheduling time, shortening distance, and reducing fuel consumption is achieved by finding the optimal path and rationally scheduling the allocation. Ultimately improve the efficiency of transportation.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;program optimization;scheduling (computing)	Changchun Dong;Liang Zhou	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-00018-9_46	real-time computing;process function;computer science;commodity;scheduling (computing);fuel efficiency;distributed computing	EDA	13.867414669038281	1.1121691462862398	77710

This model conforms with real honey bee colony, indeed, in nature some bees among the foraging ones are called inspectors because they preserve the colony's history and historical information related to food sources.

GALE is a near-linear time MOEA that builds a piecewise approximation to the surface of best solutions along the Pareto frontier. For each piece, GALE mutates solutions towards the better end. In numerous case studies, GALE finds comparable solutions to standard methods (NSGA-II, SPEA2) using far fewer evaluations (e.g. 20 evaluations, not 1,000). GALE is recommended when a model is expensive to evaluate, or when some audience needs to browse and understand how an MOEA has made its conclusions.	approximation;browsing;evolutionary algorithm;moea framework;multi-objective optimization;pareto efficiency;search-based software engineering;software engineer;time complexity	Joseph Krall;Tim Menzies;Misty Davies	2015	IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering	10.1109/TSE.2015.2432024	mathematical optimization;search-based software engineering;computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-objective optimization;machine learning;active learning;computational model	SE	21.810108394721563	-3.314723142005854	78476

One of the new elements of this Fuzzy Adaptive Neighborhood Search (FANS ) algorithm is a fuzzy valuation, which is used to measure the degree to which the solutions that are considered at the decision stages accomplish a certain qualitative property. FANS is analyzed from two perspectives: first, it is shown how FANS may be adapted to behave like other traditional local search techniques by means of suitable definitions for the fuzzy valuation component. Second, comparisons are made to show the potential of the method as a general purpose optimization tool, when none or minimal knowledge of the problem being solved is available. Both aspects make FANS a valuable tool regarding further developments within the context of decision support systems involving heuristic algorithms.	algorithm;combinatorial optimization;decision support system;heuristic;local search (constraint satisfaction);local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;search algorithm;value (ethics)	Armando Blanco;David A.

CWLP is fully non-separable and non-differentiable, and thus traditional algorithms can hardly deal with it. This paper proposes an algorithm named Cooperative Co-evolution with Weighted Random Grouping (CCWR) to tackle it. CCWR employs the weighted random (WR) grouping strategy, which is specifically designed for CWLP, to divide the large-scale Crossing Waypoints (CWs) into small sub-groups and an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to solve the smaller scale CWs location problem in each sub-group. Experiments on the database of the ARN in China have been carried out to evaluate the performance of CCWR. The results showed that CCWR is superior to a number of state-of-the-art algorithms, and the advanced performance of CCWR is mainly due to the WR grouping strategy.	evolutionary algorithm;xslt/muenchian grouping	Mingming Xiao;Jun Zhang;Kaiquan Cai;Xianbin Cao;Ke Tang	2011	2011 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence	10.1109/ICTAI.2011.40	algorithm design;simulation;computer science;evolutionary algorithm;group theory;algorithm;evolutionary computation	Robotics	17.784393021419753	-0.07167549329423822	78565

Our study is from the perspective of the airport, the air services provider (such as air traffic control) and the travelling public, rather than from the perspective of a single airline. Disruptions cause flights to be subjected to ground holding or to be cancelled. We present polynomial time algorithms based on the primal-dual schema and show that the algorithms find an optimal solution if the problem is feasible.

7a397e51304a69faa70b68e1555dd21f2765ce4d	the thief orienteering problem: formulation and heuristic approaches		This paper introduces the Thief Orienteering Problem (ThOP), a multi-component problem that combines two classic combinatorial problems: Orienteering Problem (OP) and Knapsack Problem (KP). In this problem, a person (called the thief) carries a capacitated knapsack and has a time limit to collect items distributed in a set of cities. The thief has fixed start and end points, begins his journey with the knapsack empty, and travels with speed inversely proportional to the knapsack weight. While there is time, the thief may visit the cities and collect items. The aim of the problem is to determine the thief's route and items to collect in order to maximize the knapsack profit. We formally describe the ThOP by a mixed integer non-linear programming formulation and present two heuristic approaches based on Iterated Local Search (ILS) and Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) metaheuristics. Our results showed that BRKGA outperformed ILS for a large majority of instances.	diversification (finance);genetic algorithm;heuristic (computer science);iterated function;iterated local search;knapsack problem;linear programming formulation;metaheuristic;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;pixel;problem solving;trusted third party	André G.

Those algorithms often show surprisingly good performance on widely used DTLZ and WFG test problems. The performance of those algorithms has continued to be improved. The aim of this paper is to show our concern that such a performance improvement race may lead to the overspecialization of developed algorithms for the frequently used many-objective test problems. In this paper, we first explain the DTLZ and WFG test problems. Next, we explain many-objective evolutionary algorithms characterized by the use of systematically generated weight vectors. Then we discuss the relation between the features of the test problems and the search mechanisms of weight vector-based algorithms such as multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III), MOEA/dominance and decomposition (MOEA/DD), and  $\theta $ -dominance based evolutionary algorithm ( $\theta$ -DEA). Through computational experiments, we demonstrate that a slight change in the problem formulations of DTLZ and WFG deteriorates the performance of those algorithms. After explaining the reason for the performance deterioration, we discuss the necessity of more general test problems and more flexible algorithms.	circuit complexity;computation;diversification (finance);evolutionary algorithm;experiment;feasible region;genetic algorithm;human body weight;moea framework;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;sorting;wait-for graph;weight function	Hisao Ishibuchi;Yu Setoguchi;Hiroyuki Masuda;Yusuke Nojima	2017	IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation	10.1109/TEVC.2016.2587749	maintenance engineering;mathematical optimization;convergence;shape;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;evolutionary computation	AI	23.798365607450275	-3.839443319562693	79170

We report on the state of the art in algorithm selection, as defined by the Algorithm Selection Competition series 2015 to 2017. The results of these competitions show how the state of the art improved over the years. Although performance in some cases is very promising, there is still room for improvement in other cases. Finally, we provide insights into why some scenarios are hard, and pose challenges to the community on how to advance the current state of the art.	algorithm selection;complementarity theory;selection algorithm	Marius Lindauer;Jan N. van Rijn;Lars Kotthoff	2018	CoRR		artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;complementarity (molecular biology);algorithm selection	AI	20.80736416188928	-5.943256900163051	79334

In the literature, several successful applications have been reported for graph-based optimization problems, such as vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems. In this paper, we propose an application of the ACO to a two-machine flowshop scheduling problem. In the flowshop, no intermediate storage is available between two machines and each operation demands a setup time on the machines. The problem seeks to compose a schedule that minimizes the total completion time. We first present a transformation of the scheduling problem into a graph-based model. An ACO algorithm is then developed with several specific features incorporated. A series of computational experiments is conducted by comparing our algorithm with previous heuristic algorithms. Numerical results evince that the ACO algorithm exhibits impressive performances with small error ratios. The results in the meantime demonstrate the success of ACO's applications to the scheduling problem of interest.	ant colony optimization algorithms;mathematical optimization;scheduling (computing)	Shyong Jian Shyu;Bertrand M.

FS-MOGA is a real-coded GA for multi-objective function optimization proposed by Hamada et. al. FS-MOGA utilizes the local-Pareto-optima overcoming strategy and the Pareto frontier covering strategy adaptively. Hamada et. al. reported that FS-MOGA outperformed conventional methods on multimodal and nonlinear problems. However, the Pareto frontier covering strategy proposed by Hamada et. al. has some problems in terms of the coverage of solution. Especially in case of solving three or more objective problems, the strategy's problems become more critical. In this paper, we propose a new Pareto frontier covering strategy that is excellent in the coverage of solutions and confirm its effectiveness through some experiments.	experiment;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;multimodal interaction;nonlinear system;object storage;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;partial template specialization;powera;software release life cycle	Ryo Miyazaki;Naoki Hamada;Yuichi Nagata;Isao Ono	2012	The 6th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems, and The 13th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligence Systems	10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2012.6505313	mathematical optimization;computer science;mathematical economics	AI	24.353012259269942	-4.170340223252356	79932

It improves the original Ruin and Recreate principle’s performance by incorporating an Evolutionary Ruin step which implements evolution within a single solution. In the proposed approach, a cycle of Solution Decomposition, Evolutionary Ruin and Stochastic Recreate continues until stopping conditions are reached. The Solution Decomposition step first uses some domain knowledge to break a solution down into its components and assign a score to each. The Evolutionary Ruin step then applies two operators (namely Selection and Mutation) to destroy a certain fraction of the entire solution. After the above steps, an input solution becomes partial and thus the resulting partial solution needs to be repaired. The repair is carried out by using the Stochastic Recreate step to reintroduce the removed items in a specific way (somewhat stochastic in order to have a better chance to jump out of the local optima), and then ask the underlying improvement heuristic whether this move will be accepted. These three steps are executed in sequence until a specific stopping condition is reached. Therefore, optimisation is achieved by solution disruption, iterative improvement and a stochastic constructive repair process performed within. Encouraging experimental results on exam timetabling problems are reported.	denial-of-service attack;heuristic;iterative method;local optimum;mathematical optimization;mutation (genetic algorithm)	Jingpeng Li;Rong Qu;Yindong Shen	2012		10.7148/2012-0347-0353	mathematical optimization;engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning	AI	23.318023053581715	-0.7750493712843566	79950

Particularly the design of overcurrent relay coordination in such system is an independent area of research. With the availability of new artificial based optimization algorithm relay coordination research gain a new momentum. Well established artificial based optimization algorithm such as genetic and particle swam optimization are successfully applied for such applications. This paper discusses the application of informative differential evolution algorithm with self adaptive re-clustering technique for selection of TDS and PSM for optimal coordination of directional overcurrent relays. Both continuous as well as discrete version of informative differential evolution algorithm are used for optimization of relay setting. Proper combination of backup relays for each primary relay are identified by using LINKNET graph theory approach. Coordination of directional overcurrent is developed for 9 bus and IEEE 30 bus distribution systems. The aim of problem is to minimize the total operating time of primary relays and eliminate the miscoordination among the primary and backup relay pairs. Discrete types of settings for electromechanical types of relay are also discussed in this paper. Moreover, the relay coordination problem is modified for providing optimal coordination time interval between 0.2 and 0.8 s among all primary and backup relays pairs. The results are compared with hybrid of genetic algorithm – nonlinear programming and sequential quadratic programming. Digsilient power factory software is used for verification of result.	algorithm;differential evolution;information;relay	Manohar Singh;Bijaya Ketan Panigrahi;Abhijit R. Abhyankar;Swagatam Das	2014	J.

Unlike classical approach, this paper studies an integrated production scheduling and coil shuffling problem, which is to create a production scheduling with considering production scheduling constraints and shuffling logistics operation. The problem is motivated by pickling-rolling practical production in the steel industry where selection and sequence of coils need not only considering the changeovers cost between adjacent coils, but also coil shuffling cost in retrieving coil. The objective is to minimize the overall production scheduling cost and shuffling cost. A tabu search based algorithm is developed where a two-phase heuristics is proposed to act the initial feasible solutions of tabu search. Computational results show that integrated approach of production scheduling and coil shuffling may reduce the total cost by 17% on average, compared with separate approach.	algorithm;computation;heuristic (computer science);logistics;rolling hash;scheduling (computing);tabu search;two-phase commit protocol	Ren Zhao;Lixin Tang	2009	2009 International Joint Conference on Computational Sciences and Optimization	10.1109/CSO.2009.334	fair-share scheduling;logistics;job shop scheduling;minimisation;mathematical optimization;dynamic priority scheduling;tabu search;computer science;operations management;two-level scheduling;scheduling;iron;scheduling;rolling	Robotics	13.9410889935197	4.103534246290929	80647

In the 1990's a new simulation methodology, discrete rate simulation, was developed to address those issues. The most challenging aspect of discrete rate simulation is to accurately calculate the movement of material (""""flow"""") over a wide range of simulated systems. To calculate flow rates, the first generation DRS technology used an iterative algorithm based on the propagation of potential rates. The iterative approach failed to provide an accurate calculation of flow for many DRS models, limiting the use of this technology to a small range of real world problems. Discussed here is how the second generation DRS technology uses a global oversight approach to model the full range of DRS systems and resolve the issues associated with earlier methods."""	algorithm;discrete rate simulation;iterative method;software propagation	Cecile Damiron;David Krahl	2014	Proceedings of the Winter Simulation Conference 2014		mathematical optimization;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;discrete system;discrete modelling;simulation language	EDA	12.260101332940408	-7.159413830612721	80782

A promising approach aims at the creation of pre-designed product structures optimized for later component adaptations. Thus, if customer demands turn up, change impacts are minimized and can be easier handled in order to diminish delivery time and costs. As available methods of structure planning show disadvantages in comprehensive considerations of interdependency networks, an evolutionary algorithm based process has been developed for mediating case specific structural characteristics to the designer. In this context a fitness function has been implemented to meet the selection demands. Further, the new approach permits automated structure optimization by modifying single product dependencies. The designer obtains propositions for useful product adaptation regarding product’s aptitude for later customization.	evolutionary algorithm;fitness function;interdependence;mathematical optimization;aptitude	Maik Maurer;Udo Lindemann	2005		10.1007/11553939_189	computer science;artificial intelligence;product design specification;evolutionary algorithm;design review;product design;algorithm;new product development;product engineering	Robotics	16.562517172144847	-6.814559865850138	81045

Frequently, they connect a pair of refineries or harbors with the purpose of sharing oil products. As the construction of twin pipelines transporting products in opposite directions demands large capital investments, reversible-flow pipelines arise as a promising alternative. This paper introduces a novel continuous-time formulation for the short-term operational planning of reversible multiproduct pipelines. The proposed model allows to change the flow direction as many times as needed to meet terminal demands, determining precise time instants for flow reversals. It provides the input and output schedules in a single step, and the most convenient product used as filler to push current batches out of the line. Three examples are successfully solved with much less computational effort than previous approaches.	pipeline (computing);scheduling (computing)	Diego C.

This situation can occur, for example, when the optimization must be performed on a device whose hardware is limited due to cost and space limitations. This paper addresses this class of optimization problems and proposes a novel algorithm, namely compact Particle Swarm Optimization (cPSO). The proposed algorithm employs the search logic typical of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms, but unlike classical PSO algorithms, does not use a swarm of particles and does not store neither the positions nor the velocities. On the contrary, cPSO employs a probabilistic representation of the swarm's behaviour. This representation allows a modest memory usage for the entire algorithmic functioning, the amount of memory used is the same as what is needed for storing five solutions. A novel interpretation of compact optimization is also given in this paper. Numerical results show that cPSO appears to outperform other modern algorithms of the same category (i.e. which attempt to solve the optimization despite a modest memory usage). In addition, cPSO displays a very good performance with respect to its population-based version and a respectable performance also with respect to some more complex population-based algorithms. A real world application in the field of power engineering and energy generation is given. The presented case study shows how, on a model of an actual power plant, an advanced control system can be online and real-time optimized. In this application example the calculations are embedded directly on the real-time control system.	particle swarm optimization	Ferrante Neri;Ernesto Mininno;Giovanni Iacca	2013	Inf.

The proposed clonal selection algorithm (CSA) has a new encoding and a novel procedure to cope with dummy departments that are introduced to fill the empty space in the facility area. The algorithm showed consistent performance for the 25 test problem cases studied. The problems with 100 and 125 were studied with FBS first time in the literature. CSA provided four new best FBS solutions and reached to sixteen best-so-far FBS solutions. Further, the two very large size test problems were solved first time using FBS representation, and results significantly improved the previous best known solutions. The overall results state that CSA with FBS representation was successful in 95.65% of the test problems when compared with the best-so-far FBS results and 90.90% compared with the best known solutions that have not used FBS representation.	algorithm;artificial immune system	Berna Haktanirlar Ulutas;Sadan Kulturel-Konak	2012	Expert Syst.

The proposed algorithm adds, to NNIA, local search procedures including a rational combination of undirected simulated annealing (UDSA) operator, directed cost simulated annealing (DCSA) operator and directed makespan simulated annealing (DMSA) operator. We have validated its efficiency by evaluating the algorithm on multiple instances of the FJSPs. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is an efficient and effective algorithm for the FJSPs, and the combination of UDSA operator, DCSA operator and DMSA operator with NNIA is rational.	graph (discrete mathematics);job scheduler;job stream;local search (optimization);makespan;mathematical optimization;memetic algorithm;multi-objective optimization;scheduling (computing);simulated annealing	Jingjing Ma;Yu Lei;Zhao Wang;Licheng Jiao;Ruochen Liu	2014	2014 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2014.6900331	job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;computer science;machine learning;adaptive simulated annealing	AI	21.065654465046343	-0.46273012545045883	81708
0965a0e82e1960e77b01599c6340fffb033b4be0	a dynamic discrete network design problem for maintenance planning in traffic networks		We propose a dynamic model for network maintenance planning by extending the Discrete Network Design Problem. The leader decides which road in the network is maintained in which period and the follower, as in the Discrete Network Design Problem, optimizes its own path through the network. The non-linear bilevel problem is first linearized and then transformed into a single-level mixed-integer program by using the Karush–Kuhn– Tucker conditions. This model is solved with Benders Decomposition. The numerical study shows that this method finds better solutions faster compared to solving the mixed-integer formulation directly and using a genetic algorithm. Furthermore, we show the benefit of this approach compared to simple greedy heuristics.	benders decomposition;blu-ray;genetic algorithm;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;iteration;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;linear programming;mathematical model;multi-level cell;network planning and design;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;referring expression generation;tucker decomposition	Pirmin Fontaine;Stefan Minner	2017	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-016-2171-y	mathematical optimization;simulation;operations management;network simulation	AI	15.668573987435995	-0.3997213337447863	81795

91749ff4fe5aa0bd6fb80fa89b9ca42b37ae2864	memetic algorithms for the automatic discovery of software architectures		Designing complex software systems involves making choices. Particularly in the early stages, software architects need to consider a wide range of design alternatives in order to satisfactorily meet all the requirements. Search techniques like evolutionary algorithms can support them to better explore these choices, requiring the resolution of the formulated search problem under the guidance of software metrics. Aspects like the system complexity and the diversity of metrics have a significant impact on the algorithm performance. Therefore, trying to improve its effectiveness by combining it with local search techniques represents an interesting option to fine tune the returned results. However, designing this kind of hybrid approaches, a.k.a. memetic algorithms, pose new challenges such as determining where these improvements should be located within the evolutionary process. Two memetic approaches are proposed with the aim of analysing and comparing their performance when dealing with a complex problem like the discovery of software architectures.	evolutionary algorithm;local search (optimization);memetic algorithm;memetics;requirement;search problem;software architect;software architecture;software metric;software system	Aurora Ramírez;Rafael Barbudo;José Raúl Romero;Sebastián Ventura	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-53480-0_43	software system;artificial intelligence;machine learning;theoretical computer science;computer science;software architecture;software;local search (optimization);software metric;evolutionary algorithm;memetic algorithm;search-based software engineering	SE	21.938013232316223	-4.672516146849237	81996

To meet the drug supply chain and transport chain requirements, three models are established to help reduce the increasing number of patients. First, we constructed the fitting model of the number of patients according to the principle of least squares. Second, based on the theory of joint managed inventory, the optimal route in the supply chain and optimal cost model are constructed. Then, according to the characteristics of the inflection of Ebola virus, dynamic model is established. In drug flow system, by applying the supply chain model to constrain the drug in different ways, the optimal allocation plan is achieved. In inter city transportation, by using the ant colony algorithm, the optimal path can be found in the same region.	mathematical model	Shujuan Yuan;Yi Zhang;Yalou Liu;Xiuli Han	2016	IJAMC	10.1504/IJAMC.2016.10001903	logistics;supply chain management;simulation;resource allocation;mathematical model;operations research;least squares	Vision	10.646779253532186	-5.728729807770228	82477

The system has shown the performance to make a plan in reasonable time, and has enabled a picking machine to automate the work of palletizing multiple kinds of loads. The developed system is successfully applied to multi-load automatic storage.	beam search;heuristic;logistics;search algorithm;software release life cycle	Seiji Koide;Shuntaro Suzuki;Sadao Degawa	1995		10.1109/IROS.1995.525933	beam search;mathematical optimization;simulation;genetic algorithm;beam stack search;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;incremental heuristic search;best-first search;search algorithm	AI	18.893415672369816	-0.08507190038181858	82533

In this problem there are restrictions on some items and conveyances so that some specific items cannot be transported through some particular conveyances. With the critical value (CV)-based reductions of type-2 fuzzy variables, a chanceconstrained programming model is formulated for the problem and then this model is converted to an equivalent deterministic form. Here, we propose a method to find nearest interval approximations for continuous type-2 fuzzy variables. A deterministic form for the problem is also obtained by applying interval analysis using the interval approximations of continuous type-2 fuzzy variables. The reduced deterministic problems are solved using a gradient based optimization – Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) technique (using LINGO solver) and Genetic Algorithm.

The combinatorial complexity of inferring the topology of the best tree makes phylogenetic inference an ideal candidate for evolutionary algorithms. However, difficulties arise when different data sets provide conflicting information about the inferred `best' tree(s). We apply the techniques of multi-objective optimisation to phylogenetic inference for the first time. We use the simplest model of evolution and a four species problem to illustrate the method.	computational phylogenetics;evolutionary algorithm	Leon Poladian;Lars S.

Considerable benefits could be gained by improving and optimizing container terminal operations. One specific challenge facing container terminals is the berth allocation problem, referred to as (BAP). In this paper, a new formulation is proposed for the dynamic berth allocation problem (DBAP). Initially the problem was formulated as a non-linear mixed integer program, followed by incorporating techniques to present an equivalent mixed integer program (MIP). A genetic algorithm (GA) heuristic was developed and applied to different instances of the problems, and through computational experiments the best, average, and worst case performances were analyzed to determine the efficiency of the algorithms.	berth allocation problem;best, worst and average case;computation;experiment;genetic algorithm;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;nonlinear system;performance	Ahmed S.

a639421a0517f5d719cc0b5767f6031d1e6d373a	introducing learning mechanism for class responsibility assignment problem		Assigning responsibilities to classes is a vital task in object-oriented design, which has a great impact on the overall design of an application. However, this task is not easy for designers due to its complexity. Though many automated approaches have been developed to help designers to assign responsibilities to classes, none of them considers extracting the design knowledge (DK) about the relations between responsibilities in order to adapt designs better against design problems. To address the issue, we propose a novel Learning-based Genetic Algorithm (LGA) for the Class Responsibility Assignment (CRA) problem. In the proposed algorithm, a learning mechanism is introduced to extract DK about which responsibilities have a high probability to be assigned to the same class, and the extracted DK is employed to improve the design qualities of generated solutions. An experiment was conducted, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	assignment problem;credit bureau;genetic algorithm;lattice gas automaton;software release life cycle	Yongrui Xu;Peng Liang;Muhammad Ali Babar	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22183-0_28	mathematical optimization;simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence	AI	20.92318842463832	-2.0867783646299585	83047
78694c9ccac632647a18794f6ba91cf1107ef707	the travelling maintainer problem: integration of condition-based maintenance with the travelling salesman problem	journal of the operational research society	The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most studied problems in the literature due to its applicability to a large number of real cases. Most variants of the TSP consider total distance travelled. This paper presents a new generalised formulation of the TSP that aims to minimise the sum of functions of latencies to cities, rather than total distance travelled. Then, a new problem that uses a special function using the latency as input is presented, called the Travelling Maintainer Problem (TMP). The TMP integrates the output of prognostics in Condition-based Maintenance (CBM) with the TSP. CBM aims to minimise the failure and maintenance cost by identifying and predicting upcoming failures through the analysis of sensory information collected in real-time. Maintenance scheduling is performed using the predicted failure information obtained from the CBM. When the systems to be maintained are geographically distributed, maintenance scheduling requires integrated analysis of travel times and their effects on the failure progression in systems. This paper also presents Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimisation-based solutions and their comparisons for the TMP on a case study.

Terminal managers confront the challenge in improving the efficiency of their service. As the most expensive equipment in a terminal, the operational performance of gantry cranes is a crucial factor. In this paper, the gantry crane scheduling problem of railway container terminals is investigated. A mixed integer programming model which considers the effect of dwelling position dependent processing times is formulated. In addition, the safety distances, the travel times and the non-crossing requirement of cranes are incorporated in the mathematical model. A novel discrete artificial bee colony algorithm is presented to solve the intractable scheduling problem. Computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithm on some randomly constructed instances based on typical terminal operational data. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can obtain near optimal solutions for the investigated problem in a reasonable computational time.

Therefore, in MOPs, the worst case might not be a single scenario but rather a set of such worst case scenarios, depending on the user preferences. The evolution of solutions based on their related sets of worst case scenarios has been recently introduced. It has been termed: """"worst case evolutionary multi-objective optimization."""" In the current paper the worst case evolutionary multi-objective optimization is further developed. In contrast to the former work where the number of possible scenarios is small and the set of worst cases can thus be easily determined, here, the number of scenarios is assumed to be large, and the worst cases are searched for by means of an embedded evolutionary search. This means that for each nominal solution, a worst set of scenarios has to be found. In the current study, the resulting front, consisting of sets of solutions' worst cases, is formally defined, and a new approach to support decision making based on it, is suggested. The new decision support poses the selection as an auxiliary MOP, highlighting the tradeoff which might result from the worst being a set and not a single point.

Generating the whole nondominated set is often unrealistic due to its size but also because most of these points are irrelevant to the decision maker. Another approach consists in obtaining preference information and integrating it a priori, in order to reduce the size of the nondominated set and have a gain in computation time. In this work we focus on a partial preference relation based on requirement and tolerance thresholds that translate the Pareto dominance cone. After introducing this preference relation, we present adaptations to use it in existing discrete multi-objective optimization algorithms.

The objective of the LORA is to minimize the total (variable and fixed) costs. We propose an IP model that generalizes the existing models, based on cases that we have seen in practice. Analysis of our model reveals that the integrality constraints on a large number of binary variables can be relaxed without yielding a fractional solution. As a result, we are able to solve problem instances of a realistic size in a couple of seconds on average. Furthermore, we suggest some improvements to the LORA analysis in the current literature.	row echelon form	Rob J. I. Basten;J. M. J.

8b8bc7a3db15fbeb6e923cbd464e147b15e00759	a heuristic simulation-based framework to improve the scheduling of blocks assembly and the production process in shipbuilding		Strong global competition in the shipbuilding market has forced shipyards to focus their efforts on optimizing their system resources. Therefore, the development of efficient medium-term and short-term operation strategies in the shipyard block assembly process is becoming a potential competitiveness tool. This paper introduces a heuristic simulation-based approach to address the scheduling problem for shipbuilding in a real-world multi-stage production system. The main goal is to minimize the total production and assembly time of the shipbuilding process (makespan) applying different types of heuristic rules in an advanced simulation framework. The proposed simulation model allows evaluation of the effective production of a large number of blocks and sub-blocks, while satisfying a large set of hard constraints. Uncertain alternative scenarios are tested and computational statistics are carefully analyzed.	assembly language;computation;computational statistics;heuristic;makespan;production system (computer science);scheduling (computing);simulation	Natalia P.

Equilibria of a game obtained by eliminating a δ-dominated strategy are guaranteed to be approximate equilibria of the original game, with degree of approximation bounded by the dominance parameter, δ. We can apply elimination of δ-dominated strategies iteratively, but the δ for which a strategy may be eliminated depends on prior eliminations. We discuss implications of this order independence, and propose greedy heuristics for determining a sequence of eliminations to reduce the game as far as possible while keeping down costs. A case study analysis of an empirical 2-player game serves to illustrate the technique, and demonstrate the utility of weaker-than-weak dominance pruning.	alpha–beta pruning;approximation algorithm;computation;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);iterated function;iteration;linear programming relaxation;order of approximation;referring expression generation	Shih-Fen Cheng;Michael P.

It is assumed that the starting depots are not prespecified. This assumption distinguishes the present work from the existing literature. A number of viewpoints are assigned to be visited in a certain sequence to minimize the total travel distance. The problem turns out to be a variant of the well-known Traveling Salesmen Problem (TSP), namely the Multidepot multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem (MmTSP). A comparison between the commonly-used pre-specified starting multidepot approach and the proposed formulation is performed and the efficacy of the results is presented through simulations.	mathematical optimization;simulation;trajectory optimization;travelling salesman problem;whole earth 'lectronic link	Walaaeldin Ghadiry;Jalal Habibi;Amir G.

Cartesian GP (CGP) is one of the extensions of GP, which generates the graph structural programs. By using the graph structure, the solutions can be represented by more compact programs. Therefore, CGP is widely applied to the various problems. As a different approach from the evolutionary algorithm, there is the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), which is an optimization method for combinatorial optimization problems based on the cooperative behavior of ants. By using pheromone communication, the promising solution space can be searched intensively. A number of ACO variants have been proposed for the various problem domains. One of them, ACO to automatic programming has been proposed recently. This new model, called Cartesian Ant Programming (CAP), is based graph representations in CGP with search mechanism of ACO. The connections of nodes are optimized by ant-based search instead of genetic operators. However, it is difficult to utilize the most part of given nodes as an effective node which are contained in the created program. In this paper, we propose a node release mechanism for CAP in order to utilize given nodes more efficiently. In the mechanism, specific nodes are set to unavailable at the start of the run. After certain step, unavailable nodes are released and all nodes become available. We compared the search performance of CAP with node release mechanism and normal CAP, and showed the effectiveness of our method.	ant colony optimization algorithms;automatic programming;cartesian closed category;combinatorial optimization;computer program;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;feasible region;genetic operator;genetic programming;mathematical optimization;node (computer science);problem domain;symbolic regression	Jun-ichi Kushida;Akira Hara;Tetsuyuki Takahama	2015	2015 IEEE 8th International Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Applications (IWCIA)	10.1109/IWCIA.2015.7449467	genetic programming;programming;mathematical optimization;ant colony optimization algorithms;meta-optimization;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;artificial intelligence;resource management;machine learning;metaheuristic	AI	22.016967830146232	-8.524641764577867	84346

KBACO algorithm provides an effective integration between Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) model and knowledge model. In the KBACO algorithm, knowledge model learns some available knowledge from the optimization of ACO, and then applies the existing knowledge to guide the current heuristic searching. The performance of KBACO was evaluated by a large range of benchmark instances taken from literature and some generated by ourselves. Final experimental results indicate that the proposed KBACO algorithm outperforms some current approaches in the quality of schedules. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

An excellent vertical traffic scheduling approach aims at enhancing the system handling capacity and reducing the waiting time, journey time and energy consumption, especially in up-peak traffic pattern. To balance workloads of elevator cars in the system is a good choice for any peak traffic. This paper proposed a novel PSO-based dynamic scheduling algorithm for vertical traffic in buildings. The service zones for elevators are determined by considering their expected round-trip time. Our preliminary simulation results show that the proposed algorithm balances the round-trip time over the elevator system and further improves the service quality of elevator system in buildings.	algorithm;experiment;group control system;natural deduction;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;qualitative comparative analysis;scheduling (computing);simulation;vehicle tracking system	Zhonghua Li;Hongzhou Tan;Yunong Zhang	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74819-9_102	fair-share scheduling;real-time computing;simulation;dynamic priority scheduling;engineering;operations management	HPC	11.339985390432698	-8.523207092965729	84693

The EAS program was established to guarantee continued air service to small communities that suffered air service losses as a result of carrier withdrawals permitted by the Deregulation Act. The model has been designed to aid decision makers in allocating subsidized air services to communities in a region, given the goal of maximizing access to the air transportation system. In order to provide information on optimal service locations, service characteristics, and patterns of access, the authors have utilized a maximal covering formulation and incorporated elements of hierarchical and weighted benefit models. In addition, a stopover service option has been included in the model to permit evaluation of potential gains in economic efficiency that may be realized by utilizing stopover service, when appropriate, in place of more costly nonstop service. In addition to the coverage objective, a second objective of systemwide cost minimization is employed. By using a multiobjective approach, the trade-offs between the conflicting objectives of coverage and cost can be explored and the spatial patterns of service associated with each combination of coverage level and cost can be examined. The model is applied to a sample study of small community air service in North and South Dakota.		John Flynn;Samuel J.

An analysis of including distributed population ideas and parallelism into the basic genetic algorithm is carried out to solve the problem accurately and efficiently. Experimental evidence in this work shows that the proposed parallel versions of the distributed algorithms outperform their sequential counterparts in time, although there are no significant differences either in the mean best values obtained or in the effort.	genetic algorithm;set packing	Carolina Salto;Enrique Alba;Juan Miguel Molina	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-78827-0_70	distributed algorithm;mathematical optimization;cultural algorithm;computer science;machine learning;genetic representation;algorithm;population-based incremental learning	AI	21.014450149795252	1.1848989343065068	84856

Since closed-form analytical solutions generally do not exist for such systems, simulation is the only faithful way for performance evaluation. From the practical engineering perspective, the designs (or solution candidates) with low complexity (called simple designs) have many advantages compared with complex designs, such as requiring less computing and memory resources, and easier to interpret and to implement. Therefore, they are usually more desirable than complex designs in the real world if they have good enough performance. Recently, Jia (IEEE Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng., vol. 8, no. 4, pp. 720-732, Oct. 2010) discussed the importance of design simplicity and introduced an adaptive simulation-based sampling algorithm to sequentially screen the designs until one simplest good enough design is found. In this paper, we consider a more generalized problem and introduce two algorithms OCBA-mSG and OCBA-bSG to identify a subset of m simplest and good enough designs among a total of K (K >; m) designs. By controlling the simulation allocation intelligently, our approach intends to find those simplest good enough designs using a minimum simulation time. The numerical results show that both OCBA-mSG and OCBA-bSG outperform some other approaches on the test problems.	algorithm;complexity;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;principle of good enough;sampling (signal processing);simulation;stochastic process	Shen Yan;Enlu Zhou;Chun-Hung Chen	2012	IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/TASE.2012.2200887	sampling;mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;marketing;machine learning;mathematics;product design;algorithm;statistics;mechanical engineering	EDA	15.842958651653063	-7.5368242802822945	85043

We investigate the performances of two different algorithms for solving the DMDGP. The first one is the Branch and Prune (BP) algorithm, an exact algorithm that is strongly based on the structure of the combinatorial problem. The second one is the Monkey Search (MS) algorithm, a meta-heuristic algorithm that is inspired by the behavior of a monkey climbing trees in search for food supplies, and that exploits ideas and strategies from other meta-heuristic searches, such Genetic Algorithms, Differential Evolution, and so on. The comparison between the two algorithms is performed on a set of instances related to protein conformations.

S. migration network. A heuristic, ”greedy” algorithm–using the β = 1 results as an initial configuration–is devised. While the largest 25,329 entries of the 735,531 non-zero entries of the bi-stochasticized table–in the β = 1 case–are required to complete the widely-applied two-stage (double-standardization and strong-component hierarchical clustering) procedure, 105,363 of the 735,531 are needed (reflective of greater uniformity of entries) in the β = 0 instance. The North Carolina counties of Mecklenburg (Charlotte) and Wake (Raleigh) are considerably relatively more cosmopolitan in the β = 0 study. The Colorado county of El Paso (Colorado Springs) replaces the Florida Atlantic county of Brevard (the ”Space Coast”) as the most cosmopolitan, with Brevard becoming the second-most. Honolulu County splinters away from the other four (still-grouped) Hawaiian counties, becoming the fifth most cosmopolitan county nation-wide. The five counties of Rhode Island remain intact as a regional entity, but the eight counties of Connecticut fragment, leaving only five counties clustered.	circuit complexity;cluster analysis;computer cluster;greedy algorithm;heuristic;hierarchical clustering;itakura–saito distance;kullback–leibler divergence;wake	Paul B.

b2d1b8d4c3e721aae96793b3ee6e61cec2acdc89	the offshore wind farm array cable layout problem: a planar open vehicle routing problem	journal of the operational research society	In an offshore wind farm, the turbines are connected to a transformer by cable routes which cannot cross each other. Finding the minimum cost array cable layout thus amounts to a vehicle routing problem with the additional constraints that the routes must be embedded in the plane. For this problem, both exact and heuristic methods are of interest. We optimize cable layouts for real-world offshore wind farms by a hop-indexed integer programming formulation, and develop a heuristic for computing layouts based on the Clarke and Wright savings heuristic for vehicle routing. Our heuristic computes layouts on average only 2% more expensive than the optimal layout. Finally, we present two problem extensions arising from real-world offshore wind farm cable layouts, and adapt the integer programming formulation to one of them. The thus obtained optimal layouts are up to 13% cheaper than the actually installed layouts.	edmund m. clarke;embedded system;heuristic;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;local search (optimization);planar graph;time complexity;transformer;vehicle routing problem	Joanna Bauer;Jens Lysgaard	2015	JORS	10.1057/jors.2013.188	simulation;economics;operations management	PL	17.519625183066083	3.7336255459197614	86088

It is assumed that a flat car may have to reserve multiple resources simultaneously at a moment during its travel. Example of the resources are transfer points (TPs) and intersections (ISs) on guide-path network.

Five systems (chromosome representation and genetic operators) are described and their suitability assessed for this application. Three of the systems use direct representations of permutations, the other two use indirect representations. Experimental results with different fitness equations, operator rates and population and replacement strategies are also given. All the systems are shown to be good at solving the problem if the algorithm parameters are correct.

The objective functions considered to model the scheduling problem are: 1) minimizing the system operation cost and 2) minimizing the emission cost. In the proposed algorithm, the chromosome is formulated as a binary unit commitment matrix (UCM) which stores the generator on/off states and a real power matrix (RPM) which stores the corresponding power dispatch. Problem specific binary genetic operators act on the binary UCM and real genetic operators act on the RPM to effectively explore the large binary and real search spaces separately. Heuristics are used in the initial population by seeding the random population with two Priority list (PL) based solutions for faster convergence. Intelligent repair operator based on PL is designed to repair the solutions for load demand equality constraint violation. The ranking, selection and elitism methods are borrowed from NSGA-II. The proposed algorithm is applied to a large scale 60 generating unit power system and the simulation results are presented and compared with our earlier algorithm [26]. The presented algorithm is found to outperform our earlier algorithm in terms of both convergence and spread in the final Pareto-optimal front.	bitwise operation;dynamic dispatch;evolutionary algorithm;genetic operator;heuristic (computer science);multi-objective optimization;pareto efficiency;rational clearcase ucm;scheduling (computing);simulation	Anupam Trivedi;Naran M.

Its scope has gone far beyond binary string optimisation using a simple genetic algorithm. Many research topics in evolutionary computation nowadays are not necessarily “genetic” or “evolutionary” in any biological sense. This talk will describe some recent research efforts in addressing several fundamental as well as more applied issues in evolutionary computation. Links with traditional computer science and artificial intelligence will be explored whenever appropriate. Evolutionary Algorithms as Generate-and-Test Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can be regarded as population-based stochastic generate-and-test [1, 2]. The advantage of formulating EAs as a generate-and-test algorithm is that the relationships between EAs and other search algorithms, such as simulated annealing (SA), tabu search (TS), hill-climbing, etc., can be made clearer and thus easier to explore and understand. Under the framework of generate-andtest, different search algorithms investigated in artificial intelligence, operations research, computer science, and evolutionary computation can be unified. Computational Time Complexity of Evolutionary Algorithms Most work in evolutionary computation has been experimental. Although there have been many reported results of EAs algorithms in solving difficult optimisation problems, the theoretical results on EA’s average computation time have been few. It is unclear theoretically what and where the real power of EAs is. It is also unclear theoretically what role a population plays in EAs. Some recent work has started tackling several fundamental issues in evolutionary computation, such as the conditions under which an EA will exhibit polynomial/exponential time behaviours [3, 4], the conditions under which a population can make a difference in terms of complexity classes [5], and the analytical tools and frameworks that facilitate the analysis of EA’s average computation time [6]. Two Heads are Better than One Although one of the key features of evolutionary computation is a population, most work did not actually exploit this. We can show through a number of examples that exploiting population information, rather than just the best individual, can lead to many benefits in evolutionary learning, e.g., improved generalisation ability [7–9] and better fault-tolerance [10].	artificial intelligence;complexity class;computer science;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary computation;fault tolerance;genetic algorithm;hill climbing;mathematical optimization;operations research;polynomial;population;search algorithm;simulated annealing;tabu search;time complexity	Xin Yao	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-45224-9_6	evolutionary programming;mathematical optimization;evolutionary music;genetic algorithm;interactive evolutionary computation;human-based evolutionary computation;cultural algorithm;java evolutionary computation toolkit;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary acquisition of neural topologies;genetic representation;evolution strategy;memetic algorithm;evolutionary computation	AI	22.532607269362217	-5.380944949569499	86821

One of the problems targeted in the investigation is that of job sequence optimization for welding robots operating in a shipyard. This is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with constraints. To solve the problem, we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm incorporating domain-specific knowledge. We demonstrate how the method is successful in solving the job sequencing problem. The effectiveness and usefulness of the algorithm is further exemplified by the fact, that it has been implemented in the RoboCopp application program, which is currently used as the task sequence scheduler in a commercially available robot programming environment.	combinatorial optimization;domain-specific language;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary computation;genetic algorithm;integrated development environment;job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;memetic algorithm;np-hardness;optimization problem;problem solving;programming paradigm;robot;scheduling (computing)	Martin Damsbo;Peder Thusgaard Ruhoff	1998		10.1007/BFb0055907	mathematical optimization;constrained optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;evolutionary algorithm;np-hard;robotics;algorithm	AI	22.606500240234706	2.775212381420487	86835

The problem can be modeled as a generalization of the prize collecting vehicle routing problem which should make both sequencing and selecting decisions. We propose tabu search-based algorithm (TS) to solve the problem. After each move in the searching procedure, the sequencing decision is adjusted to optimal by a dynamic programming algorithm which can solve up to the industrial sized problem quickly. Thus, TS procedure essentially makes the selecting decision. To further improve the TS algorithm, composite neighborhoods involving block moves are proposed. In addition, compound moves are implemented by choosing improvement strategy from variable neighborhoods alternately at each iteration. To evaluate the performance of the TS algorithm, by reformulating the problem as a set covering model with double-side inequality capacity constraints, the lower bound is constructed using a column generation algorithm where the pricing problem is solved by dynamic programming method based on derived dominance rules. From the computation results based on randomly generated instances, the average deviation between the feasible solution and lower bound is 4.2334%, thus the performance of the proposed TS algorithm and column generation is demonstrated. Alternately, another TS algorithm without DP is proposed for the possible larger scale instances.	adduct;algorithm;column generation;computation;dynamic programming;iteration;line level;procedural generation;requirement;selection algorithm;social inequality;tabu search;time complexity;vehicle routing problem	Lixin Tang;Yang Yang;Jiyin Liu	2012	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2011.2170196	algorithm design;mathematical optimization;computer science;engineering;machine learning;dynamic programming	Robotics	19.06487665848223	2.5082254490759395	87192

To date, much research has concentrated on solving standard benchmark problems such as the travelling salesman problem, quadratic assignment problem and the job sequencing problem. In this paper, we investigate the application of ant colony optimisation to practical telecommunication design and synthesis problems having real-world constraints.

79f3ed179ea899aad863d1da5be602d5c2f4df1c	column generation based approaches for combined routing and scheduling		Abstract The multi-trip location routing problem is usually applied in the logistics and transportation field. The multi-trip location routing problem is an integrated problem that combines two important and difficult optimization problems: the facility location problem and the multi-trip vehicle routing problem. In the facility location problem, one has to determine the set of facilities that can be used to serve the clients. To fulfill the clients needs, we generate a set of routes by solving a multi-trip vehicle routing problem which allows the assignment of more than one single-trip to a vehicle along the planning horizon. To solve the multi-trip location routing problem, we propose a column generation approach that integrates these two problems. In practice, both the facility location problem and the multi-trip vehicle routing problem are solved simultaneously. This approach leads to better solutions than those achieved by solving the two problems separately. Computational results are described at the end of the paper to illustrate the potential of this approach.	column generation;routing;scheduling (computing)	Bruna Ramos;Cláudio Alves;José M.

The performance of these systems heavily depends on operational success of emergency services in which emergency vehicles, medical personnel and supporting equipment and facilities are the main resources. Optimally locating and sizing of such services is an important task to enhance the responsiveness and the utilization of limited resources. In this study, an integer optimization model is presented to decide locations and types of service stations, regions covered by these stations under service constraints in order to minimize the total cost of the overall system. The model can produce optimal solutions within a reasonable time for large cities having up to 130 districts or regions. This model is tested for the EMS system of Adana metropolitan area in Turkey. Case study and computational findings of the model are discussed in detail in the paper.	algorithm;cns disorder;computation;data table;decision support system;drug vehicle;emergency medical service;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;health services;heuristic (computer science);integer (number);integer programming;large;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;mathematics;numerical analysis;optimization problem;programming model;requirement;responsiveness;simulated annealing;simulation;solutions;tabu search	Nusin Coskun;Rizvan Erol	2008	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-008-9214-0	simulation;resource allocation;computer science;type of service;emergency medical services;management	AI	12.734770572361793	-1.165422781871589	88019
8df9048f11b888f9e114d0af1141fb6f094170d5	a comparative study of solving quadratic assignment problems using some standard minlp solvers		The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) has important application areas, for example, facility layout (Dickey and Hopkins, 1972) and electronic component placement (Rabak and Sichman, 2003). The NP-hard problem already becomes difficult and time consuming to solve satisfactorily for small applications. It is therefore of interest to investigate how well standard MINLP methods can provide good solutions within a reasonable time, even though global optimality can not be guaranteed. In this study we focus on solving a subset of 50 problems in the QAP library (Burkard et al., 1997). We use a standard Mixed-Integer NonLinear Programming (MINLP) formulation modelled in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) (Rosenthal, 2010). The solution quality and solution time is evaluated for the solvers AlphaECP, Bonmin, DICOPT and SBB. We compare the solvers when a 1 hour time limit per problem is used, where the solvers are started from 3 random start points, i.e. initial variable levels. Furthermore, we investigate how well the most promising solver DICOPT performs when started from 50 random start points for 22 problems for which the global optimal solution is known.	component placement;electronic component;gams;np-hardness;nonlinear programming;quadratic assignment problem;solver	Toni Lastusilta;Tapio Westerlund	2011			combinatorics;mathematics;mathematical economics;algorithm	AI	19.007697068214778	4.0768827394650735	88342

Generating companies (suppliers) participate in the bidding process in order to maximize their profits in an electricity market. Each supplier will bid strategically for choosing the bidding coefficients to counter the competitors bidding strategy. The gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is tedious to solve the optimal bidding strategy problem because, the optimum selection of gravitational constant (G). To overcome this problem, FAGSA is applied for the first time to tune the gravitational constant using fuzzy “IF/THEN” rules. The fuzzy rule-based systems are natural candidates to design gravitational constant, because they provide a arket clearing price (MCP) uzzy inference ravitational search algorithm way to develop decision mechanism based on specific nature of search regions, transitions between their boundaries and completely dependent on the problem. The proposed method is tested on IEEE 30-bus system and 75-bus Indian practical system and compared with GSA, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA). The results show that, fuzzification of the gravitational constant, improve search behavior, solution quality and reduced computational time compared against standard constant parameter algorithms.	coefficient;computation;fuzzy rule;fuzzy set;genetic algorithm;global storage architecture;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;rule-based system;search algorithm;stochastic optimization;time complexity	J.

We ask: If such an algorithm were to periodically report, over the course of its operation, the best solution found so far, would the quality of the solution reported by the algorithm improve monotonically over time? To answer this question, we construct a simple preference relation to reason about the goodness of different individual and composite phenotypic behaviors. We then show that whether the solutions reported by the coevolutionary algorithm improve monotonically with respect to this preference relation depends upon the solution concept implemented by the algorithm. We show that the solution concept implemented by the conventional coevolutionary algorithm does not guarantee monotonic improvement; in contrast, the game-theoretic solution concept of Nash equilibrium does guarantee monotonic improvement. Thus, this paper considers 1) whether global and objective metrics of goodness can be applied to coevolutionary problem domains (possibly with open-ended search spaces), and 2) whether coevolutionary algorithms can, in principle, optimize with respect to such metrics and find solutions to games of strategy.	algorithm;game theory;nash equilibrium;nonlinear gameplay;problem domain	Sevan G.

Such models are so important that extensive studies are available, recommending different modeling techniques o be adopted for specific processes or goals. It is usual and practical to split modeling techniques under two main groups: mechanistic methods and mpirical or statistical methods. Both paradigms have been adopted, but very few frameworks were developed to combine and integrate features rom both of them. In this article we describe a framework for data-driven evolution of static mechanistic models with a selective inclusion of simple mpirical terms. To illustrate its practical potential, our framework is applied to the identification of a non-ideal reactor and to the optimization of he Otto–Williams benchmark reactor. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike previous works, we try to take advantage of the knowledge of this domain to provide a problem-specific genetic operation that improves both the speed of convergence and the quality of the results. The evaluation of the strategy is carried out by means of a case of study aimed to improve the performance of the well-known web server Apache. Experimental results show that a 7.5% overall improvement can be achieved. Furthermore, the adaptive approach has shown an ability to markedly speed-up the convergence of the original strategy.	application domain;compiler;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;performance tuning;rate of convergence;sensor;server (computing);software incompatibility;software release life cycle;web page;web server;whole earth 'lectronic link	Antonio Martínez-Álvarez;Jorge Calvo-Zaragoza;Sergio Cuenca-Asensi;Andrés Ortiz;Antonio Jimeno-Morenilla	2014	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2013.07.036	simulation;genetic algorithm;computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-objective optimization;machine learning;adaptive strategies	AI	23.820651499175575	-3.358032938789007	88384

In this paper, the yard cranes are confined to rail mounted gantry cranes (RMGC), which are characterized by the restricted traveling range on a pair of rails. Since RMGCs and yard blocks are tightly bound to each other, when allocating them, we should make sure that the RMGCs allocated for a yard activity are able to together cover the blocks allocated for the corresponding yard activity. In addition, considering that there are four basic activities occurring in the yard which compete with each other for the scarce resources and have different requirements and priorities in the allocation of blocks and yard cranes, we treat them in a single model rather than in multiple independent models as were generally done in literature. A mixed integer programming model is constructed, and an iterative decomposition solution procedure is proposed for the problem. Based on the solution procedure, a decision support system is developed and implemented for a terminal in Tianjin seaport. Using the actual data, the numerical experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision support system.	decision support system;experiment;integer programming;iterative method;linear programming;numerical analysis;programming model;requirement;semiconductor industry	Canrong Zhang;Zhi-Hai Zhang;Li Li Zheng;Lixin Miao	2011	APJOR	10.1142/S0217595911003351	simulation;decision support system;computer science;operations management	AI	14.119876404920472	2.6914183143389336	88670

Different landscape metrics can be computed and used to predict search difficulty. Yet, the metaphor falls short in visualisation terms because it is hard to represent complex landscapes, both in terms of size and dimensionality. This paper combines local optima networks, as a compact representation of the global structure of a search space, and dimensionality reduction, using the t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding algorithm, in order to both bring the metaphor to life and convey new insight into the search process. As a case study, two benchmark programs, under a genetic improvement bug-fixing scenario, are analysed and visualised using the proposed method. Local optima networks for both iterated local search and a hybrid genetic algorithm, across different neighbourhoods, are compared, highlighting the differences in how the landscape is explored.	3d rendering;benchmark (computing);blender (software);clutter;combinatorial optimization;data access;dimensionality reduction;disk mirroring;edit distance;expectation propagation;genetic algorithm;genetic improvement (computer science);genetic programming;iterated function;iterated local search;iteration;layout engine;library (computing);local optimum;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;memetic algorithm;metaheuristic;python;r language;t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding;test case;test suite	Nadarajen Veerapen;Gabriela Ochoa	2018	Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines	10.1007/s10710-018-9328-1	genetic algorithm;machine learning;artificial intelligence;computer science;fitness landscape;iterated local search;visualization;local optimum;dimensionality reduction;embedding;curse of dimensionality	AI	24.39629985474513	-6.7339307303552784	88694
1077f10d2a6c4493ab0d2afce401bfba5aaad8a5	special issue on «logistics operations management (gol2012) foreword»		We are pleased to introduce this special issue of INFOR. Preliminary versions of the papers in this special issue have been presented at the 1 IEEE International Conference on Logistics Operations Management (GOL2012), which was held in Le Havre, France, from October 17 to October 19, 2012. This new conference series aims at bringing together researchers and professionals interested in logistics not only from an technology standpoint, but also from a social sciences perspective. This multi-disciplinary approach examines the current state of the art focusing on new techniques and models relevant to the operations management of various logistics flows. The scope of the conference series covers themes such as logistics systemsmodelling, decision support systems, information systems, legal and regulatory environments, framework and control of the global logistics chain, organization of manufacturing, transport and storage operations, performance modelling and measurement, and, risk analysis and planning. In their paper, Abrache, Crainic, Gendreau and Aouam consider a general production/consumption exchange of interdependent goods, for which they investigate iterative auction mechanisms based on mathematical programming dual decomposition methods. They focus on Lagrangian relaxation and the solution of the Lagrangian dual through subgradient algorithms and the bundle method. Ouzineb, Mhada and El Allaoui propose a heuristic method based on space partitioning and tabu search to solve the buffer sizing problem in unreliable production lines with several inspection stations. In such problem, there is an unreliable production line consisting of a certain number of machines and fixed-size buffers. Thesemachines produce a single part with two different quality levels: conforming and non-conforming parts. The production line may contain inspection stations whose job is to reject the non-conforming parts from the line. The production line must meet a constant rate of demand for the conforming finished parts. The objective is tominimize the average long term combined storage and shortage costs, while also specifying the optimal location of inspection stations. Schindl and Zufferey consider a problem that consists in optimizing the refueling costs of a fleet of locomotives over a railway network. The goal consists in determining the number of trucks contracted for each yard (truck assignment problem) and to determine the refueling plan of each locomotive (fuel distribution problem), while minimizing the costs and satisfying constraints. A two-level approach is proposed to tackle this NP-hard problem. Three metaheuristics (namely a descent procedure, a tabu search, and an ant local search algorithm) are proposed for the truck assignment level, and a flow model is designed for the fuel distribution level. Benslimane and Benadada describe a solution method based on an ant colony algorithm for the multi-depot vehicle routing problem in large quantities by a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. Elhassania, El Hilali Alaoui and Boukachour study static and dynamic variants of the vehicl routing problem with time windows. The dynamic case takes into account the fact that new customers become known andmust be served, while vehicles are delivering their products. They present algorithms based on ant colony optimizationa and large neighborhood search. Wewould like to thank the authors of this special issue and all the participants of GOL2012.

It involves determining which logs to process taking into account the diameter, length, and grade of each log, on one hand, and the finished products that are needed to fulfill the orders, on the other. The cutting pattern determines which products are generated and also the yield, which is how much of the volume of the log ends as finished products. We used two approaches to solve the problem: a mathematical model, which calculates the volume and the schedule of various types of logs, and a heuristic that solves the problem by systematically applying the criteria used by a sawmill programmer in southern Chile. We compare the results of using both approaches under various scenarios in a 6week planning horizon, with the mathematical model showing a superior performance in almost all instances except two, were both found the optimal solution. The proposed mathematical model can be solved in a relatively short time, which makes it a suitable basis of a practical optimization-based decision support system.	heuristic;mathematical model;sawmill	Sergio Maturana;Enzo Pizani;Jorge Vera	2010	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2010.07.016	mathematical optimization;simulation;heuristic;decision support system;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;operations management;operating system;mathematical model;scheduling;scheduling	AI	13.551361372823763	3.572182647783879	88941
5378d422680fda88b29768a01c48b4bb86d9437b	a hybrid genetic and ant colony algorithm for finding the shortest path in dynamic traffic networks		Solving the dynamic shortest path problem has become important in the development of intelligent transportation systems due to the increasing use of this technology in supplying accurate traffic information. This paper focuses on the problem of finding the dynamic shortest path from a single source to a destination in a given traffic network. The goal of our studies is to develop an algorithm to optimize the journey time for the traveler when traffic conditions are in a state of dynamic change. In this paper, the models of the dynamic traffic network and the dynamic shortest path were investigated. A novel dynamic shortest path algorithm based on hybridizing genetic and ant colony algorithms was developed, and some improvements in the algorithm were made according to the nature of the dynamic traffic network. The performance of the hybrid algorithm was demonstrated through an experiment on a real traffic network. The experimental results proved that the algorithm proposed in this paper could effectively find the optimum path in a dynamic traffic network. This algorithm may be useful for vehicle navigation in intelligent transportation systems.	ant colony optimization algorithms;hybrid algorithm;shortest path problem	Shuijian Zhang	2018	Automatic Control and Computer Sciences	10.3103/S014641161801008X	mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;ant colony;ant colony optimization algorithms;hybrid algorithm;intelligent transportation system;computer science;shortest path problem;dijkstra's algorithm	AI	21.575293634409142	-1.9032881492021982	88948

We develop a mixed integer linear programming model for this train scheduling problem. For practical problem sizes, it seems to be impossible to directly solve the model within a reasonable amount of time. However, suitable decomposition leads to much better performance. In the first part of the decomposition, only the train type related constraints stay active. In the second part, using an optimal solution of this relaxation, we select and fix train types and try to generate a train schedule satisfying the remaining constraints. This decomposition idea provides the cornerstone for an algorithm integrating cutting planes and branch-and-bound. We present computational results for railroad networks from Germany and the Netherlands.	algorithm;branch and bound;cplex;computation;cost efficiency;cutting-plane method;experiment;integer programming;interactivity;lp-type problem;linear programming formulation;linear programming relaxation;management component transport protocol;mathematical optimization;programming model;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);solver	Thomas Lindner;Uwe T.

A multilevel decomposition of metaheuristics is proposed that allow to have a unified vision on this optimization approach. Then, a new layer based on machine learning is added to take profit from the evolution of the algorithm to adapt it to the considered problem to alleviate users efforts interested in designing and implementing metaheuristics. In other terms, the goal is to proved an alternative to implement metaheuristics. Surprisingly, when results were compared to those of other classical metaheuristics, in most of cases the proposed approach provided good results.	algorithm;machine learning;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;mutual information	Amir Nakib;Mohamed Hilia;Frederic Heliodore;El-Ghazali Talbi	2017	2017 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)	10.1109/IPDPSW.2017.137	computer science;hyper-heuristic;differential evolution;ant colony optimization algorithms;maximum likelihood;metaheuristic;mutual information;algorithm design;machine learning;mathematical optimization;parallel metaheuristic;artificial intelligence	Embedded	23.084896205199104	-5.393324331692834	89280

Many nonlinear characteristics of the generator, such as ramp rate limits, prohibited operating zone, and non-smooth cost functions are considered using the proposed method in practical generator operation. The proposed method is tested on three different systems (six-unit system considering losses, 15 units: ED considering transmission loss, large system: 40 generating units with valve-point loading effects). Furthermore, results are compared with other optimization approaches proposed in the recent literature, showing the feasibility of this technique to highly nonlinear and different ELD problem.	algorithm;bang file;dynamic dispatch;mathematical optimization	Yacine Labbi;Djilani Ben Attous	2017	Int.

Demand buses are alternative transportation vehicles, replacing traditional routing-oriented buses. In this paper, the authors address the characteristic issues, attend to the practical operations, and estimate and evaluate the trade-off strategies between usage convenience and cost management. The main idea, which is established from the features among parameters interpretatively, is to make use of visualization techniques and apply a self-organizing map (SOM) to this visualization.

To address this problem, an algorithm, called NoC design optimization based on Gaussian process model assisted differential evolution (NDPAD), is presented. Using the surrogate model-aware evolutionary search (SMAS) framework with the tournament selection based constraint handling method, NDPAD can obtain satisfactory solutions using a limited number of expensive simulations. The evolutionary search strategies and training data selection methods are then investigated to handle integer design parameters in NoC design optimization problems. Comparison shows that comparable or even better design solutions can be obtained compared to standard EAs, and much less computation effort is needed.	computation;differential evolution;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;gaussian process;mathematical optimization;network on a chip;process modeling;simulation;surrogate model;tournament selection	Mengyuan Wu;Ammar Karkar;Bo Liu;Alexandre Yakovlev;Georges G.

a6f3487add7e665de9d7798ea17a3294870f1eb5	heuristic based task scheduling in multiprocessor systems with genetic algorithm by choosing the eligible processor		In multiprocessor systems, one of the main factors of systems’ performance is task scheduling. The well the task be distributed among the processors the well be the performance. Again finding the optimal solution of scheduling the tasks into the processors is NP-complete, that is, it will take a lot of time to find the optimal solution. Many evolutionary algorithms (e.g. Genetic Algorithm, Simulated annealing) are used to reach the near optimal solution in linear time. In this paper we propose a heuristic for genetic algorithm based task scheduling in multiprocessor systems by choosing the eligible processor on educated guess. From comparison it is found that this new heuristic based GA takes less computation time to reach the suboptimal solution.	central processing unit;computation;evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;heuristic;job shop scheduling;makespan;multiprocessing;scheduling (computing);simulated annealing;simulation;software release life cycle;star trek generations;stepping level;time complexity;whole earth 'lectronic link	Probir Roy;Md.

These emerging contracting methods place an enormous pressure on the contractors to improve construction quality. For a general contractor, which subcontracts most tasks of a project and invites a number of bids, choosing an appropriate bid which satisfies the time, cost and quality of construction project is complex and challenging. To solve this problem involving conflicting objectives, a fuzzy clustering-based genetic algorithm (FCGA) approach is proposed in this paper. A case study of highway construction is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. A comparative study is conducted over three test cases involving varying dimensions and complexities to test performance of the proposed FCGA against existing approaches. Results reveal that the FCGA is capable of generating better Pareto front than other existing approaches.	cluster analysis;fuzzy clustering;genetic algorithm	Santosh Mungle;Lyès Benyoucef;Young-Jun Son;Manoj Kumar Tiwari	2013	Eng.

Many different approaches have been applied to JSSP and a rich harvest has been obtained. However, some JSSP, even with moderate size, cannot be solved to guarantee optimality. In this paper, a computationally effective team process algorithm (TPA) for solving the minimum makespan problem of job-shop scheduling is used. In the TPA system, the team numbers are divided into the elite and plain groups. The manipulations of learning and exploring are properly defined, and the member renewal rules are reasonably established. It makes the algorithm possesses the potential of global, local and directional search. Numerical results verify that the modified TPA has the properties of simple implementation, high success rate for global optimization, fast convergence, and better than the modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) with GA and GA alone. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective is to minimize the sum of the weighted time components between the moment a donor organ becomes available and its transplantation into the recipient's body. The weight factor for the elapsed time before the organ's removal from the donor body allows to assign a lower weight to this time component in the objective function in order to reflect the criticality of the process after the organ's removal. The specificity of organ transplants makes the model more complex than a traditional facility location model. The model is applied to the Belgian organ transplant path. Extensive numerical experiments reveal the key factors that impact the long-term decision of centralizing versus decentralizing transplant centers.	facility location problem;optimizing compiler	Jeroen Beliën;Liesje De Boeck;Jan Colpaert;Stijn Devesse;Filip Van den Bossche	2013	Decision Support Systems	10.1016/j.dss.2012.05.059	simulation;computer science;operations management;facility location problem;organ transplantation	ECom	11.81134948006826	-1.207802944275307	90661

To address large industrial problems, a Lagrangean scheme is proposed to decompose the MINLP of Part I according to the warehouses by dualizing the logic constraints that assign the warehouses to different customers, together with the demand constraints and factory capacity constraints. The subproblems are first approximated by an adaptive piece-wise linearization scheme that provides lower bounds, and the MILP is further relaxed to an LP to improve solution efficiency while providing a valid lower bound. An initialization scheme is designed to obtain good initial Lagrange multipliers, which are scaled to accelerate the convergence. The results from an illustrative problem and two real world industrial problems show that the method can obtain optimal or near optimal solutions in modest computational times.	approximation algorithm;computation;image scaling;lagrange multiplier;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;series acceleration	Yongheng Jiang;María Analía Rodríguez;Iiro Harjunkoski;Ignacio E.

01fcbb39a7d5afea2f5c217dec987c5af8e4f5af	constraint-handling techniques used with evolutionary algorithms		Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), when used for global optimization, can be seen as unconstrained optimization techniques. Therefore, they require an additional mechanism to incorporate constraints of any kind (i.e., inequality, equality, linear, nonlinear) into their fitness function. Although the use of penalty functions (very popular with mathematical programming techniques) may seem an obvious choice, this sort of approach requires a careful fine tuning of the penalty factors to be used. Otherwise, an EA may be unable to reach the feasible region (if the penalty is too low) or may reach quickly the feasible region but being unable to locate solutions that lie in the boundary with the infeasible region (if the penalty is too severe). This has motivated the development of a number of approaches to incorporate constraints into the fitness function of an EA. This tutorial will cover the main proposals in current use, including novel approaches such as the use of tournament rules based on feasibility, multiobjective optimization concepts, hybrids with mathematical programming techniques (e.g., Lagrange multipliers), cultural algorithms, and artificial immune systems, among others. Other topics such as the importance of maintaining diversity, current benchmarks and the use of alternative search engines (e.g., particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, evolution strategies, etc.) will be also discussed (as time allows).	artificial immune system;benchmark (computing);cultural algorithm;differential evolution;evolution strategy;evolutionary algorithm;feasible region;fitness function;global optimization;lagrange multiplier;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;nonlinear system;particle swarm optimization;social inequality;web search engine	Carlos A.

MFRSPSD simultaneously determines the route and schedule of a fleet of mobile facilities which serve customers with uncertain demand in order to minimize the total cost generated over the planning horizon. The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model, in which the first stage decision deals with the temporal and spatial movement of the MFs and the second stage handles how MFs serve customer demands. An algorithm based on the multicut version of L-shaped method is developed. The computational results show that the algorithm yields high quality upper and lower bounds within reasonable computation time for medium scale problems.	algorithm;computation;display resolution;programming model;routing;scheduling (computing);stochastic programming;time complexity	Chao Lei;Wei-Hua Lin;Lixin Miao;Mingyao Qi	2013	16th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2013)	10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728493	mathematical optimization;simulation;operations management;business	Robotics	15.330467012483187	1.853445321745563	90986

However, to date, there is a lack of effective optimization algorithms for this NP-hard problem. This paper develops a new mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model and a two-phase enumeration algorithm to improve the best-so-far exact methods for solving this problem with the objective of minimizing the makespan. A comprehensive computational experiment is performed to compare the performances of the discussed exact methods. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed MILP model and the two-phase enumeration algorithm significantly outperform the best-so-far optimization methods, and the (sub-) optimal solutions to several unsolved instances from the literature are reported.	algorithm;computation;integer programming;linear programming;makespan;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;performance;scheduling (computing);two-phase commit protocol	Kuo-Ching Ying;Chung-Cheng Lu;Shih-Wei Lin	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2834954	mathematical optimization;enumeration;job shop scheduling;computer science;distributed computing;scheduling (computing);integer programming;pharmaceutical manufacturing	AI	18.403185489641007	3.2631137426633723	91055

9b8930bb6cfe384420587a5ae263d52aa8118ed5	speed-consumption tradeoff for electric vehicle route planning	004;electric vehicles shortest paths route planning bicriteria optimization algorithm engineering	We study the problem of computing routes for electric vehicles (EVs) in road networks. Since their battery capacity is limited, and consumed energy per distance increases with velocity, driving the fastest route is often not desirable and may even be infeasible. On the other hand, the energy-optimal route may be too conservative in that it contains unnecessary detours or simply takes too long. In this work, we propose to use multicriteria optimization to obtain Pareto sets of routes that trade energy consumption for speed. In particular, we exploit the fact that the same road segment can be driven at different speeds within reasonable intervals. As a result, we are able to provide routes with low energy consumption that still follow major roads, such as freeways. Unfortunately, the size of the resulting Pareto sets can be too large to be practical. We therefore also propose several nontrivial techniques that can be applied on-line at query time in order to speed up computation and filter insignificant solutions from the Pareto sets. Our extensive experimental study, which uses a real-world energy consumption model, reveals that we are able to compute diverse sets of alternative routes on continental networks that closely resemble the exact Pareto set in just under a second—several orders of magnitude faster than the exhaustive algorithm. 1998 ACM Subject Classification G.2.2 Graph Theory, G.2.3 Applications	algorithm;computation;experiment;fastest;graph theory;köppen climate classification;mathematical optimization;online and offline;pareto efficiency;velocity (software development)	Moritz Baum;Julian Dibbelt;Lorenz Hübschle-Schneider;Thomas Pajor;Dorothea Wagner	2014		10.4230/OASIcs.ATMOS.2014.138	mathematical optimization;simulation;mathematics	AI	14.853361947177143	-1.023321142319391	91268

A genetic algorithm together with exponential desirability function is employed to determine the optimal parameter setting for TQFP encapsulation. The proposed method was implemented in a semiconductor assembly factory in Taiwan. The results from this study have proved the feasibility of the proposed approach. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In an attempt to reduce inspection costs and promote inspection scheduling predictability, the Air Force is reducing the number of C-5 Isochronal inspection (ISO) sites from five to three. C-5 ISOs require at least two weeks and involve an exhaustive inspection of the entire aircraft. AMC headquarters staff asked us to model the new ISO process to help them understand how the reduced number of ISO locations will affect inspection timeliness. We used the problem as the class project for a graduate discrete event simulation course at the Air Force Institute of Technology. We review our process and results, and present some insights on conducting simulation research as a class assignment.	advanced mezzanine card;assignment (computer science);delta iso;process modeling;scheduling (computing);simulation	Alan W.

761f8fb2cf124ad57681973f717f151dbe0613ef	an optimization approach for district heating strategic network design	graph theory;district heating;energy;linear programming;optimization	District heating systems provide the heat generated in a centralized location to a set of users for their residential and commercial heating requirements. Heat distribution is generally obtained by using hot water or steam flowing through a closed network of insulated pipes and heat exchange stations at the users’ locations. The use of optimization techniques for the strategic design of such networks is strongly motivated by the high cost of the required infrastructures but is particularly challenging because of the technical characteristics and the size of the real world applications. We present a mathematical model developed to support district heating system planning. The objective is the selection of an optimal set of new users to be connected to an existing thermal network, maximizing revenues and minimizing infrastructure and operational costs. The model considers steady state conditions of the hydraulic system and takes into account the main technical requirements of the real world application.

In spite of the commonality in production scheduling system requirements and design, different scheduling environments invariably present different challenges (e.g. different constraints, different objectives, different domain structure, etc.). The proposed methodology for building ontologies used for production scheduling systems represents a synthesis of extensive work in developing constraint-based scheduling models for a wide range of applications in manufacturing and production planning. Since the effective modeling is one of the most important and difficult steps in the development of reliable information systems, and taking into consideration the fact that the general problem of the production scheduling in the industries is very difficult and still unsolved, one can easily estimate the merit of this methodology.

71e8a69231f57f134f9634cd147e88eb046e865c	optimization of the multiechelon system for repairable spare parts using swarm intelligence combined with a local search strategy		Repairable spare parts are referred to critical and expensive components which could have failures; this type of spare parts are common in mining, military and other industries with high value physical assets. Repairable components, after a failure, can be restored to operation by a repair procedure which does not constitute an entire substitution. Many industries deploy their operations and their inventories in a geographically distributed structure. That distribution is composed by a central installation or depot and a set of bases where processes normally, take place (i.e. mining in northern Chile). This type of arrangement is called multi-echelon systems. The main concern in this type of systems is: in what number and how to distribute those expensive and critical repairable spare parts. The decision is restricted by a limited budget and the necessity of not affecting the normal operations of the system. Multi-echelon, multi-item optimization problems are known for their hardness in solving them to optimality, and therefore heuristics methods are approached to near-optimally solve such problems. The most prominent model is the Multi-Echelon Technique for Recoverable Item Control (METRIC), presented by Sherbrooke in 1968 [10]. That model has been extensively used in the military world and in the last years in others industries such aviation and mining. Through this model availability values are obtained from the performance characterization of backorders at the bases. METRIC allocates spare parts in the system on a global basis, since the METRIC model considers all locations simultaneously in the performance analysis. This work proposes the use of Particle Swarm Optimization with local search procedures to solve the multi-echelon of repairable spare parts optimization problem. The major difference between our proposal and previous works lies in that we will combine population based methods with specific local search methods The use of hybridization of non-traditional techniques to attain better optimization performance, is the main challenge of this work. No previous works have already been devoted to the use of hybridization of such techniques in such a type of problems.

Since its formulation in 1959, a great number of powerful solution methods have been designed. However, for large scale problems, few techniques are able to consistently find good solutions within an acceptable time limit. In this paper, the concept of Static Move Descriptors, a recently published technique for speeding up Local Search algorithms, is analyzed and an efficient implementation is suggested. We describe several changes that significantly improve the performance of an SMD-based Local Search algorithm. The result is an efficient and flexible technique that can easily be adapted to different metaheuristics and can be combined with other complexity reduction strategies.	heuristic;local search (optimization)	Onne Beek;Birger Raa;Wout Dullaert	2013		10.5220/0004284102770282	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;incremental heuristic search	SE	23.32357286567302	3.3655582129100767	92185

Elsewhere we have introduced the model for dealing with velocity and altitude changes in a given air sector. In this work, we extend the model to cover the important problem of coordinating the decisions of the Air Traffic Control Officers of different air sectors. The new model allows the aircraft to ascend or descend one or more altitude levels. It is so tight that a state-of-the-art mixed integer linear optimization solver provides the solution in a very affordable computing time even for large-scale instances. It is worth pointing out that only in very few pilot instances of the testbed, the software engine needs to use the branch-and-cut phase of the solver.

Within the framework of credibility theory, several fuzzy portfolio selection models have been proposed such as mean–variance model, entropy optimization model, chance constrained programming model and so on. In order to solve these nonlinear optimization models, a hybrid intelligent algorithm is designed by integrating simulated annealing algorithm, neural network and fuzzy simulation techniques, where the neural network is used to approximate the expected value and variance for fuzzy returns and the fuzzy simulation is used to generate the training data for neural network. Since these models are used to be solved by genetic algorithm, some comparisons between the hybrid intelligent algorithm and genetic algorithm are given in terms of numerical examples, which imply that the hybrid intelligent algorithm is robust and more effective. In particular, it reduces the running time significantly for large size problems. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To tackle this problem, we first propose a Gaussian process dynamic congestion model that can effectively characterize both the dynamics and the uncertainty of congestion conditions. Our model is efficient and thus facilitates real-time adaptive routing in the face of uncertainty. Using this congestion model, we develop efficient algorithms for non-myopic adaptive routing to minimize the collective travel time of all vehicles in the system. A key property of our approach is the ability to efficiently reason about the long-term value of exploration, which enables collectively balancing the exploration/exploitation trade-off for entire fleets of vehicles. Our approach is validated by traffic data from two large Asian cities. Our congestion model is shown to be effective in modeling dynamic congestion conditions. Our routing algorithms also generate significantly faster routes compared to standard baselines, and achieve near-optimal performance compared to an omniscient routing algorithm. We also present the results from a preliminary field study, which showcases the efficacy of our approach.	algorithm;field research;gaussian process;network congestion;real-time clock;routing	Siyuan Liu;Yisong Yue;Ramayya Krishnan	2015	IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering	10.1109/TKDE.2015.2411278	planning;routing;static routing;simulation;uncertainty;adaptive routing;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;multipath routing;gaussian process;slow-start;statistics	DB	12.910466823526523	-8.075074794325888	92670

The SSCMWP is a non-convex optimization problem and difficult to solve. In the SSCMWP, customer locations, customer demands and facility capacities are known a priori. The transportation costs are proportional to the distance between customers and facilities. We consider both the Euclidean and rectilinear distance cases of the SSCMWP. We first present an Alternate Location and Allocation type heuristic and its extension by embedding a Very Large Scale Neighborhood search procedure. Then we apply a Discrete Approximation approach and propose both lower and upper bounding procedures for the SSCWMP using a Lagrangean Relaxation scheme. The proposed heuristics are compared with the solution approaches from the literature. According to extensive computational experiments on standard and randomly generated test sets, we can say that they yield promising performance.	heuristic (computer science);weber problem	Temel Öncan	2013	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2013.01.005	mathematical optimization;operations management;mathematics;welfare economics	SE	16.703277988397	3.2780965534285236	92789

This study proposes risk-control approaches for two bottleneck transportation problems with random variables and preference levels to objective functions with risk parameters. Each proposed model is formulated as a multiobjective programming problem using robust-based optimization derived from stochastic chance constraints. Since it is impossible to obtain a transportation pattern that optimizes all objective functions, our proposed models are numerically solved by introducing an aggregation function for the multiobjective problem. An exact algorithm that performs deterministic equivalent transformations and introduces auxiliary problems is also developed.	randomness;transportation theory (mathematics)	Takashi Hasuike	2014	J.

Replacing traditional crossover and mutation operators by building and sampling a probabilistic model of promising solutions enables the use of machine learning techniques for automatic discovery of problem regularities and exploitation of these regularities for effective exploration of the search space. Using machine learning in optimization enables the design of optimization techniques that can automatically adapt to the given problem. There are many successful applications of PMBGAs, for example, Ising spin glasses in 2D and 3D, graph partitioning, MAXSAT, feature subset selection, forest management, groundwater remediation design, telecommunication network design, antenna design, and scheduling.  The tutorial Probabilistic Model-Building GAs will provide a gentle introduction to PMBGAs with an overview of major research directions in this area.

The simulation is capable of modeling a non-linear and stochastic problem. GA are one of the commonly used metaheuristics and are a proven tool for solving complex optimization problems. The proposed GA simulation approach addresses a complex MACD problem. Its solution quality is illustrated by a case study from a multi-layer ceramic capacitor (MLCC) manufacturing plant. Because GA search results are often sensitive to the search parameters, this research optimized the GA parameters by using regression analysis. Empirical results showed that the GA simulation approach outperformed several commonly used dispatching rules. The improvements are ranging from 33% to 61%. On the other hand, the increased shop-floor-control complexity may hinder the implementation of the system. Finally, future research directions are discussed.	decision problem;genetic algorithm;simulation	Taho Yang;Yiyo Kuo;Chiwoon Cho	2007	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2005.10.048	mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;combinatorial optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;operations management;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	15.132618941804026	-3.8256544411039646	93290
a99cf345018bb5530605b4eaac499d3acdfb177a	promoting sustainability of automotive products through strategic assortment planning		Assortment planning seeks to find an optimal set of products that the company should offer to its customers. Traditionally, it is a trade-off between offering lar ger assortments to maximize customer choice vs. smaller assortments to minimize costs associated with design, manufacturing, and distribution. Existing assortment planning models are quite lacking when it comes to configurable products such as automobiles and detail level of supply chain considerations. Further complications stem from increasingly strict environmental regulations and broader expectations for sustainable products and supply chains. We present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for integrated assortment and supply chain network design models for automotive products to provide effective decision support and directional guidance to strategic product planners. Our models account for product use and supply chain emissions as well as fuel efficiency requirements.

55767777445e0b826a09b7a5ee45613aca787203	bees swarm optimization for web information foraging		The present work is related to Web intelligence and more precisely to Wisdom Web foraging. The idea is to learn the localization of the most relevant Web surfing path that might interest the user. We propose a novel approach based on bees behaviour for information foraging. We implemented the system using a colony of cooperative reactive agents. In order to validate our proposal, experiments were conducted on MedlinePlus, a benchmark dedicated for research in the domain of Health. The results are promising either for those related to some Web regularities and for the response time, which is very short and hence complies with the real time constraint.	information foraging;swarm	Yassine Drias;Samir Kechid	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-13817-6_20	bees algorithm	ML	24.54965732144946	-5.145240389407345	93521

In this article a sequencing approach is proposed for train scheduling on parallel lines separated by crossover points. The primary feature that is introduced is a modeling device called a compound buffer that is very powerful, particularly because it has widespread applicability. It may be used to maintain the correct occupancy levels of lines while allowing trains to pass through the crossover points without additional routing decisions. The compound buffer is a collection of machines that collectively acts as a traditional capacitated buffer. The machines that are part of the compound buffer, however, maintain their independence and are not treated differently in the scheduling process. To demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of this new approach, a variety of typical railway infrastructure were considered. Extensive numerical investigations show that the approach successfully and consistently creates train schedules of high quality. It also shows that compound buffers accurately portray the technical constraints of the real system.	algorithm;crew scheduling;disjunctive normal form;display resolution;increment and decrement operators;instruction creep;iterative method;mind;nl-complete;numerical analysis;point of view (computer hardware company);primary source;protocol buffers;ring counter;routing;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);simulation	Robert L.

74ca53be26664ea99527a6cb21a8289fb65209da	an optimization model for 3d pipe routing with flexibility constraints		Optimizing the layout of the equipment and connecting pipes that form a chemical plant is an important problem, where the aim is to minimize the total cost of the plant while ensuring its safety and correct operation. The complexity of this problem is such that it is still solved manually, taking multiple engineers several years to complete. Most research in this area focuses on the simpler subproblem of placing the equipment, while the approaches that take pipe routing into account are either based on heuristics or do not consider sufficiently realistic scenarios. Our work presents a new model of the pipe routing subproblem that integrates realistic requirements, such as flexibility constraints, and aims for optimality while solving the largest problem instance considered in the literature. The model is being developed in collaboration with Woodside Energy Ltd. for their Liquefied Natural Gas plants, and is implemented in the high-level modeling language MiniZinc. The use of MiniZinc has both reduced the amount of time required to develop the model, and allowed us to easily experiment with different solvers.	routing	Gleb Belov;Tobias Czauderna;Amel Dzaferovic;Maria Garcia de la Banda;Michael Wybrow;Mark Wallace	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-66158-2_21	modeling language;total cost;mathematical optimization;heuristics;computer science;chemical plant	Robotics	12.686227631831771	2.7279374111794485	93665
2438e8a2fa053a8d4b07ea3cc00ec55ed255a3da	hybrid biogeography-based optimization for solving vendor managed inventory system		In the modern era of industrialization and globalization, distribution and control of goods are essential aspects for multinational corporations and strategic partners. Vendor managed inventory (VMI) is one of the well-known strategies of merchandizing between supplier and retailer. In this paper, we consider different number of suppliers and retailers to perform business under VMI system and formulate three: single-supplier and single-retailer, single-supplier and multi-retailer, and multi-supplier and multi-retailer VMI systems. The objective is to minimize the total cost of VMI system. Since it is a non-linear integer programming problem, this paper proposes a novel hybrid biogeography-based optimization algorithm to solve it. We enhance the proposed algorithm by embedding stochastic fractal search (SFS) in biogeography-based optimization (BBO). SFS algorithm is a newly developed powerful evolutionary algorithm to find global optimum much faster and efficiently. The diffusion process of SFS improved the exploitation ability of search in BBO. Our proposed algorithm is applied on all three versions of VMI systems under different constraints. We have considered suitable input data for all the different problems and obtained the results. By comparison, we show that the results outperformed for all VMI systems.	black bag operation;british informatics olympiad;clustered file system;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;fractal;global optimization;integer programming;inventory;local optimum;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;operating system;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Zubair Ashraf;Deepika Malhotra;Pranab K.

We present a technique to solve in an exact and optimal way the pick-up and delivery problem under the typical assumptions of intermodal transportation: full truck load, split delivery, clustered backhauls, and time windows. The method allows limiting the distance traveled by road, enabling to match a delivery with a pick-up request, while respecting customers' service time windows, vehicles availability, and rental needs. Thus, intermodal companies can manage vehicle routing and scheduling problems in an integrated way. The technique effectiveness is shown by a real case study.	backhaul (telecommunications);hard time;microsoft windows;network congestion;performance;pick operating system;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;vehicle routing problem	Mariagrazia Dotoli;Nicola Epicoco	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2016.7844300	simulation	Robotics	13.00333532781335	0.9332175392973427	93902

The proposed method does not use a penalty function and it builds surrogates for the objective and constraint functions. Each parent generates a large number of trial offspring in each generation. Then, the surrogate functions are used to identify the trial offspring that are predicted to be feasible with the best predicted objective function values or those with the minimum number of predicted constraint violations. The objective and constraint functions are then evaluated only on the most promising trial offspring from each parent, and the method proceeds in the same way as in a standard EP. In the numerical experiments, the type of surrogate used to model the objective and each of the constraint functions is a cubic radial basis function (RBF) augmented by a linear polynomial. The resulting RBF-assisted EP is applied to 18 benchmark problems and to an automotive problem with 124 decision variables and 68 black-box inequality constraints. The proposed method is much better than a traditional EP, a surrogate-assisted penalty-based EP, stochastic ranking evolution strategy, scatter search, and CMODE, and it is competitive with ConstrLMSRBF on the problems used.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);black box;cubic function;decision theory;evolution strategy;evolutionary programming;expectation propagation;experiment;loss function;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;penalty method;polynomial;program optimization;radial (radio);radial basis function;social inequality;surrogates	Rommel G.

Hence, usually companies are not only interested in finding the best ways to schedule their current resources so that their benefits are maximized (optimization), but, in order to increase the productivity, they also conduct some analysis to find bottlenecks in their system and eliminate them in the most efficient way (e.g., with the lowest investment). We show that the current frequently used analysis (based on average shadow price) for identifying bottlenecks has some limitations: (1) it is limited to linear constraints, (2) it does not consider all potential sources for bottlenecks in a system, and (3) it does not provide adequate tools for decision makers to find the best way of investment to eliminate bottlenecks and maximize the profit they can gain. We propose a more comprehensive definition of bottlenecks that covers these limitations. Based on the new definition, we propose a multi-objective model for the benefit and investment. The solution for this model provides the best way of investment in resources to achieve maximum profit. As the proposed model is multi-objective and non-linear, it opens an important opportunity for the application of evolutionary algorithms, which can consequently lead to a significant impact on the decision making process of companies.	bottleneck (software);coefficient;decision support system;evolutionary algorithm;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;reza iravani;shadow price;world-system	Mohammad Reza Bonyadi;Zbigniew Michalewicz;Markus Wagner	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-13563-2_37	feasibility study;mathematical optimization;shadow price;management science	EDA	11.623198976016713	1.255271126218495	94761

Results from ergonomics [2] indicate that rotating workforce schedules have a profound impact on the health and satisfaction of employees as well as on their performance at work. Moreover, rotating workforce schedules must satisfy legal requirements and should also meet the objectives of the employing organization. We describe our solution to this problem. A basic design decision was to aim at quickly obtaining high-quality schedules for realistically sized problems while maintaining human control. The interaction between the decision maker and the algorithm therefore consists in four steps: (1) choosing a set of lengths of work blocks (a work block is a sequence of consecutive days of work shifts), (2) choosing a particular sequence of work and days-o blocks among those that have optimal weekend characteristics, (3) enumerating possible shift sequences for the chosen work blocks subject to shift change constraints and bounds on sequences of shifts, and (4) assignment of shift sequences to work blocks while ful lling the staÆng requirements. The combination of constraint satisfaction and problem-oriented intelligent backtracking algorithms in each of the four steps allows to nd good solutions for real-world problems in acceptable time. Computational results from a real-world problem and from a benchmark example found in the literature con rm the viability of our approach. The algorithms have been implemented in a commercial shift scheduling software.	algorithm;backtracking;benchmark (computing);computation;constraint satisfaction;display resolution;human factors and ergonomics;local search (optimization);naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;requirement;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing)	Nysret Musliu;Johannes Gärtner;Wolfgang Slany	2002	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/S0166-218X(01)00258-X	decision-making;mathematical optimization;simulation;constraint satisfaction;computer science;mathematics;management science;algorithm;backtracking;satisfiability	SE	13.332349823858637	1.975876931688302	95001
4da9a20161e948b228675dc644e645e39ca97793	a greedy biogeography-based optimization algorithm for job shop scheduling problem with time lags		This paper deals with the Job shop Scheduling problem with Time Lags (JSTL). JSTL is an extension of the job shop scheduling problem, where minimum and maximum time lags are introduced between successive operations of the same job. We propose a combination between Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm and Greedy heuristic for solving the JSTL problem with makespan minimization. Biogeography-Based optimization is an evolutionary algorithm which is inspired by the migration of species between habitats. BBO has successfully solved optimization problems in many different domains and has reached a relatively mature state using two main steps: migration and mutation. Good performances of the proposed combination between Greedy and BBO algorithms are shown through different comparisons on benchmarks of Fisher and Thompson, Lawrence and Carlier for JSTL problem.	greedy algorithm;job shop scheduling;scheduling (computing)	Madiha Harrabi;Olfa Belkahla Driss;Khaled Ghédira	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-94120-2_47	artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematical optimization;evolutionary algorithm;scheduling (computing);job shop;biogeography-based optimization;job shop scheduling;computer science;algorithm;metaheuristic;greedy algorithm;optimization problem	Theory	23.3811949437451	-1.7080367409462631	95021

PDMOSA algorithm uses a strategy of Pareto dominant based fitness in the acceptance criteria of simulated annealing and is improved. In all algorithms, the current solution explores its neighborhoods in a way similar to that of classical simulated annealing. The performance and computational cost for all algorithms have been studied. All algorithms are found to be quite robust with algorithmic parameters and are capable of generating a large number of well diversified Pareto-optimal solutions. The quality and diversification of Pareto-optimal solutions generated by all algorithms are found to be problem specific. The computational cost is least by WMOSA and is followed by PDMOSA. The algorithms are simple to formulate and require reasonable computational time. Hence, the simultaneous use of all algorithms is suggested to obtain a wider spectrum of efficient solutions. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

68abf799abc2575053c60e8c0bc3a0d24863d498	a multi-objective genetic algorithm for assembly line resource assignment and balancing problem of type 2 (alrabp-2)	cycle time;precedence and compatibility constraints;assembly line balancing;hybrid multi objective genetic algorithm;cost per hour	This paper presents a new extension of SALBP-2, so called assembly line resource assignment and balancing problem of type 2 (ALRABP-2). Two main differences from the existing literature are revealed in this work. The first is on the objective function which is a multiple one. It is aimed here to minimize both the cycle time and the cost per time unit (hour) of a line for a fixed number of stations to satisfy the constraints of precedence between tasks and compatibility between resources. The second difference lies in the proposed method to solve this problem. A new version of multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) called hybrid MOGA (HMOGA) is elaborated. Full experiment design is used to obtain a better MOGA parameters combination. The effectiveness of the HMOGA was assessed through a set of literature problems. The performance of HMOGA shows a good quality of the fronts generated and a better problem-solving capacity for two optimisations.	genetic algorithm;nsa product types	Hager Triki;Ahmed Mellouli;Faouzi Masmoudi	2017	J.

To test the validity and usefulness of COREA, we simulate three knowledge sharing climates in which the majority of CoPs performs below-, on-, or above-average. In addition, we also allow knowledge sharing activity of CoPs to improve or deteriorate over years in each climate. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed COREA system performs significantly better than the currently available reward system over various scenarios. In particular, the COREA system finds approximately optimal financial reward allocations for many cases in which the current reward system fails to find solutions that meet constraints.	algorithm;c object processor;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;np-completeness;optimization problem;performance evaluation;requirement;responsiveness;simulation	Suchul Lee;Euiho Suh;Yong Seog Kim	2012			management science;knowledge management;computer science;reward system;knowledge sharing;finance	AI	14.022348496259376	-2.384145847542081	95467

The six components of the airplane are to be produced in different European cities. They need to be transported from these cities to Toulouse, France, for assembly, and several means of transportation have been investigated. The sizes of the freights, the length of the itinerary, and the narrowness of the critical passages constitute a challenge that classical transportation techniques in the domain of oversized convoys cannot easily overcome. Therefore, Airbus and the French national agency in charge of road management launched a research and development project divided into two parts. The objective of the first part is to adapt functions first to develop for mobile robots to the complex kinematics of trailer-truck systems and integrating these functions into a software platform. The second part of the project aims to define and develop a computer-aided driving system on board the vehicles in order to help the drivers carry out their task. This paper provides a brief overview of the state of the art in trajectory planning for mobile robots and vehicles, and discusses the development of original solutions to address both the kinematic complexity of one of the vehicles and the need to optimize the distance to obstacles.	assembly language;lock convoy;mathematical optimization;mobile robot;trajectory optimization	Florent Lamiraux;Jean-Paul Laumond;Carl Van Geem;Daniel Boutonnet;Gilbert Raust	2005	IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine	10.1109/MRA.2005.1411414	mobile robot;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;automotive engineering;transport engineering	Robotics	10.749862744155056	0.9712494511110935	96232
24626ef47900e65f1ad108b485b8570325aa1e63	clustering of maintenance tasks for the danish railway system		Clustering of maintenance tasks for the danish railway system Standardisation of the European rail traffic signalling system is an ongoing project for faster travel within the EU, which entails very strict time limits and constraints on recovery operations. Denmark will be the first country to upgrade its entire signalling system to implement the new standards. In this paper, we present a mathematical model for allocation of maintenance tasks to maintenance team members, which is a variant of the Generalized Assignment Problem. The aim is to optimise the following three criteria: (i) the total distance travelled from depots to tasks, (ii) the maximal distance between any maintenance task and its allocated crew member, and (iii) the imbalance in workload among crew members. As test cases, we use a set of instances that simulate the distribution of tasks in the Jutland peninsula, the largest region of Denmark.		Shahrzad M.

d5ce656720590ba898c8fb4ab859243cc0f9d0cf	adapting the hypervolume quality indicator to quantify trade-offs and search efficiency for multiple criteria decision making using pareto fronts	hypervolume;search method assessment;characterizing trade offs;multiple response criteria optimization;pareto optimization search	When choosing a best solution based on simultaneously balancing multiple objectives, the Pareto front approach allows promising solutions across the spectrum of user preferences for the weightings of the objectives to be identified and compared quantitatively. The shape of the complete Pareto front provides useful information about the amount of trade-off between the different criteria and how much compromise is needed from some criterion to improve the others. Visualizing the Pareto front in higher (3 or more) dimensions becomes difficult, so a numerical measure of this relationship helps capture the degree of trade-off. The traditional hypervolume quality indicator based on subjective scaling for multiple criteria optimization method comparison provides an arbitrary value that lacks direct interpretability. This paper proposes an interpretable summary for quantifying the nature of the relationship between criteria with a standardized hypervolume under the Pareto front (HVUPF) for a flexible number of optimization criteria, and demonstrates how this single number summary can be used to evaluate and compare the efficiency of different search methods as well as tracking the search progress in populating the complete Pareto front. A new HVUPF growth plot is developed for quantifying the performance of a search method on completeness, efficiency, as well as variability associated with the use of random starts, and offers an effective approach for method assessment and comparison. Two new enhancements for the algorithm to populate the Pareto front are described and compared with the HVUPF growth plot. The methodology is illustrated with an optimal screening design example, where new Pareto search methods are proposed to improve computational efficiency, but is broadly applicable to other multiple criteria optimization problems.

The scheduling-based family, as one branch of RIFD reader collision avoidance methods, focuses on the allocation of time slots and frequency channels to RFID readers. Generally, the RFID reader-to-reader collision avoidance model can be translated as an optimization problem related with the communication resource allocation by maximizing the total effective interrogation area. Artificial immune networks are emerging heuristic evolutionary algorithms, which have been broadly applied to scientific computing and engineering applications. Since the first version of artificial immune networks for optimization occurred, a series of revised or derived artificial immune networks have been developed which aim at capturing more accurate solutions at higher convergence speed. For the RFID reader-to-reader collision avoidance model, this paper attempts to investigate the performance of six artificial immune networks in allocating communication resources to multiple readers. By following the spirits of artificial immune networks, the corresponding major immune operators are redesigned to satisfy the practice of RFID systems. By taking into account the effects of time slots and frequency channels, respectively, two groups of simulation experiments are arranged to examine the effectiveness of different artificial immune networks in optimizing the total effective interrogation area. Besides, a group of examination is executed to investigate the performance of six algorithms in solving different dimensionality of solution space in reader collision avoidance model. Meanwhile, a single group of simulation experiments are arranged to examine the computational efficiency of six artificial immune networks. The results demonstrate that six artificial immune networks perform well in searching the maximum total effective interrogation and are suitable to solve the RFID reader-to-reader collision avoidance model. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.	collision detection;collision problem;computation;computational science;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;feasible region;heuristic;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;profiling (computer programming);radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;scheduling (computing);simulation	Zhonghua Li;Jianming Li;Shanjin Wang;Chengpei Tang;Minghua Xia	2015	Appl.

b78e1258d86217cf05d1fe8150ff6d15cac4cab7	nga-lp: a robust and improved genetic algorithm to detect communities in directed networks		Understanding the community structure of realworld networks is an important task to predict the dynamics of many complex systems. To this end, several optimization methods were developed to maximize the widely studied measure known as Modularity. Most of these methods use global information and, therefore, are computationally expensive to process large-scale networks. This paper proposes a genetic algorithm to detect communities in directed networks, named NGA-LP, that contains local genetic operators designed to have low computational cost. The primary advantage of NGA-LP is the local representation, where the vertices store the information of the individuals. This representation makes possible the use of local genetic operators which do not require global information. Moreover, NGA-LP combines a pair of crossover operators that are automatically chosen according to the characteristics of the network, guided by the quality of the solution. The goal of combining different crossover operators is to ensure the robustness and capability of handling with different networks in an adaptive fashion. In the computational tests carried out in this paper, the introduced algorithm achieved excellent results and outperformed the other benchmark algorithms, even for undirected networks.	algorithmic efficiency;analysis of algorithms;benchmark (computing);complex systems;computation;genetic algorithm;genetic operator;graph (discrete mathematics);mathematical optimization;modularity (networks);next-generation access;robustness (computer science);semantic network	Rodrigo Francisquini;Mariá Cristina Vasconcelos Nascimento;Márcio P.

The structure and parameters of the nonlinear models are selected simultaneously as result of the conjoint usage of customized genetic operators and of a deterministic parameter computation procedure. This symbiosis is configured to efficiently exploit the nonlinear, linear in parameters formalism, a proven universal approximator, according to which the models are generated. In order to protect useful model terms from fragmentation via crossover, the authors have introduced a novel encapsulation mechanism supervised by a fuzzy controller. To meet the specific requirements of systems identification in engineering applications, the optimization procedure considers two evaluation criteria, namely accuracy and parsimony, exploited from an elitist standpoint. The approach also features an original similarity analysis technique, meant to encourage population diversity. The practical efficiency of the proposed identification algorithm was tested in the framework of a real life industrial system.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;crossover (genetic algorithm);encapsulation (networking);evolutionary algorithm;experiment;fragmentation (computing);genetic operator;genetic programming;mathematical optimization;maximum parsimony (phylogenetics);multi-objective optimization;nonlinear system;occam's razor;partial template specialization;performance;real life;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);semantics (computer science);universal approximation theorem	Alina Patelli;Lavinia Ferariu	2010	2010 5th IEEE International Conference Intelligent Systems	10.1109/IS.2010.5548346	control engineering;mathematical optimization;machine learning;mathematics	Robotics	23.662333256740745	-9.6476205624777	97035

First we compare Lamarckian and Baldwinian with each other. Experimental results show that the Baldwinian repair outperforms the Lamarckian repair. It is also shown that these repair schemes outperform a penalty function approach. Then we examine partial Lamarckianism where the Lamarckian repair is applied to each individual with a prespecified probability. Experimental results show that a so-called 5% rule works well. Finally partial Lamarckianism is compared with an island model with two subpopulations where each island has a different repair scheme. Experimental results show that the island model slightly outperforms the standard single-population model with the 50% partial Lamarckian repair in terms of the diversity of solutions.	computation;experiment;knapsack problem;penalty method;population model	Hisao Ishibuchi;Shiori Kaige;Kaname Narukawa	2005		10.1007/978-3-540-31880-4_26	mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;mathematics;algorithm	AI	23.754167128097578	-0.6761413100546465	97050

This paper deals with a novel real-world optimization problem, called the 'Item-location assignment problem', faced by a logistics company in Shenzhen, China. The objective of the company in this particular operation is to assign items to suitable locations such that the sum of the total traveling time of the workers required for all orders is minimized. We propose to use a stochastic search technique called fuzzy logic guided genetic algorithms (FLGA) to solve this operational problem. In GA, a specially designed crossover operation, called a shift and uniform based multi-point (SUMP) crossover, and swap mutation are adopted. Furthermore, the role of fuzzy logic is to dynamically adjust the crossover and mutation rates after each ten consecutive generations. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the FLGA and make a comparison with the FLGA through simulations, several search methods, branch and bound, standard GA (i.e. without the guide of fuzzy logic), simulated annealing, and tabu search, are adopted. Results show that the FLGA outperforms the other search methods in the considered scenario.	assignment problem;branch and bound;crossover (genetic algorithm);fuzzy logic;genetic algorithm;horner's method;logistics;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;paging;simulated annealing;simulation;software release life cycle;stochastic optimization;tabu search	Henry C.

5c27b48d1aa884ab50f74edb29125430bd9b010b	satellite data download management with uncertainty about the generated volumes	assignment;constraint based local search;reactive planning;scheduling	Earth observation satellites are space sensors which acquire data, compress and record it on board, and then download it to the ground. Because of the use of more and more sophisticated compression algorithms, the amount of data resulting from an acquisition is more and more unpredictable. In such conditions, planning satellite data download activities offline on the ground is more and more problematic. In this paper, we report the results of a work aiming at evaluating the positive impact of planning downloads onboard when the amount of data produced by each acquisition is known. The data download problem to be solved is an assignment and scheduling problem with unsharable resources, sequences of activities, precedence constraints, time-dependent minimum durations, and a complex optimization criterion. The generic InCELL library (Pralet and Verfaillie 2013a)) is used to model constraints and criterion, to check non temporal constraints, to propagate temporal constraints, and to evaluate the optimization criterion. On top of this library, greedy and local search algorithms have been designed to produce download plans with limited time and computing resources available on board.	automated planning and scheduling;autonomous robot;data compression;download;greedy algorithm;image resolution;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;microsoft windows;online and offline;scheduling (computing);search algorithm;sensor;software propagation	Cédric Pralet;Gérard Verfaillie;Adrien Maillard;Emmanuel Hebrard;Nicolas Jozefowiez;Marie-José Huguet;Thierry Desmousceaux;Pierre Blanc-Paques;Jean Jaubert	2014			mathematical optimization;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;assignment;reactive planning;scheduling	AI	15.166370967878334	-1.6028764672856068	97178

The effectiveness of a VANET largely depends on the density and location of these RSUs. During the initial stages of VANET, it will not be possible to deploy a large number of RSUs either due to the low market penetration of VANET-enabled vehicles or due to the deployment cost of RSUs. There is, therefore, a need to optimally place a limited number of RSUs in a given region in order to achieve maximum performance. In this paper, we present two different optimization methods for placement of a limited number of RSUs in an urban region: an analytical Binary Integer Programming (BIP) method and a novel Balloon Expansion Heuristic (BEH) method. BIP method utilizes branch and bound approach to find an optimal analytical solution whereas BEH method uses balloon expansion analogy to find an optimal or near optimal solution. Our evaluations show that both methods perform optimally or near optimally compared with the exhaustive method. Further, BEH method is more versatile and performs better than BIP method in terms of computational cost and scalability.	algorithmic efficiency;branch and bound;heuristic;heuristic (computer science);hoc (programming language);integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;scalability;software deployment;tracing (software)	Baber Aslam;Muhammad Faisal Amjad;Cliff Changchun Zou	2012	2012 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2012.6249333	vehicular ad hoc network;simulation;integer programming;computer science;computer network;placement	AI	15.089329642991334	-0.10835146315165514	97204

The methodology includes a mathematical model which describes the characteristics of the integrated supply chain and an efficient genetic search algorithm. The objective is to minimize the total operating cost. Unlike canonical genetic algorithms, individuals of the proposed genetic algorithm have the ability to learn from their ancestors in order to enhance the convergence speed and the quality of the final solution. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by solving a set of randomly generated problems. Comparison of the results obtained with that of a conventional genetic algorithm clearly shows that the proposed algorithm is superior to the conventional genetic algorithm. The proposed methodology is described in some details in the hope of thus stimulating the use of similar methodology to the solution of other important problems in industrial engineering practice.

So far, researchers have pre-specified a separate representation for shaping and value functions in multi-task settings. However, no work has made precise what distinguishes these representations, or what makes a good representation for either function. This paper shows two alternative methods by which an evolutionary algorithm can find a shaping function in multi-task RL without pre-specifying a separate representation. The second method, which uses an indirect fitness measure, is demonstrated to achieve similar performance to the first against a significantly lower computational cost. In addition, we define a formal categorisation of representations that makes precise what makes a good representation for shaping and value functions. We validate the categorisation with an evolutionary feature selection method and show that this method chooses the representations that our definitions predict are suitable.	algorithmic efficiency;categorization;computation;computer multitasking;evolutionary algorithm;feature selection;noise shaping;reinforcement learning	Matthijs Snel;Shimon Whiteson	2009		10.1145/1830483.1830671	mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;mathematics;feature selection;reinforcement learning	ML	21.154524879077165	-6.87620688929301	97458

This dissertation has developed an integrated traffic control system for evacuation operations that may require concurrent implementation of different control options, including traffic routing, contraflow operation, staged evacuation, and intersection signal control. The system applies a hierarchical control framework to achieve a trade-off between modeling accuracy and operational efficiency for large-scale network applications. The network-level optimization formulations function to assign traffic to different evacuation corridors, select lane reversal configurations for contraflow operations, and identify the evacuation sequence of different demand zones for staged evacuation. With special constraints to approximate flow interactions at intersections, the formulations have introduced two network enhancement approaches with the aim to capture the real-world operational complexities associated with contraflow operations and staged evacuation. The corridor-level optimization formulations, taking the network-level decisions as input, function to identify the critical control points and generate the optimal signal timings along the major evacuation corridors. The formulations feature the critical intersection concept to reduce the interference of side-street traffic on arterial evacuation flows. This study has also developed an efficient solution method using the Genetic Algorithm based heuristics along with an embedded macroscopic simulator. This dissertation has also proposed a revised cell transmission model that aims to capture the complex temporal and spatial interactions of evacuation traffic flows for both levels of optimization formulations. This model can significantly reduce the size of the optimization problem, and yet preserve the ability in effectively modeling network traffic dynamics. Numerical studies were conducted for each individual control component as well as for the entire integrated control system. The results reveal that the staged evacuation and contraflow strategies generated from the proposed formulations can substantially improve the evacuation efficiency and effectively reduce network congestions. Signal control strategies with the critical intersection concept also outperform the state-of-the-practice evacuation signal plans.

Bat intelligence is a novel optimization method that models prey hunting behaviors of bats. Bat intelligence and genetic algorithm (GA) are used to solve single-objective multiprocessor scheduling problem using, makespan, tardiness, and energy consumption as objective functions. Bat intelligence shows considerable improvement in terms of solution quality when compared with GA. Different combinations of these objectives are used to solve bi-objective multiprocessor scheduling problems, (makespan vs. energy, and also tardiness vs. energy). Tri-objective multiprocessor scheduling problem is also presented at the end. To generate desirable efficient alternatives, a Normalized Weighted Additive Utility Function is used. Simulation shows that BI identifies a set of efficient solutions that correspond to the assigned weights. The computational simulation also shows conflicting relationships between makespan and energy, and also between tardiness and energy.	multiprocessing;multiprocessor scheduling;scheduling (computing)	Behnam Malakooti;Shaya Sheikh;Camelia Al-Najjar;Hyun Jin Kim	2013	J.

The proposed idea is grounded on the concept of prioritizing the sub-projects' scheduling based on: a) the number of external (to other sub-projects) relations and b) the resource requirements as compared to the resource shortage for each resource type and each sub-project. The implementation uses the Genetic Algorithm to deal with the classification and prioritization of the projects to be scheduled and the inner ACO algorithm, to perform the activity list optimization for each project. The proposed method was validated using a consistent number of PSP Lib[l] data sets.	ant colony optimization algorithms;emoticon;genetic algorithm;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;requirement;scheduling (computing)	Elena Rokou;Manos Dermitzakis;Konstantinos Kirytopoulos	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management	10.1109/IEEM.2014.7058717	fair-share scheduling;nurse scheduling problem;mathematical optimization;ant colony optimization algorithms;earliest deadline first scheduling;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;engineering;rate-monotonic scheduling;operations management;genetic algorithm scheduling;two-level scheduling;distributed computing;round-robin scheduling;schedule	Robotics	19.781284102859193	-0.29614313123508573	97757

5b0e0b7d7bf289d1258ff446f3fe37bcfeee0eb7	integrated use of fuzzy c-means and convex programming for capacitated multi-facility location problem	convex programming;capacitated multi facility location problem;fuzzy c means	In this study a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm based method is proposed for solving a capacitated multi-facility location problem of known demand points which are served from capacitated supply centres. It involves the integrated use of fuzzy c-means and convex programming. In fuzzy c-means, data points are allowed to belong to several clusters with different degrees of membership. This feature is used here to split demands between supply centers. The cluster number is determined by an incremental method that starts with two and designated when capacity of each cluster is sufficient for its demand. Finally, each group of cluster and each model are solved as a single facility location problem. Then each single facility location problem given by fuzzy c-means is solved by convex programming which optimizes transportation cost is used to fine-tune the facility location. Proposed method is applied to several facility location problems from OR library (Osman & Christofides, 1994) and compared with centre of gravity and particle swarm optimization based algorithms. Numerical results of an asphalt producer's real-world data in Turkey are reported. Numerical results show that the proposed approach performs better than using original fuzzy c-means, integrated use of fuzzy c-means and center of gravity methods in terms of transportation costs.

A reliable controller must stabilize the quality during the manufacturing process and bring the quality characteristics of the manufacturing process close to the target. This controller must also have an adequate feedback system with estimation technology and optimization algorithm. In addition, the artificial intelligence has reasonably been matured and is often used in dealing with construction problems. Therefore, this work constructed a controller with artificial intelligence technology by first using an artificial neural network as the predictor and then using the traveling particle swarm optimizer that is ideal for continuous optimization problems as the algorithm for optimization. The proposed approach has been tested through chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), an important process in semiconductor manufacturing. The result of the test shows that the proposed approach can bring quality characteristics closer to the target than any other approaches.	mimo;mathematical optimization;swarm	Chwen-Tzeng Su;Jui-Tsung Wong	2007	Expert Syst.

6bb27a0ae4021dba600d828c79a6728b65185666	solving multistage quantified linear optimization problems with the alpha-beta nested benders decomposition		Quantified linear programs (QLPs) are linear programs with variables being either existentially or universally quantified. QLPs are convex multistage decision problems on the one side, and two-person zero-sum games between an existential and a universal player on the other side. Solutions of feasible QLPs are so-called winning strategies for the existential player that specify how to react on moves—fixations of universally quantified variables—of the universal player to certainly win the game. To find a certain best one among different winning strategies, we propose the extension of the QLP decision problem by an objective function. To solve the resulting QLP optimization problem, we exploit the problem’s hybrid nature and combine linear programming techniques with solution techniques from game-tree search. As a result, we present an extension of the nested Benders decomposition algorithm by the \(\alpha \beta \)-heuristic and move-ordering, two techniques that are successfully used in game-tree search to solve minimax trees. We furthermore exploit solution information from QLP relaxations obtained by quantifier shifting. The applicability is examined in an experimental evaluation.	benders decomposition;linear programming;mathematical optimization;multistage amplifier	Ulf Lorenz;Jan Wolf	2015	EURO J.

The amount of combusted diesel on a route segment of a tour depends to a large extend on the travel distance, the curb weight and the actual payload of the vehicle traversing that segment. Both, using an adequate mixed fleet and allowing split deliveries, open up options for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by transportation. A MIP-model for a GHG based vehicle routing problem with a mixed fleet and split deliveries is presented. To demonstrate the achieved potential for emission reduction, we analyze results of applying our model to instances generated for homogeneous and mixed fleets.	vehicle routing problem	Benedikt Vornhusen;Herbert Kopfer	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-24264-4_6	computer science;theoretical computer science;greenhouse effect;diesel fuel;vehicle routing problem;curb weight;automotive engineering;greenhouse gas;payload;transportation planning;haulage	Robotics	15.30513693802231	1.00265442100052	98668

In this paper, a shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA) based algorithm is proposed for solving the FJSP. First, the SFLA employs a hybrid encoding scheme in which two sequences are used to illustrate both operation order sequence and machines assignment. Second, a special bi-Ievel crossover scheme as a local search scheme based on the critical path is incorporated in the framework of the memetic search. The searching ability of the modified SFLA can be well balanced between exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, the influence of the parameter setting is also investigated and suitable parameters are suggested. Numerical simulation and comparisons based on the well-known benchmark problems indicates the effectiveness of the SFLA for solving the problem.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);computation;critical path method;job scheduler;job shop scheduling;line code;local search (optimization);memetics;scheduling (computing);simulation;tau-leaping;whole earth 'lectronic link	Ye Xu;Ling Wang;Shengyao Wang	2013	2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Control and Automation (CICA)	10.1109/CICA.2013.6611673	job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;flow shop scheduling;computer science;theoretical computer science;algorithm	Embedded	22.577563737951692	-0.9453210247179337	98939
82b1c4244de637574ae99f1ef46d4e86025b41d4	strategic service network design for dhl hong kong		We developed a two-phase network planning methodology to design a service network for DHL(HK) based on two measures of service performance: service coverage and service reliability. The methodology consists of first using an optimization model to determine a least-cost distribution network, which forms the basis of a simulation model for analyzing the network's operational characteristics. It takes into consideration such design issues as inbound and outbound shipment, equivalent shipment, cutoff time, demand fluctuation, and random behaviors. DHL decision makers can now examine trade-offs between coverage and reliability by adjusting workforce, changing cutoff time, or redesigning the service network. D HL, an international air express company, serves over 220 countries around the world. Its worldwide operations network consists of over 40,000 employees, 1,900 international service stations , 30 regional gateways, and 28 international sorting hubs. DHL's fleet of 177 aircraft and 11,000 vehicles transports millions of customers' packages daily. In addition to the hub-and-spoke routings of the company's own aircraft, DHL also uses commercial flights extensively for direct point-to-point transport. Established in San Francisco in 1969, DHL's major markets are in Europe and the Asia Pacific (AP) Region. Within the AP Region, DHL is a leading carrier in terms of total volume , with Japan, Hong Kong, and Singa-pore as its three largest subregions.	dvd region code;gateway (telecommunications);horseland;inbound marketing;mathematical optimization;point-to-point (telecommunications);quantum fluctuation;simulation;sorting;the hub (forum);two-phase commit protocol;usb hub	Waiman Cheung;Lawrence C.

2197aa76c5d130804efe83d3b385f2b8671d1394	a surrogate assisted differential evolution to solve constrained optimization problems		Many real optimization problems are defined by functions whose evaluations are very expensive in terms of time consuming. This is an important issue to the applications of evolutionary algorithms, which demand a large number of function evaluations. In this sense, surrogate models can provide good approximations maintaining the accuracy of the search. This paper presents a similarity-based surrogate coupled to a differential evolution to solve constrained optimization problems. The database management, where solutions evaluated by the exact model are stored and used to approximate other solutions, is done according to a “merit” scheme. A set of 24 constrained benchmark problems is used in the computational experiments and the results showed that the proposed scheme achieves good solutions with a reduced number of function evaluations.	constrained optimization;differential evolution;mathematical optimization	R.

3c0d052125c4f7fd60fe216c5b86982c10948aa3	a global information based adaptive threshold for grouping large scale optimization problems		By taking the idea of divide-and-conquer, cooperative coevolution (CC) provides a powerful architecture for large scale global optimization (LSGO) problems, but its efficiency highly relies on the decomposition strategy. It has been shown that differential grouping (DG) performs well on decomposing LSGO problems by effectively detecting the interaction among decision variables. However, its decomposition accuracy highly depends on the threshold. To improve the decomposition accuracy of DG, a global information based adaptive threshold setting algorithm (GIAT) is proposed in this paper. On the one hand, by reducing the sensitivities of the indicator in DG to the roundoff error and the magnitude of contribution weight of subcomponent, we proposed a new indicator for two variables which is much more sensitive to their interaction. On the other hand, instead of setting the threshold only based on one pair of variables, the threshold is generated from the interaction information for all pair of variables. By conducting the experiments on two sets of LSGO benchmark functions, the correctness and robustness of this new indicator and GIAT were verified.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);cooperative coevolution;correctness (computer science);decision theory;discontinuous galerkin method;experiment;global optimization;interaction information;mathematical optimization;round-off error;sensor;sorting	An Chen;Yipeng Zhang;Zhigang Ren;Yang Yang;Yongsheng Liang;Bei Pang	2018		10.1145/3205455.3205641	mathematical optimization;machine learning;cooperative coevolution;global optimization;round-off error;computer science;architecture;robustness (computer science);correctness;artificial intelligence;optimization problem;interaction information	AI	23.636745407495617	-5.016083395929145	99631

BDS explores the search space by combining the dynasearch procedure and the adaptive perturbation strategy. Experimental results show that BDS virtually solves all the standard benchmark problem instances with 40, 50, and 100 jobs from the literature within 0.1 seconds. For 500 larger instances with 150, 200, 250, and 300 jobs, BDS obtains all the upper bounds with the same objective function of the optimal solutions within an average of 252 seconds, demonstrating the efficacy of BDS in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency.

Evolutionary computation uses iterative progress, which is often inspired by biological mechanisms of evolution, to solve the problems that are multi-modal, multi-objective, discontinuous, non-differential, noisy and not well-defined. In this survey, many acceleration approaches are summarized and clustered in recent two decades. Applications of the acceleration approaches are included. We propose three promising research directions and their concrete approaches. These include including search space landscape approximation, search space projection and search strategy study, and comprise the main further research directions to be implemented an efficient EC search. Finally, we discuss the future research on accelerating convergence approaches of EC, and motivate some new approaches.	academy;approximation;evolutionary computation;hardware acceleration;iteration;microsoft outlook for mac;modal logic;multi-objective optimization;pattern recognition;soft computing;technological convergence	Yan Pei;Hideyuki Takagi	2011	2011 International Conference of Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition (SoCPaR)	10.1109/SoCPaR.2011.6089140	acceleration;mathematical optimization;projective space;navigation;convergence;interpolation;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;iterative method;computational model;artificial neural network;evolutionary computation;approximation theory	Robotics	21.97725570731635	-6.281475005755158	99781
5f7878f635a330f68cb133083a0ef36698facbcf	towards landscape-aware automatic algorithm configuration: preliminary experiments on neutral and rugged landscapes		The proper setting of algorithm parameters is a well-known issue that gave rise to recent research investigations from the (offline) automatic algorithm configuration perspective. Besides, the characteristics of the target optimization problem is also a key aspect to elicit the behavior of a dedicated algorithm, and as often considered from a landscape analysis perspective. In this paper, we show that fitness landscape analysis can open a whole set of new research opportunities for increasing the effectiveness of existing automatic algorithm configuration methods. Specifically, we show that using landscape features in iterated racing both (i) at the training phase, to compute multiple elite configurations explicitly mapped with different feature values, and (ii) at the production phase, to decide which configuration to use on a feature basis, provides significantly better results compared against the standard landscape-oblivious approach. Our first experimental investigations on NK-landscapes, considered as a benchmark family having controllable features in terms of ruggedness and neutrality, and tackled using a memetic algorithm with tunable population size and variation operators, show that a landscape-aware approach is a viable alternative to handle the heterogeneity of (black-box) combinatorial optimization problems.	baseline (configuration management);benchmark (computing);black box;combinatorial optimization;entity;experiment;general-purpose modeling;iterated function;iteration;mathematical optimization;memetic algorithm;memetics;online algorithm;online and offline;optimization problem;rugged computer;whole earth 'lectronic link	Arnaud Liefooghe;Bilel Derbel;Sébastien Vérel;Hernán E.

Finally, after presenting experimental results for three test functions representing a unimodal and a multimodal case as well as a step function with discontinuities, similarities and differences of the algorithms are elaborated, and some hints to open research questions are sketched.	crossover (genetic algorithm);discrete optimization;distribution (mathematics);evolution strategy;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary programming;expectation propagation;genetic algorithm;high- and low-level;mathematical optimization;multimodal interaction;nonlinear system;open research;problem domain;response surface methodology	Thomas Bäck;Hans-Paul Schwefel	1993	Evolutionary Computation	10.1162/evco.1993.1.1.1	evolutionary programming;quality control and genetic algorithms;genetic programming;mathematical optimization;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;meta-optimization;genetic algorithm;cma-es;estimation of distribution algorithm;cultural algorithm;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;genetic representation;mathematics;evolution strategy;algorithm;memetic algorithm;evolutionary computation	AI	23.30015730171595	-6.172842716371782	99959

64ce2124228ca37029c95a7a3d4ad19a25e39662	development of online fuel consumption cost calculator		Recently, fuel price becomes as hot topic and never ending issue especially the demand of fuel is very high. Malaysia Government has stood up in helping citizens by giving certain amount of money per vehicle owner to reduce their burden. However, the solution of reducing the total amount of fuel cost and consumption seems to be more helpful if the citizens can plan their fuel expenditure efficiently without unnecessary spend. Therefore, new software namely Online Fuel Consumption Cost Calculator (OFCCC) has been developed to help user plan and calculates the total amount of fuel cost for a car to travel based on the distance given, driving speed, weight capacity and current market fuel price cost. This software has been developed by using Microsoft Web Expression 2 and SQL Server database system. The result shows that the users can obtain a minimum cost towards the desired destination by using OFCCC.		Ahmad Noraziah;A. S.

22ca2c26efa86eaa2906e26dc473f000a5a5df2b	a two-level diploid genetic based algorithm for solving the family traveling salesman problem		In this paper, we consider the Family Traveling Salesman Problem (FTSP), which is a variant of the classical Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Given a partition of the nodes into a predefined number of clusters, called families, the aim of the FTSP is to find a minimum cost tour visiting a given number of nodes from each family. We describe a novel solution approach for solving the FTSP obtained by decomposing the problem into two smaller subproblems: a macro-level subproblem and a micro-level subproblem, and solving them separately. The goal of the first subproblem is to provide tours visiting the families using a classical genetic algorithm and a diploid genetic algorithm, while the aim of the second subproblem is to find the minimum-cost tour, corresponding to the above mentioned tours, visiting a given number of nodes from each family. The second subproblem is solved by transforming each global tour into a traveling salesman problem (TSP) which then is optimally computed using the Concorde TSP solver. The preliminary computational results on a usually used set of benchmark instances prove that our solution approach provides competitive solutions in comparison to the existing methods for solving the FTSP.	benchmark (computing);computation;concorde tsp solver;genetic algorithm;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;memetic algorithm;optimization problem;scalability;software release life cycle;travelling salesman problem	Petrica C.

The first problem studied is the building evacuation problem with shar ed information (BEPSI), which seeks a set of evacuation routes and the assignment of evacuees to these routes with the minimum total evacuation time. The BEPSI incorporates the constraints of shared information in providing on-line instructions t evacuees and ensures that evacuees departing from an intermediate or source location at a mutual point in time receive common instructions. A mixed-integer linear progr am is formulated for the BEPSI and an exact technique based on Benders decomposition is proposed for its solution. Numerical experiments conducted on a mid-sized real-world e xample demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The second problem addressed is the network resilience problem (NRP), i nvolving an indicator of network resilience proposed to quantify the ability of a network to recover from randomly arising disruptions resulting from a disaster event. A stochastic, mixed integer program is proposed for quantifying network resilience and i dentifying the optimal post-event course of action to take. A solution technique based on c oncepts of Benders decomposition, column generation and Monte Carlo simulation is proposed. Experiments were conducted to illustrate the resilience concept and procedure for its measurement, and to assess the role of network topology in its magnitude. The last problem addressed is the urban search and rescue team deployment problem (USAR-TDP). The USAR-TDP seeks an optimal deployment of USAR teams to disaster sites, including the order of site visits, with the ultim ate goal of maximizing the expected number of saved lives over the search and rescue period. A mul tistage stochastic program is proposed to capture problem uncertainty and dy namics. The solution technique involves the solution of a sequence of interrelated two -stage stochastic programs with recourse. A column generation-based technique is proposed for the solution of each problem instance arising as the start of each de cision epoch over a time horizon. Numerical experiments conducted on an example of the 2010 Haiti earthquake are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

19b30db307b5f65f9372fa01ac2c6280cdcd214a	a modified ant colony optimization algorithm for the distributed job shop scheduling problem		Abstract The Distributed Job shop Scheduling Problem (DJSP) deals with the assignment of jobs to factories geographically distributed and with determining a good operation schedule of each factory. The objective is to minimize the global makespan over all the factories. This paper is a first step to deal with the DJSP using three versions of a bio-inspired algorithm, namely the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) which are the Ant System (AS), the Ant Colony System (ACS) and a Modified Ant Colony Optimization (MACO) aiming to explore more search space and thus guarantee better resolution of the problem. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the three algorithms and the results show that the MACO is effective for the problem and AS and ACS algorithms in resolving the DJSP.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;job shop scheduling;scheduling (computing)	Imen Chaouch;Olfa Belkahla Driss;Khaled Ghédira	2017		10.1016/j.procs.2017.08.267	ant colony;ant colony optimization algorithms;swarm intelligence;job shop scheduling;ant;metaheuristic;computer science;algorithm;job shop;mathematical optimization;flow shop scheduling	Theory	20.42780906724488	-0.3395412649059146	100572

We describe the implementation and report experimental results. In addition, we discuss the effect of parallelizing SYNCHEMu0027s search algorithm on the global best-first heuristic exploration of the synthesis problem space. Though reasonably wide-ranging and inclusive, sequential exploration exhibits a pronounced depth-first flavor. Parallelization introduces a countervailing breadth-first tendency that alters the region of the problem space explored by the search engine with mixed consequences, the positive clearly outweighing the negative.	heuristic	Daren Krebsbach;Herbert L.

This accessibility constraint implies the selection of locations to park the trailer before performing the trips to the customers. We propose two metaheuristics based on greedy randomized adaptive search procedures (GRASP), variable neighborhood descent (VND) and evolutionary local search (ELS) to solve this problem. To evaluate these metaheuristics we test them on a set of 32 randomly generated problems. The computational experiment shows that a multi-start evolutionary local search outperforms a GRASP/VND. Moreover, it obtains competitive results when applied to the multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP), that can be seen as a special case of the STTRPSD.	grasp;local search (optimization);routing	Juan G.

ad31e5a01e0992dce23ebff1e814fb495e5dbd71	optimizing the size and configuration of combinatorial libraries		This paper addresses a major issue in library design, namely how to efficiently optimize the library size (number of products) and configuration (number of reagents at each position) simultaneously with other properties such as diversity, cost, and drug-like physicochemical property profiles. These objectives are often in competition, for example, minimizing the number of reactants while simultaneously maximizing diversity, and thus present difficulties for traditional optimization methods such as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing. Here, a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is used to vary library size and configuration simultaneously with other library properties. The result is a family of solutions that explores the tradeoffs in the objectives. This is achieved without the need to assign relative weights to the objectives. The user is then able to make an informed choice on an appropriate compromise solution. The method has been applied to two different virtual libraries: a two-component aminothiazole library and a four-component benzodiazepine library.	aminothiazole;addresses (publication format);benzodiazepines;genetic algorithm;libraries;mathematical optimization;optimizing compiler;powera;reagents;simulated annealing;solutions;weight	Trudi Wright;Valerie J.

The objective is to determine the required number and size of AGVs as well as the levels of product inventories given the takt times assumed for each kind of product. The major complication of this design problem lies in the large number of trade-offs involved, for instance the merging of input/output buffer capacities versus the frequency of AGV circulation, and the length of takt time versus inventory levels. By using an analytical model encompassing bottleneck-driven representation of cyclic schedules it is shown that this problem can be formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem. Its task-oriented representation, aimed at reducing the size of the search space, is discussed. An illustrative example proving the feasibility of the proposed approach is provided.

ce8c6a713c4a00bb531318f2bfd057abc57bb0d3	robust project scheduling with unreliable resources: a variable neighbourhood search based heuristic approach		Approaches for proactive project scheduling under limited resource condition has been widely researched by many researchers. In real world situations, the parameters of projects are vulnerable to uncertainty, change or disruption, which necessitates that the initial baseline schedule must be revised. With this in mind, in order to protect an existing schedule from any possible future disruptions as a result of single and/or multiple resource breakdowns and to make that schedule robust, we have proposed a semantic approach to effectively design proactive schedules. To solve that proactive schedule, a variable neighbourhood search-based heuristic (VNSH) is proposed, which can generate robust schedules after absorbing all possible resource uncertainties. Benchmark instances from the Project Scheduling Library (PSLIB) for 30 and 120 activities are considered to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach.

Hybridisation is used across its three phases. In the first phase a deterministic single objective optimization algorithm finds the extreme points of the Pareto front. In the second phase a K-best approach finds the first neighbours of the extreme points, which serve as an elitist parent population to an evolutionary algorithm in the third phase. A knowledge-based mutation operator is applied in each generation to reproduce individuals that are at least as good as the unique parent. The advantages of KEA over previous algorithms include its speed (making it applicable to large real-world problems), its scalability to more than two criteria, and its ability to find both the supported and unsupported optimal solutions.	evolutionary algorithm;file spanning;mathematical optimization;minimum spanning tree;pareto efficiency;scalability	Madeleine Davis-Moradkhan;Will N.

This model explicitly includes the VMI contractual agreement between the vendor and the buyer such as warehouse capacity and delivery constraints, bounds for each order, and limits on the number of pallets. To create a kind of green supply chain, tax cost of green house gas (GHG) emissions and limitation on total emissions of all items are considered in the model. A hybrid genetic and imperialist competitive algorithm (HGA) is employed to find a near-optimum solution of a nonlinear integer-programming (NIP) with the objective of minimizing the total cost of the supply chain. Since no benchmark is available in mperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) endor managed inventory (VMI) ybrid algorithm reen house gas (GHG) emissions the literature, a genetic algorithm (GA) is developed as well to validate the result obtained. For further validation, the outcomes are also compared to lower bounds that are found using a relaxed model in which all variables are treated continuous.

Our results proved that the proposed hybrid procedure was able to find better and nearer optimal solutions. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 .

Globally, the industrial environment gradually becomes more and more competitive and much effort has been made toward the efficiency and effectiveness. So in this connection, the supply chain (SC) management plays an important role in the present situation [4]. Several programs of collaboration and coordination between SC partners have been successfully implemented in practice. Vendor managed inventory (VMI) is collaborative initiatives that have been theoretically and empirically shown to improve SC efficiency and responsiveness [5]. Under VMI partnership, the vendor (supplier) is responsible for managing inventory levels at the retail store by determining the right timing and size of the orders. In return, the vendor gets a better visibility about the final customer demand. Historically, VMI originated hybrid genetic and imperialist competitive algorithm for EOQ model under shortage, Appl.

32eef731e2630f1a83afe4c80a3220a0b9f5fc04	using genetic algorithms for large scale optimizationof assignment, planning and rescheduling problems		There has always been a need to solve real-life large-scale problems, such as efficiently allocating limited resources, and other complex and conflicting situations related to combinatorial optimization genre. A class of combinatorial optimization problems is NP-hard and, among many well-known, several of them are assignment, planning and rescheduling problems. Assignment problems can deal with optimal assignment of teams of collaborating agents; planning problems can be effects-based planning that search for promising plans to get desired end states with minimal cost; rescheduling problems can be multi-criteria optimization of rescheduling resources that modify existing original schedule. These large scale optimization problems are complex with intractable and highly complex search spaces. Currently, there are no known algorithms with polynomial time complexity, which can solve these problems. Genetic Algorithms have been successfully applied to solve many complex optimization problems but not to the specific problems mentioned above. The aim of the research, presented in this thesis, is to use Genetic Algorithms for large scale optimization of assignment, planning and rescheduling problems. More specifically, the contributions of the thesis are to: (i) adapt existing and develop new efficient Genetic Algorithms to solve large scale assignment problems, and (ii) adapt existing Genetic Algorithms to solve large scale effects-based planning, and multi-objective rescheduling optimization	automated planning and scheduling;combinatorial optimization;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;real life;time complexity	Irfan Younas	2014				AI	21.678794143439003	1.4840834029290124	101575

An optimized cutting process maximizes the materials use and is an important factor for production systems performance at glassworks industries, impacting directly in the products final cost formation and, thus, increasing the company's competitiveness in glass market. Several studies have shown that combinations of bio-inspired meta-heuristics, more specifically, the Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) are efficient techniques to solving constraint satisfaction problems and combinatorial optimization problems. GA and ACO are bio-inspired meta-heuristics techniques suitable for random guided solutions in problems with large search spaces. GA are search methods inspired by the natural evolution theory, presenting good results in global searches. ACO is based on the attraction of ants by pheromone trails while searching for food and uses a feedback system that enables rapid convergence in good solutions. The initial results from the combination of these two techniques when compared with the results each technique individually applied are encouraging and have presented interesting solutions to the problem of optimizing two-dimensional guillotined cutting.	heuristic	Flávio Moreira da Costa;Renato José Sassi	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-32639-4_95	mathematical optimization;ant colony optimization algorithms;genetic algorithm;computer science	EDA	19.180024575925337	2.2360981889695566	101896

Disruptions at hubs result in excessive transportation costs and economic losses as customers (demand) initially served by these facilities must now be served by other hubs. In this study, we first present a novel mathematical model that builds hub-and-spoke systems under the risk of hub disruption. In developing the model, we assume that once a hub stops normal operations, the entire demand initially served by this hub is handled by a backup facility. The objective function of the model minimizes the weighted sum of transportation cost in regular situation and the expected transportation cost following a hub failure. We adopted a linearization for the model and present an efficient evolutionary approach with specifically designed operators. We solved a number of small problem instances from the literature using CPLEX for our enhanced mathematical model. The obtained results are also used as a platform for assessing the performance of our proposed meta-heuristic which is then tested on large instances with promising results. We further study and provide results for the relaxed problem in which demand points affected by disruption are allowed to be reallocated to any of the operational hubs in the network.	usb hub	Nader Azizi;Satyaveer Chauhan;Saïd Salhi;Navneet Vidyarthi	2016	Computers & OR	10.1016/j.cor.2014.05.012	logistics;simulation;computer science;evolutionary algorithm;spoke-hub distribution paradigm	ECom	14.27807175724151	0.48861582488557853	101924

On the other hand, Two-sided Assembly Line Balancing Problem is a generalization of simple Assembly Line Balancing Problem where different assembly tasks are carried out on the same product in parallel at both left and right sides of the line. Two-sided assembly lines are generally employed for the assembly of large-sized products such as buses and trucks. Furthermore, many real life problems contain imprecise objectives and Fuzzy Multi-objective Programming gives an opportunity to handle such situations. In this study, Two-sided Assembly Line Balancing Problem is considered more realistically by employing positional, zoning and synchronous task constraints and by utilizing fuzzy approaches so as to maximize work slackness index and line efficiency, and minimize total balance delay. For solving this problem Bees Algorithm is used as a search mechanism for obtaining good solutions and extensive computational results are presented.	bees algorithm	Pinar Tapkan;Lale Özbakir;Adil Baykasoglu	2012	Optimization Letters	10.1007/s11590-011-0344-9	mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;bees algorithm	Robotics	17.975591727334486	0.8811073212137827	102397

An optimal plan might therefore lose its optimality when applied in real world operations where stochastic disturbances occur. In this study we employ network flow techniques to construct a logistical support scheduling model under stochastic travel times. The concept of time inconsistency is also proposed for precisely estimating the impact of stochastic disturbances arising from variations in vehicle trip travel times during the planning stage. The objective of the model is to minimize the total operating cost with an unanticipated penalty cost for logistical support under stochastic traveling times in short term operations, based on an emergency repair work schedule, subject to related operating constraints. This model is formulated as a mixed-integer multiple-commodity network flow problem and is characterized as NP-hard. To solve the problem efficiently, a heuristic algorithm, based on problem decomposition and variable fixing techniques, is proposed. A simulation-based evaluation method is also presented to evaluate the schedules obtained using the manual method, the deterministic model and the stochastic model in the operation stage. Computational tests are performed using data from Taiwan's 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake. The preliminary test results demonstrate the potential usefulness of the proposed stochastic model and solution algorithm in actual practice.	logistics;scheduling (computing)	Shangyao Yan;Chih-Kang Lin;Sheng-Yu Chen	2014	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2013.10.007	mathematical optimization;simulation;heuristic;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;operations management;operations research	Robotics	13.409613061776607	1.7087145261811512	102928

e828d5490641934d96d27c097f0af471a113adbd	uncertain multi-objective optimal model of oilfield development planning and its algorithm		In this paper, we discuss the formulation of the oilfield development plan in case of significant nondeterminacy in oilfield development. And the plan needs to ensure production and achieve minimum cost and maximum new recoverable reserves. The uncertain factors in oilfield development are analyzed in this paper, and we consider the uncertain nature of the stimulation effect of measures and new recoverable reserves per well and quantify them. On this basis, an uncertain multi-objective optimal model of oilfield development planning is constructed. The model aims to minimize the expectation of development cost and maximize the expectation of new recoverable reserves, and optimizes the workload of each measure under the constraints including the oil production and the resources limitation. Based on uncertainty theory, the model is transformed into a deterministic model. And a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm with elite strategy is developed to solve the model and get the Pareto solution set. Then the multi-attribute decision-making is applied to select the multiple development plans, which provides the basis for the decision-making of the oilfield development plan. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify the effectiveness of the model and algorithm, and their practical application values under the background of oilfield development planning.	algorithm	Xiaoyu Ji;Sen Yan;Siyu Feng	2017	J.

Given the league schedule, a number of individuals, as sport teams, play in pairs and their game outcome is determined given known the playing strength (fitness value) along with the team formation (solution). Modelling an artificial match analysis, each team devises the required changes in its formation (a new solution) for the next week contest and the championship goes for a number of seasons. In this paper, we adapt LCA for constrained optimization. In particular: (1) a feasibility criterion to bias the search toward feasible regions is included besides the objective value criterion; (2) generation of multiple offspring is allowed to increase the probability of an individual to generate a better solution; (3) a diversity mechanism is adopted, which allows infeasible solutions with a promising objective value precede the feasible solutions. Performance of LCA is compared with comparator algorithms on benchmark problems where the experimental results indicate that LCA is a very competitive algorithm. Performance of LCA is also evaluated on well-studied mechanical design problems and results are compared with the results of 21 constrained optimization algorithms. Computational results signify that with a smaller number of evaluations, LCA ensures finding the true optimum of these problems. These results encourage that further developments and applications of LCA would be worth investigating in the future studies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

1ec3d633f2271f294e8b17e2c814a2e67c4aaed9	a new shortest path algorithm to solve the resource-constrained project scheduling problem with routing from a flow solution		Abstract In this study, the definition of a RCPSPR (Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem with Routing) solution from a flow solution of the RCPSP is investigated. This new problem consists in defining a solution of RCPSPR that considers both routing and scheduling and that complies with a RCPSP flow, i.e., a solution where the loaded vehicle moves are achieved between activity i and j with a non-null flow. A shortest path algorithm is proposed to solve this problem with a labeling dynamic approach where a label provides all of the information about a solution, including the objective function, the system state and the remaining resources that allow the use of a dominance rule. The system state, described by the label, encompasses both the activities and the vehicle fleet information, including vehicle position and availability dates. Numerical experiments are limited to a comparative study with a proposed linear formulation since no previous publications exist on this problem. A time performance analysis of the proposed algorithm is carried out, proving the efficiency of the algorithm and clearing the way for integration into global iterative optimization schemes that will solve the RCPSPR to optimality.	dijkstra's algorithm;routing;scheduling (computing);shortest path problem	Philippe Lacomme;Aziz Moukrim;Alain Quilliot;Marina Vinot	2017	Eng.

49eb9ad47080347a9ac4c235d6a054b546deacfe	an evolutionary strategy based on partial imitation for solving optimization problems	heuristic;social influence;combinatorial optimization	In this work we introduce an evolutionary strategy to solve combinatorial optimization tasks, i.e. problems characterized by a discrete search space. In particular, we focus on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), i.e. a famous problem whose search space grows exponentially, increasing the number of cities, up to becoming NP-hard. The solutions of the TSP can be codified by arrays of cities, and can be evaluated by fitness, computed according to a cost function (e.g. the length of a path). Our method is based on the evolution of an agent population by means of an imitative mechanism, we define ‘partial imitation’. In particular, agents receive a random solution and then, interacting among themselves, may imitate the solutions of agents with a higher fitness. Since the imitation mechanism is only partial, agents copy only one entry (randomly chosen) of another array (i.e. solution). In doing so, the population converges towards a shared solution, behaving like a spin system undergoing a cooling process, i.e. driven towards an ordered phase. We highlight that the adopted ‘partial imitation’ mechanism allows the population to generate solutions over time, before reaching the final equilibrium. Results of numerical simulations show that our method is able to find, in a finite time, both optimal and suboptimal solutions, depending on the size of the considered search space. ∗ marcojavarone@gmail.com 1 ar X iv :1 60 2. 04 18 6v 2 [ co nd -m at .d is -n n] 4 A ug 2 01 6	combinatorial optimization;computer cooling;computer simulation;evolutionary algorithm;fitness function;interaction;loss function;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;numerical analysis;randomness;travelling salesman problem	Marco Alberto Javarone	2016	CoRR	10.1016/j.physa.2016.07.053	mathematical optimization;heuristic;social influence;combinatorial optimization;mathematics;algorithm	ML	24.430261871815365	-0.329086290608142	103593

The primary objective of this paper is to study how various firms in the IPI with different business strategies, competing for the same opportunities can find suitable benchmarking peer groups to meet the challenges of a dynamic business environment using data envelopment analysis (DEA). A multiple objective DEA model that determines suitable peer groups for inefficient companies is discussed along with more traditional DEA models.

ed72f4beafff766e8c3fd42fbad5aa947d2164af	connectivity-based accessibility for public bicycle sharing systems		An increasing number of cities are implementing bicycle sharing systems to reduce traffic congestion. Determining the locations of bicycle stations is one of the fundamental challenges in planning of such systems. This paper provides a novel solution on it. The min-plus algebra is introduced to model transport systems for accessibility analysis. A unified model in the sense of the min-plus algebra for an integrated system with both buses and bicycles is presented to dynamically describe the state transitions of passengers in the system. A new accessibility is proposed with regards to a general index  $\omega $  such as the geographical distance and the travel time. A necessary and sufficient condition on the accessibility is then provided. The minimization of bicycle stations under the accessibility is formulated to be a 0–1 integer programming problem. The case studies on two cities, Ningbo and Hangzhou, were performed, which show that compared with the current layouts of urban transportation networks, the proposed public bicycle sharing systems have remarkable advantages in topological characteristics and robustness against failures. Note to Practitioners—This paper reports a practical solution for station allocation for public bicycle sharing systems (PBSSs). PBSSs have increased tremendously in recent years and become popular in many countries. They complement the bus and subway systems and contribute to better environment and lifestyle. On the other hand, they cause some serious issues with their planning and operations. The station allocation for PBSSs is one of its fundamental challenges as it greatly affects investment and running costs as well as customer satisfaction. Note that the station allocation for PBSSs should be addressed based on a unified dynamic model taking into consideration the transition of passengers, PBSS, and urban public transportation system together. Thus, a dynamically synthesized, physically realizable, and satisfactory solution for station allocation of PBSSs is significant for the success of practitioners. This paper proposes a framework to analytically obtain the station allocation of bicycle sharing systems based on a new accessibility criterion associated with detailed planning requirements and on a hybrid min-plus model corresponding to an integrated public transportation system. Furthermore, an algorithm for obtaining the minimum number of bicycle stations is presented for ease of actual implementation in applications and demonstrated with numerical simulation on the systems in two cities, Ningbo and Hangzhou. It should be pointed out that our optimization formulation is indicative, and alternative formulations with other objective functions and constraints are possible. But, the proposed accessibility as the most fundamental constraint of transportation systems should be included in any formulation.	accessibility;algorithm;broadcast television systems inc.;bus (computing);computer simulation;control system;geographical distance;index (publishing);integer programming;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;multistage interconnection networks;network congestion;requirement;robustness of complex networks;unified model	Lei Wang;Chanying Li;Michael Z.

31a7a4d4e1ddd81e4ea4e9e70db4fade82e8e0ed	a new method for optimal location and sizing of capacitors in distorted distribution networks using pso algorithm	capacitor banks;global solution;power quality;pso algorithm;distributed networks;sizing;placement;optimal method;cost reduction;harmonic;non linear load;optimal location;objective function;harmonic power flow;particle swarm optimizer;energy loss;power flow;optimization;optimal algorithm;fitness function;power quality pq	This paper presents an optimization algorithm for simultaneous improvement of power quality (PQ), optimal placement and sizing of fixed capacitor banks in radial distribution networks in the presence of voltage and current harmonics. The algorithm is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). The objective function includes the cost of power losses, energy losses and those of the capacitor banks. Constraints include voltage limits, number/size of installed capacitors at each bus, and PQ limits of standard IEEE-519. Using a newly proposed fitness function, a suitable combination of the objective function and relevant constraints is defined as a criterion to select a set of the most suitable buses for capacitor placement. This method is also capable of improving particles in several steps for both converging more readily to the near global solution as well as improving satisfaction of the power quality constraints. Simulation results for the 18-bus and 33-bus IEEE distorted networks using the proposed method are presented and compared with those of previous works. In the 18-bus IEEE distorted network, this indicated an improvement of 3.29% saving compared with other methods. Using the proposed optimization method and simulation performed on the 33-bus IEEE distorted network an annual cost reduction of 31.16% was obtained. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

After the disaster occurred, it seems that some shelters have relief oversupply, others have lacked them. Since some survivors cannot stay at shelters for some private reasons, they must stay at their home even if the lifeline stops. This paper proposes a methodology to redistribute the relief oversupply at a shelter to other locations such as other shelters and elderly care homes with relief shortage around one week passed from the disaster occurrence as the beginning of the planning horizon. From the computational results, regardless of the balance between total volume of relief oversupply and that of relief shortage, our approach can find the locations with or without relief supply.

The objectives are to minimize the total negative impact on normal traffic due to the reduction of available lanes for general-purpose vehicles and to maximize the robustness of the lane-reservation solution against the uncertainty in link travel times. We first define the robustness for the lanereservation problem and formulate a biobjective mixed-integer linear program. Then, we develop an improved exact ε-constraint and a cut-and-solve combined method to generate its Pareto front. Computational results for an instance based on a real network topology and 220 randomly generated instances with up to 150 nodes, 600 arcs, and 50 tasks demonstrate that the proposed method is able to find the Pareto front and that the proposed cut-and-solve method is more efficient than the direct use of optimization software CPLEX.	cplex;computation;general-purpose markup language;linear programming;mathematical optimization;network topology;pareto efficiency;procedural generation	Peng Wu;Ada Che;Feng Chu;Mengchu Zhou	2015	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2014.2368594	minimisation;transport;mathematical optimization;simulation;integer programming;uncertainty;computer science;multi-objective optimization;machine learning;methodology;mathematics;hazardous waste;network topology;robustness	Robotics	16.757709428849598	2.583713612979061	104791

The invested time in the resolution is decreased by means of a parallel implementation of an evolutionary team algorithm. This model keeps the advantages of heterogeneous island models but also allows to assign more computational resources to the algorithms with better expectations.

This paper develops a procedure based on Data Envelopment Analysis method to solve the assignment problems with fuzzy costs or fuzzy profits for each possible assignment. It aims to obtain the points with maximum membership values for the fuzzy parameters while maximizing the profit or minimizing the assignment cost. In this method, a discrete approach is presented to rank the fuzzy numbers first. Then, corresponding to each fuzzy number, we introduce a crisp number using the efficiency concept. A numerical example is used to illustrate the usefulness of this new method.

These decisions are particularly challenging for omnichannel service centers, where customers can request services via different communication channels (e.g., phone, e-mail, live-chat, social media) that have different service quality and response requirements. We present a formulation of the omnichannel workforce management problem that accounts for variations in response urgencies of different channels as well as diminishing agent performances due to channel switching. We develop an algorithm that efficiently provides solutions for this problem and determines the number and channel allocation of service agentswithin the service center. Through numerical experiments, we study the performance of the algorithm among various service center configurations with equal cost characteristics. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can identify service center structures that outperform many alternative structures, including those commonly-adopted in the real-world. © 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.	algorithm;best practice;computational complexity theory;email;experiment;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;numerical analysis;omnichannel;performance;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;social media;timex sinclair 2068	Noyan Ilk;Michael J.

305aaed1bcb5b4954d93fba48cae7d65c16c1942	a network optimization research for product returns using modified plant growth simulation algorithm		As product returns are eroding Internet retail profit, managers are continuously striving for a more scientific and efficient network layout to arrange the returned goods. Based on a three-echelon product returns network, this paper proposes a mixed integer nonlinear programming model with the aim of minimizing total cost and creates a high-efficiency method, the Modified Plant Growth Simulation Algorithm (MPGSA), to optimize the problem. The algorithm handles the objective function and the constraints, respectively, requiring no extrinsic parameters and provides a guiding search direction generated from the assessment of the current solving state. Above all, MPGSA keeps a great balance between concentrating growth opportunities on the outstanding growth points and expanding the searching scope. The improvements give the revaluating and reselecting chances to all growth points in each iteration, enhancing the optimization efficiency. A case study illustrates the effectiveness and robustness of MPGSA compared to its original version, Plant Growth Simulation Algorithm, and other approaches, namely, Genetic Algorithm, Artificial Immune System, and Simulated Annealing.	algorithm;optimizing compiler;simulation	Xuping Wang;Jian Qiu;Tingting Li;Junhu Ruan	2017	Scientific Programming	10.1155/2017/1080468	simulation;computer science;management science	HPC	18.695089178485137	-2.922701673048929	105548

Robot cellular manufacturing systems utilize one or more flexible robots which can carry out a large number of operations, and can conduct flexible assemble processes. The layout design stage of such manufacturing systems is especially important since fundamental performances of the manufacturing system under consideration are determined at this stage. Layout area, operation time and manipulability of robot are the three important criteria when it comes to designing manufacturing system. The use of nature inspired algorithms are not extensively explored to optimize robot workcell layouts. The contribution in this paper is the use of five nature-inspired algorithms, viz. genetic algorithm (GA), differential evolution (DE), artificial bee colony (ABC), charge search system (CSS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms and to optimize the three design criteria simultaneously. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II is used to handle multiple objectives and to obtain pareto solutions for the problems considered. The performance of sequence pair and B*-Tree layout representation schemes are also evaluated. It is found that sequence pair scheme performs better than B*-Tree representation and it is used in the algorithms. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed methods. It is observed that PSO performs better over the other algorithms in terms of solution quality.	artificial bee colony algorithm;cascading style sheets;computer-aided design;differential evolution;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;operation time;pareto efficiency;particle swarm optimization;performance;robot;software quality assurance;sorting;viz: the computer game	Zhen Yang Lim;S.

Combining this technology with intelligent systems will permit to automate most of the decisions needed to generate the appropriate sanitary resource sets, thereby reducing the time from the occurrence of the accident to the stabilization and hospitalization of the injured passengers. However, generating the optimal allocation of sanitary resources is not an easy task, since there are several objectives that are mutually exclusive, such as assistance improvement, cost reduction, and balanced resource usage. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the sanitary resources allocation in traffic accidents. Our approach is based on the use of multi-objective genetic algorithms, and it is able to generate a list of optimal solutions accounting for the most representative factors. The inputs to our model are: i) the accident notification, which is obtained through vehicular communication systems, and ii) the severity estimation for the accident, achieved through data mining. We evaluate our approach under a set of vehicular scenarios, and the results show that a memetic version of the NSGA-II algorithm was the most effective method at locating the optimal resource set, while maintaining enough variability in the solutions to allow Preprint submitted to Expert Systems with Applications July 26, 2012 applying different resource allocation policies.	artificial intelligence;data mining;effective method;expert system;genetic algorithm;heart rate variability;mathematical optimization;memetics;multi-objective optimization;pareto efficiency;powera;simulation;vehicle-to-vehicle	Manuel Fogue;Piedad Garrido;Francisco J.

In this spirit, optional flight legs can be considered to construct a profitable schedule by optimally selecting among such alternatives in concert with assigning the available aircraft fleet to all the scheduled legs. Examining itinerary-based demands as well as multiple fare-classes can effectively capture network effects and realistic demand patterns. In addition, allowing flexibility on the departure times of scheduled flight legs can increase connection opportunities for passengers, hence yielding robust schedules while saving fleet assignment costs within the framework of an integrated model. Airlines can also capture an adequate market share by balancing flight schedules throughout the day, and recapture considerations can contribute to more realistic accepted demand realizations. We therefore propose in this paper a model that integrates the schedule design and fleet assignment processes while considering flexible flight times, schedule balance, and recapture issues, along with optional legs, path/itinerary-based demands, and multiple fare-classes. A polyhedral analysis is conducted to generate several classes of valid inequalities, which are used along with suitable separation routines to tighten the model representation. Solution approaches are designed by applying Benders decomposition method to the resulting tightened model, and computational results are presented using real data obtained from United Airlines to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed procedures.

The development was aimed to assist the A/D process of aircraft parts maintenance with an intelligent algorithm. A comprehensive methodology is presented by an intelligent algorithm generating the best sequence for the assembled/disassembled parts. For this purpose, a genetic algorithm was chosen because of its effectiveness and compatibility dealing with the A/D sequencing problem. Furthermore, A/D process of the parts will also be calculated in the genetic algorithm process, which will show the effectiveness of the algorithm. Moreover, the concept of both natural and artificial constraints are applied to generate the path planning of the assembled/disassembled parts. It is believed that the combination of haptic, optimized sequence algorithm and intelligent path planning will increase efficiency for the overall aircraft parts maintenance process.	disassembler;haptic technology	Christiand;Jungwon Yoon	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-72586-2_108	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;haptic technology	Robotics	18.386995392759612	-5.660491440248115	105952

In this problem, facilities of fixed capacity must be installed on the edges of an undirected network to carry the flow from a central vertex to a set of demand vertices. The objective is to minimize the total installation costs. In this work, the nonbifurcated version of the problem is considered, where the demand at any given vertex must be satisfied through a single path. The proposed heuristics alternate between a construction phase and a local search phase. Each new construction phase, except the first one, is part of a diversification strategy aimed at providing a new starting point for the following local search phase. Different diversification strategies are tested and compared on large-scale instances with up to 500 vertices.	diversification (finance);local search (optimization)	Bernard Gendron;Jean-Yves Potvin;Patrick Soriano	2002	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/S0377-2217(02)00263-1	diversification;mathematical optimization;network planning and design;computer science;local search;operations management;mathematics;welfare economics;metaheuristic;satisfiability	Vision	17.17418187509922	3.4713569963617394	106038

Computational results on real instances show that pattern generation policies are crucial to address scheduling and routing in large Home Care instances.	mathematical optimization;routing;scheduling (computing)	Paola Cappanera;Maria Grazia Scutellà	2013	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2013.05.075	mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science	EDA	13.095682983142304	-1.1622498000951784	106076

Specifically, in the first stage, the travel time of each train on each link is taken as a stochastic variable, which is the sum of a minimum travel time (a constant variable) and disturbance time (a stochastic variable). Through embedding the train stop planning process into the train timetabling problem, the train stop plan and train timetable under different scenarios can be generated/optimized in the first stage. In the second stage, we treat the travel time of each train on each link as a decision variable, which is restricted to be no less than the minimum travel time. Then, based on the train stop plan and train timetable generated in the first stage, an optimal robust train timetable and train stop plan can be obtained, in which the sum of variance between the robust timetable and each timetable generated in the first stage is minimum. The optimization software GAMS with CPLEX and BARON solvers are used to solve the proposed model and generate approximate optimal solutions. Finally, an experiment is implemented to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.	approximation algorithm;baron;cplex;experiment;gams;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;schedule;timeline	Jianguo Qi;Lixing Yang;Yuan Gao;Shukai Li	2015	2015 12th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)	10.1109/FSKD.2015.7382069	simulation	AI	14.047252182593915	1.529225118100254	106156

In this paper, we consider periodic solutions that visit clients in one of several specified frequencies, and focus on the case when the frequencies of visiting nodes are nested. We give the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for designing optimum nested periodic schedules for the problem with no limit on vehicle capacities by simple reductions to prize-collecting network design problems. For instance, we present a 2.55approximation algorithm for the minimum-cost nested periodic schedule where the vehicle routes are modeled as minimum Steiner trees. We also show a general reduction from the capacitated problem where all vehicles have the same capacity to the uncapacitated version with a slight loss in performance. This reduction gives a 4.55-approximation for the capacitated problem. In addition, we prove several structural results relating the values of optimal policies of various types. 1998 ACM Subject Classification G.1.6 Optimization	apx;approximation algorithm;network planning and design;program optimization;steiner tree problem;vehicle routing problem	Takuro Fukunaga;Afshin Nikzad;R.

The critical point in this logistic system is the integration between production and transportation management, given the long distance between Brescia and Foshan. Shipments are performed by the means of different types of vehicles with different unit costs and significantly different lead times. Variable production costs, variable and fixed transportation costs and, possibly, inventory costs are charged in the objective function. Different production policies are compared. Our aim is to determine integrated policies that minimize the total cost of the system. We formulate integer linear programming models for the solution of these problems, and we solve the real instance and carry out a sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution.

There are many factors affects the storage assignment. For example, order picking method, size and layout of the storage system, material handling system, product characteristics, demand trends, turnover rates and space requirements. Selecting appropriate storage assignment policies (i.e. random, dedicated or class-based) and routing methods (i.e. transversal, return or combined) with regards to above factors is a possible solution to tackle this problem. However, the efficiency of these policies is interdependent. This paper aims to present a simulation study of a real case regarding storage assignment problem of a manual-pick and multi-level rack warehouse. Performance of the case is measured in terms of travel distance and order retrieval time. The results of the study indicate that the key to effective implementation of a storage assignment system is to match the types of warehouse storage system and the variety of items in the customer order. Also, the use of key performance indicator should clearly reflect the needs of the warehouse.		Felix T. S. Chan;Hing Kai Chan	2011	Expert Syst.

The problem consists in selecting a portfolio of suppliers from a set of pre-selected candidates. The supplier selection is a multi-criteria problem that includes both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In order to select the best suppliers it is crucial to make a trade off between these tangible and intangible criteria, some of which may be contradictory. The proposed approach uses discrete-event simulation for performance evaluation of a supplier portfolio and a genetic algorithm for optimum portfolio identification based on performance indices estimated by the simulation.

This paper presents new preprocessing stages and an improved mixed integer mathematical model. An exam-based conflict graph in which edges represent incompatibilities between exams is used. The preprocessing stages make use of the graph, together with hard constraints and room capacities, to reveal implicit constraints. Results show that the new preprocessing stages increase up to 106 % the number of conflict constraints an have more than doubled the size of the maximum clique. The improved mixed integer model comprises fewer constraints and is therefore more memory-efficient than the model presented after the competition. We propose valid inequalities based on cliques and a Data-dependent dual-feasible function to enhance our model. We run the tests on the twelve instances presented in the competition and the Yeditepe instances. The problem contains several criteria, which were also tested individually to help end users decide their respective importance. When our model and the original model are compared on the different instances, results show that the improved model yields better results for the majority of the cases and uses less memory.	preprocessor;timeline	Taha Arbaoui;Jean Paul Boufflet;Aziz Moukrim	2015	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-015-1832-6	mathematical optimization;integer programming;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;preprocessor;algorithm	NLP	19.740387753272564	3.1843848285049408	106647
65d954aff03c1ff6556964f622f1b8ecee34d442	a network-consistent time-dependent travel time layer for routing optimization problems	vehicle routing optimization;time dependent travel times;congestion	In the vehicle routing literature, there is an increasing focus on time-dependent routing problems, where the time (or cost) to travel between any pair of nodes (customers, depots) depends on the departure time. The aim of such algorithms is to be able to take recurring congestion into account when planning logistics operations. To test algorithms for time-dependent routing problems, time-dependent problem data is necessary. This data usually comes in the form of three-dimensional travel time matrices that add the departure time as an extra dimension. However, most currently available time-dependent travel time matrices are not network-consistent, i.e., the travel times are not correlated both in time and in space. This stands in contrast to the behavior of real life congestion, which generally follows a specific pattern, appearing in specific areas and then affecting all travel times to and from those areas. As a result of the lack of available network-consistent travel time matrices, it is difficult to develop algorithms that are able to take this special structure of the travel time data into account. In this paper, we present a method to generate time-dependent travel time matrices that are both spatially and temporally correlated and hence network-consistent. The novel travel time generation model is conceptually elegant, requires a minimal amount of input data and provides an efficient and effective way of storing the time-dependent travel time matrices. In this way, the data sets generated by our approach achieve a much larger degree of realism, without suffering from a decreased usability. The characteristics and applicability of the newly presented model are demonstrated on a time-dependent vehicle routing problem. The method to generate network-consistent time-dependent travel time data has been implemented in Java and is available for download (http://antor.ua.ac.be/network-consistent). 2012 Elsevier B.V.

957df7ab5f88595763b12774f91545cce4eb5a26	a new cluster-based approach for the vehicle routing problem with time windows		Modern logistics receives increasing attention for planning and scheduling operations of transport systems that have to be resource efficient and environmentally sustainable. A well known model for solving routing problems with time windows and vehicles is the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). This paper proposes a VRPTW algorithm based on cluster first, route second methods. In particular, first, by using a graph partitioning Integer Linear Programming problem, the algorithm generates a number of clusters equal to the number of available vehicles. Then, each vehicle solves a Travelling Salesman Problem with Time Windows to compute its route in the assigned cluster. Numerous benchmark problems featuring different sizes, random customer locations and time window distributions are solved and compared with the optimal solution. Moreover, a real case study shows the efficiency of the solution method..

A SAT solver is used not to solve the whole instance but for optimizing the makespan of a sub-optimal solution. This approach is trying to exploit the ability of stateof- the-art SAT solvers to give a solution to relatively small instance quickly. A sub-optimal solution to the instance is obtained by some existent method first. It is then submitted to the optimization process which decomposes it into small subsequences for which optimal solutions are found by a SAT solver. The new shorter solution is subsequently obtained as concatenation of optimal subsolutions. The process is iterated until a fixed point is reached. This is the first method to produce near optimal solutions for densely populated environments; it can be also applied to domain-independent planning supposed that suboptimal planner is available.	motion planning	Pavel Surynek	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-32695-0_50	mathematical optimization;machine learning;mathematics;algorithm	AI	21.128105646225638	3.588922143899738	106761

Creating Multiple Classifier Systems for this task has proven itself as a promising research direction. Here arises a problem on how to select valuable members to the committee - so far a largely unexplored area in one-class classification. This paper introduces a novel approach that allows to choose appropriate models to the committee in such a way that assures both high quality of individual classifiers and a high diversity among the pool members. We aim at preventing the selection of both too weak or too similar models. This is achieved with the usage of an multi-objective optimization that allows to consider several criteria when searching for a good subset of classifiers. A memetic algorithm is applied due to its efficiency and less random behavior than traditional genetic algorithm. As one-class classification differs from traditional multi-class problems we propose to use two measures suitable for this problem - consistency measure that allow to rank the quality of one-class models and introduced by us sphere intersection measure that serves as a diversity metric. Experimental results carried on a number of benchmark datasets proves that it outperforms traditional single-objective approaches.

Based on the analysis of vessel berth position and QC coverage range, a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model is developed. A novel heuristic method based on spatiotemporal conflict analysis is applied to derive a high-quality berth-QCs plan. The initial pessimistic priorities of vessels are employed to reflect the preferences of vessels for terminal resources. The proposed cluster of vessels focuses on spatiotemporal conflicts among vessels. Coordinated assignments of resources for the clustered vessels are realized via the branch-and-bound method. The QC feasibility check identifies infeasibility of QCs-to-vessel assignment. Several experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Numerical results demonstrate that high-quality berth-QCs plans can be obtained within an acceptable time. Further, the influence of coverage range of QC is discussed in detail.

Due to lack of suitable solution techniques, such problems are artificially converted into a single-objective problem and solved. The difficulty arises because such problems give rise to a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, instead of a single optimum solution. It then becomes important to find not just one Pareto-optimal solution but as many of them as possible. Classical methods are not quite efficient in solving these problems because they require repetitive applications to find multiple Pareto-optimal solutions and in some occasions repetitive applications do not guarantee finding distinct Paretooptimal solutions. The population approach of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) allows an efficient way to find multiple Pareto-optimal solutions simultaneously in a single simulation run. In this tutorial, we discussed the following aspects related to EMO: 1. The basic differences in principle of EMO with classical methods. 2. A gentle introduction to evolutionary algorithms with simple examples. A simple method of handling constraints was also discussed. 3. The concept of domination and methods of finding non-dominated solutions in a population of solutions were discussed. 4. A brief history of the development of EMO is highlighted. 5. A number of main EMO methods (NSGA-II, SPEA and PAES) were discussed. 6. The advantage of EMO methodologies was discussed by presenting a number of case studies. They clearly showed the advantage of finding a number of Pareto-optimal solutions simultaneously. 7. Three advantages of using an EMO methodology were stressed: (a) For a better decision making (in terms of choosing a compromised solution) in the presence of multiple solutions 1 Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings 04461 Practical Approaches to Multi-Objective Optimization http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2005/252 (b) For finding important relationships among decision variables (useful in design optimization). Some case studies from engineering demonstrated the importance of such studies. (c) For solving other optimization problems efficiently. For example, in solving genetic programming problems, the so-called ‘bloating’ problem of increased program size can be solved by using a second objective of minimizing the size of the programs. 8. A number of salient research topics were highlighted. Some of them are as follows: (a) Development of scalable test problems (b) Development of computationally fast EMO methods (c) Performance metrics for evaluating EMO methods (d) Interactive EMO methodologies (e) Robust multi-objective optimization procedures (f) Finding knee or other important solutions including partial Pareto-optimal set (g) Multi-objective scheduling and other optimization problems. It was clear from the discussions that evolutionary search methods offers an alternate means of solving multi-objective optimization problems compared to classical approaches. This is why multi-objective optimization using EAs is getting a growing attention in the recent years. The motivated readers may explore current research issues and other important studies from various texts (Coello et al, 2003; Deb, 2001), conference proceedings (EMO-01 and EMO-03 Proceedings) and numerous research papers (http://www.lania.mx/ ccoello/EMOO/).	decision theory;dominating set;dynamic energy budget;emoticon;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary computation;genetic programming;iterative method;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;object process methodology;pareto efficiency;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;word lists by frequency	Kalyanmoy Deb	2005			mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-objective optimization;operations research	AI	21.984917988950237	-4.82488192914847	107784

Most of these packages use the generational model inspired by GEN ESIS. A few have adopted the steady-state model used in Genitor. Unfortunately, they have some deficiencies when working with orderhsed problems such as packing, routing, and scheduling. This paper describes LibGA, which was developed specifically for order-baaed problems, but which also works easily with other kinds of problems. It offers an easy to use ‘user-friendly’ interface and allows comparisons to be made between both generational and steadystate genetic algorithms for a particular problem. It includes a variety of genetic operators for reproduction, crossover, and mutation. LibGA makes it easy to use these operators in new ways for particular applications or to develop and include new operators. Finally, it offers the unique new feature of a dynamic generation gap.	crossover (genetic algorithm);genetic algorithm;genetic operator;routing;scheduling (computing);set packing;software release life cycle;steady state;workbench	Arthur L.

In particular, the effects of different crossover operators in combination with offspring selection are still largely unknown. This contribution sheds light on the ability of well-known GP crossover operators to create better offspring (success rate) when applied to benchmark problems. We conclude that standard (sub-tree swapping) crossover is a good default choice in combination with offspring selection, and that GP with offspring selection and random selection of crossover operators does not improve the performance of the algorithm in terms of best solution quality or efficiency.

516d6829f5d57801ccaf258c672bc98ec3203d95	implementation of simple multiobjective memetic algorithms and its applications to knapsack problems		The aim of this paper is to propose a simple but powerful multiobjective hybrid genetic algorithm and to examine its search ability through computational experiments on commonly used test problems in the literature. We first propose a new multiobjective hybrid genetic algorithm, which is designed by combining local search with an EMO (evolutionary multiobjective optimization) algorithm. In the design of our algorithm, we try to make its algorithmic complexity as simple as possible so that it can be easily understood, easily implemented and easily executed within short CPU time. At the same time, we try to maximize its search ability. Our algorithm makes use of advantages of both EMO and local search for achieving high search ability without increasing its algorithmic complexity. For example, each solution is evaluated based on Pareto ranking and the concept of crowding as in many EMO algorithms. On the other hand, a weighted scalar fitness function is used for efficiently executing local search. A kind of elitism is also implemented using Pareto ranking in the process of generation update. Through computational experiments on multiobjective 0/1 knapsack problems, we examine the search ability of four variants of our algorithm with various parameter specifications. Those variants are different from each other in the implementation of parent selection and local search. While some variants use the weighted scalar fitness function only for local search, others use it for both local search and parent selection. One variant uses Pareto ranking instead of the weighted scalar fitness function in local search. In addition to the comparison among those four variants, our algorithm is also compared with well-known EMO algorithms (i.e., SPEA of Zitzler & Thiele and NSGA-II of Deb et al.) and memetic EMO algorithms (i.e., M-PAES of Knowles & Corne and MOGLS of Jaszkiewicz). We also examine the effect of the balance between genetic search and local search on the search ability of our algorithm using two parameters: a local search application probability and a local search stopping condition. Moreover we demonstrate the usefulness of a weighted scalar fitness function-based greedy repair procedure in the application of memetic EMO algorithms to multiobjective 0/1 knapsack problems. Our experimental results by various EMO algorithms show that there exists a clear tradeoff between CPU time and the quality of solution sets obtained by each algorithm. Since our algorithm is very simple, it can be efficiently executed.

There are very few applications of EM in scheduling problems. This paper presents a discrete EM (DEM) algorithm for minimizing the total weighted tardiness in a single-machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times. Unlike other discrete EM algorithms that use a random key method to deal with the discreteness, the proposed DEM algorithm employs a completely different approach, with an attraction–repulsion mechanism involving crossover and mutation operators. The proposed algorithm not only accomplishes the intention of an EM algoeta-heuristic cheduling rithm but also can be applied in other combinatorial optimization problems. To verify the algorithm, it is compared with a discrete differential evolution (DDE) algorithm, which is the best meta-heuristic for the considered problem. Computational experiments show that the performance of the proposed DEM algorithm is better than that of the DDE algorithm in most benchmark problem instances. Specifically, 30 out of 120 aggregated best-known solutions in the literature are further improved by the DEM algorithm, stanc while other another 70 in	algorithm;benchmark (computing);combinatorial optimization;computation;differential evolution;dynamic data exchange;experiment;heuristic;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;scheduling (computing);single-machine scheduling	Chien-Wen Chao;Ching-Jong Liao	2012	Appl.

AntScout reacts immediately to any change in the query or in the current traffic situation. This is achieved by the continuous application of ant colonies which are specially designed for problems with unexpected dynamic input change.

Number of hubs and facilities are unknown and the objective is to minimize the transportation cost, lost demand penalty and facility set up costs. Also the distribution of demand among domestic facilities and hubs adheres to gravity rule. To solve the problem, sequential and integrated approaches were undertaken. In the sequential approach, domestic facilities were allocated and hubs were selected afterwards. However the integrated approach deals with both concurrently, with a more sophisticated steps reaching to the solution. This is mainly because the demand itself is highly dependent to where the facilities are going to be located. Heuristic solutions were employed and was tested in a set of Turkish network and validated by CPLEX software in small cases.	cplex;heuristic;usb hub	Shahrzad Khosravi;Mohammad R.

In this paper, we incorporate time windows into a priori routes by introducing the probabilistic traveling salesman problem with time windows (PTSPTW). The PTSPTW is an extension of the well-known probabilistic traveling salesman problem, where in addition to stochastic customer presence, each customer has an associated time window during which deliveries must be made. We present a recourse model and a variable neighborhood search with variable neighborhood descent algorithm to solve problem instances. We also present computational experiments that demonstrate the value of incorporating stochasticity into the problem.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;experiment;gradient descent;heuristic;loss function;microsoft windows;optimization problem;sampling (signal processing);stochastic process;travelling salesman problem;variable neighborhood search;vehicle routing problem;whole earth 'lectronic link	Stacy A.

The main concept we introduce in this paper is using mobile platforms to move parts, tools and fixtures between workstations in a manufacturing environment instead of conveyors. A conveyor-based production system is a fixed transportation system, hard mounted and not reconfigurable, any change in the conveyors path is costly, time-consuming and difficult. Mobile platforms allow for a more flexible manufacturing environment as it only requires a change in the software to reroute the transportations paths and accommodate the changes to the production flow and workstations. This concept paper addresses two objectives: 1) describe some of the existing mobile platform used in industry today 2) introduce the concepts and a simulation of the ultra-flexible production system.	amiga walker;automatic control;deployment environment;hans moravec;logistics;mathematical optimization;mechatronics;mobile device;mobile operating system;mobile robot;online and offline;production system (computer science);simulation software;workstation	Remus Boca;Thomas A.

As the importance of the requirements is often described in a hierarchical manner, lexicographic goal programming has been used to minimize the number of requirement violations. The resulting schedules are in general of high quality with respect to requirement violations but may lack acceptance by employees because of an unfair distribution of the violations. We introduce a novel approach for lexicographic goal programming that allows to improve an existing schedule in terms of fairness without deteriorating its quality with regard to requirement violations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated for a test set derived from real-world data.	display resolution;fairness measure;goal programming;lexicographical order;lexicography;requirement;test set	Tom Rihm;Philipp Baumann	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM)	10.1109/IEEM.2015.7385847	programming;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;economics;schedule;computer science;linear programming;operations management;goal programming;mathematics;management	SE	10.880629872788496	-0.28907258297740296	109087

This can be accomplished in several ways including on-line tracking of packages, ensuring on-time delivery, and offering residential pick ups. Some companies want their drivers to develop relationships with customers on a route and would like the same drivers to visit the same customers at roughly the same time on each day that the customers need service. These service requirements together with traditional constraints on vehicle capacity and route length define a variant of the classical capacitated vehicle routing problem (VRP) that we call the Consistent VRP (ConVRP). In this paper, we formulate the problem as a mixed integer program (MIP) and develop an algorithm to solve the ConVRP that is based on the record-to-record travel algorithm. We compare the performance of our algorithm to the optimal MIP solutions for a set of small problems and then apply our algorithm to five simulated data sets with 1,000 customers and a real-world data set with more than 3,700 customers. The solutions produced by our algorithm on all problem sets do a very good job of meeting customer service objectives with routes that have a low total travel time.	algorithm;device driver;integer programming;linear programming;online and offline;requirement;vehicle routing problem	Chris Groër;Bruce L.

The problem has been proven to be NP-complete and the traditional heuristics (e.g., the SPH, DNH and ADH) are inefficient in solving it. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an efficient global search algorithm and is promising in dealing with complex problems. This paper extends the PSO to a discrete PSO and uses the DPSO to solve the MDR problem. The global search ability and fast convergence ability of the DPSO make it efficient to the problem. Experiments based on the benchmarks from the OR-library show that the DPSO obtains better results when compared with traditional heuristic algorithms, and also outperforms the GA-based algorithm with faster convergence speed.	binary code;communications of the acm;converge;destination routing;heuristic (computer science);ieee congress on evolutionary computation;mathematical optimization;memory data register;np-completeness;particle swarm optimization;prim's algorithm;proceedings of the ieee;search algorithm;shortest path problem;smoothed-particle hydrodynamics;software release life cycle;steiner tree problem;velocity (software development)	Zhi-hui Zhan;Jun Zhang	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-01129-0_15	mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;particle swarm optimization;metaheuristic	AI	24.475546285314966	0.6536296966836815	109392

Our goal is to develop GNP, which can deal with dynamic environments efficiently and effectively, based on the distinguished expression ability of the graph (network) structure. The characteristics of GNP are as follows. 1) GNP programs are composed of a number of nodes which execute simple judgment/processing, and these nodes are connected by directed links to each other. 2) The graph structure enables GNP to re-use nodes, thus the structure can be very compact. 3) The node transition of GNP is executed according to its node connections without any terminal nodes, thus the past history of the node transition affects the current node to be used and this characteristic works as an implicit memory function. These structural characteristics are useful for dealing with dynamic environments. Furthermore, we propose an extended algorithm, GNP with Reinforcement Learning (GNPRL) which combines evolution and reinforcement learning in order to create effective graph structures and obtain better results in dynamic environments. In this paper, we applied GNP to the problem of determining agents' behavior to evaluate its effectiveness. Tileworld was used as the simulation environment. The results show some advantages for GNP over conventional methods.	anatomic node;evolutionary algorithm;execution;gerontological nurse practitioner;graph (discrete mathematics);graph - visual representation;gross national product;memory disorders;memory bound function;node - plant part;reinforcement learning;simulation;negative regulation of endoplasmic reticulum tubular network organization	Shingo Mabu;Kotaro Hirasawa;Jinglu Hu	2007	Evolutionary Computation	10.1162/evco.2007.15.3.369	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;algorithm;evolutionary computation;implicit memory	AI	22.30146661290366	-8.93037183114318	109407

8d1413240d6d6dd9308109af9d13511637c84d43	interval type-2 fuzzy demand based vendor managed inventory model		Vendor managed inventory (VMI) is one of the well-known strategies of merchandizing between suppliers and retailers. The essential aspect in VMI model is to fulfill the demand of the retailers by the suppliers. Since, the costs of items are highly volatile, it is not possible to design a VMI model with deterministic demand. In this paper, we have considered one supplier and retailer to perform business of multi-product under VMI model with uncertain demand. Thus, it proposes a novel VMI model, termed as ‘interval type-2 fuzzy vendor managed inventory (IT2 FVMI) model’ that considers interval type-2 fuzzy number to represent the uncertain demand. The objective is to minimize the total cost of VMI by finding the optimum ordered quantity and backordered level. We develop a particle swarm optimization algorithm based solution approach to solve it. A suitable real-world application is considered to perform the simulation. We have considered different number of instances of the products to obtain the results. By comparing the results with the deterministic demand and type-1 fuzzy number, we show the efficacy of our proposed IT2 FVMI model.	algorithm;experiment;fuzzy logic;fuzzy number;inventory theory;ising model;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Zubair Ashraf;Deepika Malhotra;Pranab K.

The goal is to find a placement that utilizes the area of a container. In this paper three methods (random search, greedy algorithm and genetic algorithm) are tested on sets of regular (convex polygons) and irregular (cutting parts) items. The goal is to find the optimal items placement that minimizes the cover area. In this paper a no-fit polygon (NFP) is used to assure two items touch without overlapping. NFP is constructed by rotating polygon B around a static polygon A in a way their edges always touch and never overlap. The result is a polygonal area enclosed by trajectory of rotating polygon's reference point which represents the overlapping area of A and B. Items touch if polygon B is placed on the NFP's border. Non-convex cutting parts are approximated with their convex hull since a NFP version for convex polygons is used in this paper.	approximation algorithm;convex hull;cutting stock problem;experiment;genetic algorithm;greedy algorithm;placement (eda);random search;search algorithm;set packing	Daniel Domovic;Tomislav Rolich;Darko Grundler;Slavica Bogovic	2014	2014 37th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)	10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859732	greedy randomized adaptive search procedure;mathematical optimization;greedy algorithm;bin packing problem;approximation algorithm	Robotics	19.48023946456562	3.2228656377233067	109530

The consideration of multiple delivery periods per customer and the possibility of splitting deliveries across different periods makes it a relaxation of the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Split Deliveries (VRPTWSD). The problem is solved by a branch-and-price method. The opportunity for freight forwarders is to plan more efficient tours by exploiting alternative delivery periods. The contribution of this article is to prove the potential of this approach for cost savings and to demonstrate the decomposition of a SDVRPTWA in a demand focused master problem and period related pricing problems.	branch and price;linear programming relaxation;microsoft windows;name binding;scheduling (computing);vehicle routing problem;whole earth 'lectronic link	Heiko Breier;Timo Gossler	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-07001-8_9	simulation	ML	15.551786266453053	2.625359102985083	109658

Efficient homing of cells to switches can have a significant impact on handoff and cabling costs. This problem is an NP-hard problem, which cannot be solved by conventional optimization algorithms. It is therefore necessary to use metaheuristic methods to solve it. This research proposes a hybrid heuristic approach for further improving the quality of solutions. This approach applies API ant algorithm in combination with one of the best heuristics used to solve this problem: Tabu Search. A key element in the success of this hybrid approach is the use simultaneously an intensified research on several areas of research space. The implementation of these algorithms has been subject to extensive tests. In comparison with previous research, the proposed method is efficient, regarding quality of solutions provided for moderate-sized and large-sized cellular mobile networks.

This method can be divided into two stages, where each stage is  a steady-state EA. The first stage improves the quality of the initial population. The second stage uses concatenated, complex  neighbourhood structures for the mutations and improves the quality of the solutions with a randomized k-opt local search  procedure. The bit selection by mutation is based on an explicit collective memory (EC-memory) that is a modification of the  flee-mutation operator (Sebag et al. 1997). We tested our algorithm on all the benchmark problems of the OR-Library. Comparing the results with other heuristic methods,  we can conclude that our algorithm belongs to the best methods of this problem scope.  	evolutionary algorithm;quadratic programming	István Borgulya	2004		10.1007/3-540-31182-3_1	evolutionary programming;quadratic unconstrained binary optimization;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;machine learning;mathematics;quadratic programming;memetic algorithm	Crypto	24.46134165951284	0.19322615520576014	109746

The work centre of FMS can process a group of jobs. The usage of common tool magazine is in practice for FMS facilities in order to reduce tool inventory. The objective of this paper is to generate an active schedules and optimal sequence of job and tool that can meet minimum tardiness for the FMS. In this paper, non-traditional optimisation algorithms such as genetic algorithm, SA algorithm, ACO algorithm and PSO algorithm are proposed to derive near optimal solutions which adopt the extended Giffler and Thompson algorithm for active schedule generation. Twenty problems have been randomly generated for the performance analysis of the proposed methodologies. The performances of the proposed algorithms are compared with tardiness and computational time. The analysis reveals that PSO algorithm provides better solution with reasonable computational time.	metaheuristic	P.

The model involves various characteristics and behaviors of aircraft maintenance system, including gate assignment and its effects on the required number of mechanics, unscheduled aircraft maintenance, scheduled Remain Over-night (RON) maintenance, and the constraints affecting resource availability, ground time, and spare parts. Optimization modules of the simulation software generate an optimum shift schedule of mechanics increasing the existing system's efficiency, and the optimum number of new mechanics to match the increased workload in the future. The model can be used as a tool for understanding resource requirements on a daily basis and for developing efficient manpower staffing models, which can guarantee that a sufficient number of mechanics with approximate qualifications are always available. Its purpose is, therefore, to secure a complete match between workload and the available workforce.	simulation	Massoud Bazargan;Baohong Jiang	2010			transport;simulation;engineering;transport engineering;operations research	AI	11.882231197870341	0.5074991876481176	110227

And consequently, more resources were demanded to be directed to pavement maintenance and rehabilitation. Hereby, the concept of pavement management emerged. Although project-level analyses were found adequate previously, network-level evaluations were needed in order to do detailed planning as a result of resource allocation and transfer problems that were emerged later. Therefore, pavement management system has become compulsory for all pavements to be controlled together. In this framework, programming is needed in order to schedule maintenance–rehabilitation and develop costs with respect to budget. In the study carried out, a mode was developed in order to program the routine network maintenance activities in terms of Pavement Maintenance and Management Systems, and it was concluded that this problem can be solved through ant colony, using Visual Basic.	ant colony optimization algorithms;management system;mathematical optimization;pdf/a;visual basic	Serdal Terzi;Sercan Serin	2013	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-013-1456-1	computer science;ant colony;operations research	AI	11.483722163358784	-4.49456384527494	110325

Among the most prominent examples are the evolution of binary strings, real-valued vectors, permutations, nite automata, and parse trees. In this project the use of Petri Nets as the structures that undergo evolution is examined. Petri Nets, structurally, can be considered as specialized bipartite graphs. The goal is to evolve Petri Nets, which in their extended version (adding inhibitor arcs) are as powerful as Turing machines. Evolving Petri Nets is therefore a form of Genetic Programming (GP) and could be compared to traditional GP, where parse trees of computer programs are evolved."""	automata theory;computer program;data structure;evolutionary computation;genetic algorithm;genetic operator;genetic programming;parse tree;parsing;petri net;turing machine	Holger Mauch	2003		10.1007/3-540-45110-2_76	discrete mathematics;genetic algorithm;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;process architecture;petri net;algorithm	Logic	24.450904468782092	-9.3417614638374	110503

Three experiments are designed to study the behavior of different DE variants on a set of benchmark problems by using different performance measures proposed in the specialized literature. The first experiment analyzes the behavior of four DE variants in 24 test functions considering dimensionality and the type of constraints of the problem. The second experiment presents a more in-depth analysis on two DE variants by varying two parameters (the scale factor F and the population size NP ), which control the convergence of the algorithm. From the results obtained, a simple but competitive combination of two DE variants is proposed and compared against state-of-the-art DE-based algorithms for constrained optimization in the third experiment. The study in this paper shows (1) important information about the behavior of DE in constrained search spaces and (2) the role of this knowledge in the correct combination of variants, based on their capabilities, to generate simple but competitive approaches.	benchmark (computing);constrained optimization;differential evolution;distribution (mathematics);evolutionary algorithm;experiment;mathematical optimization;np (complexity);numerical analysis	Efrén Mezura-Montes;Mariana Edith Miranda-Varela;Rubí del Carmen Gómez-Ramón	2010	Inf.

In this context, decisions on powering-on a set of access points, via the assignment of one power level to each opened access point, and decisions on the assignment of the user terminals to the opened access points, have to be taken simultaneously. In particular, the power level assigned to an access point affects, in a nonlinear way, the capacity of the connections between the access point and the user terminals that are assigned to it. We model this problem as an integer program with nonlinear constraints. We solve the proposed nonlinear integer programming model by means of a branch-and-Benders-cut method. The approach has been tested on a large set of instances, and compared to a more traditional Benders decomposition algorithm on a subset of the instances. The computational results show the superiority of the proposed branch-and-Benders-cut approach in terms of solution quality, scalability and robustness.	algorithm;benders decomposition;bernard galler;branch and bound;computation;integer programming;loss function;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;programming model;scalability;wireless access point	Bernard Gendron;Maria Grazia Scutellà;Rosario Giuseppe Garroppo;Gianfranco Nencioni;Luca Tavanti	2016	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2016.04.058	benders' decomposition;mathematical optimization;network planning and design;real-time computing;integer programming;operations management;mathematics;branch and cut	EDA	15.602370739896445	-0.11182183071518959	110739

Against the problem that the existing optimization algorithms which study only from the perspective of shortest path or minimum taxiing time of departures ignoring the impact of airline satisfaction and taxiway load rate to the taxiway scheduling, a taxiing route optimization algorithm for departures based on backpressure routing is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the optimization problem is equivalent into the routing problem in network topology. Then the taxiing route which possesses the maximum airline satisfaction and minimum taxiway load rate is obtained by introducing the backpressure routing algorithm. The simulation results of a domestic hub airport runway and taxiway system show that the taxiing route achieved by this algorithm ensures the utility of the runway and taxiway while reduces taxiing time of aircraft effectively, improving the throughput of airport simultaneously.	airport security;algorithm;backpressure routing;mathematical optimization;network topology;optimization problem;scheduling (computing);shortest path problem;simulation;throughput;usb hub	Zhiwei Xing;Hongyue Lu	2015	2015 11th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC)	10.1109/ICNC.2015.7378014	engineering;operations management;transport engineering;computer network	EDA	10.625008709999653	-8.159592861144342	110771
b5468e3511585f71e9e6dc201f45332be294cac4	the integrated dial-a-ride problem with timetabled fixed route service		This paper concerns operational planning of door-to-door transportation systems for the elderly and/or disabled, who often need a more flexible transportation system than the rest of the population. Highly flexible, but very costly direct transportation is often offered as a complement to standard fixed route public transport service. In the integrated dial-a-ride problem (IDARP), these modes of transport are combined and certain legs of the passengers journeys may be performed with the fixed route public transport system. We extend the IDARP and include timetables for the fixed route services, forcing the fleet of vehicles to schedule the arrival at transfer locations with care. Two mixed integer linear programming formulations of the integrated dial-a-ride problem with timetables (IDARP-TT) are presented and analyzed. The key modeling challenge is that of the transfers between the fleet of vehicles and the fixed route public transport system. The formulations differ in how the transfers are modeled and the differences are thoroughly discussed. The computational study compares the formulations in terms of network size, computational time and memory usage and conclusions about their performances are drawn.	computation;integer programming;linear programming;performance;schedule;time complexity	Marcus Posada;Henrik Andersson;Carl H.

One of the products it o ers to network operators is wireless infrastructure such as base stations. Such equipment is delivered in cabinets. These cabinets are packed with various pieces of electronics: lters, ampli ers, circuit packs, etc. The exact con guration of a cabinet is dependent upon the circumstances it is being placed in, and some 20 product groups can be distinguished. However, the variation in cabinets is large, even within one product group. For this reason, they are built to order. In order to improve cost, yield and delivery performance, lean manufacturing concepts were applied to change the layout of the factory to one based on cells. These cells focus on improving manufacturing through standardised work, limited changeovers between product groups and better utilisation of test equipment. A key component in the implementation of these improvements is a system which schedules the cells to satisfy customer request dates in an e cient sequence. This paper describes the transformation and the tool that was built to support the new method of operations. The implementation has achieved signi cant improvements in manufacturing interval, work in process inventory, rst test yield, headcount, quality (i.e. fewer defects are found during the testing stage) and delivery performance. Although these bene ts are mainly achieved because of the change to a cell layout, the scheduling tool is crucial in realising the full potential of it.	built-in test equipment;cell (microprocessor);lean software development;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;scheduling (computing)	Roman van der Krogt;James Little;Kenneth Pulliam;Sue Hanhilammi;Yue Jin	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74970-7_10	base station;work in process;standardization;algorithm;lean manufacturing;satisfiability	Robotics	11.086089581171068	3.517671925111077	111022

It is intuitive that the population size of a GA may greatly affect the quality of the solution, but it is unclear what are the effects of having population sizes that are significantly greater than typical experiments. The emergence of MapReduce, a framework running on a cluster of computers that aims to provide large-scale data processing, offers great opportunities to investigate this issue. In this paper, a GA is implemented to scale the population using MapReduce. Experiments are conducted on a large cluster, and population sizes up to 10^7 are inspected. It is shown that larger population sizes not only tend to yield better solutions, but also require fewer generations. Therefore, it is clear that when dealing with a hard problem such as JSSP, an existing GA can be improved by massively scaling up populations with MapReduce, so that the solution can be parallelized and completed in reasonable time.	computer cluster;converge;emergence;experiment;genetic algorithm;heuristic;image scaling;iteration;jssp;job shop scheduling;local search (optimization);mapreduce;overhead (computing);parallel computing;population;randomness;run time (program lifecycle phase);scheduling (computing);software release life cycle;speedup	Di-Wei Huang;Jimmy J.

The current position, the final destination, and some number of point of interest (POI) categories visited during the trip are specified in advance. Then, the query searches the shortest route from the current position with stops at one of each specified POI category from the visiting sequence before reaching the final destination. Several such types of trip planning methods have been proposed. Among them, this paper deals with the optimal sequenced route (OSR) which is the simplest query because it has a strongest restriction on the visiting order. This paper proposes a fast incremental algorithm to find OSR candidates in the Euclidean space. Furthermore, it provides an efficient verification method for the road network distance.

To extend the effective application scope of MOEA/D for high-dimensional objectives, an improved MOEA/D design for many-objective optimization problems, named I-MOEA/D, is proposed in this paper. Comparing with the original MOEA/D, we redesigned the weight vectors used in the subproblems, making the distribution of the weight vectors broader and more effective to ensure the diversity and convergence of solutions in the objective space. Moreover, a new decomposition approach, called the weighted mixture-style method, which combines the advantages of the weighted sum decomposition and the Tchebycheff decomposition approaches, is adopted in I-MOEA/D to improve the effectiveness of the algorithm. A three-part experimental comparison using DTLZ1-DTLZ4, with the number of objectives ranging from three to fifteen, is performed. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of each strategy and reveal that the proposed I-MOEA/D method achieves better performance than the other related state-of-the-art algorithms in solving this type of many-objective optimization problems.	evolutionary algorithm;experiment;moea framework;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;pareto efficiency;weight function	Wei Zheng;Yanyan Tan;Lili Meng;Huaxiang Zhang	2018	Applied Intelligence	10.1007/s10489-018-1183-5	machine learning;computer science;artificial intelligence;evolutionary algorithm;ranging;optimization problem;convergence (routing)	AI	24.426592614994576	-3.869299748285823	112114
a830948f146a014eeaab9660b731360d6f3b0fb9	an empirical comparison of several recent multi-objective evolutionary algorithms		Many real-world problems can be formulated as multi-objective optimisation problems, in which many potentially conflicting objectives need to be optimized simultaneously. Multi-objective optimisation algorithms based on Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been proven to be superior to other traditional algorithms such as goal programming. In the past years, several novel Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been proposed. Rather than based on traditional GAs, these algorithms extended other EAs including novel EAs such as Scatter Search and Particle Swarm Optimiser to handle multi-objective problems. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no fair and systematic comparison of these novel MOEAs. This paper, for the first time, presents the results of an exhaustive performance comparison of an assortment of 5 new and popular algorithms on the DTLZ benchmark functions using a set of well-known performance measures. We also propose a novel performance measure called unique hypervolume, which measures the volume of objective space dominated only by one or more solutions, with respect to a set of solutions. Based on our results, we obtain some important observations on how to choose an appropriate MOA according to the preferences of the user.	baseline (configuration management);benchmark (computing);evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;goal programming;moa;moea framework;mathematical optimization;objective-c;swarm	Thomas White;Shan He	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33409-2_6	artificial intelligence;genetic algorithm;machine learning;goal programming;computer science;evolutionary algorithm;particle swarm optimization	AI	21.72375135819304	-3.8428627470378176	112130
4f66708021a22b3a7af77a1361fe90bae167919b	an architecture based on interactive optimization and machine learning applied to the next release problem	next release problem;interactive optimization;machine learning;search based software engineering	The next release problem (NRP) consists of selecting which requirements will be implemented in the next release of a software system. For many search based software engineering approaches to the NRP, there is still a lack of capability to efficiently incorporate human experience and preferences in the search process. Therefore, this paper proposes an architecture to deal with this issue, where the decision maker (DM) and his/her tacit assessments are taken into account during the solutions evaluations alongside the interactive genetic algorithm. Furthermore, a learning model is employed to avoid an overwhelming number of interactions. An empirical study involving software engineer practitioners, different instances, and different machine learning techniques was performed to assess the feasibility of the architecture to incorporate human knowledge in the overall optimization process. Obtained results indicate the architecture can assist the DM in selecting a set of requirements that properly incorporate his/her expertise, while optimizing other explicit measurable aspects equally important to the next release planning. On a scale of 0 (very ineffective) to 5 (very effective), all participants found the experience of interactively selecting the requirements using the approach as a 4 (effective).	decision theory;genetic algorithm;interaction;interactive evolutionary computation;interactivity;machine learning;mathematical optimization;nurse scheduling problem;requirement;search-based software engineering;software engineer;software system	Allysson Allex Araújo;Matheus Paixão;Italo Yeltsin;Altino Dantas;Jerffeson Souza	2016	Automated Software Engineering	10.1007/s10515-016-0200-3	simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;software engineering	SE	19.752683074094307	-4.955349918707545	112195

The method combines genetic programming (GP) for evolving agent's bidding functions for the individual auctions with genetic algorithms (GAs) for evolving an optimal ordering for auctions. The framework is evaluated in the context of the exam timetabling problem (ETTP). In this problem, there is a set of exams, which have to be assigned to a predefined set of slots. Here, the exam time tabling system is the seller that sells a set of slots in a series of auctions. There is one auction for each slot. The exams are viewed as the bidding agents in need of slots. The problem is then to find a schedule (i.e., a slot for each exam) such that the total cost of conducting the exams as per the schedule is minimised. In order to arrive at such a schedule, we find the bidders optimal bids for an auction using GP. We combine this with a GA that finds an optimal ordering for conducting the auctions. The effectiveness of this co-evolutionary method is demonstrated experimentally by comparing it with some existing benchmarks for exam timetabling.	expectation propagation;experiment;genetic algorithm;genetic programming;heuristic;hyper-heuristic;job shop scheduling;memoization;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);software release life cycle;william l. burke	S.

2a5ba480fd3d381b88a240f65e793b9ffc6d1b30	orienteering algorithms for generating travel itineraries		We study the problem of automatically and efficiently generating itineraries for users who are on vacation. We focus on the common case, wherein the trip duration is more than a single day. Previous efficient algorithms based on greedy heuristics suffer from two problems. First, the itineraries are often unbalanced, with excellent days visiting top attractions followed by days of exclusively lower-quality alternatives. Second, the trips often re-visit neighborhoods repeatedly in order to cover increasingly low-tier points of interest. Our primary technical contribution is an algorithm that addresses both these problems by maximizing the quality of the worst day. We give theoretical results showing that this algorithm»s competitive factor is within a factor two of the guarantee of the best available algorithm for a single day, across many variations of the problem. We also give detailed empirical evaluations using two distinct datasets:(a) anonymized Google historical visit data and(b) Foursquare public check-in data. We show first that the overall utility of our itineraries is almost identical to that of algorithms specifically designed to maximize total utility, while the utility of the worst day of our itineraries is roughly twice that obtained from other approaches. We then turn to evaluation based on human raters who score our itineraries only slightly below the itineraries created by human travel experts with deep knowledge of the area.	baseline (configuration management);display resolution;experiment;fold (higher-order function);greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);maxima and minima;multitier architecture;numerical analysis;point of interest;referring expression generation;regular expression;submodular set function;unbalanced circuit	Zachary Friggstad;Sreenivas Gollapudi;Kostas Kollias;Tamás Sarlós;Chaitanya Swamy;Andrew Tomkins	2018		10.1145/3159652.3159697	computer science;data mining;orienteering;trips architecture;point of interest;approximation algorithm;heuristics;algorithm	ML	11.589936702442886	-6.970833311091302	112628

With the gaining of focus on the design of novel and improved chemical products, the traditional heuristic based approaches may not be effective in designing optimal products. This leads to the vast development and application of CAMD tools, which are methods that combine property prediction models with computer-assisted search in the design of various chemical products. The introduction and development of different classes of property prediction methods in the overall product design process is discussed. The exploration and application of CAMD tools in numerous single component product designs, mixture design, and later in the integrated process-product design are reviewed in this paper. Difficulties and possible future extension of CAMD are then discussed in detail. The highlighted challenges and opportunities are mainly about the needs for exploration and development of property models, suitable design scale and computational effort as well as sustainable chemical product design framework. In order to produce a chemical product in a sustainable way, the role of each level in a chemical product design enterprise hierarchy is discussed. In addition to process parameters and product quality, environment, health and safety performance are required to be considered in shaping a sustainable chemical product design framework. On top of these, recent developments and opportunities in the design of ionic liquids using molecular design techniques have been discussed.		Lik Yin Ng;Fah Keen Chong;Nishanth G.

3cbde58efb0b642acbda1319c30735ea583ab044	a short-term operating room surgery scheduling problem integrating multiple nurses roster constraints	ant colony optimization;operating room management;nurse roster;surgery scheduling	OBJECTIVES Operating room (OR) surgery scheduling determines the individual surgery's operation start time and assigns the required resources to each surgery over a schedule period, considering several constraints related to a complete surgery flow and the multiple resources involved. This task plays a decisive role in providing timely treatments for the patients while balancing hospital resource utilization. The originality of the present study is to integrate the surgery scheduling problem with real-life nurse roster constraints such as their role, specialty, qualification and availability. This article proposes a mathematical model and an ant colony optimization (ACO) approach to efficiently solve such surgery scheduling problems.   METHOD A modified ACO algorithm with a two-level ant graph model is developed to solve such combinatorial optimization problems because of its computational complexity. The outer ant graph represents surgeries, while the inner graph is a dynamic resource graph. Three types of pheromones, i.e. sequence-related, surgery-related, and resource-related pheromone, fitting for a two-level model are defined. The iteration-best and feasible update strategy and local pheromone update rules are adopted to emphasize the information related to the good solution in makespan, and the balanced utilization of resources as well. The performance of the proposed ACO algorithm is then evaluated using the test cases from (1) the published literature data with complete nurse roster constraints, and 2) the real data collected from a hospital in China.   RESULTS The scheduling results using the proposed ACO approach are compared with the test case from both the literature and the real life hospital scheduling. Comparison results with the literature shows that the proposed ACO approach has (1) an 1.5-h reduction in end time; (2) a reduction in variation of resources' working time, i.e. 25% for ORs, 50% for nurses in shift 1 and 86% for nurses in shift 2; (3) an 0.25h reduction in individual maximum overtime (OT); and (4) an 42% reduction in the total OT of nurses. Comparison results with the real 10-workday hospital scheduling further show the advantage of the ACO in several measurements. Instead of assigning all surgeries by a surgeon to only one OR and the same nurses by traditional manual approach in hospital, ACO realizes a more balanced surgery arrangement by assigning the surgeries to different ORs and nurses. It eventually leads to shortening the end time within the confidential interval of [7.4%, 24.6%] with 95% confidence level.   CONCLUSION The ACO approach proposed in this paper efficiently solves the surgery scheduling problem with daily nurse roster while providing a shortened end time and relatively balanced resource allocations. It also supports the advantage of integrating the surgery scheduling with the nurse scheduling and the efficiency of systematic optimization considering a complete three-stage surgery flow and resources involved.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;colony collapse disorder;combinatorial optimization;computational complexity theory;confidentiality;crew scheduling;entity name part qualifier - adopted;equilibrium;graph - visual representation;iteration;makespan;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;nurse scheduling problem;operating room;operative surgical procedures;overtime;patients;pheromone;real life;resource allocation;rule (guideline);scheduling (computing);scheduling - hl7 publishing domain;scientific publication;test case	Wei Xiang;Jiao Yin;Gino Lim	2015	Artificial intelligence in medicine	10.1016/j.artmed.2014.12.005	fair-share scheduling;nurse scheduling problem;ant colony optimization algorithms;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating room management	AI	12.875834533511368	-1.2020892079614676	112707
3d7a72aa15b38d31f3b6f12d8d354ea88a58919c	a distributionally robust optimization approach for surgery block allocation		Abstract Operating Rooms (ORs) are a critical resource in hospitals. Managing ORs efficiently is a difficult task for hospital managers, as patients’ surgery durations have high variability and cannot be accurately predicted in advance. This paper considers a Surgery Block Allocation (SBA) problem, which includes determining the ORs to open and assigning the surgeries in a daily listing to the ORs, towards minimizing the weighted sum of OR opening costs and expected overtime (relative to a fixed length-of-day) penalty costs. Based on real-life surgery durations’ data, we construct an ambiguity set of distribution, which incorporates the empirical means, the mean absolute deviations and the support set. In particular, we help the ambiguity-averse managers develop a distributionally robust model for the SBA problem, where the overtime costs are evaluated over the worst-case probability distribution within the ambiguity set. Bounds on the objective value are discussed. Due to its intractability, we reformulate it as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model using the duality theory. To solve large-scale instances, we employ the linear decision rule technique and develop an approximated MILP model, and propose another approximated MILP model by heuristically constructing a discrete distribution that is “close to” the worst-case distribution. Computational experiments show that our models outperform an existing stochastic programming model in terms of computational time and upper-decile performance. In particular, the heuristic method greatly improves the computational efficiency without pulling down the out-of-sample performances.

9cd3c6bf4d19861984bcf2e96f18c269b054e18f	algorithms for electric vehicle scheduling in large-scale mobility-on-demand schemes		We study a setting where Electric Vehicles (EVs) can be hired to drive from pick-up to drop-off points in a Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) scheme. The goal of the system is, either to maximize the number of customers that are serviced, or the total EV utilization. To do so, we characterise the optimisation problem as a max-flow problem in order to determine the set of feasible trips given the available EVs at each location. We then model and solve the EV-to-trip scheduling problem offline and optimally using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) techniques and show that the solution scales up to medium sized problems. Given this, we develop two non-optimal algorithms, namely an incremental-MIP algorithm for medium to large problems and a greedy heuristic algorithm for very large problems. Moreover, we develop a tabu search-based local search technique to further improve upon and compare against the solution of the non-optimal algorithms. We study the performance of these algorithms in settings where either battery swap or battery charge at each station is used to cope with the EVs’ limited driving range. Moreover, in settings where EVs need to be scheduled online, we propose a novel algorithm that accounts for the uncertainty in future trip requests. All algorithms are empirically evaluated using real-world data of locations of shared vehicle pick-up and drop-off stations. In our experiments, we observe that when all EVs carry the same battery which is large enough for the longest trips, the greedy algorithm with battery swap with the max-flow solution as a pre-processing step, provides the optimal solution. At the same time, the greedy algorithm with battery charge is close to the optimal (97% on average) and is further improved when local search is Preprint submitted to Artificial Intelligence Journal February 14, 2018 used. When some EVs do not have a large enough battery to execute some of the longest trips, the incremental-MIP generates solutions slightly better than the greedy, while the optimal algorithm is the best but scales up to medium sized problems only. Moreover, the online algorithm is shown to be on average at least 90% of the optimal. Finally, the greedy algorithm scales to 10-times more tasks than the incremental-MIP and 1000-times more than the static MIP in reasonable time.	experiment;extended validation certificate;flow network;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;linear programming;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;maximum flow problem;online algorithm;online and offline;paging;preprocessor;scheduling (computing);tabu search	Emmanouil Rigas;Sarvapali D.

The permutation flowshop scheduling problem is an NP-hard problem that has practical applications in production facilities and in other areas. An iterated greedy algorithm for solving the permutation flowshop scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing total tardiness is presented in this paper. The proposed iterated greedy algorithm uses a new formula for temperature calculation for acceptance criterion and the algorithm is hybridized with a random search algorithm to further enhance the solution quality. The performance of the proposed method is tested on a set of benchmark problems from the literature and is compared to three versions of the traditional iterated greedy algorithm using the same problem instances. Experimental results show that, the proposed algorithm is superior in performance to the other three iterated greedy algorithm variants. Ultimately, new best known solutions are obtained for 343 out of 540 problem instances.	greedy algorithm;iteration	Korhan Karabulut	2016	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2016.06.012	greedy randomized adaptive search procedure;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;greedy algorithm;discrete mathematics;random search;computer science;operating system;mathematics;scheduling	Robotics	20.042586836650838	2.3621758338192342	113488

Cost of remediation and remaining concentration of contaminant are the main conflicting objectives to be decided during remediation period of groundwater. Multi objective optimisation is one of the best techniques to obtain Paretos for the conflicting objectives. In this study metaheuristic hybrid algorithm has been used to obtain Paretos for in-situ bioremediation of groundwater. Further, the performance of Paretos obtained with varying population size has been evaluated. The results indicate that too small or too large population size does not give well spaced Paretos. Only the population size in specific range shows better performance in the present study for groundwater remediation. The cost analysis of in-situ bioremediation based on the Paretos obtained from proposed hybrid algorithm shows that percentage increase in cost increases as the clean up standard of groundwater increases.	hybrid algorithm;mathematical optimization	Deepak Kumar;Ch.

Results on a set of test functions are presented and compared to a standard approach, showing that Mate Choice is able to contribute to enhanced results on complex instances of Symbolic Regression.

We analyze the problem for path and tree network topologies as well as several categories of line operation that are important for the Quito Trolebús system. It turns out that, from a computational complexity worst case point of view, the problem is hard in all but the most simple variants.

This paper presents a novel method that combines clustering and heuristic methods to solve an ILA problem, which reduces the elapsed time keeping the quality of the solution found compared with other heuristics methods.	affinity propagation;ccir system a;cluster analysis;data point;dataspaces;decision problem;euclidean distance;heuristic (computer science);location-allocation;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;point of view (computer hardware company);problem solving;search algorithm;simulated annealing;software propagation	Ferran Torrent-Fontbona;Víctor Muñoz;Beatriz López	2013	Expert Syst.

d66dd155b61363700dee53e7706d6ae82debfb98	a multi-objective mathematical model for problems optimization in multi-modal transportation network		In order to reach a sustainable planning in a rather complicated transport system, it is of high interest to use methods included in Operations Research areas. This study has been conducted to solve the transportation network planning problems, in accordance with the optimization problem and multi-objective transport network in multi-modal transportation. Firstly, we improve the implementation of the existing literature model proposed in (Cai, Zhang, and Shao, 2010; Zhang and Peng, 2009) because after the conducted experimentation, we show that there are two previously proposed constraints that make the solution unrealizable for the transportation problem solving. Secondly, we develop the proposed multi-objective programming model with linear constraints. Computational experiments are conducted to test the effectiveness of the proposed model. The mathematical formulation is developed to contribute to success solving the optimization problem, taking into account important aspects of the real system which were not included in previous proposals in the literature, and review. Thus, it gives ample new research directions for future studies.	automated planning and scheduling;computation;experiment;futures studies;loss of significance;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;modal logic;operations research;optimization problem;problem solving;programming model;transportation theory (mathematics)	Mouna Mnif;Sadok Bouamama	2017		10.5220/0006472603520358	engineering optimization;modal;engineering;flow network;fuzzy transportation;control engineering;discrete optimization;bilevel optimization;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization	AI	20.681276773486115	-3.5402251652917767	114225
a4cb90dde2feb449ae53d2cd77fe08bdf3056965	swarm based mean-variance mapping optimization for solving economic dispatch with cubic fuel cost function		In power generation system, the economic dispatch (ED) is used to allocate the real power output of thermal generating units to meet required load demand so as their total operating cost is minimized while satisfying all units and system constraints. This paper proposes a novel swarm based mean-variance mapping optimization (MVMOS) for solving the ED problem with the cubic fuel cost function. The special feature of the proposed algorithm is a mapping function applied for the mutation based on the mean and variance of n-best population. This method has been tested on 3, 5 and 26 units and the obtained results are compared to those from genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and firefly algorithm (FA). Test results have indicated that the proposed method is efficient for solving the ED problem with cubic fuel cost function.	cubic function;loss function;swarm	Khoa H.

e79e0de82bdbfcf05e172ff87b72b6e2b2ea1d07	evolutionary optimization: a big data perspective	high dimensionality;non linearity;big data;optimization;evolutionary algorithm	Stochastic search techniques such as evolutionary algorithms (EA) are known to be better explorer of search space as compared to conventional techniques including deterministic methods. However, in the era of big data like most other search methods and learning algorithms, suitability of evolutionary algorithms is naturally questioned. Big data pose new computational challenges including very high dimensionality and sparseness of data. Evolutionary algorithms' superior exploration skills should make them promising candidates for handling optimization problems involving big data. High dimensional problems introduce added complexity to the search space. However, EAs need to be enhanced to ensure that majority of the potential winner solutions gets the chance to survive and mature. In this paper we present an evolutionary algorithm with enhanced ability to deal with the problems of high dimensionality and sparseness of data. In addition to an informed exploration of the solution space, this technique balances exploration and exploitation using a hierarchical multi-population approach. The proposed model uses informed genetic operators to introduce diversity by expanding the scope of search process at the expense of redundant less promising members of the population. Next phase of the algorithm attempts to deal with the problem of high dimensionality by ensuring broader and more exhaustive search and preventing premature death of potential solutions. To achieve this, in addition to the above exploration controlling mechanism, a multi-tier hierarchical architecture is employed, where, in separate layers, the less fit isolated individuals evolve in dynamic sub-populations that coexist alongside the original or main population. Evaluation of the proposed technique on well known benchmark problems ascertains its superior performance. The algorithm has also been successfully applied to a real world problem of financial portfolio management. Although the proposed method cannot be considered big data-ready, it is certainly a move in the right direction. & 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This problem considers distinct realistic features widely existing in make-to-order supply chains, namely unrelated parallel-machine production environment and product batch-based delivery. An evolution-strategy-based bi-level evolutionary optimization approach is developed to handle the IPTS problem by integrating a memetic algorithm and heuristic rules. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated by numerical experiments based on industrial data and industrial-size problems.

However, RAP in multi-state system (MSSs) still has some restrictions that components have only two performances: perfect functionality and complete failure. Therefore, this paper formulates a new kind of RAP called repairable redundancy allocation problem (RRAP) in multi-state systems (RRAP in MSSs) to break the restrictions. RRAP in MSSs is nearer to reality and widespread in many critical systems. RRAP in MSSs is not only an NP-hard problem, but also a nonlinear integer optimization problem. In order to deal with RRAP in MSSs in a reasonable time, this paper employs an optimization method of soft computing called simplified swarm optimization (SSO). Finally, the results obtained by SSO have been compared with that obtained from genetic algorithm (GA). Computational results show that the SSO is very competitive and effective in this problem.	bridge circuit;computation;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;performance;rapid refresh;single sign-on;soft computing;swarm	Wei-Chang Yeh;Siang-Tai Wang;Chyh-Ming Lai;Yen-Cheng Huang;Yuk Ying Chung;Jsen-Shung Lin	2016	2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727710	mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;algorithm;metaheuristic	Robotics	16.13372400591181	-2.526635255963476	114887

Design/methodology/approach – There is much uncertain information in the distribution network optimization of supply chain, including fuzzy information, stochastic information and grey information, etc. Fuzzy information and stochastic information have been studied in supply chain, however grey information of the supply chain has not been covered. In the distribution problem of supply chain, grey demands are taken into account. Then, a mathematics model with grey demands has been constructed, and it can be transformed into a grey chance-constrained programming model, grey simulation and a proposed hybrid particle swarm optimization are combined to resolve it. An example is also computed in the last part of the paper. Findings – The results are convincing: not only that grey system theory can be used to deal with grey uncertain information about distribution of supply chain, but grey chance-constrained programming, grey simulation and particle swarm optimization can be combined to resolve the grey model. Practical implications – The method exposed in the paper can be used to deal with distribution problems with grey information in the supply chain, and network optimization results with a grey uncertain factor could be helpful for supply chain efficiency and practicability. Originality/value – The paper succeeds in realising both a constructed model of the distribution of supply chain with grey demands and a solution algorithm of the grey mathematics model by using one of the newest developed theories: grey systems theory.	algorithm;complex system;fuzzy logic;mathematical optimization;p3m;p5 (microarchitecture);particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;program optimization;programming model;simulation;systems theory	Qishan Zhang;Haiyan Wang;Hong Liu	2012	Kybernetes	10.1108/03684921211243293	distribution;supply chain management;artificial intelligence;supply chain;particle swarm optimization;operations research	ECom	14.315563791026145	-3.9202429695927257	114927

In this study, to overcome this isolation problem, we propose an integrated system that does PP and Scheduling in parallel and responds to fluctuations in job floor on time. One common problem observed in integration models is the increase in computational time in conjunction with the increase of problem size. Therefore in this study, we use a hybrid heuristic model combining both Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN). To improve GA performance and increase the efficiency of searching, we use a clustered chromosome structure and test the performance of GA with respect to different scenarios. Data provided by GA is used in constructing an FNN model that instantly provides new schedules as new constraints emerge in the production environment.

Strategies for traffic signal control typically seek to optimize average travel times, although reliability is in general not explicitly taken into account. In this paper, we propose a new framework for evaluating the consequences of signal-control tactics on both reliability and expected values of travel time, based on an analytic model of travel time distribution. A genetic-algorithm-based approach is then employed to identify optimal multicriteria signal control strategies, including sensitivity analysis, to the relative weighting between reliability and expected value. We expose the properties of the proposed framework via an empirical case study of four alternative optimization approaches (the signal setting optimized with the traditional Webster's method, TRANSYT model, and the newly proposed model) under various traffic conditions. Results indicate that the newly proposed framework outperforms the alternative signal control strategies in terms of both travel-time variability and expected travel time.	genetic algorithm;glossary of computer graphics;heart rate variability;mathematical optimization	Fangfang Zheng;Henk J. van Zuylen;Scott Le Vine	2017	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2016.2582920	stochastic process;simulation;genetic algorithm;computer science;engineering;reliability;mathematics;transport engineering;computational model;statistics	SE	10.105208552829446	-9.324184874394515	114955

In this article, two parallel heuristic algorithms are proposed, which are based on the ejection chain local search (EC) proposed by Yagiura et al. One is a simple parallelization called multistart parallel EC (MPEC) and the other is cooperative parallel EC (CPEC). In MPEC each search process independently explores search space while in CPEC search processes share partial information to cooperate with each other. The experimental results with 9 computers for large benchmark instances show that (1) MPEC and CPEC, respectively, run twice and 4 times faster than EC, and (2) compared to EC, the difference in quality between obtained solutions and theoretical lower bounds is reduced to [Formula: See Text] and [Formula: See Text] by MPEC and CPEC, respectively. It is said that these methods give us full benefit of parallelization, speedup and improvement for quality of solutions.	generalized assignment problem	Yuichi Asahiro;Masahiro Ishibashi;Masafumi Yamashita	2003	Optimization Methods and Software	10.1080/1055678031000107105	heuristic;mathematical optimization;computer science;generalized assignment problem;local search;theoretical computer science;heuristics;np-hard;mathematics;parallel algorithm;upper and lower bounds;algorithm	Robotics	21.97922452186764	3.0176521315036204	115087

This kind of problems is referred to as dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems (DMOOPs).

However, in recent years, algorithms were proposed to solve dynamic MOO (DMOO). This paper provides an overview of the algorithms that were proposed in the literature to solve DMOOPs.

7a13e5ea32aa688d5e366efe7b42d06c43737ed0	an efficient feature selection algorithm for evolving job shop scheduling rules with genetic programming		Automated design of job shop scheduling rules using genetic programming as a hyper-heuristic is an emerging topic that has become more and more popular in recent years. For evolving dispatching rules, feature selection is an important issue for deciding the terminal set of genetic programming. There can be a large number of features, whose importance/relevance varies from one to another. It has been shown that using a promising feature subset can lead to a significant improvement over using all the features. However, the existing feature selection algorithm for job shop scheduling is too slow and inapplicable in practice. In this paper, we propose the first “practical” feature selection algorithm for job shop scheduling. Our contributions are twofold. First, we develop a Niching-based search framework for extracting a diverse set of good rules. Second, we reduce the complexity of fitness evaluation by using a surrogate model. As a result, the proposed feature selection algorithm is very efficient. The experimental studies show that it takes less than 10% of the training time of the standard genetic programming training process, and can obtain much better feature subsets than the entire feature set. Furthermore, it can find better feature subsets than the best-so-far feature subset.	bean scripting framework;central processing unit;computation;feature selection;genetic programming;heuristic;hyper-heuristic;javascript style sheets;job shop scheduling;performance;relevance;scheduling (computing);selection algorithm;simulation;surrogate model;time complexity	Yi Mei;Su Nguyen;Bing Xue;Mengjie Zhang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence	10.1109/TETCI.2017.2743758	job shop scheduling;hyper-heuristic;algorithm;machine learning;genetic programming;artificial intelligence;surrogate model;feature selection;computer science;flow shop scheduling	AI	22.465475660077587	-2.543378462039804	115181
ba9a2477f423592b09a762af79a7ab2cf2907f10	incorporating decision maker’s preferences in a multi-objective approach for the software release planning		Release planning (RP) is one of the most complex and relevant activities in the iterative and incremental software development, because it addresses all decisions associated with the selection and assignment of requirements to releases. There are many approaches in which RP is formalized as an optimization problem. In this context, search-based software engineering (SBSE) deals with the application of search techniques to solve complex problems of software engineering. Since RP is a wicked problem with a large focus on human intuition, the decision maker’s (DM) opinion is a relevant issue to be considered when solving release planning problem. Thus, we emphasize the importance in gathering the DM’s preferences to guide the optimization process through search space area of his/her interests. Typically, RP is modelled as a multi-objective problem by considering to maximize overall clients satisfaction and minimize project risk. In this paper, we extend this notion and consider DM’s preferences as an additional objective. The DM defines a set of preferences about the requirements allocation which is stored in a preference base responsible for influencing the search process. The approach was validated through an empirical study, which consists of two different experiments, respectively identified as (a) automatic experiment and (b) participant-based experiment. Basically, the former aims to analyze the approach using different search-based algorithms (NSGA-II, MOCell, IBEA, and SPEA-II), over artificial and real-world instances, whereas the latter aims at evaluating the use of the proposal in a real scenario composed of human evaluations. The automatic experiment points out that NSGA-II obtained overall superiority in two of the three datasets investigated, positioning itself as a superior search technique for scenarios with few number of requirements and preferences, while IBEA showed to be better for larger ones (with more requirements and preferences). Regarding the participant-based experiment, it was found that two thirds of the participants evaluated the preference-based solution better than the non-preference-based one. The results suggest that it is feasible to investigate the approach in a real-world scenario. In addition, we made available a prototype tool in order to incorporate the human’s preferences about the requirements allocation into the solution of release planning.	algorithm;emoticon;experiment;iteration;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem;prototype;rp (complexity);requirement;search-based software engineering;software development;software release life cycle;wicked	Raphael Saraiva;Allysson Allex Araújo;Altino Dantas;Italo Yeltsin;Jerffeson Souza	2017	Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society	10.1186/s13173-017-0060-0	software development;computer science;wicked problem;management science;incremental build model;multi-objective optimization;objective approach;software release life cycle;search-based software engineering;optimization problem	SE	19.85292105327546	-4.878877978183019	115218
18589fca5aaac39a243c0ef00ebe634e00dfa75c	optimization and simulation based approach for an arrival and departure manager tool		This work proposes a methodology for developing an airport arrival and departure manager tool. This methodology employs optimization together with simulation techniques for improving the robustness of the solution. An arrival and departure manager tool is intended to help air traffic controllers in managing the inbound and outbound traffic without incurring in conflicts or delays. In this context, air traffic controllers need to have a tool able to help them to make the right decisions in a short time horizon. The main decisions taken in the present methodology for each aircraft are: entry time and entry speed in the airspace and push back time at the gate. The objective of this methodology is to have a smooth flow of aircraft both in the airspace and on the ground. Preliminary tests were made using Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport as case study, and the results show that conflicts were sensibly reduced.	inbound marketing;mathematical optimization;simulation	Paolo Scala;Miguel Mujica Mota;Daniel Delahaye	2016	2016 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)		simulation;engineering;operations research	EDA	12.476208452489939	-0.2672732184257296	115270

The objective of CVRP is to deliver a set of customers with known demands on minimum-cost vehicle routes originating and terminating at a delivery depot. CVRP is a difficult combinatorial problem, since it contains both the bin packing problem and the traveling salesperson problem as special cases. A simulated annealing combining local search approach is developed in this research to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problems. Computational results are reported on a sample of fourteen benchmark problems which have different settings. The developed approach obtained six solutions which are equal to the best solution found so far using the reasonable computing time. And the solutions obtained have the smaller relative deviation percentage (RDP) when compared with the best solution found so far in the literature. Therefore, the developed approach can perform well in different problem settings.	benchmark (computing);bin packing problem;computation;divergence (computer science);elemental;local search (optimization);remote desktop protocol;set packing;simulated annealing;travelling salesman problem;vehicle routing problem	Shih-Wei Lin;Kuo-Ching Ying;Zne-Jung Lee;Fu Hsung Hsi	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384457	mathematical optimization;bin packing problem;supply chain management;simulation;computer science	Robotics	17.121999205466068	1.4204480149564405	115378

First, I will discuss the challenges of urban logistics, more specifically in the context of last-mile delivery of freight into mega-cities like Singapore. I will present several case studies in Europe and Asia on the operation of Urban Consolidation Centers (UCCs) which enable collaboration among shippers, carriers, and retailers to consolidate deliveries. I will then discuss my research on market mechanisms and system that provide the necessary technology and incentives for multiple stakeholders to derive win-win benefits from operating within UCCs. In the second part, I will discuss last-mile delivery of passengers from a transport hub (such as a major train/bus station) to their homes. Improving last-mile public transportation is a major challenge in congested cities, and for this, I will discuss my research on mechanisms for taxi ridesharing, which is a viable option for cities like Hanoi, Singapore and many Asian cities where taxis are free-roaming agents. More specifically, I will present 2-level planning framework for making real-time clustering and routing decisions. The first upper/strategic level selects, from the set of current requests, the ones to be scheduled in a given period, which can be modelled and solved as Markov decision process (MDP). The second lower/operational level clusters and then routes the selected requests using a standard vehicle routing heuristic.	cluster analysis;heuristic;last mile;logistics;markov chain;markov decision process;open world;real-time clock;semiconductor consolidation;smart city;usb hub;vehicle routing problem	Hoong Chuin Lau	2014		10.1145/2676585.2676588	simulation;engineering;operations management;transport engineering	AI	13.1429346567371	0.016559659202855247	115432
06d4e8b3fe40e1a9efc716aba0e125cb64ff67f1	reinforcement learning-based bus holding for high-frequency services		Since the bus holding problem is an operational control problem, bus holding decisions should be made in realtime. For this reason, common bus holding approaches, such as the one-headway-based holding, focus on computationally inexpensive, rule-based techniques that try to minimize the deviation of the actual headways from the planned ones. Nevertheless, rule-based methods optimize the system locally without considering the full effect of the bus holding decisions to future trips or other performance indicators. For this reason, this work introduces a Reinforcement Learning approach which is capable of making holistic bus holding decisions in realtime after the completion of a training period. The proposed approach is trained in a circular bus line in Singapore using 400 episodes (where an episode is one day of operations) and evaluated using 200 episodes demonstrating a significant improvement in scenarios with strong travel time disturbances and a slight improvement in scenarios with low travel time variations.

These techniques have focused on discovering better backtrack points, learning from dead-ends and avoiding repetitious interference, problem reduction method and the use of network heuristics. Much of this research has derived innovative methods for solving the CSP, however, the evaluations of the techniques have remained diverse and in many cases, statistically inaccurate. Another issue with regard to the performance measurement of constraint satisfaction techniques is the inability to model computational constraint processing cost. It is not uncommon to find evaluations that are based on CSPs that differ only on the percentage of constraints and the tightness of each constraint. This may be justifiable if it can be established that they are the only contributing factors of the performance variable. The three aspects mentioned above comprise this paper’s main focus points. They come under the general headings of Modelling CSP Difficulty, Modelling Constraint Cost andElucidating Major Performance Factors respectively. This paper seeks to provide a set of proposals with respect to the above three well-known areas so as collectively to enhance the robustness of evaluations conducted in the field of constraint satisfaction. q 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

b6368bfc5e3bae5c780d3b7dcaaba75c46d4461d	solving the traveling thief problem using orchestration in optimization networks		Optimization problems can sometimes be divided into multiple subproblems. Working on these subproblems instead of the actual master problem can have some advantages, e.g. if they are standard problems, it is possible to use already existing algorithms, whereas specialized algorithms would have to be implemented for the master problem. In this paper we approach the NP-hard Traveling Thief Problem by implementing different cooperative approaches using optimization networks. Orchestration is used to guide the algorithms that solve the respective subproblems. We conduct experiments on some instances of a larger benchmark set to compare the different network approaches to best known results, as well as a sophisticated, monolithic approach. Using optimization networks, we are able to find new best solutions for all of the selected problem instances.	program optimization	Johannes Karder;Andreas Beham;Stefan Wagner;Michael Affenzeller	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-74718-7_37	computer science;theoretical computer science;orchestration (computing);artificial intelligence;machine learning;metaheuristic;evolutionary algorithm;optimization problem	Vision	21.389581821651383	0.4118231176045046	115759

The representation which is based on a path in the graph of states of dynamic programming is adapted to dynamic structure of the problem and it allows to hybridize easily evolutionary algorithms with dynamic programming. DYNAMOP is tested on two case studies of hydro-scheduling problem with different price scenarios. Experiments indicate that the proposed approach performs considerably better than classical genetic algorithms and dynamic programming.	dynamic programming;metaheuristic	Sophie Jacquin;Laetitia Vermeulen-Jourdan;El-Ghazali Talbi	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-45523-4_14	parallel metaheuristic;search-based software engineering	Robotics	22.714804992136727	-3.0066888317749894	115812
29fbfff999be2e022873476c07a708cbd4e339c8	avoiding ambiguity and assessing uniqueness in minisatellite alignment	004;minisatellite alignment dynamic programming ambiguity	Several algorithms have been suggested for minisatellite alignment. Their time complexity is high—close toO(n3)—due to the necessary reconstruction of duplication histories. We investigate the uniqueness of optimal alignments computed under the common single-copy duplication model. To this extent, it is necessary to avoid ambiguity in the algorithm employed. We re-code the ARLEM algorithm in the form of a grammar, and apply a disambiguation technique which uses a mapping to a canonical representation of minisatellite alignments. Having arrived at a nonambiguous algorithm this way, we demonstrate that the underlying model—independent of the algorithm—gives rise to an exorbitant number of different, co-optimal alignments when applied to real-world data. We conclude that alignment-free methods should be considered for minisatellite comparison. 1998 ACM Subject Classification J.3.a [Life and Medical Sciences]: biology and genetics	algorithm;optimal design;sequence alignment;time complexity;word-sense disambiguation	Benedikt Löwes;Robert Giegerich	2013		10.4230/OASIcs.GCB.2013.110	biology;bioinformatics;genetics	Comp.	15.706918941342785	-8.757507656667917	115833

The first model minimizes water and energy costs. The optimal freshwater and water flow rates within the HIWN are determined from this model. Using these optimal flow rates, different configurations of HIWN are evaluated for the purpose of heat integration. The second model is the stage-wise heat exchanger network (Yee and Grossmann, 1990), which is solved for each of the evaluated network configuration in a sequential manner. Using this proposed strategy, a set of locally optimal HIWNs are produced and the best one is chosen based on the minimum total annual cost (TAC). The proposed sequential strategy is applied to small and medium sized examples in the literature. The results show that the proposed new sequential solution strategy can be successfully applied to small and medium sized HIWN problems.

The truncated Adams’ model is applied to generate the probability and mean of delay of pedestrians non-complying with traffic law. Using the section-based traffic queuing-theory and the stochastic decomposition property of M/G/1 vacation system with exhaustive service, the mean delay of vehicles is formulated. A multi-objective optimization model simultaneously minimizing the delays of pedestrians and vehicles during a signal period is proposed. The effects, which several model parameters have on the delays and the optimal solution of the model, are illustrated by numerical examples.		Ren-Yong Guo;Xiaoshan Lu	2016	J.

Our approach to this challenge consists on using a meta-optimized Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) strategy which, at the end of each iteration, generates a new “ant” by running Simulated Annealing or applying a mutation operator to the best “ant” of the iteration. Results are compared to variations of this algorithm, as well as to other meta-heuristic methods. They show that the developed approach is a better alternative than regular ACO for the time-dependent TSP class of problems, and that applying a K-Opt optimization will usually improve the results.	heuristic (computer science);optimizing compiler	Diogo Duque;José Aleixo Cruz;Henrique Lopes Cardoso;Eugénio Oliveira	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-03493-1_76	air travels;machine learning;mathematical optimization;operator (computer programming);computer science;travelling salesman problem;meta-optimization;simulated annealing;ant colony optimization algorithms;metaheuristic;artificial intelligence	NLP	22.7575344722277	0.6108863825971469	116013

The optimal VAR dispatch problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained multiobjective optimization problem where the real power loss and the bus voltage deviations are to be minimized simultaneously. A new Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) based approach is proposed to handle the problem as a true multiobjective optimization problem with competing and noncommensurable objectives. A hierarchical clustering algorithm is imposed to provide the decision maker with a representative and manageable Pareto-optimal set. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach to generate true and well-distributed Paretooptimal nondominated solutions in one single run. The results also show the superiority of the proposed approach and confirm its potential to solve the multiobjective VAR dispatch problem.	cluster analysis;dynamic dispatch;evolutionary algorithm;hierarchical clustering;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;pareto efficiency	Mohammad Ali Abido;Jamil M.

cc61f4864febdbe7219e35ed2dd982cee46037f5	optimal configuration of power distribution networks with variable renewable energy resources		Abstract An attractive way to reduce losses in electric power distribution networks is addressing the network reconfiguration problem, which should give a topology for the primary distribution network that minimizes the total losses due to the electrical resistances in the lines and complementary equipment’s ( technical losses ). Distributed energy resources and additional innovations associated to smart grids allow enhancing the benefits of finding better network topologies. On the other hand, the integration of renewable energy sources with variable random outputs requires expanding the perspective in modeling the network reconfiguration problem and in the shaping of appropriate solution techniques. These issues are the object of this paper. The main new features of the problem are explored with a maquette designed to highlight the consequences of random generation sources in the networks. Following, the paper proposes a formulation for the problem that explicitly considers random energy sources. A state of the art genetic algorithm build under the biased random-key evolution framework (BRKGA) is developed to address this hard combinatorial optimization problem. Case studies with benchmark networks put into perspective the proposed methodology. Results show that random energy values should be explicitly modeled in contemporary approaches to the network reconfiguration problem. The paper provides the grounds for addressing this new problem and points to additional research paths in the area.		Ellen M. B. Cavalheiro;André H. B.

Evolutionary algorithms constitute a popular optimization method, but scalability is a concern with larger graph designs. Generative representation schemes, often inspired by biological development, seek to address this by facilitating the discovery and reuse of design dependencies and allowing for adaptable exploration strategies. We present a novel developmental method for optimizing graphs that is based on the notion of directly evolving a hypergraph grammar from which a population of graphs can be derived. A multi-objective design system is established and evaluated on problems from three domains: symbolic regression, circuit design, and neural control. The observed performance compares favorably with existing methods, and extensive reuse of subgraphs contributes to the efficient representation of solutions. Constraints can also be placed on the type of explored graph spaces, ranging from tree to pseudograph. We show that more compact solutions are attainable in less constrained spaces, although convergence typically improves with more constrained designs.	circuit design;emergence;evolution;evolutionary algorithm;graph (abstract data type);graph rewriting;hypergraph grammar;mathematical optimization;multigraph;relevance;scalability;search algorithm;symbolic regression;universality probability	Martin H.

These problems are defined by a set of variables and a set of constraints. Each variable has non-empty domain of possible value and each constraint involves some subset of the variables and specifies the allowable combinations of values for that subset. The resolution of these problems is carried out by a constraint satisfaction solver which explores a search tree of potential solutions. This exploration is controlled by the enumeration strategy, which is responsible for choosing the order in which variables and values are selected to generate the potential solution. There exist different ways to perform this selection, and depending on the quality of this decision, the efficiency of the solving process may dramatically vary. Autonomous search is a particular case of adaptive systems that aims at improving its solving performance by adapting itself to the problem at hand without manual configuration of an expert user. The goal is to improve their solving performance by modifying and adjusting themselves, either by self-adaptation or by supervised adaptation. This approach has been effectively applied to different optimization and satisfaction techniques such as constraint programming, metaheuristics, and SAT. In this paper, we present a new Autonomous Search approach for constraint programming based on four modern bio-inspired metaheuristics. The goal of those metaheuristics is to optimize the self-tuning phase of the constraint programming search process. We illustrate promising results, where the proposed approach is able to efficiently solve several well-known constraint satisfaction problems.	autonomous robot;constraint satisfaction problem	Ricardo Soto;Broderick Crawford;Rodrigo Olivares;Cristian Galleguillos;Carlos Castro;Franklin Johnson;Fernando Paredes;Enrique Norero	2016	Swarm and Evolutionary Computation	10.1016/j.swevo.2016.04.003	constraint logic programming;concurrent constraint logic programming;mathematical optimization;constraint programming;binary constraint;decomposition method;ac-3 algorithm;constraint satisfaction;constraint learning;constraint graph;machine learning;brute-force search;constraint satisfaction dual problem;mathematics;complexity of constraint satisfaction;constraint;constraint satisfaction problem;algorithm;hybrid algorithm;local consistency;backtracking	AI	20.43103526430276	-6.443789684654533	116593

The developed capacitor placement problem (CPP) has been formulated to make the objective function (i.e., planning method) more realistic by incorporating essential economic factors, viz., maintenance cost, interest on investment cost and inflation. This developed CPP is found capable of providing more cost-effective solution than existing approaches. Simulation results are obtained for IEEE 9-bus and 69-bus radial distribution system. Results obtained with NM-PSO, are compared with the PSO approach. For both the IEEE test systems, simulation results reveal more effective and profitable planning with NM-PSO. In addition, sensitivity analysis is carried out to highlight the impact of newly incorporated economic factors, justifying their inclusion in CPP.	algorithm;loss function;mathematical optimization;nelder–mead method;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;radial (radio);route inspection problem;simulation;viz: the computer game	Pradeep Kumar;Asheesh K.

Taxis are given advisories to move into these regions to ensure a better balance between number of waiting clients and free taxis overall. TADS performs the following tasks: (1) estimates system states (number of free taxis and waiting clients), (2) generates appropriate number of advisory tokens and, (3) distributes advisory tokens. We perform evaluation of our proposed system based on traces obtained from a large Singapore taxi company that operates more than 15,000 taxis. Our results show that TADS can reduce the number of clients with wait times longer than 60 minutes by over 30%.	dynamic dispatch;tads;tracing (software)	Fai Cheong Choo;Mun Choon Chan;Akkihebbal L.

Moreover, dynamic decision blocks are introduced to the hyperheuristic to make a better balance between optimization performance and computation efficiency.

To address the difficulties of the proposed scheduling model with respect to minimizing the makespan, we adapt the PSOSAHT algorithm framework proposed previously, where particle swarm optimization based exploration and simulated annealing based exploitation are well integrated, and the hypothesis test is to compare the stochastic makespan in statistical sense to avoid repeated search. Computational results on typical benchmark problems demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the PSOSAHT algorithm. It is worth noting that it is the first attempt to address the no-wait stochastic distributed assembly flowshop by hybrid PSO strategy.	algorithm;assembly language;benchmark (computing);combinatorial optimization;computation;ieee congress on evolutionary computation;makespan;mathematical optimization;memetic algorithm;memetics;np-hardness;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;scheduling (computing);sensitivity and specificity;simulated annealing	Mengchen Ji;Yixin Yang;Wenzhe Duan;Shouyang Wang;Bo Liu	2016	2016 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2016.7744120	job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;computer science;stochastic optimization;machine learning;particle swarm optimization;encoding	AI	21.44128650039109	0.6928313970642905	117137

When solving a CSP, the order in which the variables are selected to be instantiated and the order of the corresponding values to be tried affect the complexity of the search. Hyper-heuristics are flexible methods that provide generality when solving different problems and, within CSP, they can be used to determine the next variable and value to try. They select from a set of low-level heuristics and decide which one to apply at each decision point according to the problem state. This study explores a hyper-heuristic model for variable and value ordering within CSP based on a decision matrix hyper-heuristic that is constructed by going into a local improvement method that changes small portions of the matrix. The results suggest that the approach is able to combine the strengths of different low-level heuristics to perform well on a wide range of instances and compensate for their weaknesses on specific instances.	artificial intelligence;constraint satisfaction;heuristic (computer science);high- and low-level;hyper-heuristic;operations research;procedural generation;the matrix	José Carlos Ortiz-Bayliss;Hugo Terashima-Marín;Ender Özcan;Andrew J.

9f4c049daba3328e38d0e75386e7ca97baf3df60	competitive island-based cooperative coevolution for efficient optimization of large-scale fully-separable continuous functions		In this paper, we investigate the performance of introducing competition in cooperative coevolutionary algorithms to solve large-scale fully-separable continuous optimization problems. It may seem that solving large-scale fully-separable functions is trivial by means of problem decomposition. In principle, due to lack of variable interaction in fullyseparable problems, any decomposition is viable. However, the decomposition strategy has shown to have a significant impact on the performance of cooperative coevolution on such functions. Finding an optimal decomposition strategy for solving fully-separable functions is laborious and requires extensive empirical studies. In this paper, we use a competitive two-island cooperative coevolution in which two decomposition strategies compete and collaborate to solve a fully-separable problem. Each problem decomposition has features that may be beneficial at different stages of optimization. Therefore, competition and collaboration of such decomposition strategies may eliminate the need for finding an optimal decomposition. The experimental results in this paper suggest that competition and collaboration of suboptimal decomposition strategies of a fully-separable problem can generate better solutions than the standard cooperative coevolution with standalone decomposition strategies. We also show that a decomposition strategy that implements competition against itself can also improve the overall optimization performance.	algorithm;continuous optimization;cooperative mimo;cooperative coevolution;custom integrated circuits conference;mathematical optimization	Kavitesh Bali;Rohitash Chandra;Mohammad Nabi Omidvar	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-26555-1_16	machine learning;continuous optimization;empirical research;artificial intelligence;cooperative coevolution;computer science;separable space;continuous function	AI	23.46922594006854	-4.429377187980931	117210
425225dc310ed53f4532a8821e2be17c376a8eaf	multi-objective optimization of the integrated problem of location assignment and straddle carrier scheduling in maritime container terminal at import		Maritime terminals need more efficiency in their handling operations due to the phenomenal evolution of world container traffic, and to the increase of the container ship capacity. In this work, we propose a new integrated modeling considering the optimization of maritime container terminals using straddle carriers. The problem is considered at import. We study a combination between two known problems, the first is the storage location assignment problem, and the second is the straddle carrier scheduling problem. This approach, which combines between two chronologically successive problems, leads to the use of multi-objective optimization. In fact, we study the multi-objective integrated problem of location assignment and Straddle carrier Scheduling (IPLASS) in maritime container terminal at import. We prove that the problem is NP-Complete. The objective is to minimize the operating cost which we evaluate according to eight components: the date of last task called makespan, the total vehicle operating time, the total storage bay occupation time, the number of vehicles used, the number of storage bays used, the number of storage locations used, and two different costs of storage location assignment. The location assignment costs are evaluated in order to facilitate the containers transfer for deliveries. We assume that the operating cost is a function of these components and that the influence of each component is variable and dependent on different parameters. These parameters are essentially: the number of quays in the terminal, the straddle carrier traffic layout, the number of container ships to serve in the terminal, the influence of concurrent operations in the terminal, the storage space configuration, the number of free storage bays, the number of free straddle carriers, the number of free quay cranes, the mobility of quay cranes, etc. To solve IPLASS efficiently, we propose an adapted multi-objective Tabu Search algorithm. Lower-bound evaluations are introduced to perform approximation of Pareto Front. To explore efficiently the non-convex Pareto Front Region, we evaluate also a maximized distance adapted to the set of objectives. Indicators of efficiency are developed to propose distinguished solutions to operator. 2D-projections of approximated Pareto Frontier are given to more understand the efficiency of proposed solutions.

33349a174df9f0629737d19100c9e0bd6cb28658	adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning with hybrid exploration for traffic signal control based on cooperative multi-agent framework	reinforcement learning;multi objective optimization;adaptive optimization;exploration;cooperative multi agent system;traffic signal control	In this paper, we focus on computing a consistent traffic signal configuration at each junction that optimizes multiple performance indices, i.e., multi-objective traffic signal control. The multi-objective function includes minimizing trip waiting time, total trip time, and junction waiting time. Moreover, the multi-objective function includes maximizing flow rate, satisfying green waves for platoons traveling in main roads, avoiding accidents especially in residential areas, and forcing vehicles to move within moderate speed range of minimum fuel consumption. In particular, we formulate our multi-objective traffic signal control as a multi-agent system (MAS). Traffic signal controllers have a distributed nature in which each traffic signal agent acts individually and possibly cooperatively in a MAS. In addition, agents act autonomously according to the current traffic situation without any human intervention. Thus, we develop a multi-agent multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) traffic signal control framework that simulates the driver's behavior (acceleration/deceleration) continuously in space and time dimensions. The proposed framework is based on a multi-objective sequential decision making process whose parameters are estimated based on the Bayesian interpretation of probability. Using this interpretation together with a novel adaptive cooperative exploration technique, the proposed traffic signal controller can make real-time adaptation in the sense that it responds effectively to the changing road dynamics. These road dynamics are simulated by the Green Light District (GLD) vehicle traffic simulator that is the testbed of our traffic signal control. We have implemented the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) acceleration model in the GLD traffic simulator. The change in road conditions is modeled by varying the traffic demand probability distribution and adapting the IDM parameters to the adverse weather conditions. Under the congested and free traffic situations, the proposed multi-objective controller significantly outperforms the underlying single objective controller which only minimizes the trip waiting time (i.e., the total waiting time in the whole vehicle trip rather than at a specific junction). For instance, the average trip and waiting times are ~8 and 6 times lower respectively when using the multi-objective controller.	multi-agent system;reinforcement learning	Mohamed A. Khamis;Walid E.

cf30b7cc00ae144d39fc6262c1861ed1e57143f7	dynamic programming based metaheuristics for the dial-a-ride problem	dynamic programming;dial a ride problem;large neighborhood search	The organization of a specialized transportation system to perform transports for elderly and handicapped people is usually modeled as dial-a-ride problem. Users place transportation requests with specified pickup and delivery locations and times. The requests have to be completed under user inconvenience considerations by a specified fleet of vehicles. In the dial-a-ride problem, the aim is to minimize the total travel times respecting the given time windows, the maximum user ride times, and the vehicle restrictions. This paper introduces a dynamic programming algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem and demonstrates its effective application in (hybrid) metaheuristic approaches. Compared to most of the works presented in literature, this approach does not make use of any (commercial) solver. We present an exact dynamic programming algorithm and a dynamic programming based metaheuristic, which restricts the considered solution space. Then, we propose a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm which integrates the dynamic programming based algorithms into a large neighborhood framework. The algorithms are tested on a given set of benchmark instances from the literature and compared to a state-of-the-art hybrid large neighborhood search approach.	dynamic programming;metaheuristic	Ulrike Ritzinger;Jakob Puchinger;Richard F.

The algorithm is motivated by the need for interactive, multi-objective, and efficient optimization approaches to solving problems with fuzzy conflicting goals and constraints. The SM goes through initialization, growth, and maturation phases, mimicking the metamorphosis process. Initialization generates a candidate solution which successively goes through growth and maturation loops. Comparative computational tests on benchmark problems show that, when compared to other algorithms, SM is more efficient and effective, producing near-optimal solutions within reasonable computation times.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);computation;control flow;global optimization;iterative method;job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;memoization;metaheuristic;multi-objective optimization;nurse scheduling problem;scheduling (computing);simulated annealing;simulation;vehicle routing problem	Michael Mutingi;Charles Mbohwa	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management	10.1109/IEEM.2014.7058657	nurse scheduling problem;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;simulation;engineering;operations management;mathematics	Robotics	21.725805980158786	-1.1329214367077929	117409

The AGVS delivers containers of material from a central depot to workcenters throughout the factory floor. The workcenters are partitioned into delivery zones. They are served by a common pool of automated guided vehicles (AGVs), each of which can carry multiple orders per delivery. The demand of the workcenters and the time until delivery are stochastic. We develop a nonlinear binary integer program to determine the optimal partition of workcenters into zones, the optimal number of AGVs to purchase, and the set of workcenters that warrant AGV delivery, subject to constraints on maximum allowable mean waiting time for material delivery. We develop an analytical expression for the mean waiting time until material delivery and present an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm that solves the AGVS design model optimally. Wi...

975be67cd2fd8766d9618513ec408ea836d92fef	a multiagent-based approach for vehicle routing by considering both arriving on time and total travel time		Arriving on time and total travel time are two important properties for vehicle routing. Existing route guidance approaches always consider them independently, because they may conflict with each other. In this article, we develop a semi-decentralized multiagent-based vehicle routing approach where vehicle agents follow the local route guidance by infrastructure agents at each intersection, and infrastructure agents perform the route guidance by solving a route assignment problem. It integrates the two properties by expressing them as two objective terms of the route assignment problem. Regarding arriving on time, it is formulated based on the probability tail model, which aims to maximize the probability of reaching destination before deadline. Regarding total travel time, it is formulated as a weighted quadratic term, which aims to minimize the expected travel time from the current location to the destination based on the potential route assignment. The weight for total travel time is designed to be comparatively large if the deadline is loose. Additionally, we improve the proposed approach in two aspects, including travel time prediction and computational efficiency. Experimental results on real road networks justify its ability to increase the average probability of arriving on time, reduce total travel time, and enhance the overall routing performance.	agent-based model;assignment problem;semiconductor industry;vehicle routing problem	Zhiguang Cao;Hongliang Guo;Jie Zhang	2017	ACM TIST	10.1145/3078847	machine learning;vehicle routing problem;artificial intelligence;real-time computing;computer science;route assignment;intelligent transportation system	AI	14.051276076331915	0.3585481692953145	117536

Differently from the traditional vehicle loading problems, there is also a set of optional items that may be loaded in order to maximize the used capacity of the selected vehicles. The problem is decomposed in two subproblems: i) selection; ii) packing. In the former subproblem vehicles and items (including optional items) are chosen for the weekly delivery. In the latter the items selected for each vehicle are packed in the vehicle. We propose an integer programming formulation to solve the selection subproblem and an evolutionary algorithm for the packing subproblem. They work cooperatively, the solution of each one depending on the solution of the other one. We show the results for several instances, and also compare the results for instances of the literature without optional items, showing that although proposed to this specific problem, the method is general enough to compete with the best methods in other packing problems.integer programming formulation	evolutionary algorithm;integer programming;set packing	Oberlan Christo Romao;André Gustavo dos Santos;José Elias Claudio Arroyo	2012	2012 12th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA)	10.1109/ISDA.2012.6416558	mathematical optimization;bin packing problem;integer programming;computer science;evolutionary computation	Robotics	16.796688618523334	1.4410374049604646	117544

The deterministic version of the problem can be formulated as a large-scale set covering problem. Several heuristic algorithms are proposed to generate decision policies for the stochastic optimization model over a long rolling horizon. The resulting policies have been extensively tested on instances which display the main characteristics of the industrial case-study that motivated the research. The tests demonstrate the benefits of the multi-period stochastic model over simple myopic strategies. A simple and efficient heuristic is shown to deliver good policies and to be robust against errors in the estimation of the probability distribution of the release dates.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;bin packing problem;bridging (networking);computation;covering problems;experiment;heuristic (computer science);knowledge management;loss function;optimization problem;re (complexity);randomness;reactive planning;scientific literature;set cover problem;set packing;solver;stochastic optimization	Yasemin Arda;Yves Crama;David Kronus;Thierry Pironet;Pascal Van Hentenryck	2014	EURO J.

Satisfying the task dependencies strictly and minimizing the execution time are the desired aims of the task scheduling algorithm. However, most scheduling algorithms focuses on minimizing the execution time without a clear strategy to preserve the precedence constraints. In this paper, a new two-phase algorithm called Hierarchic Hybrid Heuristic-Genetic Scheduling (H3GS) is introduced and developed for heterogeneous distributed computing systems (HeDCSs). In the first phase, the paper proposes a improvement list-based heuristic algorithm, called H2EFT, and the main principle of the algorithm is to divide the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) into levels, which simplifies the task dependencies and preserves the precedence constraints of tasks. The second phase implements a hierarchic genetic algorithm, called HGAS, which proceeds to evolve shorter schedules by inserting the H2EFT schedule into the initial populations and repairing the invalid schedule on the basis of the DAG hierarchy. Consequently, the H3GS algorithm delivers high quality solution in reasonable computing time based on a hierarchical DAG. The comparison performance results show that H3GS has outperformed the HEFT, H2EFT, and H2GS algorithms both in efficiency, complexity, and quality.	big data;data dependency;directed acyclic graph;display resolution;distributed computing;genetic algorithm;heterogeneous earliest finish time;heuristic (computer science);np-hardness;population;run time (program lifecycle phase);scheduling (computing);two-phase commit protocol	Yuanyuan Xie;Jiang Wu;Fengzhu Liu	2016	2016 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ISPA	10.1109/TrustCom.2016.0319	fair-share scheduling;fixed-priority pre-emptive scheduling;parallel computing;real-time computing;earliest deadline first scheduling;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;genetic algorithm scheduling;foreground-background;distributed computing	HPC	20.04910153136122	-0.09226099932950456	118202

The proposed mapping schemes present the different relations between the constructed class of variables according to the interaction feature and the constructed class of variables according to the imbalance feature. Covering a wide range of real-world problems is considered in the mapping schemes; therefore it can provide some insights to design LSGO benchmark suites. By developing LSGO benchmark suites with the ability of representing many-real world problems, researchers will be motivated to realize the success or failure level of LSGO algorithms for tackling various types of LSGO problems. Also, a preliminary set of experiments is conducted to present the importance of considered features in each scheme.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);distribution (mathematics);experiment;global optimization;schematic	Sedigheh Mahdavi;Shahryar Rahnamayan	2017	2017 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2017.7969373	artificial intelligence;global optimization;mathematical optimization;machine learning;computer science;algorithm design;benchmark (computing);linear programming;schematic	AI	22.625400103693483	-4.128899581037458	118229

Two different case studies in mining are presented, both requiring a blending optimization. The primary problem at hand is to model a complex supply chain involving blending of multiple inputs to produce a number of potential products for customers. The first approach involves solving an optimization model to produce a long term plan, then simulating this plan over time without the ability to change the plan as time progresses. The second approach involves a more integrated system where multiple instances of an optimization model are run throughout the simulation using updated inputs. A description of the problem is supplied, providing the need for both optimization and simulation, and then the two case studies are compared to show the benefits of integrating the optimization within the simulation model.	alpha compositing;mathematical optimization;simulation	Tom Sandeman;Chris Fricke;Peter Bodon;Chris Stanford	2010	Proceedings of the 2010 Winter Simulation Conference		multi-swarm optimization;supply chain management;simulation;engineering;multi-objective optimization;simulation modeling;supply chain;operations research	AI	11.747396510245693	-2.8002443085457798	118264

e4da5835d979dae527bcbde7c3fefb0607e5da0a	research on scheduling of iron and steel scrap steelmaking and continuous casting process aiming at power saving and carbon emissions reducing		Iron and steel scrap could substitute ironstone as the raw material for steelmaking and continuous casting (CC) production, and effectively reduce emissions of waste gas, water, and residue. The iron and steel scrap steelmaking and continuous casting (ISSSC) process is a compact production process involving scrap steel as a raw material, electric arc furnace, refining (RH/CAS/KIP/LF), and CC. Traditional scheduling of ISSSC has emphasized production performance indexes without considering energy and environmental factors. This study presents a new mathematical programming model for the scheduling of ISSSC that considers energy consumption with time-of-use electricity price and associated carbon emissions in addition to production performance indexes. The complexity of the multiobjective mixed-integer programming problem increases if the interval of the time-of-use electricity price is enlarged, the main and accessorial equipment is considered separately, and the flexible processing time is controllable. Under the linearization augmented Lagrangian relaxation framework, a solution methodology, based on controllable direction and a step surrogate subgradient Lagrangian algorithm, is developed according to the charge-based subproblem splitting policy. This solution could keep a smaller intersection angle between the gradient and the optimal direction, damping the zigzag, reducing the number of iterations, and ensuring the optimization efficiency for the scheduling of ISSSC. Numerical testing results show that the method generates high quality schedules in a timely fashion, while considering the time-of-use electricity price and associated carbon emissions.	carbon;continuous positive airway pressure;display resolution;emission - male genitalia finding;enlargement procedure;furnace device component;gradient;index;integer (number);integer programming;intersection of set of elements;iron;iteration;kitlg gene;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;mathematics;numerical method;programming model;schedule (document type);schedule (project management);scheduling (computing);scheduling - hl7 publishing domain;small;steel;subderivative;subgradient method;algorithm	Liangliang Sun;Hang Jin;Ye Li	2018	IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters	10.1109/LRA.2018.2849500	waste management;control engineering;scheduling (computing);scrap;continuous casting;engineering;greenhouse gas;steelmaking	Robotics	13.663140490136607	3.78598070309384	118420

Existing procedures typically involve pure computer simulations followed by expensive and restricted field studies. We propose a more integrated solution: using mobile devices to mimic the algorithms within actual technologies so that advanced technological design alternatives can be cheaply evaluated on the field. A process architecture is developed for a tablet-based cyber-physical surrogate system. The tablet devices can mimic many equipment packages and can transmit data, location, text, and video between themselves and a central facility. Measures of effectiveness are identified for evaluating these surrogate systems in field trials. Three surrogate systems are implemented as field experiments conducted on the Ryerson University campus in Toronto, ON. The experiments? measures of effectiveness are deviation from a schedule, total process time, and person counts-applicable to many real world transportation problems. The experiments demonstrate how we can quantitatively measure these technologies from the field: an average improvement of 64% in cumulative schedule deviation for the """"Uniform Arrivals"""" experiment, 27% in the total process time for the """"Scavenger Hunt"""" experiment, but a poor mimic error when evaluating the LIVEGAUGE stationary sensor.

The customer service level associated with time window is characterized by fuzzy membership functions based on fuzzy set theory. A novel multi-objective fuzzy programming model of PDPFTW is proposed. The proposed model aims at minimizing the vehicle numbers and the overall travel costs and maximizing the total customer service level. A novel differential evolution algorithm (DE) for PDPFTW is also proposed. In DE, we first adopted the novel decimal coding to construct an initial population, and then used some improved differential evolution operators unlike existing algorithm, in mutation operation, we used an integer order criterion based on natural number coding method and introduced a penalty technical to publish the infeasible solution. In addition, in the crossover operation, we designed a self-adapting crossover probability that varied with iteration. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed DE, which saved some running time compare with GA in 100,200,400 and 1000 cases. At the same time, DE can get better solutions compare with GA in total distance of vehicles, total services level of customers and vehicle numbers. Moreover, we found that total service level would increase with wider time window.	algorithm;differential evolution;fuzzy set;iteration;microsoft windows;programming model;set theory;software release life cycle;time complexity	Dong Chen;Erbao Cao;Wentian Lai	2016	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-151752	fuzzy logic;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;differential evolution	AI	18.335167916056985	-1.7196113331167004	118961

The concept of diversity is managed in our framework in order to both avoid stagnation and to explore the search space. To evaluate our method, we use a well-known local search algorithm. This algorithm has been specially designed for solving instances of the challenging Traveling Tournament Problem. We compare the performance obtained running different configurations of the local search algorithm to the ones using our framework.

The relative importance (weights) of the objectives are often not known during the design of the control and can change with changing production conditions and requirements. In this work a novel model-free multi objective reinforcement learning approach for adaptive optimal control of manufacturing processes is proposed.

The forward-reserve allocation problem determines the set of Stock-Keeping Units and their space allocations in the forward area to maximize the forward area's benefit by trading off the relevant costs of order picking and internal replenishment. The mathematical model of this decision resembles the classical knapsack problem with the additional complexity that it has a discontinuous nonlinear cost function. A simple greedy heuristic has been proposed in the literature to solve this problem. This paper proposes an alternative branch-and-bound algorithm that can quickly solve the problem to optimality. Heuristic and optimal solutions are numerically compared using problem instances based on real warehouse data. Results suggest that the heuristic solutions are very close to the optimal ones in terms of both the objective value and the forward assignment.		Jinxiang Gu;Marc Goetschalckx;Leon F.

We consider an infinite horizon where a fleet of capacitated homogeneous vehicles, housed at a depot/warehouse, transports products from the warehouse to meet the demand specified by the customers in each period. The demand for each product is stochastic and time varying and each customer request a distinct product. The inventory holding cost is product specific and is incurred at the customer sites. At the stage of considered planning, we have a dual purpose; minimizing the total transportation and inventory holding cost while ensuring each customer's demand is met over the planning horizon. So the problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model, and we use the optimization methodology based on ant behaviors which named the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The proposed algorithm is coupled to a local search algorithm to improve the solutions generated by the ants.	ant colony optimization algorithms;i/o request packet;integer programming;inventory;linear programming;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;np-hardness;routing;search algorithm;stochastic process	Cheikh Noufissa;El Merouani Mohamed	2016	2016 3rd International Conference on Logistics Operations Management (GOL)	10.1109/GOL.2016.7731685	inventory theory;ant colony optimization algorithms;simulation;operations management;business;operations research	Robotics	15.60408594623824	1.9237811382824925	119354

14b4c7d90b39e47e35a000b75d1409973f32480d	a bicriteria approach identifying nondominated portfolios		We explore a portfolio constructive model, formulated in terms of satisfaction of a given set of technical requirements, with the minimum number of projects and minimum redundancy. An algorithm issued from robust portfolio modeling is adapted to a vector model, modifying the dominance condition as convenient, in order to find the set of nondominated portfolios, as solutions of a bicriteria integer linear programming problem. In order to improve the former algorithm, a process finding an optimal solution of a monocriteria version of this problem is proposed, which is further used as a first feasible solution aiding to find nondominated solutions more rapidly. Next, a sorting process is applied on the input data or information matrix, which is intended to prune nonfeasible solutions early in the constructive algorithm. Numerical examples show that the optimization and sorting processes both improve computational efficiency of the original algorithm. Their limits are also shown on certain complex instances.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;exploratory search;formation matrix;hyper-heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;numerical method;optimization problem;requirement;simulation;sorting	Javier Pereira;Broderick Crawford;Fernando Paredes;Ricardo Soto	2014	J.

Many evolutionary  techniques such as particle swarm optimization, differential evolution have been applied to solve these problems and found  to perform in a better way in comparison with conventional optimization methods. But often these methods converge to a sub-optimal  solution prematurely. This paper presents a new improved particle swarm optimization technique called self-organizing hierarchical  particle swarm optimization technique with time-varying acceleration coefficients (SOHPSO_TVAC) for solving daily economic  generation scheduling of hydrothermal systems to avoid premature convergence. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated  on a sample test system comprising of cascaded reservoirs. The results obtained by the proposed methods are compared with  other methods. The results show that the proposed technique is capable of producing comparable results.    	particle swarm optimization	Kamal K.

989430f1a1d325147590b3f6c283d09e64f85c2a	serendipity-empowered path planning for predictive task completion		People spend a great deal of time driving and performing daily tasks. Although a number of studies have focused on personalized path planning and task management, people tend to miss out on the opportunities to complete some tasks that could be accomplished on their regular drive. We are interested in supporting serendipity: completing other necessary tasks on the way to a destination. As there are a number of places to complete tasks around a driver's regular commute, combining tasks and regular paths gives people opportunities to find places where they can complete tasks without extra planning and time. For this purpose, we propose a serendipity-empowered path recommendation that combines daily tasks with drivers' regular routes for predictive task completion. The proposed approach first generates a number of diverse or serendipitous paths by iteratively extending routes to consider the given tasks of drivers and corresponding point of interests. It then selects the best path by ranking the serendipitous routes with their properties. Using the best path, users are then able to perform their daily tasks on the way to their originally planned destination. We evaluated the proposed approach by modeling regular routes and tasks from 12 local drivers, and simulating serendipitous routes with a simulation prototype. We found that using serendipitous routes reduced the number of trips and time required for completing the tasks. We also found that the drivers tended to do their tasks when they moved from their office to their home and had no preferred ranking strategy for selecting the best route.		Choonsung Shin;Brian D.

4d23169267a3d2ceea2bb3c6d18e8050500bed2d	modeling and optimization of multi-echelon transportation systems — a hybrid approach		The efficient and timely distribution of freight goods is critical for supporting the demands of modern urban areas. Optimum freight ensures the survival and development of urban areas. In the contemporary logistic there are two main distribution strategies: direct distribution and multi-echelon distribution. In the direct distribution, means of transport, starting from the main distribution center, bring their freight directly to the delivery points, while in the multi-echelon systems, freight is delivered from the main distribution center to the delivery points through intermediate points (local warehouses, satellites). This study presents a concept and implementation of a integrated approach to modeling and optimization the MultiEchelon Systems. In the proposed approach, two methods of constraint logic programming (CLP) and mathematical programming (MP) were integrated and hybridized. The proposed hybrid approach will be compared with classical mathematical programming on the same data sets (known benchmarks) for illustrative multi-echelon model — Two-Echelon Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (2E-CVRP).	constraint logic programming;mathematical optimization;row echelon form;vehicle routing problem	Tadeusz Stefanski;Pawel Sitek	2017	2017 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)	10.15439/2017F80	computer science;data modeling;distribution center;vehicle routing problem;constraint logic programming;mathematical optimization;data set;warehouse	Robotics	15.56872070164849	1.667294965933549	120648

In this paper, we focus on combining important features of these two steps and propose a simultaneous solution approach to redefine timetables with the objective of bringing improvements to both quality of service and vehicle costs incurred. This includes the objectives of quantity and quality of the transfers proposed, evenness of the line headways, fleet size and length of the deadheads. The model proposed for this simultaneous approach is adapted to the problem faced by regulating authorities, encouraging intermodality and taking into account a variety of practical features. We introduce an optimization procedure based on Iterated Local Search and present computational experiments carried out on data from a large existing transit network, showing substantial improvements in both quality of service and level of resources compared to the current practice.	computation;experiment;iterated function;iterated local search;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;quality of service;schedule;scheduling (computing)	Valérie Guihaire;Jin-Kao Hao	2010	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2010.02.005	transport;mathematical optimization;simulation;computer experiment;quality of service;computer science;engineering;operations management;iterated local search;transport engineering	AI	15.182199579084266	2.0305627454620994	120725

However, most of these papers focused on the single objective RCPSP; only a few papers concentrated on the multi-objective resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MORCPSP). Inspired by a procedure called electromagnetism (EM), which can help a generic population-based evolutionary search algorithm to obtain good results for single objective RCPSP, in this paper we attempt to extend EM and hybridize it with three reputable state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) i.e. NSGA-II, SPEA2 and MOEA/D, for MORCPSP. Our two objectives are minimizing makespan and total tardiness. We perform computational experiments on standard benchmark datasets. Empirical comparison and analysis of the results obtained by the hybridization versions of EM with NSGA-II, SPEA2 and MOEA/D are conducted. The results demonstrate that EM can improve the performance of NSGA-II and SPEA2.	benchmark (computing);combinatorial optimization;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;moea framework;makespan;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;scheduling (computing);search algorithm	Jing Xiao;Zhou Wu;Jianchao Tang	2014		10.1145/2576768.2598228	mathematical optimization;electromagnetism;computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-objective optimization;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;mathematics	AI	23.015833841477907	-2.9741670469765187	120796

There are methodologies to determine a good weight setting for these features based on inverse optimization, allowing them to be combined into one objective. The distance of the minimum-cost route on a network where the arc costs are determined by this weighted objective will then form the basis of invoicing. From detailed collected and agreed routes acting as the most preferred solutions, we can evaluate the quality of our proposed approach. Multiple sources of information are used, e.g., lidar, aerial photos, and GIS databases are collected and made available. There has been a demand from end-users to also include vertical and horizontal curvature as road features in the route selection. Since such values are not directly collected or stored in databases, they must be analyzed and estimated using geographical information. We propose a methodology for computing vertical and horizontal curvatures that represent the perception of such features, as well as processes to clean and complement inaccurate coordinates in the data. The proposed decision tools work very well in practice and are implemented in the intelligent transport planning system called calibrated route finder (CRF). CRF has been used on national level for distance calculation and route selection on since 2010, and the proposed use of vertical and horizontal curvatures was implemented during 2014. Today, over 50% of all forest sector transport invoicing in Sweden is based on the system.	aerial photography;conditional random field;database;decision support system;geographic information system;mathematical optimization	Gunnar Svenson;Patrik Flisberg;Mikael Rönnqvist	2016	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2015.2503424	simulation;geometric design;big data;computer science;engineering;transport engineering;fuel efficiency	Visualization	11.40274366429855	-6.249352135624726	121022

This problem is described as a Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Linehaul and Backhaul customers (VRPMB). The goods delivered from the depot to the customers can be alternated with the goods picked up. Other variants of VRP added to VRPMB are Heterogeneous fleet and Time Windows. This paper studies a complex VRP called HVRPMBTW which concerns a logistic/transport society, a problem rarely studied in literature. In this paper, we propose a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with a local search. This approach has shown its effectiveness on several combinatorial problems. The adaptation of this approach to the problem studied is explained and tested on the benchmarks. The results are compared with our previous methods and they show that in several cases PSO improves the results.	algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);mathematical optimization;microsoft windows;particle swarm optimization;vehicle routing problem	Farah Belmecheri;Christian Prins;Farouk Yalaoui;Lionel Amodeo	2013	J.

c40976669eb7bf929febd2bfcae9033a364cecd3	on the effect of reference point in moea/d for multi-objective optimization	evolutionary computation;decomposition;multi objective optimization;reference point;moea d	Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) has continuously proven effective for multi-objective optimization. So far, the effect of weight vectors and scalarizing methods in MOEA/D has been intensively studied. However, the reference point which serves as the starting point of reference lines (determined by weight vectors) is yet to be well studied. This study aims to fill in this research gap. Ideally, the  ideal  point of a multi-objective problem could serve as the reference point, however, since the  ideal  point is often unknown beforehand, the reference point has to be estimated (or specified). In this study, the effect of the reference point specified in three representative manners, i.e., pessimistic, optimistic and dynamic (from optimistic to pessimistic), is examined on three sets of benchmark problems. Each set of the problems has different degrees of difficulty in convergence and spread. Experimental results show that (i) the reference point implicitly impacts the convergence and spread performance of MOEA/D; (ii) the pessimistic specification emphasizes more of exploiting existing regions and the optimistic specification emphasizes more of exploring new regions; (iii) the dynamic specification can strike a good balance between exploitation and exploration, exhibiting good performance for most of the test problems, and thus, is commended to use for new problems.	moea framework;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization	Rui Wang;Jian Xiong;Hisao Ishibuchi;Guohua Wu;Tao Zhang	2017	Appl.

To address this goal, we present a multidisciplinary approach for designing water supply networks for slums in large cities by applying mathematical optimization.

9e2039c5bed07059111f35790cea42710bf98095	uct in capacitated vehicle routing problem with traffic jams		In this paper a dynamic version of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) which takes into account traffic jams is considered. Traffic jams occur randomly according to pre-defined intensity and length distributions. In effect, static CVRP is transformed into a non-deterministic scheduling problem with high uncertainty factor and changing in time internal problem parameters. Our proposed solution to CVRP with traffic jams (CVRPwTJ) relies on application of the Upper Confidence Bounds applied to Trees (UCT) method, which is an extension of the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. The most challenging issue here is finding a suitable mapping of the CVRPwTJ onto a tree-like problem representation required by the UCT. Furthermore, in order to prevent the size of the tree from explosive growth, an efficient mechanism for child nodes selection is proposed. UCT-based approach is compared with four other methods showing promising results and offering prospects for its wider applicability in the domain of stochastic optimization problems.	action selection;ant colony;automated planning and scheduling;benchmark (computing);dynamic web page;evaluation function;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;markov chain;mathematical optimization;mesh parameterization;monte carlo method;monte carlo tree search;non-deterministic turing machine;partially observable markov decision process;randomness;repeatability;requirement;scheduling (computing);search algorithm;simulation;stochastic optimization;tabu search;tree (data structure);tree traversal;vehicle routing problem	Jacek Mandziuk;Maciej Swiechowski	2017	Inf.

These potential benefits have resulted in an increased demand for urban agriculture (UA), though quantitative data is lacking on the feasibility of conversion to large-scale practices. This study uses multiple land use scenarios to determine different spaces that could be allocated to vegetable production in Montréal, including residential gardens, industrial rooftops and vacant space. Considering a range of both soil-bound and hydroponic yields, the ability of these scenarios to render Montréal self-sufficient in terms of vegetable production is assessed. The results show that the island could easily satisfy its vegetable demand if hydroponics are implemented on industrial rooftops, though these operations are generally costly. Using only vacant space, however, also has the potential to meet the city’s demand and requires lower operating costs. A performance index was developed to evaluate the potential of each borough to meet its own vegetable demand while still maintaining an elevated population density. Most boroughs outside of the OPEN ACCESS ISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2014, 3 1102 downtown core are able to satisfy their vegetable demand efficiently due to their land use composition, though results vary greatly depending on the farming methods used, indicating the importance of farm management.	industrial pc;interaction;social inequality;stepping level;urban computing;user agent	Daniel Haberman;Laura Gillies;Aryeh Canter;Valentine Rinner;Laetitia Pancrazi;Federico Martellozzo	2014	ISPRS Int.

Recently, there has been growing interest in using portfolios of solvers for this problem. In this paper we present a casebased reasoning approach to SAT solving. A key challenge is the adaptation phase, which we focus on in some depth. We present a variety of adaptation approaches, some heuristic, and one that computes an optimal Kemeny ranking over solvers in our portfolio. Our evaluation over three large case bases of problem instances from artificial, hand-crafted and industrial domains, shows the power of a CBR approach, and the importance of the adaptation schemes used.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;boolean satisfiability problem;case-based reasoning;constraint satisfaction problem;heuristic;industrial pc;np-completeness;run time (program lifecycle phase);scheduling (computing);solver;upwind scheme	Barry Hurley;Barry O'Sullivan	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-32986-9_13	mathematical optimization;algorithm	AI	21.35158194894921	4.004105930886474	121878
5ff2e8a8a8d417b24bf7b81c93a533dd5cc9211f	a simulated annealing algorithm for the capacitated vehicle routing problem with two-dimensional loading constraints		This paper studies the well-known capacitated vehicle routing problem with two-dimensional loading constraints (2L-CVRP). It requires designing a set of min-cost routes, starting and terminating at the central depot, to satisfy customer demands which involve a set of two-dimensional, rectangular, weighted items. A simulated annealing algorithm with a mechanism of repeatedly cooling and rising the temperature is proposed to solve the four versions of this problem, with or without the LIFO constraint, and allowing rotation of goods or not. An open space based heuristic is employed to identify the feasible loading patterns. In addition, the data structure Trie is used to accelerate the procedure by keeping track of the packing feasibility information of routes examined, and also by controlling the effort spent on different routes. The proposed algorithm is tested on the widely used instances of 2L-CVRP. The results show that our approach outperforms all existing algorithms on the four problem versions, and reaches or improves the best-known solutions for most instances. Furthermore, we compared the impact of different loading constraints, and observed some interesting results.	abstract rewriting system;algorithm;computation;computer cooling;data structure;experiment;heuristic;maxima and minima;numerical method;pattern matching;set packing;simulated annealing;time complexity;trie;two-phase locking;vehicle routing problem;whole earth 'lectronic link	Lijun Wei;Zhenzhen Zhang;Defu Zhang;Stephen C.

783864b7f7f43dbed0977fb18139dab10e5e1d82	a hybrid discrete particle swarm optimization for vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery	vehicle routing problem;particle swarm optimization;simultaneous pickup and delivery;variable neighborhood descent algorithm	Vehicle routing problem (VRP) is an important and well-known combinatorial optimization problem encountered in many transport logistics and distribution systems. The VRP has several variants depending on tasks performed and on some restrictions, such as time windows, multiple vehicles, backhauls, simultaneous delivery and pick-up, etc. In this paper, we consider vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery (VRPSPD). The VRPSPD deals with optimally integrating goods distribution and collection when there are no precedence restrictions on the order in which the operations must be performed. Since the VRPSPD is an NP-hard problem, we present a heuristic solution approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) in which a local search is performed by variable neighborhood descent algorithm (VND). Moreover, it implements an annealing-like strategy to preserve the swarm diversity. The effectiveness of the proposed PSO is investigated by an experiment conducted on benchmark problem instances available in the literature. The computational results indicate that the proposed algorithm competes with the heuristic approaches in the literature and improves several best known solutions.	mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;vehicle routing problem	Fatma Pinar Goksal;Ismail Karaoglan;Fulya Altiparmak	2013	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2012.01.005	mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;simulation;computer science;engineering;operations management;vehicle routing problem;mathematics;particle swarm optimization	Robotics	16.775341047366336	1.3859419339531909	122720

This problem contains two sub problem, such as two-dimensional packaging problem and minimization of the tool head way, which belong to the class of NP-hard and complex problems. The formulation and restrictions of the C&P problem are considered in the paper. Authors offer a hybrid approach with the use of a multilevel evolution, which partially allows avoiding a preliminary convergence of algorithms. For packaging and minimization of tool head way there are developed modified genetic algorithms (MGA), which can obtain sets of quasi-optimal solutions in polynomial time. To carry out computational experiments on test examples (benchmarks) authors created software on the basis of hybrid approach for the C&P problem. Conducted tests and experiments allow clarifying theoretical estimations of the algorithm time complexity. In the best case the time complexity of developed algorithms are represented as O (n2), in the worst case — O (n3).	best, worst and average case;computation;experiment;genetic algorithm;hercules graphics card;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;polynomial;time complexity	Anton Orlov;Vladimir V.

It is a framework for setting the proof and disproof number of a leaf node with a heuristic evaluation function. Experiments in LOA and Surakarta show that compared to PN and PN, which use mobility to initialize the proof and disproof numbers, EF-PN and EF-PN take between 45% to 85% less time for solving positions. Based on these results, we may conclude that EF-PN and EF-PN reduce the search space considerably.	analysis of algorithms;entity framework;evaluation function;experiment;heuristic evaluation;library oriented architecture;proof-number search;test set;tree (data structure)	Mark H.

Sports scheduling is a hard combinatorial optimization problem whose solution requires modeling many different aspects of sports, some of which are unique to each sport or nation. The capability of producing a high-quality schedule is important for both balancing undesirable matches among teams and ensuring adequate coverage by television and other media. Through strong interaction with the Italian Volleyball League, we modeled and solved the problem to optimality using standard mathematical programming solvers. We also tested our solution using previous seasons’ tournaments to prove the capability of our model.	schedule (project management)	Guido Cocchi;Alessandro Galligari;Federica Picca Nicolino;Veronica Piccialli;Fabio Schoen;Marco Sciandrone	2018	Interfaces	10.1287/inte.2017.0932	management science;tournament;operations management;engineering;scheduling (computing);combinatorial optimization;integer programming	HCI	14.25875062447187	2.5799106275697845	123161

The proposed algorithm is used for creating feasible and efficient nurse rosters for many different nurse rostering cases. In order to demonstrate the efficiency and generic applicability of the proposed approach, experiments with real-world input data coming from many different nurse rostering cases have been conducted. The nurse rostering instances used have significant differences in nature, structure, philosophy and the type of hard and soft constraints. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than six different existing approaches applied to the same nurse rostering input instances using the same evaluation criteria. In addition, in all cases, it manages to reach the best-known fitness achieved in the literature, and in one case, it manages to beat the best-known fitness achieved till now.	computation;experiment;nurse scheduling problem;scheduling (computing);search algorithm;two-phase commit protocol;variable neighborhood search	Ioannis P.

b9325109b14993dedbcf47ce54f74a46fedda983	efficient elementary and restricted non-elementary route pricing	routing problems;non elementary routes;elementary routes;column generation	Column generation is involved in the current most efficient approaches to routing problems. Set partitioning formulations model routing problems by considering all possible routes and selecting a subset that visits all customers. These formulations often produce tight lower bounds and require column generation for their pricing step. The bounds in the resulting branch-and-price are tighter when elementary routes are considered, but this approach leads to a more difficult pricing problem. Balancing the pricing with route relaxations has become crucial for the efficiency of the branch-and-price for routing problems. Recently, the ng-routes relaxation was proposed as a compromise between elementary and non-elementary routes. The ng-routes are non-elementary routes with the restriction that when following a customer, the route is not allowed to visit another customer that was visited before if they belong to a dynamically computed set. The larger the size of these sets, the closer the ng-route is to an elementary route. This work presents an efficient pricing algorithm for ng-routes and extends this algorithm for elementary routes. Therefore, we address the Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraint (SPPRC) and the Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraint (ESPPRC). The proposed algorithm combines the Decremental State-Space Relaxation technique (DSSR) with completion bounds. We apply this algorithm for the Generalized Vehicle Routing Problem (GVRP) and for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), demonstrating that it is able to price elementary routes for instances up to 200 customers, a result that doubles the size of the ESPPRC instances solved to date.	elementary	Rafael Martinelli;Diego Pecin;Marcus Poggi de Aragão	2014	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2014.05.005	column generation;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;static routing;operations management;mathematics;administrative distance	Theory	16.025575862850317	3.1565589360464954	123234

Although different mechanical and energetic optimum criteria have been proposed in the last decades by assuming involved parameters as deterministically known, nowadays the need persists to explore more realistic approaches for virtue of the unavoidable presence of uncertain variables. In fact, deterministic-based optimum criteria often lead to incorrect design, evidently because it is an excessive oversimplification and heavily in conflict with practical circumstances. Consequently, searching for robustness-based criteria in the optimal design for this class of mechanical devices is a crucial question. In order to define a collection of solutions able to ensure an acceptable trade-off between mechanical performances and immunity against the variability of the involved parameters, robust-based design optimization is an important and alternative way for supporting design process. Typically, methods proposed until now are based on the probabilistic description of the uncertain variables and only few approaches consider uncertainties in both system and loads. In this paper, robustbased design optimization problems for tuned mass dampers are formulated and resolved in view of fuzzy environments. The antithetical objective functions of the problems are defined within the framework of the credibility theory: the first one is the fuzzy expected value of the adopted performance-based structural index, the second one is its fuzzy variance. Specifically, this latter is introduced to characterize the performance variability due to the existence of uncertain variables. In our analysis, protected systems are assumed subject to random vibrations, in the aim to extend the applicability of the proposed methodology to different and general (natural or artificial) dynamic loads. Both models for structural systems and dynamic loads include fuzzy variables, in order to take into account also epistemic uncertainties. Finally, several numerical applications are presented to investigate the practical utility of the obtained results. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Migrating birds optimization (MBO) algorithm is a new meta-heuristic inspired by the V flight formation of the migrating birds which is proven to be an effective energy saving formation. This paper proposes an enhanced migrating birds optimization (EMBO) algorithm for no-wait flow shop scheduling with total flow time criterion. Because MBO is a neighborhood-based search heuristic, the population is divided into multiple migrating birds in proposed EMBO in an attempt to avoid local optima. Three heuristics are used for initializing the population. An effective neighborhood structure is used for each loop of EMBO. Extensive computational experiments are carried out based on a set of well-known flow shop benchmark instances that are considered as no-wait flow shop instances. Computational results and comparisons show that the proposed EMBO algorithm performs significantly better than the existing ones for no-wait flow shop scheduling problem with total flow time criterion.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);computation;experiment;flow shop scheduling;foreach loop;heuristic (computer science);local optimum;mathematical optimization;population;scheduling (computing)	Kai-Zhou Gao;Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam Suganthan;Tay Jin Chua	2013	2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Scheduling (CISched)	10.1109/SCIS.2013.6613246	job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;simulation;flow shop scheduling;computer science	AI	21.20265977828883	-0.19668732594462193	123527

In addition, there are many parties (shipping lines, haulage companies, customers) who share this operation as well as many restrictions that increase the complexity of this problem and make it NP-hard. Therefore, it is important to create an efficient strategy to manage this process in a way to ensure all parties are satisfied. This paper investigates the pairing of containers/orders in drayage transportation from the perspective of delivering paired containers on 40-ft truck and/or individual containers on 20-ft truck, between a single port and a list of customer locations. An assignment mixed integer linear programming model is formulated, which solves the problem of how to combine orders in delivery to save the total transportation cost when orders with both single and multiple destinations exist. In opposition to the traditional models relying on the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickups and deliveries and time windows formulation, this model falls into the assignment problem category which is more efficient to solve on large size instances. Another merit for the proposed model is that it can be implemented on different variants of the container drayage problem: import only, import–inland and import–inland–export. Results show that in all cases the pairing of containers yields less cost compared to the individual delivery and decreases empty tours. The proposed model can be solved to optimality efficiently (within half hour) for over 300 orders.

Due to the distributed and constrained workplace resource, process fragmentation needs take the execution environment into consideration. In addition, the balanced granularity of the fragmentation also need to be taken into account so as to cater for the applications in which each migrating instance is generated with a balanced executing ability. This paper proposes a two-phase approach to the process partitioning. First, we abstract the process resource allocation as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem and present a particle swarm optimization algorithm for the solution of the problem. And then, based on the mapping relationship between the tasks and the available resources, we propose a task clustering algorithm to generate the set of sub-processes with balanced granularity. Simulation experiment results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the fragmentation approach.	algorithm;cluster analysis;combinatorial optimization;fork (software development);fragmentation (computing);mathematical optimization;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;simulation;two-phase commit protocol	Jie Cheng;Guangzhou Zeng	2010	2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)	10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645175	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;fragmentation	EDA	20.396733494293517	-0.3783794705644824	123874

The method is based on the parametric expression model of SIS, which is a fully-associative model driven by dimensions. Based on the parameters of SIS, the computing system of hold capacity is developed to calculate the floating status and stability automatically. Furthermore, a parametric SIS optimization model is created, including optimization objective, constraints, optimization model solving etc., in which the maximized hold capacity and minimized ballast capacity are optimization objectives, the requirements and rules for SIS design are used as the constraints. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is improved to solve this optimization model. The proposed method is applied to a 50,000 DWT product oil tanker, and it is proved to be feasible, highly efficient, and engineering practical.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization	Guan Guan;Qu Yang;Wenwen Gu;Wenying Jiang;Yan Lin	2018	Advances in Engineering Software	10.1016/j.advengsoft.2018.06.012	computer science;mathematical optimization;algorithm;parametric statistics;ballast;particle swarm optimization	EDA	17.066087730256598	-3.771861706018104	123970

For the representation, the flexible bay structure (FBS), which is a very common layout in many manufacturing and retail facilities, is used. In this paper, the FBS is relaxed by allowing empty spaces within bays, which results in more flexibility in assigning departments into bays. In addition, departments are allowed to be located more freely within the bays, and they can have different side lengths as long as they are within the bay boundaries and do not overlap. To achieve these goals, department shapes and their locations within bays are determined by linear programming (LP). A PTS approach is developed to search an overall layout structure that describes relative positions of departments for the relaxed-FBS (RFBS). The proposed LP embedded PTS–RFBS approach is used to solve thirteen FLP instances from the literature with varying sizes.

424a636e5a5c2b61d024b2994fc83b0989970f16	distributionally robust single machine scheduling with risk aversion	single machine scheduling;distributionally robust optimization;total flow time;robustness and sensitivity analysis;cvar	This paper presents a distributionally robust (DR) optimization model for the single machine scheduling problem (SMSP) with random job processing time (JPT). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time a DR optimization approach is applied to production scheduling problems in the literature. Unlike traditional stochastic programming models, which require an exact distribution, the presented DR-SMSP model needs only the mean-covariance information of JPT. Its aim is to find an optimal job sequence by minimizing the worst-case Conditional Value-at-Risk (Robust CVaR) of the job sequence’s total flow time. We give an explicit expression of Robust CVaR, and decompose the DR-SMSP into an assignment problem and an integer second-order cone programming (I-SOCP) problem. To efficiently solve the I-SOCP problem with uncorrelated JPT, we propose three novel Cauchy-relaxation algorithms. The effectiveness and efficiency of these algorithms are evaluated by comparing them to a CPLEX solver, and robustness of the optimal job sequence is verified via comprehensive simulation experiments. In addition, the impact of confidence levels of CVaR on the tradeoff between optimality and robustness is investigated from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Our results convincingly show that the DR-SMSP model is able to enhance the robustness of the optimal job sequence and achieve risk reduction with a small sacrifice on the optimality of the mean value. Through the simulation experiments, we have also been able to identify the strength of each of the proposed algorithms.	risk aversion;scheduling (computing);single-machine scheduling	Zhiqi Chang;Shiji Song;Yuli Zhang;Jianya Ding;Rui Zhang;Raymond Chiong	2017	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2016.06.025	mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;operations management	ML	10.416712315619634	-0.24584483540110944	124186

Cross docking is a logistic concept in which product items are unloaded from inbound trucks into a warehouse and then are sorted out based on customer demands and loaded into outbound trucks. For a dock holding pattern for outbound trucks, two possible scenarios can be defined. In the first scenario, whenever a truck goes into a shipping dock, it does not leave the dock until all needed product items are loaded into outbound truck. In the second scenario, outbound trucks can enter and leave the dock repeatedly. Therefore, in the second scenario it is possible that an outbound truck loads some of its needed products from shipping dock, leaves the dock for another outbound truck, waits and goes into the shipping dock again to load all or part of its remaining product items. This paper proposes a genetic algorithm-based framework for scheduling inbound and outbound trucks in cross docking systems with temporary storage of product items at shipping dock for the second defined scenario such that minimizes total operation time. In order to show the merit of the proposed method in providing a sequence that minimizes the total operation time, the operation time of the proposed method is compared to a well-known existing model by several numerical examples. The numerical results show the high performance of the proposed algorithm.	docking (molecular);schedule (project management)	Ali Mohtashami	2015	Appl.

The problem consists of partitioning a given set of basic units into p districts so as minimize a measure of territory dispersion. Additional constraints include territory connectivity and balancing with respect to several criteria. To obtain feasible solutions to this NP-hard problem, a reactive greedy randomized adaptive search metaheuristic procedure is used. Previous work addressed medium-scale instances. In this paper, we report our computational experience when addressing larger instances ressembling more closely the size of real-world instances. The empirical work includes full assessment of the algorithmic parameters and its local search phase, and a sensitivity analysis of the balance tolerance parameter in terms of solution quality and feasibility. The empirical evidence shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and how this approach is significantly better than the method used by the industrial partner. The complexity of the planning constraints make the current practice method struggling on getting feasible designs. Even for the larger cases, the proposed procedure successfuly solved instances with balance tolerance parameter values of as low as 3%, something impossible to achieve by the company current standars.	coefficient;computation;grasp;greedy algorithm;greedy randomized adaptive search procedure;heuristic;local search (optimization);loss function;metaheuristic;optimization problem;paging;parameter (computer programming);programming model;randomized algorithm;requirement;stochastic modelling (insurance);stochastic programming;tabu search	Roger Z.

The problem is modelled as an extension to the set covering problem and considers the minimisation of the total procurement costs and the maximisation of the service-quality level of the execution of all transportation contracts tendered. To solve the problem, an exact branch–and–bound algorithm and eight variants of a multiobjective genetic algorithm are proposed. The algorithms are tested using a set of new benchmark instances which comply with important economic features of the transportation domain. For some smaller instances, the branch–and–bound algorithm finds all optimal solutions. Large instances are used to compare the relative performance of the eight genetic algorithms. The results indicate that the quality of a solution depends largely on the initialisation heuristic and suggest also that a well-balanced combination of different operators is crucial to obtain good solutions. The best of all eight genetic algorithms is also evaluated using the small instances with the results being compared to those of the exact branch–and–bound algorithm. keywords: bi-objective winner determination problem; multiobjective genetic algorithm; combinatorial auction University of Hagen, Faculity of Business Administration and Economics Department of Information Systems, Prof. Dr. H.

Solving a Bi-Objective Winner Determination Problem in a Transportation Procurement Auction Tobias Buer and Giselher Pankratz 1 Procurement of Transportation Contracts Shippers, like retailers as well as industrial enterprises often procure the transportation services they require via reverse auctions, where the objects under auction are transportation contracts. Usually, such contracts are designed as framework agreements lasting for a period of one to three years, and defining a pick-up location, a delivery location, and the type and volume of goods that are to be transported between both locations. Additionally, further details such as a contract-execution frequency, e.g. delivery twice a week, and the required quality of service, e.g. an on-time delivery quota, are specified in a transportation contract. A carrier can bid for one or more contracts. In each bid, the carrier states how much he wants to be paid for accepting the specified contracts. Transportation procurement auctions are of high economic relevance. Caplice and Sheffi [4] report on the size of real world transportation auctions in which they were involved over a period of five years. According to their report, in a single transportation auction up to 470 (median 100) carriers participated, up to 5,000 (median 800) lanes were tendered, and the annual cost of transportation amounted up to US-$ 700 million (median US-$ 75 million). Elmaghraby and Keskinocak [9] present a case study of a procurement auction event in which a do-it-yourself chain operating mainly in North America procured transportation services for about a quarter of the in-bound moves to their chain stores, which corresponds to a number of over 600 lanes. In the study at hand, the terms lane and transportation contract are used interchangeably. In the scenario presented here there are a number of interesting problems on the carrier’s as well as on the shipper’s side. This paper focuses on the allocation problem that has to be solved by the shipper after all bids are submitted. In particular, two characteristics of the given scenario are of interest. First, from a carrier’s point of view, there are complementarities between some of the contracts. That is, the costs for executing some contracts simultaneously are lower than the sum of the costs of executing each of these contracts in isolation. The cost effect of such complementarities is also referred to as economies of scope. Second, allocation of contracts to carriers has to be done taking into account multiple, often conflicting	auction algorithm;benchmark (computing);branch and bound;complementarity theory;covering problems;evolutionary algorithm;exact algorithm;fax;genetic algorithm;heuristic (computer science);information systems;microsoft outlook for mac;pareto efficiency;powera;procurement;quality of service;relevance;set cover problem;software release life cycle;whole earth 'lectronic link	Tobias Buer;Giselher Pankratz	2010	Logistics Research	10.1007/s12159-010-0031-8	mathematical optimization;computer science;operations management;mathematical economics;branch and bound	AI	15.396726631095605	2.3340278356620967	124619

Such linkage is defined by the way material and information flows are established. A control policy in manufacturing systems imposes a particular pattern of information flow on the factory. Similarly, a specific implementation of transportation policies defines a pattern of material flow between two uncoupled processes. This paper studies the condition of material flow in KSC. Furthermore, through simulation, proper flow of material with the aim of achieving Company's development plan as well as increasing the production capacity from 2.1 to 4.2 million tons per year has been provided. For this, the exchanges among different units and various modes for transporting material among these units have been studied. Considering the hourly distribution of materials and the share of railway and road network in the material flow, four scenarios have been proposed. In each scenario various solutions for improving the condition of material flow have been studied.	computer simulation;linkage (software);material flow;multimodal interaction;telephone exchange	Mohsen Fattahi Ardakani;Fatmeh Ranaiefar;Ruzbeh Mohagheghzadeh	2008	2008 Second Asia International Conference on Modelling &#x00026; Simulation (AMS)	10.1109/AMS.2008.103	engineering;operations management;transport engineering;material flow;manufacturing engineering	Robotics	11.577737091129864	0.33893611394253714	124791

Each single objective optimization problem is defined by a scalarizing function using a weight vector. In MOEA/D, there are several scalarizing approaches such as the weighted Tchebycheff, the weighted sum, and the PBI (penalty-based boundary intersection). However, these conventional scalarizing approaches face a difficulty to approximate a widely spread Pareto front in some problems. To enhance the spread of Pareto optimal solutions in the objective space and improve the search performance of MOEA/D especially in many-objective optimization problems, in this work we propose the inverted PBI scalarizing approach which is an extension of the conventional PBI. We use many-objective knapsack problems and WFG4 problems with 2-8 objectives, and compare the search performance of NSGA-III and four MOEA/Ds using the weighted Tchebycheff, the weighted sum, the PBI and the inverted PBI. As results, we show that MOEA/D using the inverted PBI achieves higher search performance than other algorithms in problems with many-objectives and the difficulty to obtain a widely spread Pareto front in the objective space.	approximation algorithm;knapsack problem;moea framework;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;weight function	Hiroyuki Sato	2014		10.1145/2576768.2598297	mathematical optimization;computer science;multi-objective optimization;machine learning;mathematics	AI	24.11704956092519	-3.3683788671488943	124874

These offer faster and more accurate ways to achieve good solutions. Ant colony optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are the most common metaheuristics. Based on the behaviour of collectives of ants, birds, fish and others, they offer algorithms which can be used to solve different NP-hard problems. Multi-agent systems (MAS) offer new perspectives on organisation of code into specific components as autonomic, decentralized or distributed agents. The Multi-agent Systems Engineering (MaSE) methodology allows the combination of both aforementioned approaches. This paper presents research based on the AgentSwarm application which evaluates the efficiency of applying MaSE methodology to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP) using ACO and PSO metaheuristics. Initial results have shown that MaSE is a comprehensive methodology, solid and reliable in building and developing swarm-based multi-agent systems.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;artificial intelligence;autonomic computing;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;multi-agent system;np-hardness;particle swarm optimization;swarm intelligence;systems engineering;travelling salesman problem	Dariusz Król;Maciej Drozdzowski	2010	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-2010-0453	mathematical optimization;ant colony optimization algorithms;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;multi-agent system	AI	20.209196841057505	-1.227316631221405	125146
78ba369168b8197b31d219f62d7e488795e37e55	on optimality criteria in identification problems	optimality criteria	The identification problem is largely formulated as a problem of finding a plant operator estimate optimal in terms of a specified criterion. The resultant solution permits estimation of the model adequacy. The criterion and the model structure are selected individually for each model. For complex systems the large number of plant parameter interrelations and of external disturbances make a completely adequate model non-feasible or undesirable. True, a more accurate model and a better system description is supposed to give a better forecast and control of the system but studying each input and its responses takes more time, funds and material resources. Hence it is clear that identification of large systems requires quantitative assessment of the effect of each system input on its output variable and of the accuracy with which a model where these inputs are integrated simulates the actual processes; a decision should be made, which system variables should be represented in the model. Identification is also impossible without systems approach, studying the hierarchical structure and knowledge of the entire system functioning. We will describe optimal selection of plant information indices with the techno-economic criterion. The results related to the model performance act as constraints.	complex systems;constraint (mathematics);resultant;type system	I. S. Durgarian;N. S.

While in the CPP the cost of traversing an edge is a constant (equal to its length), in the variant we present here the cost of traversing an edge depends on its length and on the weight of the vehicle at the moment it is traversed. This problem is inspired by the perspective of minimizing pollution in transportation, since the amount of pollution emitted by a vehicle not only depends on the travel distance, but also on its load, among other factors. We define the problem, study its computational complexity, provide two mathematical programming formulations and propose two metaheuristics for its solution. Extensive computational experiments reveal the extraordinary difficulty of this problem.

1f26d8e592a9edcefdb0ec6835d3e1197c1d82d9	a decomposition-based uncertainty quantification approach for environmental impacts of aviation technology and operation		As a measure to manage the climate impact of aviation, significant enhancements to aviation technologies and operations are necessary. When assessing these enhancements and their respective impacts on the climate, it is important that we also quantify the associated uncertainties—this is important to support an effective decision and policy making process. However, such quantification of uncertainty is challenging, especially in a complex system that comprises multiple interacting components. The uncertainty quantification task can quickly become computationally intractable and cumbersome for one individual or group to manage. Recognizing the challenge of quantifying uncertainty in multicomponent systems, we utilize a divide-and-conquer approach, inspired by the decomposition-based approaches used in multidisciplinary analysis and optimization. Specifically, we perform uncertainty analysis and global sensitivity analysis of our multicomponent aviation system in a decomposition-based manner. In this work we demonstrate how to handle a high-dimensional multicomponent interface using sensitivity-based dimension reduction and a novel importance sampling method. Our results demonstrate that the decomposition-based uncertainty quantification approach can effectively quantify the uncertainty of a feed-forward multicomponent system for which the component models are housed in different locations and owned by different groups.	complex system;computation;computational complexity theory;design tool;dimensionality reduction;feedback;importance sampling;institute for operations research and the management sciences;interaction;mathematical optimization;sampling (signal processing);system integration;uncertainty quantification	Sergio Amaral;Douglas L.

This paper addresses the problem of optimizing the routes and the speeds of ATs making deliveries under uncertain traffic conditions. The aim is to reduce the cost of emissions, fuel consumption and travel times. The traffic conditions are represented by a discrete set of scenarios, using which the problem is modeled in the form of two-stage stochastic programming formulations using two different recourse strategies. The strategies differ in the amount of information available during the decision making process. Computational results show the added value of stochastic modeling over a deterministic approach and the quantified benefits of optimizing speed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of the covering set location models is to select a set of facilities (public facilities, antennas, etc.) to be implemented in order to satisfy all or a part of the demand of a given area. A facility has a constant coverage radius R and a demand node is covered, if it is within distance R of an established facility. We introduce an original model, in which we take into account: (i) the costs incurred to establish a facility, (ii) the costs incurred if a demand node is not covered, (iii) the cost or gain incurred if a demand node is covered by more than one facility. We introduce some properties of an optimal solution and derive heuristic algorithms and a branch and bound method from these properties. We illustrate this approach with numerical examples.	algorithm;branch and bound;heuristic;integer programming;numerical analysis;numerical method;performance;procedural generation;simulated annealing	Lionel Dupont;Matthieu Lauras;Claude Yugma	2013		10.3182/20130619-3-RU-3018.00144	mathematical optimization;operations management;mathematics;welfare economics;1-center problem	AI	16.634911853295392	3.3633385776959344	125769

During the developmental phase, an advanced simulation approach, based on programming code and tables for information storage, was adopted. As a result the proposed modelling architecture ensures flexibility and high computational efficiency and allows comparison of the system's performances under different production planning scenarios obtained by applying dispatching rules, Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) algorithms. The suitability of the simulation outputs is ensured by the verification and validation activities carried out in the developmental phase; furthermore, specific subroutines allow the full integration of the simulation model with the company's ERP system.

First, a static DARP model is formulated as a mixed integer programming and in order to validate the model, several random small network problems are solved using commercial optimization package, CPLEX. Three heuristic algorithms based on sequential insertion, parallel insertion, and clustering first-routing second are proposed to solve static DARP within a reasonable time for implementation in a real-world situation. Also, the results of three heuristic methods are compared with the results obtained from exact solution by CPLEX to validate and evaluate three heuristic algorithms. Computational results show that three heuristic algorithms are superior compared to the exact algorithm in terms of the calculation time as the problem size (in terms of the number of demands) increases. Also among the three heuristic algorithms, the heuristic algorithm based on sequential insertion is more efficient than other heuristic algorithms that are based on parallel insertion and clustering first-routing second. For the case study, Maryland Transit Administration (MTA)’s real operation of Dial-a-ride service is introduced and compared with the results of developed heuristic. The objective function values from heuristic based on clustering firstrouting second are better than those from MTA’s operation for all cases when waiting cost, delay cost, and excess ride cost are not included in the objective function values. Also, the algorithm for real-time DARP considering dynamic events such as customer no shows, accidents, cancellations, and new requests is developed based on static DARP. The algorithm is tested in a simulation framework. In the simulation test, we compared the results of cases according to degree of gap between expected link speeds and real link speeds. Also for competitive analysis, the results of dynamic case are compared with the results of static case, where all requests are known in advance.

Simulation turns to be reference aid for developing and acknowledging the appropriate set-ups and the adaptive schedules. The paper, besides reference concepts, summarises a case example related to the management of the fabric warehouse, in order to grant adaptive sorting and dispatching of bolts, by on-process optimisation of the actually used cloth, with account of fabric quality-data and of time-varying schedules. The combined-mode schedules show the benefits for qick response, leaving open middle/long horizons issues; checks on alternatives are provided by virtual reality tests.		Gabriella M. Acaccia;A.

An analysis of the HEN resiliency is very useful to assess other design options and for the design of a robust control structure. The use of design reliability theory coupled with fuzzy design uncertainties can be used to determine the possibility of violating the HEN constraints. This measures the potential of the design failure rather than the frequency of failure, the latter being measured by probability theory.#R##N##R##N#The HEN constraints considered in this work are the target temperatures, hot/cold utility flow rate and heat transfer area/overall coefficient (UA). If the design under consideration results in a significant value of the failure possibility for any of these constraints, then this HEN design will require either a modification of the design or the establishment of a specific requirement in the control system. The case study treated in this paper shows that design reliability theory is a useful tool for determining HEN constraint violations that will require special attention from a control point of view, that is controllability analysis. Thus, this approach has proven to be a useful tool for determining design changes and for developing a workable control scheme for HEN designs.	reliability engineering	Rodolfo Tellez-Schmill;William Y.

This research addresses the scheduling problem of multimedia object requests, which is an important problem in information systems, in particular, for World Wide Web applications. The performance measure considered is the variance of response time which is crucial as end users expect fair treatment to their service requests. This problem is known to be NP-hard. The literature survey indicates that two heuristics have been proposed to solve the problem. In this paper, we present a new heuristic, a hybrid evolutionary heuristic, which is shown to perform much better than the two existing ones, e.g., the overall average errors of the existing ones are 1.012 and 2.042 while the error of the proposed hybrid evolutionary heuristic is 0.154.	computation;evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);information system;loss function;merge algorithm;np-hardness;optimization problem;response time (technology);responsiveness;scheduling (computing);server (computing);web application;world wide web	Fawaz S.

The problem is to determine when and how much to order to the warehouse and retailers such that the total system-wide costs are minimized. We propose a new (combined transportation and shortest path based) integer programming reformulation for the problem in addition to the echelon stock and transportation based formulations in the literature. We analyze the strength of the LP relaxations of three formulations and show that the new formulation is stronger than others. We also show that the new and transportation based formulations are equivalent for the joint replenishment problem, where the warehouse is a crossdocking facility. We extend all formulations to the case with initial inventory at the warehouse and reveal the relation among their LP relaxations. We present our computational experiments with all formulations over a set of randomly generated test instances.

In general, RNA secondary and tertiary structures can be represented as a set of nested arcs and a set of crossing arcs, respectively. Since RNA functions are largely determined by molecular confirmation and therefore secondary and tertiary structures, the comparison between RNA secondary and tertiary structures has received much attention recently. In this paper, we propose the notion of edit distance to measure the similarity between two RNA secondary and tertiary structures, by incorporating various edit operations performed on both bases and arcs (i.e., base-pairs). Several algorithms are presented to compute the edit distance between two RNA sequences with various arc structures and under various score schemes, either exactly or approximately, with provably good performance. Preliminary experimental tests confirm that our definition of edit distance and the computation model are among the most reasonable ones ever studied in the literature.	arcs (computing);alignment;approximation algorithm;base;best, worst and average case;computation (action);edit distance;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;max;model of computation;nitroprusside;norm (social);rna;research in computational molecular biology;snp (complexity);warren abstract machine;algorithm;confirmation - responselevel;tertiary	Tao Jiang;Guohui Lin;Bin Ma;Kaizhong Zhang	2002	Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology	10.1089/10665270252935511	biology;nucleic acid structure;speech recognition;base pair;edit distance;computer science;bioinformatics;wagner–fischer algorithm;dynamic programming;mathematics;string-to-string correction problem;genetics;approximation algorithm;algorithm	Comp.	15.55748894725695	-8.760532506186305	126499

An innovative neighbourhood search heuristic is proposed for the ore selection problem. This iterative construction heuristic employs a stochastic demolition and reconstruction strategy. Computational experiments with this heuristic for two ore selection problem instances, one involving 2,500 blocks and the other involving 78,000 blocks, are given. These problem instances are made publicly available for use by future workers. Our computational experiments indicate that the proposed heuristic produces better quality solutions faster than a relay hybrid (constructive-simulated annealing) heuristic.	computation;constructive heuristic;decision problem;experiment;greedy algorithm;heuristic;heuristic (computer science);iterative method;relay;selection algorithm;simulated annealing;time complexity	A.

Also, in optimality conditions, it is shown that how the FLMOLP problem can be solved by employing the preceding computations if the degree of priority of the fuzzy objective functions is changed.

Most of the existing approaches are based on finding an approximate solution to the user equilibrium or to the system optimum, which can be computationally expensive. In this paper we use a genetic algorithm to compute an approximate solution (routes for the trips) that seeks to minimize the average travel time. To illustrate this approach, a non-trivial network is used, departing from binary route choice scenarios. Our result shows that the proposed approach is able to find low travel times, without the need of recomputing shortest paths iteratively.	agent-based model;analysis of algorithms;approximation algorithm;augmented assignment;genetic algorithm;iterative and incremental development;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;shortest path problem;software release life cycle	Ana L.

At the core of this research area, numerous diverse search-based techniques were developed in the past 6 years for optimally solving MAPF under the sum-of-costs objective function. In this paper we survey these techniques, while placing them into the wider context of the MAPF field of research.

The problem involves routing vessels, each belonging to a particular vessel class, between loading and discharging ports, each belonging to a particular region. Our algorithms iteratively solve a MIRP by zooming out and then zooming in on the problem. Specifically, in the “zoomed out” phase, we solve a first-stage master problem in which aggregate information about regions and vessel classes is used to route vessels between regions, while only implicitly considering inventory and capacity requirements, berth limits, and other side constraints. In the “zoomed in” phase, we solve a series of second-stage subproblems, one for each region, in which individual vessels are routed through each region and load and discharge quantities are determined. Computational experience shows that an integrated approach that combines these two algorithms is vastly superior to solving the problem directly with a commercial mixed-integer programming solver.	aggregate data;algorithm;computation;discharger;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;object composition;parallel computing;requirement;routing;solver	Dimitri J.

The hyper-heuristics vary for the choice of the underlying heuristics. The choice function hyper-heuristic uses a selection function while the random hyper-heuristic selects randomly the underlying heuristics. In this paper, we propose a new idea for hyper-heuristics by combining choice function and randomness strategies. The two strategies in the proposed approach are controlled by using a walk probability as done in stochastic local search. The proposed method is evaluated on various benchmark problems. The numerical results show that the SHH performs better in almost all cases and the comparison is done with the choice function hyper-heuristic, the random hyper-heuristic and the well-known Stochastic Local Search (SLS).	benchmark (computing);heuristic (computer science);hyper-heuristic;local search (optimization);numerical analysis;randomness;standard sea level;whole earth 'lectronic link	Dalila Boughaci;Mourad Lassouaoui	2014		10.1145/2668260.2668268	mathematical optimization;choice function;machine learning;randomness;statistics	AI	23.374636872494555	-2.0706736205973097	127365

In such type of software-based systems, optimal design is more important to improve the system performance. The perfect parameter design problems are complex because of non-linear relationships and interactions may occur among parameters. So, a proper approach is needed for a parameter optimal design. An integrated approach of neural network with genetic algorithms is proposed to address the optimal design of software-based automation system. This article outlines neural network methodology to predict the response of the software-based automation system for various process parameters values. Then, the genetic algorithm is used to predict the quantitative value of process parameter to improve the performance of the system. In this work, a cascading electro-pneumatic kit is taken as case analysis to analyse the performance of software-based system.	algorithm	R.

2838f6c4d36abfcb12a549db2329ea45a047ab48	special issue on cutting, packing and related problems		The purpose of this special issue is to encourage research on cutting, packing and related problems. During the last five decades this subject has received the attention of many academic researchers and industrial practitioners, including topics such as bin packing, knapsack problems, pallet and container loading, nesting, pattern sequencing, layout problems, multi-processor scheduling, and integrated problems as cutting and sequencing, lot sizing and cutting, routing and packing, among others. This issue features nine among the 32 submitted papers. Umetani et al. deal with the irregular strip packing problem and develop a guided local search algorithm for a core sub-problem to solve it: the overlap minimization problem. Bortfeldt and Winter propose a genetic algorithm to address guillotine and non-guillotine cases of the two-dimensional knapsack problem with rectangular pieces. Koch, Konig and Wascher present a case study of a special cutting process from the wood-processing industry: a decision support tool is developed, which incorporates a linear programming model, and experience from the application of this tool is reported. Christensen and Rousoe cope with the container loading problem with multi-drop constraints and present a heuristic to solve it based on a tree search framework: the algorithm is tested using data from a Danish company distributing construction products. Belov, Kartak and Scheithauer consider the feasibility problem in multi-dimensional orthogonal packing problem and examine one-dimensional relaxations and linear programming bounds for the problem. Kaluzny and Shaw propose a mixed integer programming formulation to solve a problem of determining the arrangement of items in a cargo hold that optimizes the load balance in aircrafts of the Canadian Forces. Egeblad presents a heuristic based on guided local search to the problem of placing irregular shapes in two or three dimensions within a container, such that the placement of the shapes is optimized for balance and inertia moment. Yi, Chen and Zhou introduce the pinwheel pattern as an alternative solution to the manufacturer’s pallet loading problem, in which a single pallet has to be loaded with a maximum number of identical boxes. Finally, Vasko and Bartkowski present in a short communication an iterative approach that judiciously uses Wang’s algorithm to obtain optimal cutting patterns for two-dimensional guillotine cutting stock problems in reasonable computer runtimes. We are indebted to 71 competent reviewers for their time and effort. Without their help this edition on cutting, packing, and related problems would not have been possible. We also wish to express our deepest appreciation to the authors of all 32 papers submitted. Special thanks for the support of Celso C.

e73f7db68d0799655c45d76433e3826fb033d71c	learning to describe collective search behavior of evolutionary algorithms in solution space		Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are a kind of population-based meta-heuristic optimization methods, which have proven to have superiorities in solving NP-complete and NP-hard optimization problems. But until now, there is lacking in the researches of effective representation method to describe the collective search behavior of the Evolutionary Algorithm, while it is useful for researchers and engineers to understand and compare different EAs better. In the past, most of the theoretical researches cannot directly guide for practical applications. To bridge the gap between theoretical research and practice, we present a generic and reusable framework for learning features to describe collective behavior of EAs in this paper. Firstly, we represent the collective behavior of EAs with a parent-child difference of population distribution encoded by self-organizing map (SOM). Then, we train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn problem-invariant features from the samples of EAs’ collective behavior. Lastly, experiment results demonstrate that our framework can effectively learn discriminative features representing collective behavior of EAs. In the behavioral feature space stretched by the obtained features, the collective behavior samples of various EAs on various testing problems exhibit obvious aggregations that highly correlated with EAs but very weakly related to testing problems. We believe that the learned features are meaningful in analyzing EAs, i.e. it can be used to measure the similarity of EAs according to their inner behavior in solution space, and further guide in selecting an appropriate combination of sub-algorithm of a hybrid algorithm according to the diversity of candidate sub-algorithm instead of blind.	evolutionary algorithm;feasible region	Lei Liu;Chengshan Pang;Weiming Liu;Bin Li	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-68759-9_17	machine learning;combinatorial search;mathematical optimization;collective behavior;hybrid algorithm;self-organizing map;feature vector;evolutionary algorithm;feature learning;computer science;population;artificial intelligence	AI	22.746016023081285	-7.078759195617439	127493
c035716aa0c1927b68b9e396b1f47403d22c37ee	event-driven production rescheduling in job shop environments		Unpredictable incoming orders and the required nesting process highly complicate production planning and scheduling in sheet metal job shop environments and cause extremely high lead times as well as intermediate stocks. For this, numerous advanced planning and scheduling (APS) algorithms exist, aiming at creating a globally optimized production schedule. Due to the complexity of the multi-objective optimization and the large amount of unforeseen shop-floor events, effective and applicable solutions have not been presented so far. This work introduces an event-driven rescheduling concept based on lean principles leading to a high responsiveness of the production process to any kind of deviation. The achieved, significantly smaller buffer occupancies enable shorter lead times and improved delivery time estimations. Excellent performance results of the rescheduling concept are shown in different simulation experiments. The presented concept can easily be implemented in any kind of sheet metal job shop and its respective IT infrastructure.

In previous papers, we proposed parallel algorithms to solve the PFSP based on load balancing Branch and Bound approach. In this work, we propose other alternatives based on Genetic Algorithms to solve this problem. However, using efficiently genetic algorithm (GA) involves a complex interaction among its parameters. Therefore, finding good solutions for NP-hard problems (PFSP) cannot be guaranteed without proper setting of genetic parameters (selection, crossover, mutation, etc...). In this context, a parametric study is presented to select the best setting of GA parameters to solve the PSFP. Our study is completed with an extensive computational experiment, and the results are compared with known works in the literature. The results indicate that the proposed settings of the GA are efficient in finding better quality solutions.	algorithmic efficiency;branch and bound;computation;crossover (genetic algorithm);display resolution;experiment;flow shop scheduling;genetic algorithm;load balancing (computing);mutation (genetic algorithm);np-hardness;parallel algorithm;selection (genetic algorithm)	Samia Kouki;Manel Guenaoui;Mohamed Jemni	2016	2016 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)	10.1109/ISNCC.2016.7746115	quality control and genetic algorithms;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;flow shop scheduling;genetic operator;mathematics;algorithm	AI	23.070131054192224	0.30070491205130845	128244

Aimed at agricultural by-products logistics delivery route planning problem, traditional genetic algorithm was modified by using operator dynamic adjustment methods. The modified Genetic Algorithm (GA) selected different crossover operators, mutation operators and selection pressure with generation growth, which avoided the local optima problem of traditional GA when the chromosome length was long.

43b293f5e4b03045682a13fefb7feeb49df77fff	a new approach for solving bi-objective redundancy allocation problem using doe, simulation and ε-constraint method		The redundancy allocation problem (RAP) has been studied for many different system structures, objective functions, and distribution assumptions. In this paper, we present a problem formulation and a solution methodology to maximize the system steady-state availability and minimize the system cost for the repairable series-parallel system designs. In the proposed approach, the components’ time-to-failure (TTF) and time-to-repair (TTR) can follow any distribution such as the Gamma, Normal, Weibull, etc. We estimate an approximation of the steady-state availability of each subsystem in the series-parallel system with an individual meta-model. Design of experiment (DOE), simulation and the stepwise regression are used to build these meta-models. Face centred design, which is a type of central composite design is used to design experiments. According to a max–min approach, obtained meta-models are utilized for modelling the problem alongside the cost function of the system. We use the augmented ε-constraint method to reformulate the problem and solve the model. An illustrative example which uses the Gamma distribution for TTF and TTR is explained to represent the performance of the proposed approach. The results of the example show that the proposed approach has a good performance to obtain Pareto (near-Pareto) optimal solutions (system configurations).	approximation;augmented lagrangian method;central composite design;computer performance;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;loss function;maxima and minima;metamodeling;pareto efficiency;rapid refresh;series-parallel graph;simulation;steady state;stepwise regression;test template framework	Mehdi Keshavarz Ghorabaee;Maghsoud Amiri;Zenonas Turskis	2017	Informatica, Lith.

We showed that for a landscape of a small size, information landscape theory can be used to predict the performance of a GA without running the algorithm. Based on this framework, here we develop a new theoretical model to study search algorithms in general.

While standard modeling approaches embody single objectives, real-world decision problems often seek multiple performance measures. Decision-makers here desire solutions that simultaneously optimize on multiple objectives, or obtain an acceptable tradeoff amongst objectives. Multi-criteria problems often characterize a range of solutions, none of which dominate the others with respect to the multiple objectives these specify the Pareto-frontier of nondominated solutions, each offering a different level of tradeoff. This paper proposes the use of evolutionary computation based procedures for obtaining a set of nondominated models with respect to multiple stated objectives. The targeting depth-of-file presents a crucial real-world criterion in direct marketing, and models here are tailored for specified file-depths. Decision-makers are thus able to obtain a set of models along the Pareto-frontier, for a specific file-depth. The choice of a model to implement can be thus based on observed tradeoffs in the different objectives, based on possibly subjective and problem specific judgements. Given distinct models tailored for different file-depths, the implementation decision can also consider performance tradeoffs at the different depths-offile. Empirical results from a real-world problem illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach. Both linear and nonlinear models obtained by genetic search are examined.	data mining;decision problem;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary computation;nonlinear system;pareto efficiency;performance prediction;predictive modelling	Siddhartha Bhattacharyya	2000		10.1145/347090.347186	standard model;decision-making;mathematical optimization;computer science;machine learning;decision problem;direct marketing;data mining;management science;predictive modelling;statistics;evolutionary computation	AI	20.63508354565559	-5.806512255873968	128453

Evolutionary algorithms, a class of algorithms that borrow paradigms from nature, are particularly well suited to address such problems. These algorithms are stochastic methods of optimization that have become immensely popular recently, because they are derivative-free methods, are not as prone to getting trapped in local minima (as they are population based), and are shown to work well for many complex optimization problems. Although evolutionary algorithms have conventionally focussed on optimizing single objective functions, most practical problems in engineering are inherently multi-objective in nature. Multi-objective evolutionary optimization is a relatively new, and rapidly expanding area of research in evolutionary computation that looks at ways to address these problems. In this chapter, we provide an overview of some of the most significant issues in multi-objective optimization (Deb, 2001).	dynamic energy budget;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary computation;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;multi-objective optimization	Sanjoy Das;Bijaya Ketan Panigrahi	2009		10.4018/978-1-59904-849-9.ch167	evolutionary programming;genetic algorithm;interactive evolutionary computation;human-based evolutionary computation;cultural algorithm;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary acquisition of neural topologies;fitness approximation;evolutionary computation	AI	22.7037998619539	-5.168750183267188	128477

However, no existing program can compose adequate chess problems. In this paper, we present a model that is capable of improving the quality of some of the existing chess problems. We have formalized a major part of the knowledge needed for evaluating the quality of chess problems. In the model, we attempt to improve a given problem by a series of meaningful chess transformations, using a hill-climbing search, while satisfying several criteria at each step. This model has been implemented in a working system called ICP Improver of Chess Problems. The results of the experiment we carried out show that the majority of the problems examined were optimal. However, the software has improved almost one third of the tested problems; most of them needing only slight changes.

In ELD problems the cost function for each generator has been approximated by a single quadratic cost equation. As cost of coal increases, it becomes even more important have a good model for the production cost of each generator for the solar thermal hybrid system. A more accurate formulation is obtained for the ELD problem by expressing the generation cost function as a piece wise quadratic cost function. However, the solution methods for ELD problem with piece wise quadratic cost function requires much complicated algorithms such as the hierarchical structure approach along with evolutionary computations (ECs). A test system comprising of 10 units with 29 different fuel [7] cost equations is considered in this paper.

In cases where the size and color of cable are changed, the cable industry is classified as a multiproduct, mass production system. Two different mathematical programming models based on continuous time representation are proposed for a case study on the scheduling problem of the cable industry to minimize the total cost including setup cost, operating cost, and inventory holding cost. As the solution methodology, different grouping policies, for example, grouping cables of the same size and grouping cables of the same color are proposed. Then different metaheuristic methods based on simulated annealing and variable neighborhood search algorithms are applied to minimize the total cost of proposed solutions. Finally, the solution with the smallest total cost is selected as the production schedule of the case study, while Xpress solver could not provide any feasible solution for the mathematical models in the problem size of case study.	analysis of algorithms;central processing unit;computation;computational complexity theory;date and time representation by country;experiment;international federation of operational research societies;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;production system (computer science);scheduling (computing);search algorithm;simulated annealing;solver;variable neighborhood search;xpress	Sadegh Niroomand;Béla Vizvári	2015	ITOR	10.1111/itor.12096	mathematical optimization;simulation;simulated annealing;computer science;operations management;mathematics;scheduling	AI	15.280635429866946	2.735643536596396	128620
1ec9615d64f513ec1a0bc77fa6c911ba6c4e5c87	design of optimal phase plans for isolated intersections using vertex coloring and binary integer linear programming		In this paper, a novel optimization technique is proposed to minimize the total number of phases in a traffic signal cycle at isolated intersections for safer and efficient traffic signal allocation. Each phase consists of traffic movements with no conflicts and includes all pedestrian crosswalks once in the signal cycle. The traffic movements and associated conflicting relations are converted to an incompatibility graph. Two vertices in the graph are assigned the same color if they are not connected by an edge. A vertex coloring algorithm has been employed to find the minimum number of colors that can identify and group the nonconflicting vertices. We formulate it as a Linear programming problem with appropriate constraints to obtain the minimum possible colors. The color class sets obtained constitutes the optimal phases which ensure safety at an isolated intersection.		T. A. Ambili;Sharmila Devi Kumaravel;M. S.

051946854ab2786fe5d7c1ce8f8178bb29fcf082	evaluating the efficiency of robust team formation algorithms		Selecting a minimal-cost team from a set of agents, with associated costs, to complete a given set of tasks is a common and important multiagent systems problem. Often, some degree of fault-tolerance in such teams is also required which enables the team to continue to complete all tasks even if a subset of the agents are incapacitated. A k-robust team is one that is capable of completing all assigned tasks when any k team members are not available. The corresponding decision problem of selecting a k-robust team that costs no more than a desired cost threshold has been shown to be NP-Complete. We present and experimentally evaluate, for varying problem sizes and characteristics, heuristic and evolutionary approximation approaches to find optimal-cost k-robust teams which can be used for large problems. We present a Linear Programming approximation algorithm that is found to produce optimal results for small problem sizes, and prove that it is a 2 ln(n + k) + O(lnn)factor approximation. We also present three heuristic algorithms and an evolutionary computation approach which scales up to larger problems. Another advantage of the evolutionary scheme is that can approximate the Pareto-frontier of teams trading off robustness and cost.	agent-based model;approximation algorithm;decision problem;evolutionary computation;experiment;fault tolerance;genetic algorithm;greedy algorithm;heuristic;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;linear programming;linear programming relaxation;multi-agent system;multi-objective optimization;np-completeness;pareto efficiency;population;real life	Chad Crawford;Zenefa Rahaman;Sandip Sen	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-46882-2_2	mathematical optimization;simulation;machine learning	AI	21.24316689423723	3.330960494422158	128804

35fb846ec51a832043528323f4a08ad69eea391c	fast-forwarding agent states to accelerate microscopic traffic simulations		"""Traditionally, the model time in agent-based simulations is advanced in fixed time steps. However, a purely time-stepped execution is inefficient in situations where the states of individual agents are independent of other agents and thus easily predictable far into the simulated future. In this work, we propose a method to accelerate microscopic traffic simulations based on identifying independence among agent state updates. Instead of iteratively updating an agent's state throughout a sequence of time steps, a computationally inexpensive """"fast-forward"""" function advances the agent's state to the time of its earliest possible interaction with other agents. To demonstrate the approach in practice, we present an algorithm to efficiently determine intervals of independence in microscopic traffic simulations and derive a fast-forward function for the popular Intelligent Driver Model (IDM). In contrast to existing acceleration approaches based on reducing the level of model detail, our approach retains the microscopic nature of the simulation. A performance evaluation is performed in a synthetic scenario and on the road network of the city of Singapore. At low traffic densities, we achieved a speedup of up to 2.8, whereas at the highest considered densities, only few opportunities for fast-forwarding could be identified. The algorithm parameters can be tuned to control the overhead of the approach."""	agent-based model;algorithm;computation;computer simulation;correctness (computer science);fast forward;marginal model;microsoft outlook for mac;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;sparse matrix;speedup;synthetic intelligence;whole earth 'lectronic link	Philipp Andelfinger;Yadong Xu;Wentong Cai;David Eckhoff;Alois Knoll	2018		10.1145/3200921.3200923	acceleration;real-time computing;speedup;intelligent driver model;distributed computing;computer science;traffic simulation	AI	13.167767444193125	-8.45708687295174	128976

In this paper a central planner is responsible for planning routes and schedules for the entire team of cooperating robots. The potential computational complexity of such a centralized solution is addressed by an innovative genetic approach that transforms the task of multiple route design into a special manifestation of the traveling salesperson problem.

Due to the randomness of customer requests, the Virtual Machine Placement (VMP) should be formulated as an online optimization problem. This work presents a formulation of a VMP problem considering the optimization of the following objective functions: (1) power consumption, (2) economical revenue, (3) quality of service and (4) resource utilization. To analyze alternatives to solve the formulated problem, an experimental comparison of five different online deterministic heuristics against an offline memetic algorithm with migration of VMs was performed, considering several experimental workloads. Simulations indicate that First-Fit Decreasing algorithm (A4) outperforms other evaluated heuristics on average. Experimental results prove that an offline memetic algorithm improves the quality of the solutions with migrations of VMs at the expense of placement reconfigurations.	cloud computing;computer simulation;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;memetic algorithm;memetics;online and offline;online optimization;optimization problem;placement syntax;quality of service;randomness;virtual machine	Fabio López-Pires;Benjamín Barán;Augusto Amarilla;Leonardo Benítez;Rodrigo Ferreira;Saúl Zalimben	2016		10.1145/2998373.2998374	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;distributed computing	HPC	20.30073323370694	3.7938008286835907	129203

We develop a mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation for the problem in which the location for establishing the cross-docks is determined while simultaneously a fleet of vehicles are applied to transport goods from suppliers to the assembly plants via two transportation strategies: direct shipment and shipment through crossdock (indirect shipment). In the second strategy, it is possible to have routes between suppliers. Not considering two problems of location and distribution planning simultaneously would result in increasing the costs of supplying parts since the transportation strategy has a huge effect on location of cross-docks. In the other words, if some loads can be directly shipped, then this kind of loads should not be taken into account in determining cross-docks location. Thus, a locationrouting problem is presented for cross-docking system in this paper. The goal is to determine the location of cross-docks, allocating suppliers to them and routing decisions, so that the location cost and total shipping cost in the network are minimized, considering variable cost of servicing parts passed through cross-docks. The proposed model is NP-hard based on literature. Thus, a metaheuristic algorithm named Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is utilized to solve the problem. In order to evaluate its efficiency, BBO results are compared with those of PSO, which is a well-known algorithm in the literature. Solving numerical examples for small size problem instances illustrates that the solving approach performs with a negligible gap relative to GAMS, while it performs much better than PSO in most cases in terms of total cost of the network and computational time.	algorithm;black bag operation;central processing unit;computation;docking (molecular);ftl: faster than light;gams;heuristic;linear programming relaxation;loss function;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;np-hardness;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;regular expression;relaxation (approximation);semiconductor consolidation;time complexity;transportation theory (mathematics);vehicle routing problem	Asefeh Hasani Goodarzi;Seyed Hessameddin Zegordi	2016	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2016.10.023	mathematical optimization;engineering;operations management;operations research;1-center problem	AI	15.848741373986776	1.067618197794291	129228

189757e3939ecb1e7c148a84f62eef2615998710	a decomposition-based approach for the multiperiod multiproduct distribution planning problem		We address the most general case of multiperiod, multiproduct network planning problems, where we allow spoilage on arcs and storage at nodes. In our models, all network parameters change over time and products. The minimum-cost flow problem in the discrete-time model with varying network parameters is investigated when we allow storage and/or spoilage, and some reformulation techniques employing polyhedrals are developed to obtain optimal solutions for a predefined horizon. Our methods rely on appropriate definitions of polyhedrals and matrices that lead to LP problems comprising a set of sparse subproblems with special structures. Knowing that computational expenses of solving such a large-scale planning problem can be decreased by using decomposition techniques, the special structure of polyhedrals is utilized to develop algorithmic approaches based on decomposition techniques to handle the global problem aiming to save computational resources.

a2f93564ed53b3f4371049c5801ea1435825adb6	algorithm for clustering of web search results from a hyper-heuristic approach		The clustering of web search results or web document clustering (WDC) has become a very interesting research area among academic and scientific communities involved in information retrieval. Systems for the clustering of web search results, also called Web Clustering Engines, seek to increase the coverage of documents presented for the user to review, while reducing the time spent reviewing them. Several algorithms for clustering of web results already exist, but results show there is room for more to be done. This paper introduces a hyper-heuristic framework called WDC-HH, which allows the defining of the best algorithm for WDC. The hyper-heuristic framework uses four high-level-heuristics (performance-based rank selection, tabu selection, random selection and performance-based roulette wheel selection) for selecting lowlevel heuristics (used to solve the specific problem of WDC). As a low level heuristics the framework considers: harmony search, improved harmony search, novel global harmony search, global-best harmony search, eighteen genetic algorithm variations, particle swarm optimization, artificial bee colony, and differential evolution. The framework uses the k-means algorithm as a local solution improvement strategy and based on the Balanced Bayesian Information Criterion it is able to automatically define the appropriate number of clusters. The framework also uses four acceptance/replacement strategies (replacement heuristics): Replace the worst, Restricted Competition Replacement, Stochastic Replacement and Rank Replacement. WDC-HH was tested with four data sets using a total of 447 queries with their ideal solutions. As a main result of the framework assessment, a new algorithm based on global-best harmony search and rank replacement strategy obtained the best results in WDC problem. This new algorithm was called WDC-HH-BHRK and was also compared against other established WDC algorithms, among them: Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) and Lingo. Results show a considerable improvement -measured by recall, Fmeasure, fall-out, accuracy and SSLkover the other algorithms.	artificial bee colony algorithm;bayesian information criterion;cluster analysis;differential evolution;fitness proportionate selection;genetic algorithm;harmony search;heuristic (computer science);high- and low-level;hyper-heuristic;information retrieval;k-means clustering;lingo (programming language);mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;suffix tree clustering;tabu search;wdc 65c21;web page;web search engine	Carlos Alberto Cobos Lozada;Andrea Duque;Jamith Bolaños;Martha Mendoza;Elizabeth León Guzman	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-62428-0_24	machine learning;suffix tree clustering;correlation clustering;flame clustering;pattern recognition;cluster analysis;artificial intelligence;canopy clustering algorithm;computer science;algorithm;search algorithm;brown clustering;cure data clustering algorithm	Web+IR	24.236550529347213	-5.519119245729575	129414
c2af37201f3dbdabd9c8f1dc1958fcef501d419b	time requirements of optimization of a genetic algorithm for road traffic network division using a distributed genetic algorithm		This paper describes the optimization of a dividing genetic algorithm (DGA). It is used for division of road traffic networks into sub-networks of a distributed road traffic simulation. The optimization is performed by finding optimal settings of the DGA parameters using a distributed optimizing genetic algorithm (distributed OGA). Since the distributed OGA is expected to be extremely time-consuming, the paper is focused on a determination of the total time necessary for the OGA computation. It is determined, performing tests, that the OGA can be completed in range of days at least for lower numbers of OGA generations on a distributed computer consisting of nearly 100 processor cores.	genetic algorithm;program optimization;requirement	Tomas Potuzak	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-06883-1_13	simulation;meta-optimization;distributed computing;transport engineering	AI	17.455628983446374	0.6435598048348227	129501

The ACO is a metaheuristic inspired by the behavior of real ants, where they search for optimal solutions by considering both local heuristic and previous knowledge, observed by pheromone changes. Good results of the ant colony algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems suggest an appropriate effectiveness of the approach also in the task of constructing decision trees. In order to improve the accuracy of decision trees we propose an Ant Colony algorithm for constructing Decision Trees (ACDT). A heuristic function used in a new algorithm is based on the splitting rule of the CART algorithm (Classification and Regression Trees). The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a number of well-known benchmark data sets from the UCI Machine Learning repository. What deserves particular attention is the fact that empirical results clearly show that ACDT performs very good while comparing to other techniques.	ant colony optimization algorithms;decision tree;program optimization	Urszula Boryczka;Jan Kozak	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16693-8_39	mathematical optimization;ant colony optimization algorithms;parallel metaheuristic;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;metaheuristic	ML	23.968686427543958	-1.8475623222629147	129627

Every passenger on each of these flights needs to pass through Customs Border and Patrol (CBP) before entering the USA. These flight arrival times vary significantly on a daily basis, annual passenger levels are steadily increasing and, since September 11, 2001, there has been an increase in security measures. All of these factors have placed an increased workload on the CBP staff. There is mounting pressure on the LAX CBP management to minimize the passenger wait times, while simultaneously meeting annual staffing budgets. Jacobs Consultancy (JC) was asked to identify optimum CBP staffing levels and determine strategies for CBP to better accommodate their variable staffing needs based on the variability of flight arrival times. JC used CAST, a passenger simulation model developed by the Airport Research Center (ARC), to assist in the evaluation.	environmental consulting;heart rate variability;simulation	Gareth Coville	2007	2007 Winter Simulation Conference		transport;simulation;engineering;simulation modeling;transport engineering;operations research	EDA	11.2239803432605	-1.0999090458169958	129859
6e88c9f2ff86ff4244ee546f2ec85d517878e695	deep reinforcement learning for solving the vehicle routing problem		We present an end-to-end framework for solving Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using deep reinforcement learning. In this approach, we train a single model that finds near-optimal solutions for problem instances sampled from a given distribution, only by observing the reward signals and following feasibility rules. Our model represents a parameterized stochastic policy, and by applying a policy gradient algorithm to optimize its parameters, the trained model produces the solution as a sequence of consecutive actions in real time, without the need to re-train for every new problem instance. Our method is faster in both training and inference than a recent method that solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), with nearly identical solution quality. On the more general VRP, our approach outperforms classical heuristics on medium-sized instances in both solution quality and computation time (after training). Our proposed framework can be applied to variants of the VRP such as the stochastic VRP, and has the potential to be applied more generally to combinatorial optimization problems.	algorithm;combinatorial optimization;computation;end-to-end principle;gradient;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;reinforcement learning;time complexity;travelling salesman problem;vehicle routing problem	MohammadReza Nazari;Afshin Oroojlooy;Lawrence V.

An important decision problem in this context receiving a lot of attention from researchers and practitioners is the sequencing problem, which decides on the succession of workpieces launched down the line. However, if multiple departments with diverging sequencing objectives are to be passed or unforeseen disturbances like machine breakdowns or material shortages occur, a resequencing of a given production sequence often becomes equally essential. This paper reviews existing research on resequencing in a mixed-model assembly line context. Important problem settings, alternative buffer configurations, and resulting decision problems are described. Finally, future research needs are identified as some relevant real-world resequencing settings have not been dealt with in literature up to now.	mixed model	Nils Boysen;Armin Scholl;Nico Wopperer	2012	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2011.08.009	computer science;bioinformatics;operations management;decision problem;conceptual framework;operations research	Robotics	11.135479085028168	2.861880373600296	130600
d9432bf49d14e9217e0e3bc8c6f4b6cb5c78df1d	determining optimal link capacity expansions in road networks using cuckoo search algorithm with lévy flights		During the last two decades, Continuous Network Design Problem (CNDP) has received much more attention because of increasing trend of traffic congestion in road networks. In the CNDP, the problem is to find optimal link capacity expansions by minimizing the sum of total travel time and investment cost of capacity expansions in a road network. Considering both increasing traffic congestion and limited budgets of local authorities, the CNDP deserves to receive more attention in order to use available budget economically and to mitigate traffic congestion. The CNDP can generally be formulated as bilevel programming model in which the upper level deals with finding optimal link capacity expansions, whereas at the lower level, User Equilibrium (UE) link flows are determined by Wardrop&#x2019;s first principle. In this paper, cuckoo search (CS) algorithm with L&#xe9;vy flights is introduced for finding optimal link capacity expansions because of its recent successful applications in solving such complex problems. CS is applied to the 16-link and Sioux Falls networks and compared with available methods in the literature. Results show the potential of CS for finding optimal or near optimal link capacity expansions in a given road network.	cuckoo search;lévy flight;search algorithm	Ozgur Baskan	2013	J.

c4d0c0fba614cd3b497e1e260ae7ef217c2b11f7	towards autonomy: cost-effective scheduling for long-range autonomous valet parking (lavp)		Continuous and effective developments in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are happening on daily basis. Industries nowadays, are interested in introducing less costly and highly controllable AVs to public. Current so-called AVP solutions are still limited to a very short range (e.g., even only work at the entrance of car parks). This paper proposes a parking scheduling scheme for long-range AVP (LAVP) case, by considering mobility of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), fuel consumption and journey time. In LAVP, Car Parks (CPs) are used to accommodate increasing numbers of AVs, and placed outside city center, in order to avoid traffic congestions and ensure road safety in public places. Furthermore, with positioning of reference points to guide user-centric long-term driving and drop-off/pick-up passengers, simulation results under the Helsinki city scenario shows the benefits of LAVP. The advantage of LAVP system is also reflected through both analysis and simulation.	attribute–value pair;autonomous car;autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);inbound marketing;net neutrality;scheduling (computing);simulation	Muhammad Khalid;Yue Cao;Xu Zhang;Chong Han;Linyu Peng;Nauman Aslam;Naveed Ahmad	2018	2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377313	real-time computing;scheduling (computing);job shop scheduling;autonomy;computer science;fuel efficiency	Mobile	13.16654956806568	0.5338331496980371	130643

To develop more economical or even cost-free transportation of packages, in this paper, we propose to make use of the existing taxis on the street that are delivering passengers, in a crowd-sourced manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits taxis occupied by passengers to help deliver package collectively, without hurting the quality of taxi services. Specifically, we propose a two-phase framework for the package express shipping. In the first phase, we rank the road segments according to their influential factor values, which is similar to the idea of identifying key people in social networks. Hubs are then identified based on the ranking and the geographical locations of the road segments. In the second phase, we develop two inter-hub routing algorithms, namely, First-Come-First-Service (FCFS) and Destination-Closer (Des Closer), to ship a package to its destination. We evaluate the two-phase framework on a large-scale real-world taxi data set, generated by 7,600 taxis in a month. Results show that, on average, the package delivery time based on Des Closer is 5.3 hours, which is 2.6x shorter than that of FCFS, the number of participating taxis per package based on Des Closer is 3.10, which is 10.6x fewer than that of FCFS.	algorithm;crowdfunding;crowdsourcing;exptime;exploit (computer security);global positioning system;pervasive informatics;routing;social network;tracing (software);two-phase commit protocol;usb hub	Chao Chen;Daqing Zhang;Leye Wang;Xiaojuan Ma;Xiao Han;Edwin Hsing-Mean Sha	2014	2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Autonomic and Trusted Computing and 2014 IEEE 14th Intl Conf on Scalable Computing and Communications and Its Associated Workshops	10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom.2014.112	computer security	Mobile	11.474911159929336	-7.24922666083794	130787

Local treatment schedules, pertaining to homogeneous sub-areas called stands, must be developed over a time horizon of a few centuries. Thousands of local schedules must be coordinated to satisfy hard constraints, and balance soft constraints and optimization criteria. Constraints and objectives are defined in terms of economical, recreational, and environmental effect. The aim of the forest treatment schedule is twofold. Over the near time horizon, it must provide clear instructions for forest treatment. In addition, sustainability over the full horizon must be demonstrated. In this context, sustainability means balancing growth and yield in the long term, the preservation of bio-diversity, and catering for human recreational and cultural value. Conventional OR based approaches have failed to give satisfactory results for this type of problem. We describe a method built on explicit constraint descriptions and a memory-based local search procedure for solving rich models of the long-term forest treatment scheduling problem. We also describe a configurable decision support system, called Ecoplan, where the scheduling kernel is based on our method. The system relies heavily on close interaction with a stand simulator, which must provide forestry knowledge necessary to guide the scheduling process, including the definition of abstract forest treatment actions. Ecoplan also provides facilities for user interaction in the planning process, functionality for locking specific parts of a plan, and flexibility to alter key factors in the plan such as active constraints and objective criteria. In this way, the system supports the definition and exploration of “what-if” scenarios. The Ecoplan system has been built on the initiative of the major Norwegian forest owners, addressing a problem area that is becoming increasingly more complex to handle and more critical to society.

Several measures have been proposed to minimize inequity of a system. This paper considers an extension to the minimum p-envy location model by evaluating the objective of the model based on a survival function instead of on a distance function since survival probability is directly related to patient outcomes with a constraint on minimum survival rate. The model was tested on a real world data set from the EMS system at Hanover County, VA, and also compared to other location models. The results indicate that, not only does the enhanced p-envy model reduce inequity but we also find that more lives can be saved by using the survival function objective. A sensitivity analysis on different quality of service measures (survival probability and traveled distance) and different choices of priority assigned to serving facility is discussed. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this research we, thus, focus on two inter-related decisions regarding tower cranes, namely their selection and their on-site location. On a given polygonal construction site, there are given polygonal supply and demand areas that have to be connected by tower cranes with given specifications such as operating radius, operating height and costs. Cranes have to be selected and their on-site locations have to be determined so that each demand area is connected to its supply area. The objective is to minimize overall cost. When locating cranes, infeasible areas, minimum distances between cranes and obstacles limiting the cranes’ slewing ranges, e.g. other cranes or existing structures, have to be respected. We provide a formal problem definition, analyze its computational complexity, and develop four different mixed-integer programming models. Finally, an extensive computational study investigates the performance of standard solver CPLEX using the model formulations.	integer programming;interference (communication);linear programming	Dirk Briskorn;Michael Dienstknecht	2019	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2018.07.033	lifting equipment;mathematical optimization;mathematics;programming paradigm;computational complexity theory;integer programming;limiting;tower;solver	Crypto	16.920217787864853	3.908110572703023	131136

The planning period is one year and a numbers of time periods are considered. The tactical decisions included in the model regard transportation of raw materials from harvest areas to pulp mills, production mix and contents at pulp mills, distribution of pulp products from mills to customers either via terminals or directly, and the selection of potential orders and their levels at customers. A mixed integer linear programming model for the supply chain problem is developed. The main solution method in this paper is a Lagrangian heuristic method based on Lagrangian decomposition. The heuristic divides the problem into two subproblems representing different physical stages in the supply chain, each including several time periods. The advantage of the proposed solution approach is that it generates feasible solutions of high quality in short time.

c844c042ed15d01440b62105e2ee8c586941b023	an integrated approach for power system restoration planning		Power system outages/blackouts, especially weather related, are becoming more and more frequent, incurring significant economic and social costs. The ability to restore power services quickly after a blackout is crucial for power system resilience. Power system restoration is an extremely complicated process, involving multiple steps, highly combinatorial operational decisions, and highly nonlinear technical constraints, which make restoration planning an exceptionally challenging task. This paper will first introduce the restoration process and operations, examine important issues in restoration, and survey the state of the art in the research and practice of power system restoration planning. Then, we will focus on the commonly used buildup restoration planning strategy, in which the system is sectionalized into smaller subsystems with initial power sources, and then the subsystems are restored in parallel. Due to the complexity, existing approaches treat the sectionalization and restoration separately, leading to a suboptimal restoration plan. We will introduce an integrated restoration planning approach to improve the quality of restoration plans globally (such as shorter overall restoration time) by using mathematical programming and simulation in an interactive and iterative way. Case studies will be provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	circuit restoration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;simulation	Feng Qiu;Peijie Li	2017	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2017.2696564	psychological resilience;electric power system;synchronization;reliability engineering;engineering	AI	12.985003586410945	1.7000982657167807	131289

Validation of these systems must be defined in terms of describing the adequacy of the P2P model to the actual environment. This paper focuses on the validation of the Distributed Resource Machine (DRM) as a computational P2P system when applied to Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs ) using exclusively gossip mechanisms for communication. The above mentioned adequacy will be measured by the range in which performance speedup actually takes place. Validation has been carried out by running an empirical performance study based on benchmarking techniques. It shows that it scales only up to a limited and small number of nodes, which is problem-dependent. Furthermore, due to the reason found for this lack of scalability, it seems unlikely that massive scalability takes place.	evolutionary algorithm;peer-to-peer;scalability;speedup	Juan Luis Jiménez Laredo;Pedro Ángel Castillo Valdivieso;Ben Paechter;Antonio Mora García;Eva Alfaro-Cid;Anna Esparcia-Alcázar;Juan Julián Merelo Guervós	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-71805-5_14	simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	HPC	21.85406471411634	3.769957538844483	131381

This class of algorithms makes it possible to exploit more efficiently the artificial Darwinist scheme, as soon as an optimisation problem can be turned into a co-evolution of interdependent sub-parts of the searched solution. Testing the efficiency of new CCEA concepts, however, it is not straightforward: while there is a rich literature of benchmarks for more traditional evolutionary techniques, the same does not hold true for this relatively new paradigm. We present a benchmark problem designed to study the behavior and performance of CCEAs, modeling a search for the optimal placement of a set of lamps inside a room. The relative complexity of the problem can be adjusted by operating on a single parameter. The fitness function is a trade-off between conflicting objectives, so the performance of an algorithm can be examined by making use of different metrics. We show how three different cooperative strategies, Parisian Evolution (PE), Group Evolution (GE) and Allopatric Group Evolution (AGE), can be applied to the problem. Using a Classical Evolution (CE) approach as comparison, we analyse the behavior of each algorithm in detail, with respect to the size of the problem capito.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);cooperative coevolution;evolution;evolutionary computation;fitness function;interdependence;mathematical optimization;programming paradigm;scheme	Alberto Paolo Tonda;Evelyne Lutton;Giovanni Squillero	2012	Memetic Computing	10.1007/s12293-012-0095-x	mathematical optimization;simulation;artificial intelligence;machine learning;evolution strategy;experimental analysis of behavior	AI	24.556428034062005	-3.9162725866457455	131534

The tool load should be minimized as higher extrusion forces required greater capacity and energy. It may lead to increase the chance of part defects, die wear and die breakage. Besides, optimization may help to save the time and cost of producing the final product, in addition to produce better formability of work material and better quality of the finishing product. In this regard, this study aimed to determine the optimal extrusion process parameters. The minimization of punch load was the main concern, in such a way that the structurally sound product at minimum load can be achieved. Minimization of punch load during the extrusion process was first formulated as a nonlinear programming model using response surface methodology in this study. The established extrusion force model was then taken as the fitness function. Subsequently, the analytical approach and metaheuristic algorithms, specifically the particle swarm optimization, cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and flower pollination algorithm, were applied to optimize the extrusion process parameters. Performance assessment demonstrated the promising results of all presented techniques in minimizing the tool loading. The CSA, however, gave more persistent optimization results, which was validated through statistical analysis.	cuckoo search;die (integrated circuit);fitness function;list of metaphor-based metaheuristics;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;particle swarm optimization;programming model;response surface methodology;search algorithm	Pauline Ong;Desmond Daniel Vui Sheng Chin;Choon Sin Ho;Chuan Huat Ng	2016	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-016-2626-8	mathematical optimization;final product;mathematics;nonlinear programming;metaheuristic;extrusion;formability;particle swarm optimization;fitness function;response surface methodology	EDA	17.29386705747408	-4.1270971333846065	131673
dd695c023b9816168447b3d55b4a880da9696e79	a binary cuckoo search big data algorithm applied to large-scale crew scheduling problems		The progress of metaheuristic techniques, big data, and the Internet of things generates opportunities to performance improvements in complex industrial systems. This article explores the application of Big Data techniques in the implementation of metaheuristic algorithms with the purpose of applying it to decision-making in industrial processes. This exploration intends to evaluate the quality of the results and convergence times of the algorithm under different conditions in the number of solutions and the processing capacity. Under what conditions can we obtain acceptable results in an adequate number of iterations? In this article, we propose a cuckoo search binary algorithm using the MapReduce programming paradigm implemented in the Apache Spark tool. The algorithm is applied to different instances of the crew scheduling problem. The experiments show that the conditions for obtaining suitable results and iterations are specific to each problem and are not always satisfactory.	algorithm;big data;crew scheduling;cuckoo search;scheduling (computing)	José García;Francisco Altimiras;Alvaro Peña;Gino Astorga;Oscar Peredo	2018	Complexity	10.1155/2018/8395193	machine learning;cuckoo search;big data;programming paradigm;spark (mathematics);artificial intelligence;metaheuristic;crew scheduling;binary number;mathematics;algorithm;convergence (routing)	ML	21.98155091227663	0.7996829930372963	131684
789fc5b921e4357f92bedeb0cdbf6d217ac63c64	balancing survival of feasible and infeasible solutions in constraint evolutionary optimization algorithms		Real-world optimization problems often involve constraints that relate to viability of implementing a solution. To solve such problems efficiently, a good constraint handling method is indispensable for an optimization algorithm. Population-based optimization algorithms allow a flexible way to handle constraints by making a careful comparison between feasible and infeasible solutions present in the population. A previous approach, which emphasized feasible solutions infinitely more than the infeasible solutions, has been popularly applied for more than one-and-half decade, mostly with real-parameter genetic algorithms (RGAs). Despite its popular use, the idea was criticized for its extreme selection pressure against infeasible solutions. Since optimal solutions often lie on the constraint boundaries, survival of certain infeasible solutions close to critical constraint boundaries should help RGA's recombination and mutation operators to produce near-optimal solutions. In this paper, we extend the earlier parameter-less constraint handling approach so as to strike a balance between survival of feasible and infeasible solutions in a GA population. The balance is controlled through an additional parameter that could be pre-specified or adaptively updated as the algorithm progresses. A parametric study is conducted to determine an appropriate value which works the best on most problems of this study. A significant improvement in performance is observed for the commonly-used g-series test problem suite and a real-world application problem (welded beam design). The approach is generic and can be easily extended to other real-parameter evolutionary algorithms, multi-objective and other advanced optimization tasks.	evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;optimizing compiler;population;software release life cycle	Zhichao Lu;Kalyanmoy Deb;Hemant Singh	2018	2018 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2018.8477976	computer science;mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;operator (computer programming);parametric statistics;linear programming;algorithm;suite;evolutionary algorithm;population;optimization problem	DB	23.13396540347599	-3.504855025242986	132254

First, a model of a generic evolutionary algorithm using iterated random maps is presented. The model allows the exploration of a connection between coupling from the past, and a stopping criterion for evolutionary algorithms. Accordingly, a method to stop a generic evolutionary algorithm is proposed. Some computational experiments are carried out to test the stopping criterion, using a modified version of coupling from the past. Empirical evidence is shown to support the suitability of the criterion.	computation;coupling from the past;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;iteration;map	German Hernandez;Kenneth Wilder;Fernando Niño;Julian Garcia	2005		10.1145/1068009.1068112	evolutionary programming;mathematical optimization;computer experiment;empirical evidence;coupling from the past;interactive evolutionary computation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;mathematics	AI	24.49116033391662	-2.4925255128126182	132443

66815bac7339126f9398a3ae86d5c09ab6d1e05a	hybrid nature-inspired intelligence for the resource leveling problem		The paper deals with a class of problems often met in modern project management under the term “resource leveling optimization problems”. The problems of this kind refer to the optimal allocation of available resources in a candidate project and have emerged, as the result of the even increasing needs of project managers in facing project complexity, controlling related budgeting and finances and managing the construction production line. For the effective resolution of resource leveling optimization problems, the use of nature inspired intelligent methodologies is proposed. Traditional approaches, such as exhaustive or greedy search methodologies, often fail to provide near-optimum solutions in a short amount of time, whereas the proposed intelligent approaches manage to timely achieve high quality near-optimal solutions. In the paper, extensive experimental results are presented, based on available data collections existing in literature for a number of known benchmark project management problems. The comparative analysis of three different intelligent metaheuristics, shows that a hybrid nature inspired intelligent approach, combining ant colony optimization and genetic algorithms, proves to be the most effective approach in the majority of benchmark problems and special decision making settings tested.

3f60c5caccf0e239ed7f9b4190d2e9ca339c03b6	applying strategic multiagent planning to real-world travel sharing problems		Travel sharing, i.e., the problem of finding parts of routes which can be shared by several travellers with different points of departure and destinations, is a complex multiagent problem that requires taking into account individual agents’ preferences to come up with mutually acceptable joint plans. In this paper, we apply state-of-the-art planning techniques to real-world public transportation data to evaluate the feasibility of multiagent planning techniques in this domain. The potential of improving travel sharing technology has great application value due to its ability to reduce the environmental impact of travelling while providing benefits to travellers at the same time. We propose a three-phase algorithm that utilises performant single-agent planners to find individual plans in a simplified domain first and then merges them using a best-response planner which ensures resulting solutions are individually rational. Finally, it maps the resulting plan onto the full temporal planning domain to schedule actual journeys. The evaluation of our algorithm on real-world, multi-modal public transportation data for the United Kingdom shows linear scalability both in the scenario size and in the number of agents, where trade-offs have to be made between total cost improvement, the percentage of feasible timetables identified for journeys, and the prolongation of these journeys. Our system constitutes the first implementation of strategic multiagent planning algorithms in large-scale domains and provides insights into the engineering process of translating general domain-independent multiagent planning algorithms to real-world applications.	agent-based model;algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;map;modal logic;scalability;schedule	Jan Hrncír;Michael Rovatsos	2012	CoRR		simulation;artificial intelligence;operations research	AI	13.064335394723491	-0.2325628202268783	132670

We describe a real-life ship routing and scheduling problem from the LNG business, with both inventory and berth capacity constraints at the liquefaction port. We propose a solution method where the routing and scheduling decisions are decomposed. The routing decisions consist of deciding which vessels should service which cargoes and in what sequence. The scheduling decisions are then to decide when to start servicing the cargoes while satisfying inventory and berth capacity constraints. The proposed solution method has been tested on several problem instances based on the real-life problem. The results show that the proposed solution method is well suited to solve this LNG shipping problem.	real life;routing;scheduling (computing)	Elin E.

We argue that end-of-run results alone do not give sufficient information about an algorithm's performance, so our approach analyzes the algorithm's progress over time. Comparisons of performance curves in diagrams can be formalized by comparing the areas under them. Algorithms can be ranked according to a performance metric. Rankings based on different metrics can then be aggregated into a global ranking, which provides a quick overview of the quality of algorithms in comparison. An open source software framework, the TSP Suite, applies this experimental procedure to the TSP. The framework can support researchers in implementing TSP solvers, unit testing them, and running experiments in a parallel and distributed fashion. It also has an evaluator component, which implements the proposed evaluation process and produces detailed reports. We test the approach by using the TSP Suite to benchmark several local search and evolutionary computation methods. This results in a large set of baseline data, which will be made available to the research community. Our experiments show that the tested pure global optimization algorithms are outperformed by local search, but the best results come from hybrid algorithms.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);benchmark (computing);diagram;evolutionary computation;experiment;global optimization;interpreter (computing);local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;open-source software;travelling salesman problem;unit testing	Thomas Weise;Raymond Chiong;Jörg Lässig;Ke Tang;Shigeyoshi Tsutsui;Wenxiang Chen;Zbigniew Michalewicz;Xin Yao	2014	IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine	10.1109/MCI.2014.2326101	2-opt;mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;nova;3-opt;metaheuristic	DB	22.13802068694216	-2.948897683704705	133210
30d482f4c4a45a68c3bee39bcbc365d4570fb863	an efficient three-level heuristic for the large-scaled multi-product production routing problem with outsourcing		Abstract A classic production routing problem (PRP), in which a plant produces and distributes a single product to a set of customers over a finite time horizon, consists of planning simultaneously the production, inventory and routing activities to minimize the total cost. The last few decades have witnessed the increasing efforts made to solve such a complex problem. In this paper, we investigate a generalized PRP by considering multiple products and outsourcing (MPRP-OS). The newly studied problem is first formulated into a mixed integer linear program. Then a three-level mathematical-programming-based heuristic called TLH is developed to solve it. TLH combines a two-phase iterative method, a repairing strategy and a fix-and-optimize procedure to find near-optimal solutions. In addition, it is adaptable to solve the classic PRP. Computational experiments on 225 newly generated MPRP-OS instances with up to 200 customers, 20 vehicles, 6 periods and 12 products show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed heuristic. The performance of TLH is further demonstrated by testing 1530 classic PRP benchmark instances with up to 200 customers, 13 vehicles and 20 periods. Experimental results indicate that TLH is able to solve large-sized MPRP-OS instances within short computation times. In addition, TLH provides new best solutions for 283 out of 1530 benchmark instances.	heuristic;outsourcing;routing	Yantong Li;Feng Chu;Chengbin Chu;Zhanguo Zhu	2019	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2018.07.018	mathematical optimization;iterative method;computation;total cost;supply chain management;linear programming;outsourcing;heuristic;time horizon;mathematics	ECom	14.85869725187645	3.421094384012022	133267

We first provide an enhanced compact model based on a combination of existing models in the literature for this relatively new operations research problem. We then extend this problem and introduce the refueling station location problem which adds the routing aspect of the individual drivers. Our proposed branch and price algorithm relaxes the simple path assumption generally adopted in the existing studies and implicitly takes into account deviation tolerances without the pregeneration of the routes. Therefore, the decrease in solution times with respect to existing models is significant and our algorithm scales very efficiently to more realistic network dimensions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) within the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

The advantages of a hybrid knowledge-based system are described followed by the system objectives, means of control, and constraints. A framework is provided that describes the necessary development stages of a commercial knowledge-based package. An overview of the utility knowledge acquisition procedure is provided to appreciate the complexity of defining the rule base. This is followed by a description of the flow of information in a three-level hierarchical rule base and a summary of network radiality, parameter, and performance rules employed in this rule base. After a heuristic preprocessor identifies a list of switch closures that would seem to reduce total system losses, network radiality rules assess if a particular search path has identified a switch that can be closed and a corresponding switch opened to maintain the radiality of the system or if the path is worth pursuing further. Network parameter rules ensure the system operates within original design parameters. Network performance rules assess the reduction in total system losses of each proposed switching operation. Where there is a coupling between knowledge-based and numerical methods, the integration of numerical methods is described. Finally, the validation and simulations as well as the benefits of this hybrid knowledge-based system are described.	heuristic;knowledge acquisition;knowledge-based systems;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;network performance;numerical method;path (variable);preprocessor;rule-based system;simulation	Robert J.

We wish to optimize both bike and dock allocations for each station at the beginning of the day, so that the expected number of customers who cannot find a bike, or cannot find a dock to return a bike, is minimized. With a system of this scale, traditional simulation optimization methods such as stochastic gradient-search and random search are inefficient. We propose a variety of more efficient gradient-like heuristic methods that can improve any given allocation based on a discrete-event simulation model of the system. The methods are tested on data from December 2015 with different starting solutions obtained from other models. We further explore the relationship between the system behaviors during the morning and afternoon rush hours by comparing optimal solutions when the problem is restricted to these two periods.	docking station;heuristic;mathematical optimization;random search;simulation;stochastic gradient descent	Nanjing Jian;Daniel Freund;Holly M.

To satisfj the requirement, a constraint pre-checking method and a gene build-in delaying GA are proposed This gene build-in delaying GA pospones the reproduction of genes whose fitness cannot be determined only by local conditions, and preferentially reproduces genes which have stronger relation to just reconshrcted genes. Moreover, constraint pre-checking method adopts the constraint propagation method into the GA. This method statically analyses constraints on the VRP, before starting GA andgenerates a two dimensional away. This amay shows the nodes which cannot be contained together in one truck route. Therefore, the calculation eflciency of the crossover and mutation operations is improved by using this away in reconshrcting individuals. Our experiment proves that this method enables interactive simulations of large-scale distribution networks.	constraint logic programming;local consistency;response time (technology);simulation;software propagation;software release life cycle;vehicle routing problem	Takashi Onoyama;Sen Kubota;Yoshio Taniguchi;Setsuo Tsuruta	2003		10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244487	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;genetic algorithm;computer science;vehicle routing problem;distributed computing;scheduling;local consistency;satisfiability	Robotics	20.092792844000215	0.31242550339838776	134096

This is an extension of the classical uncapacitated lot-sizing problem with backlogs, in which two autonomous and self-interested decision makers constitute a two-echelon supply chain. The leader buys items from the follower in order to meet external demand at lowest cost. The follower also tries to minimize its costs. Both parties may backlog. We study the leader’s problem, i.e., how to determine supply requests over time to minimize its costs in view of the possible actions of the follower. We develop two mixed-integer linear programming reformulations, as well as cutting planes to cut off feasible, but suboptimal solutions. We compare the reformulations on a series of benchmark instances.	autonomous robot;benchmark (computing);bilevel optimization;integer programming;linear programming;row echelon form	Tamás Kis;András Kovács	2013	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2012.11.023	mathematical optimization;supply chain management;integer programming;operations management;mathematics;mathematical economics;bilevel optimization	AI	15.800967136204589	3.363915985386792	134172

In MOEA/D, a multi-objective problem (MOP) can be decomposed into several single-objective sub-problems. Thus, the preference incorporation mechanism in our algorithm is implemented by selecting the preferred sub-problems rather than the preferred region in the objective space. At each interaction, iMOEA/D offers a set of current solutions and asks the DM to choose the most preferred one. Then, the search will be guided to the neighborhood of the selected. iMOEA/D is tested on some benchmark problems, and various utility functions are used to simulate the DM's responses. The experimental studies show that iMOEA/D can handle the preference information very well and successfully converge to the expected preferred regions.	benchmark (computing);converge;decision theory;evolutionary algorithm;moea framework;simulation	Maoguo Gong;Fang Liu;Wei Zhang;Licheng Jiao;Qingfu Zhang	2011		10.1145/2001576.2001675	decision-making;mathematical optimization;interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-objective optimization;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm	AI	20.733060929896336	-4.677357271370001	134208

706656bd103f02c9fff305eb54b9f71fc46c69d1	parallel genetic algorithms for constrained ordering problems	parallel genetic algorithm;difference operator;genetic al gorithm;job shop	This paper proposes two different parallel genetic algorithms (PGAs) for constrained ordering problems. Constrained ordering problems are constraint optimization problems (COPs) for which it is possible represent a candidate solution as a permutation of objects. A decoder is used to decode this permutation into an instantiafion of the COP vm-iables. Two examples of such constrmnsd ordering problems are the travel;n~ salesman problem (TSP) and the job shop schedldin~ problem (JSSP). The first PGA we propose (PGA1) implements a GA using p subpopulations, where p is the number of processors. This is known as the island model. What is new is that we use a different selection strategy, called kesp.bemt reproduction (KBR) that favours the parent with higher fitness over the child with lower fitness. Keep-best reproduction has shown better results in the sequential case than the standard selection technique (STDS) of replacing both parents by their two children (Wiese & Goodwin 1997; 1998a; 1998b). The second PGA (PGA2) is different from PGAI: while it also works with independent subpopulations, each subpopulation uses a different crossover operator. It is not a priori known which operator performs the best. PGA2 also uses KBR and its subpopulations exrhange a percentage q of their fittest individuals every x generations. In addition, whenever this exchange takes place, the subpopulation with the best average fitness broadcasts a percentage q~ of its fittest individuals to all other subpopulations. This will enmn~ that for a particular problem instance the operator that works best will have an increasing number of ot~pring sampled in the global population. This design also tAlt~ care of the fact that in the early stages of a GA run different operators can work better than in the later stages. Over time PGA2 will automatically adjust to this new situation.

Introduction Many problems in artificial intelligence and simulation can be described in a general framework as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) or constraint op timization problem (COP). Informally a CSP (in its finite domain formulation) is a problem composed of a finite set of variables, each of which has a finite domain, and a set of constraints that restrict the values that the variables can simultaneously take. For many problem domains, however, not all solutions to a CSP are equally good. For example, in the case of job shop scheduling different schedules which all satisfy the resource and capacity constraints can have different makespaus (the total time to complete all orders), or different inventory requirements. So in addition to the standard CSP, a constraint optimization problem has a so-called objective function f which assigns a value to each solution of the underlying CSP. A global solution to a COP is a labeling of all its variables, so that all constraints are satisfied, and the objective function f is optimized. Since it usually takes a complete search of the search space to find the optimum f value, for many problems global optimization is not feasible in practice. That is why COP research has focused on local search methods that take a candidate solution to a COP and search in its local neighborhood for improving neighbors. Such techniques include iterative improvement (hill climbing), threshold algorithms (Dueck Scheuer 1990), simulated annealing (Cerny 1985; Kirkpatrick, Gelatt Jr., & Vecchi 1983), taboo search (Glover, Talllard, & Werra 1993), and variable depth search. Since these methods are only searching a subset of the search space, they are not complete, i.e., are not guaranteed to return the overall optimum. Another optimization technique are genetic algorithms (GAs). Genetic algorithms were originally designed to work on hitstrings. These bitstrings encoded a domain value of a real valued function that was supposed to be optimized. They were originally proposed by Holland (Holland 1975). More recently, researchers have focused on applying GAs to combinatorial optimization problems, including constraint optimization problems such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the job shop scheduling problem (JSSP).

Several metaheuristics or exact algorithms have been proposed to solve stationary MKP. This study aims to solve this difficult problem with dynamic conditions, testing a new evolutionary algorithm. In the present study, the Partheno-genetic algorithm (PGA) is tested by evolving parameters in time. Originality of the study is based on comparing the performances in static and dynamic conditions. First the effectiveness of the PGA is tested on both the stationary, and the dynamic MKP. Then, the improvements with different random restarting schemes are observed. The PGA achievements are shown in statistical and graphical analysis.	genetic algorithm;knapsack problem	Ali Nadi Ünal;Gülgün Kayakutlu	2016	RAIRO - Operations Research	10.1051/ro/2015011	continuous knapsack problem;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;polynomial-time approximation scheme;combinatorial optimization;generalized assignment problem;mathematics;knapsack problem	Theory	23.37739239440321	-0.7155199392390311	134323
0818057dace95c1f97dd5ef3144564c6207d6f5a	simulation with data scarcity: developing a simulation model of a hospital emergency department		Our research was motivated by the resource allocations problem in the Emergency Department at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. We adopted a simulation approach to analysis how the allocation decisions impact patient's experience in the department. The development of the model is complicated by the fact that there are different categories of patients (with different time-varying arrival rates, treatments and procedures), and the data records were incomplete to allow direct estimation of many of the key operational parameters (e.g. the duration of doctor's consultation). To tackle the first issue, patients' arrivals are modelled as Poisson processes with category and time-dependent arrival rates. The second issue is resolved by positing a general distribution (Weibull) for some key processes, and developing meta-heuristic approaches to jointly estimate the distribution parameters. Our computational results show that accurate estimates of the distribution parameters are found using our proposed search procedure, in that the simulated results and the actual data were consistent.	computation;heuristic;prince;simulation	Yong-Hong Kuo;Janny Leung;Colin A.

We focus on business processes design optimization. It is known as the problem of creating feasible business processes while optimizing their criteria such as resource cost and execution time. In this paper, we propose an approach that focuses on tasks composing a business process, their resources and attributes rather than a full representation of a business process for its evaluation according to certain criteria. The main contribution of this work is a framework capable of (i) generating business processes using an enhanced version of evolutionary algorithm NSGAII. (ii) Verifying the feasibility of each business process created using an effective algorithm. At last, (iii) selecting Pareto optimal solutions in a multi criteria optimization environment up to three criteria, using an effectual fitness function.

2151b5e3f247476a0eb2c62ed790019517eda413	fleet-level selective maintenance problem under a phased mission scheme with short breaks: a heuristic sequential game approach		Abstract Selective maintenance is the most widely used strategy for identifying and performing the maintenance actions necessary for fleet mission success. A fleet of equipment is usually required to perform phased missions with short scheduled breaks. In this case, a selective maintenance model should be extended for frequency-based maintenance optimization. We research the problem considering the application of condition-based maintenance (CBM). The problem is formulated with the objective of reducing the repair frequency and cost. The constraint is the reliability of the phased mission, and the variables are the remaining useful lifetimes (RUL) of all the key subsystems. The equipment can be classified into three echelons based on the health status before each wave of a mission, and a heuristic game framework with state backtracking is proposed for the three echelons to solve the problem. The flowchart and heuristic rules of the game framework are given, and the game algorithms for the second and third echelons are presented. The second echelon algorithm aims to select the dispatched equipment for the current wave and minimize maintenance, and the third echelon algorithm aims to ensure that sufficient equipment is available for the next wave by performing necessary maintenance. Finally, we present two types of strategy adjustment methods with state backtracking to turn infeasible solutions into feasible solutions and to optimize feasible solutions. To verify the capacity of the proposed method, a case involving a fleet of 12 aircraft is analyzed for a three-mission scheme, and the aircraft repair times and costs are reduced by the method.	heuristic	Dezhen Yang;Haochen Wang;Qiang Feng;Yi Ren;Bo Sun;Zili Wang	2018	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2018.04.005	backtracking;maintenance problem;engineering;mathematical optimization;sequential game;heuristic;maintenance actions;flowchart	AI	13.565941491282967	2.038938574319748	134564
0d55b8a7c9e5c5271eb97d328485357d51aad851	a fine-grained cuda implementation of the multi-objective evolutionary approach nsga-ii: potential impact for computational and systems biology applications		Many computational and systems biology challenges, in particular those related to big data analysis, can be formulated as optimization problems and therefore can be addressed using heuristics. Beside the typical optimization problems, formulated with respect to a single target, the possibility of optimizing multiple objectives (MO) is rapidly becoming more appealing. In this context, MO Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) are one of the most widely used classes of methods to solve MO optimization problems. However, these methods can be particularly demanding from the computational point of view and, therefore, effective parallel implementations are needed. This fact, together with the wide diffusion of powerful and low-cost general-purpose Graphics Processing Units, promoted the development of software tools that focus on the parallelization of one or more computational phases among the steps characterizing MOEAs. In this paper we present a fine-grained parallelization of the Fast Non-dominating Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) for the CUDA architecture. In particular, we will discuss how this solution can be exploited to solve multi-objective optimization task in the field of computational and systems biology.	cuda;computation;systems biology	Daniele D'Agostino;Giulia Pasquale;Ivan Merelli	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-24462-4_23	computational science;computer science;bioinformatics;theoretical computer science	HPC	22.498220802150048	-4.7951195808083495	134661

Currently, authorities are forcing transport operators to act in more sustainable ways. For intermodal hubs this is translated into making a preferable choice for sustainable transport modalities. In some cases, this is no longer a choice and is imposed on the intermodal hub in terms of a desired transport modal split. In this paper, a heuristic based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) to achieve a desired transport modal split at intermodal hubs is proposed. A terminal state constraint is used for the quantity of cargo assigned per modality over the prediction horizon to guide the cargo assignment. Feasibility of the optimization problem and cargo delivery at the agreed time are assured by relaxing the terminal state constraint. The proposed heuristic can anticipate the transport of cargo due to the inclusion of predictions, leading to a push of cargo towards the final destination. As cargo is moving in anticipation to the due time the transport is more robust to unforseen events, such as jams and weather conditions. The proposed heuristic is a step towards sustainable and synchromodal transportation networks. Simulation experiments illustrate the validity of these statements.	assignment problem;decision support system;experiment;heuristic;mathematical optimization;modal logic;optimization problem;quality of service;simulation;technological convergence;the hub (forum);usb hub	João Miguel Lemos Chasqueira Nabais;Rudy R.

Its objective is to schedule the power generation properly in order to minimize the total operational cost. Renewable energy resources such as wind power have significant attention in recent years in power system field. It reduces fuel consumption and also benefits in curbing emission. But wind power penetration into conventional systems due to its intermittent nature has some implications like security concerns. Thus a reasonable trade off is required between system risk and operational cost. In this paper a bi-objective economic dispatch problem considering wind power penetration is formulated. A fuzzy membership function is used to represent the dispatch of wind power into the conventional system. A particle swarm optimization algorithm, Genetic algorithm and a bacteria-foraging technique are adopted to develop a dispatch scheme compromising both the economic and security requirements. The results of all these 3 proposed techniques are compared. Numerical analyses are reported based on a typical IEEE-30-bus with six-generator test power system to show the validity and applicability of the proposed approaches.	artificial immune system;dynamic dispatch;fossil;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;newton's method;numerical method;particle swarm optimization;requirement	A.

An important reason for its adoption as a leading indicator is its simplicity. The Quintile Share Ratio is ‘‘The ratio of total income received by the 20% of the population with the highest income (top quintile) to that received by the 20% of the population with the lowest income (lowest quintile)’’. The QSR concept is used in this paper in the context of obnoxious facility location where the inequality is in distances to the obnoxious facility. The single facility location problem minimizing the QSR is investigated. The problem is investigated for continuous uniform demand in an area such as a disk, a rectangle, and a line; when demand is generated at a finite set of demand points; and when the facility can be located anywhere on a network. Optimal solution algorithms are devised for demand originating at a finite set of demand points and at nodes of the network. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

One common and successful, but approximated approach for coping with these problems considers the system of interest isolated from its environment. In such a case, the links to the real world may be reduced to a set of parameters associated with probabilistic distributions. Simheuristics is a solving methodology able to provide efficiently near-optimal solutions for these constrained problems. This paper presents a methodology combining Simheuristics with a Petri net model, describing the environment of a logistic system. An extended version of the capacitated vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands is stated adding a Petri net model. Petri nets are widely used for modeling parallelism and concurrency, providing a realistic description of this environment, which may change the behavior of the isolated system and the scope of the decision-making.	approximation algorithm;concurrency (computer science);logistics;operations research;parallel computing;petri net;vehicle routing problem	Juan Ignacio Latorre;Javier Faulin;Angel A.

We design a genetic algorithm with some components specifically tailored to deal with the problem. In the experimental study we evaluate the proposed algorithm in a benchmark set taken from the literature, and we also compare it against the state-of-the-art showing that our proposal is significantly better.	benchmark (computing);experiment;genetic algorithm;real life;scheduling (computing);time of arrival	Jorge García-Álvarez;Miguel Angel González;Camino R.

The dissimilarity of a cluster is computed as the sum of the dissimilarities existing between each entity of the cluster and the median associated to such cluster. In this paper we present an exact algorithm for solving the CPMP based on a set partitioning formulation of the problem. A valid lower bound to the optimal solution cost is obtained by combining two different heuristic methods for solving the dual of the LP-relaxation of the exact formulation. Computational tests on problems proposed in the literature and on new sets of test problems show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.#R##N#Scope and purpose#R##N#A basic location problem consists of locating a number of facilities or depots to supply a set of customers. The objective is to minimize the cost of locating the facilities and assigning the customers to them. This problem has been extensively studied in the literature and is commonly referred to as the plant location problem, or facility location problem. When each potential facility has a constraint on the maximum demand that it can supply and the number of facilities to locate is specified, the problem is known as the Capacitated p-median problem (CPMP). The purpose of this paper is to present a new exact algorithm for the CPMP and evaluate its computational performance on a set of test problems taken from the literature and on a new set of test problems.

The aim of this problem is to find a valid broadcasting pattern to earth-stationed terminals which maximizes the number of timeslots utilized for broadcasting under certain constraints. In this paper, we proposed Boosted Binary Differential Evolution (BBDE) to solve SBS and propose some various methods for every stage of the algorithm. Our proposed algorithm employs the best method in different stages of DE. The result of our algorithm is tested against published works toward solving SBS problem. A set of benchmark instances that reported in the literature for SBS problem are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

It integrates three stages of the planning process (i.e., fleet assignment, aircraft routing, and crew pairing) that are typically solved in sequence. Aircraft maintenance is also taken into account. The objective function aims at minimizing a weighted sum of the number of aircraft routes, the number of crew pairings, and the waiting times of crews between consecutive flights. In addition, it aims at maximizing the robustness of the solution by also minimizing the number of times that crews need to change aircraft. We present two mixed integer linear programming models for the integrated problem. The first formulation, called the path-path model, can be considered as the “natural model” in which both the crew pairings and the aircraft routes are represented by path-based variables.

Much work has been done on solving static routing problems but solving the dynamic variants has not been given an equal amount of attention, while these are even more relevant to most companies in logistics and transportation. In this work an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for solving the Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows is proposed.

38a06e77a0dd0ad659f3a3803f9e18b92fcc78d2	fuzzy evolutionary approaches for bus andrail driver scheduling		Bus and train driver scheduling is a process of partitioning blocks of work, each of which is serviced by one vehicle, into a set of legal driver shifts. The main objectives are to minimise the total number of shifts and the total shift cost. Restrictions imposed by logistic, legal and union agreements make the problem more complicated.#R##N##R##N#The generate-and-select approach is widely used. A large set of feasible shifts is generated first, and then a subset is selected, from the large set, to form a final schedule by the mathematical programming method. In the subset selection phase, computational difficulties exist because of the NP-hard nature of this combinatorial optimisation problem. This thesis presents two evolutionary algorithms, namely a Genetic Algorithm and a Simulated Evolution algorithm, attempting to model and solve the driver scheduling problem in new ways.#R##N##R##N#At the heart of both algorithms is a function for evaluating potential driver shifts under fuzzified criteria. A Genetic Algorithm is first employed to calibrate the weight distribution among fuzzy membership functions. A Simulated Evolution algorithm then mimics generations of evolution on the single schedule produced by the Genetic Algorithm. In each generation an unfit portion of the working schedule is removed. The broken schedule is then reconstructed by means of a greedy algorithm, using the weight distribution derived by the Genetic Algorithm. The basic Simulated Evolution algorithm is a greedy search strategy that achieves improvement through iterative perturbation and reconstruction. This approach has achieved success in solving driver scheduling problems from different companies, with comparable results to the previously best known solutions.#R##N##R##N#Finally, the Simulated Evolution algorithm for driver scheduling has been generalized for the set covering problem, without using any special domain knowledge. This shows that this research is valuable to many applications that can be formulated as set covering models. Furthermore, Taguchi's orthogonal experimental design method has been used for the parameter settings. Computational results have shown that for large-scale problems, in general the proposed approach can produce superior solutions much faster than some existing approaches. This approach is particularly suitable for situations where quick and high-quality solutions are desirable.	raildriver;scheduling (computing)	Jingpeng Li	2002			mathematical optimization;computer science;operations management;algorithm	Arch	15.368835919102404	4.134526329996517	136109

We describe a model, where the facilities have unequal-areas and the layout for each stage is produced on the continuous plant floor. The most difficulty of solving this problem consists in the lack of a powerful optimization method. Wang–Landau (WL) sampling algorithm is an improved Monte Carlo method, and has been successfully applied to solve many optimization problems. In this paper, we combine the WL sampling algorithm and some heuristic strategies to solve the unequal-area DFLP. In the WL sampling algorithm, a vacant point strategy is applied to update layout at one stage. To prevent overlapping of facilities and reduce the empty space among facilities, a pushing strategy and a pressuring strategy are applied. We have tested the proposed algorithm on four groups of cases and the computational results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in solving the unequal-area DFLP.	algorithm;heuristic (computer science);sampling (signal processing)	Jingfa Liu;Dawen Wang;Kun He	2017	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2017.04.002	mathematical optimization;computer science;operations management;algorithm	Logic	19.250370812930655	2.3897218033392296	136252

Due to the rapid increase in sea-borne demand, large emphasis is placed on making ports more efficient, by promoting the effective utilization of available resources. Therefore, the role of optimization becomes crucial, as port operators aim for the cost-effective option of maximizing port efficiency, rather than the costly alternative of expanding existing capacity. One of the most important seaside planning problems that has received a great deal of attention in research streams is the assignment of quay space to incoming vessels; it is known as the Berth Allocation Problem (BAP). Even though it has been studied extensively, there remain certain unaddressed gaps. Relatively little attention has been focused on the operation of bulk ports, in which terminal operators are concerned with integrating and managing the sea-side area (wharf) and the buffer area for storage. The cargo type must be explicitly known to the bulk port operator, who in turn assigns to it the best storage area and the use of appropriate specialized equipment for loading and discharging. It is evident that the integration of the BAP with yard assignment is necessary, in order to maximize efficiency and obtain the optimal berthing plan in bulk ports. Thus, the current paper studies the integrated dynamic hybrid berth allocation and yard assignment problem (BYAP) in the context of bulk ports. Important assumptions are taken into consideration in order to produce a realistic and practical model. Finally, a relevant case study is presented for the case of Mina Zayed Port in Abu Dhabi.

The CLSP is the extension of the Wagner-Whitin problem where there is one product and no capacity constraints. The CLSP involves determining lot sizes for multiple products on a single machine with limited capacity that may change for each planning period. Determining the right lot sizes has a critical importance on the productivity and success of organizations. The paper aims to discuss these issues.rnrnrnrnrnDesign/methodology/approachrnrnrnrnrnThis study focuses on the CLSP with setup carryover and backordering.

As one of solutions, a PV system and a Solar Hot-Water Supply System which is a hybrid system of a Solar Thermal Water Heater and a Heat Pump Water Heater is combined. In optimization of these configuration, it is necessary to consider the optimization of multiple objectives such as cost and energy efficiency. However, it is difficult to satisfy these objectives simultaneously since these are trade-offs. In this paper, we conducted to find pareto optimal solutions by Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization which is a kind of an evolutionary computing. To facilitate the solution search within the constraints conditions, we gave a flag to the excess and run-out of the heat storage amount. Thereby, we could find quasi-optimal solutions according to each objective, and conducted a search twice for solutions by Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization with fixed configuration to find better solutions with respect to operation. As a result, the evaluation values of all objective functions are improved.	evolutionary computation;hybrid system;mathematical optimization;offset binary;page view;pareto efficiency;particle swarm optimization;power supply;program optimization	Yusuke Yoshida;Yuzuru Ueda	2016	2016 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)	10.1109/ISGT.2016.7781227	control engineering;mathematical optimization;engineering;control theory	EDA	17.261371304577843	-3.821770245548142	136296

The evacuee agents travel from a source to a destination taking the dynamic shortest time path (total travel time depends on the distance to destination and the congestion level). Throttling involves closing a road segment temporarily when its congestion level reaches an upper threshold and opening it when congestion level falls below a lower threshold. Experimentation was performed by comparing the total evacuation time obtained with throttling to a base case (non-throttling) using a small test network and the more realistic Sioux Falls network. We found that throttling improves the total evacuation time significantly. To further test the effectiveness of our control strategy we compared it to contraflow on the test network and found the results to be comparable.	agent-based model;closing (morphology);control theory;network congestion;recursion	Manini Madireddy;Deborah J.

We then show how the resulting collection of diversified solutions can be further diversified by means of permutation mappings, which equally can be used to generate diversified collections of permutations for applications such as scheduling and routing. These methods can be applied to non-binary vectors by the use of binarization procedures and by Diversification-Based Learning (DBL) procedures which also provide connections to applications in clustering and machine learning.

e94342a70e55621053906fd398dec35ad56d27dc	are the artificially generated instances uniform in terms of difficulty?		In the field of evolutionary computation, it is usual to generate artificial benchmarks of instances that are used as a test-bed to determine the performance of the algorithms at hand. In this context, a recent work on permutation problems analyzed the implications of generating instances uniformly at random (u.a.r.) when building those benchmarks. Particularly, the authors analyzed instances as rankings of the solutions of the search space sorted according to their objective function value. Thus, two instances are considered equivalent when their objective functions induce the same ranking over the search space. Based on the analysis, they suggested that, when some restrictions hold, the probability to create easy rankings is higher than creating difficult ones. In this paper, we continue on that research line by adopting the framework of local search algorithms with the best improvement criterion. Particularly, we empirically analyze, in terms of difficulty, the instances (rankings) created u.a.r. of three popular problems: Linear Ordering Problem, Quadratic Assignment Problem and Flowshop Scheduling Problem. As the neighborhood system is critical for the performance of local search algorithms three different neighborhood systems have been considered: swap, interchange and insert. Conducted experiments reveal that (1) by sampling the parameters uniformly at random we obtain instances with a non-uniform distribution in terms of difficulty, (2) the distribution of the difficulty strongly depends on the pair problem-neighborhood considered, and (3) given a problem, the distribution of the difficulty seems to depend on the smoothness of the landscape induced by the neighborhood and on its size.	benchmark (computing);c object processor;evolutionary computation;experiment;heuristic;local search (optimization);loss function;monte carlo method;optimization problem;paging;procedural generation;quadratic assignment problem;randomness;sampling (signal processing);scheduling (computing);search algorithm;testbed	Aritz Pérez Martínez;Josu Ceberio;Jose A.

The approach relies on an optimization tool, which combines evolution strategies and simulated annealing algorithms in finding the global optimum solution. The optimization variables include membership function parameters and rule numbers which are combined with genetic parameters to create diversity in the search space due to self-adaptation. The optimization technique is independent of the topology under consideration and capable of handling any type of membership function. The algorithmic details of the optimization methodology are discussed in detail, and the generality of the approach is illustrated by different examples.	algorithm;artificial neural network;evolution strategy;fuzzy control system;global optimization;mathematical optimization;simulated annealing	Guner Alpaydin;Günhan Dündar;Sina Balkir	2002	IEEE Trans.

Specifically, two evolutionary algorithms - Population Based Incremental Learning (PBIL), which is an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA), and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been applied to the problem of finding effective chemotherapeutic treatments. To our knowledge, EDAs have been applied to fewer real world problems compared to GAs, and the aim of the present paper is to expand the application domain of this technique.We compare and analyse the performance of both algorithms and draw a conclusion as to which approach to cancer chemotherapy optimisation is more efficient and helpful in the decision-making activity led by the oncologists.	application domain;estimation of distribution algorithm;evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;heuristic;mathematical optimization;population-based incremental learning	Andrei Petrovski;Siddhartha Shakya;John A.

a5d29363166bdccb29f24fadaa1c618aea53a500	region based memetic algorithm for real-parameter optimisation	real parameter optimisation;niching strategy;memetic algorithm	Memetic algorithms with an appropriate trade-off between the exploration and exploitation can obtain very good results in continuous optimisation. That implies the evolutionary algorithm should be focused in exploring the search space while the local search method exploits the achieved solutions. To tackle this issue, we propose to maintain a higher diversity in the evolutionary algorithm's population by including a niching strategy in the memetic algorithm framework. In this work, we design a novel niching strategy where the niches divide the search space into hypercubes of equal size called regions forbidding the presence of two solutions in each region. The objective is to avoid the competition between the local search and the evolutionary algorithm. We tested this niching strategy in a memetic algorithm with local search chaining and obtained significant improvements. The resulting model also appeared to be very competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms. One of the main issues when designing an evolutionary algorithm (EA) [3] for real-coded parameter optimisation problems is to offer a good exploration of the search space and, at the same time, to exploit the most promising regions to obtain high quality solutions. Memetic algorithms (MA) were proposed [34] to manage these competing objectives. They are a hybridisation between EA and local search (LS) algorithms, mixing in one model the exploration power of EA and the exploitative power of the LS. MAs are characterised by the combination of an exploration algorithm and a local improvement algorithm. MAs with an appropriate trade-off between the exploration and exploitation can obtain accurate solutions, improving the search [14,21]. Therefore, the key issue when designing a MA is to organise both efforts in the most cooperative way. Niching strategies have been used in EA to either identify various optima in a fitness landscape or to maintain a strong diversity in the EA's population [13]. In our study, we consider that using niching strategy to maintain a higher diversity in the population leads to a better separation of the effort between the EA and the LS. Thus, we design a niching strategy to limit the competition between the EA and the LS in a MA. The purpose of this method is to let the EA focus on the exploration task by limiting its exploitation power, this task being more efficiently performed by the LS method. Contrarily to most niching strategies where the niches are defined around the solutions of the population, the niches …	display resolution;evolutionary algorithm;exploit (computer security);least squares;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;memetic algorithm;memetics	Benjamin Lacroix;Daniel Molina;Francisco Herrera	2014	Inf.

6e7546187ab4b67f44464633514ac4e6a8471a0f	a generation-based optimal restart strategy for surrogate-assisted social learning particle swarm optimization		Abstract Evolutionary algorithm provides a powerful tool to the solution of modern complex engineering optimization problems. In general, a great deal of evaluation effort often requires to be made in evolutionary optimization to locate a reasonable optimum. This poses a serious challenge to extend its application to computationally expensive problems. To alleviate this difficulty, surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have drawn great attention over the past decades. However, in order to ensure the performance of SAEAs, the use of appropriate model management is indispensable. This paper proposes a generation-based optimal restart strategy for a surrogate-assisted social learning particle swarm optimization (SL-PSO). In the proposed method, the SL-PSO restarts every few generations in the global radial-basis-function model landscape, and the best sample points archived in the database are employed to reinitialize the swarm at each restart. Promising individual with the best estimated fitness value is chosen for exact evaluation before each restart of the SL-PSO. The proposed method skillfully integrates the restart strategy, generation-based and individual-based model managements into a whole, whilst those three ingredients coordinate with each other, thus offering a powerful optimizer for the computationally expensive problems. To assess the performance of the proposed method, comprehensive experiments are conducted on a benchmark test suit of dimensions ranging from 10 to 100. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method shows superior performance in comparison with four state-of-the-art algorithms in a majority of benchmarks when only a limited computational budget is available.

f4679b4054cda53f7be417511ccec0896635b4fd	shape-based visual analysis of solutions for multiobjective optimization problems		In general, Multiobjective Optimization Problems (MOPs) with conflicting objectives requires a Decision Maker to select a solution from a set of alternatives in the Pareto Front. A visual approach is a valuable alternative to analyze the several options that may exist. Thus, to support the visual analysis, this work proposes to combine a clustering method based on the shape of the solutions together with the parallel coordinate graph. The shape of a solution is defined as the positions of the ordered values of the normalized objectives that correspond to a solution. The method proposed in this work, allows exploring groups of solutions with similar shapes, to generate visual summaries with a high degree of representativeness, and to calculate statistical data of the groups and to identify the solutions. Also, this paper presents a software tool called Tava. This tool was developed to perform the visual analysis interactively.	cluster analysis;interactivity;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;program optimization;programming tool	Christian von Lücken;Abrahan D.

Specifically, we present m-A*, extending the well-known A* to them-best task, and prove that all its desirable properties, including soundness, completen ess and optimal efficiency, are maintained. Since Best-First al gorithms have memory problems, we also extend the memoryefficient Depth-First Branch-and-Bound to the m-best task. We extend both algorithms to optimization tasks over graphical models (e.g., Weighted CSP and MPE in Bayesian networks), provide complexity analysis and an empirical evaluation. Our experiments with 5 variants of Best-First and Branch-and-Bound confirm that Best-First is largely superi or when memory is available, but Branch-and-Bound is more robust, while both styles of search benefit greatly when the heuristic evaluation function has increased accuracy.	a* search algorithm;analysis of algorithms;bayesian network;branch and bound;combinatorial optimization;communicating sequential processes;constraint satisfaction problem;evaluation function;experiment;graphical model;hp multi-programming executive;heuristic evaluation;mathematical optimization;whole earth 'lectronic link	Rina Dechter;Natalia Flerova;Radu Marinescu	2012			beam search;mathematical optimization;heuristic;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;incremental heuristic search;graphical model;statistics	AI	22.75495180997487	4.094205943053143	137150

Among these applications are studies of natural evolution in the emerging eld of articial life, which place special demands on the genetic algorithm. In this paper, we characterize the di erence between panmictic and local selection/mating schemes in terms of diversity of alleles, diversity of genotypes, the inbreeding coe cient, and the speed and robustness of the genetic algorithm. Based on these metrics, local mating appears to not only be superior to panmictic for arti cial evolutionary simulations, but also for more traditional applications of genetic algorithms.

A generic and flexible scheduling optimisation methodology is developed to identify, represent, model, solve and analyse the coal transport problem in a standard and convenient way. As a result, the integrated train-stockpile-ship timetable is created and optimised for improving overall efficiency of coal transport system. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis based on extensive computational experiments is conducted to validate the proposed methodology. The mathematical proposition and proof are concluded as technical and insightful advices for industry practice. The proposed methodology provides better decision making on how to assign rail rolling-stocks and upgrade infrastructure in order to significantly improve capacity utilisation with the best resource-effectiveness ratio. The proposed decision support system with train-stockpile-ship scheduling optimisation techniques is promising to be applied in railway or mining industry, especially as a useful quantitative decision making tool on how to use more current rolling-stocks or whether to buy additional rolling-stocks for mining transportation.	decision support system;experiment;mathematical optimization;schedule;scheduling (computing);transportation theory (mathematics)	Erhan Kozan;Shi Qiang Liu	2012	Decision Support Systems	10.1016/j.dss.2012.08.012	decision support system;computer science;artificial intelligence;operations management;data mining	ML	11.67418901252193	1.1311917323086689	137270

The method consists of two major processes; selection process and optimization process. The system optimizes the following factors of procurement logistics: The number of trucks, the suppliers’ depots each of the trucks picks up goods, and their order in which the truck travels. We conducted a case study for an existing Japanese e-commerce company, and demonstrated the effectiveness of the optimization system.	logistics;procurement;program optimization	Toshiaki Kurihara;Kenji Tanaka;Kazuki Maeda	2012		10.1007/978-1-4471-4426-7_6	systems engineering;environmental resource management;commerce	Robotics	11.209815010038087	-2.6135393707578185	137593

The Crossing Waypoints Location Problem (CWLP) plays a crucial role in the design of an ARN. This paper investigates this problem in the context of designing the national ARN of China. Instead of adopting the single-objective formulation established in previous research, we propose to formulate CWLP as a bi-objective optimization problem. An algorithm named Memetic Algorithm with Pull–Push operator (MAPP) is proposed to tackle it. MAPP employs the Pull–Push operator, which is specifically designed for CWLP, for local search and the Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer for global search. Empirical studies using real data of the current national ARN of China showed that MAPP outperformed an existing approach to CWLP as well as three well-known Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). Moreover, MAPP not only managed to reduce the cost of the current ARN, but also improved the airspace safety. Hence, it has been implemented as a module in the software that is currently used for ARN planning in China. The data used in our experimental studies have been made available online and can be used as a benchmark problem for research on both ARN design and evolutionary multi-objective optimization. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the conjoint analysis methods suffer from evaluation fatigue. An interactive evolutionary computation (IEC) framework for product design has been thus proposed in this paper. The prediction module taking care of evaluation fatigue is the main part of this framework. In addition, since the evaluation function of product design is an additive utility function, designing operators which heavily utilizes the prediction results becomes possible. The on-chance operator is thus defined in this paper as well. The experimental results indicated the on-chance operator can speed up IEC and improve the quality of solution at the same time.	interactive evolutionary computation	Leuo-hong Wang;Meng-yuan Song;Chao-Fu Hong	2006		10.1007/11732242_54	interactive evolutionary computation;computer science;artificial intelligence;evolutionary algorithm;evaluation function;conjoint analysis;mathematics;product design;utility;algorithm;new product development	Theory	16.56953567460407	-6.792796020862582	137747

This is because they are lacking in intelligence such as to automatically make rescheduling plans. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for automatic train rescheduling. Firstly, we propose to use passengers' dissatisfaction as a criterion of rescheduling plans and to regard the train rescheduling problem as a constraint optimization problem in which dissatisfaction of passengers should be minimized. Then we introduce an algorithm for train rescheduling designed as a combination of PERT and meta-heuristics. We also show some experimental results of the algorithm using actual train schedule data.	algorithm;constrained optimization;fuzzy set operations;heuristic (computer science);loss of significance;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;program evaluation and review technique;simulated annealing	Norio Tomii;Tashiro Yoshiaki;Noriyuki Tanabe;Hirai Chikara;Muraki Kunimitsu	2005		10.1007/11504894_113	constrained optimization;program evaluation and review technique;computer science;artificial intelligence;operations research;expert system	AI	16.10927412034503	-6.424644265530311	137857

Determining how to integrate these decisions effectively to pursue a productive and lower cost system has become an important issue. This paper focuses on providing an effective solution to integrate the decisions of cell formation and parts scheduling, while considering intercell moves by using a Lagrangian relaxation decomposition method. A mixed integer nonlinear programming mathematical model (CFPSP) is proposed to determine which part families and machine groups are assigned to cells and in which sequence the parts are processed in the machines to minimize the total tardiness penalty cost. To effectively solve the model, a Lagrangian relaxation decomposition method with a heuristic (LRDH) is developed. Using the LRDH, the CFPSP model is solved by decomposing the model into two subproblems, i.e., the cell formation subproblem (CFPSP-FD) and the parts scheduling subproblem (CFPSP-SD). After linearizing the CFPSP-FD model, the subproblem CFPSP-FD is solved by the MIP optimizer CPLEX. A scatter search approach is developed to solve the subproblem CFPSP-SD. Combined with the Lagrange multipliers, the CFPSP-SD model takes into consideration the assignment of part families and the associated machine groups to each cell, when it sequences the processing of the parts on each machine in cells. An illustration of the application of the CFPSP model in an electronic appliance cellular manufacturing enterprise in China is presented.	algorithm;cplex;cell signaling;computation;decision problem;heuristic;integer programming;lagrange multiplier;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;programming model;quadratic programming;relaxation (approximation);scheduling (computing);secure digital;simulation	Jiafu Tang;Chongjun Yan;Xiaoqing Wang;Chengkuan Zeng	2014	IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/TASE.2014.2325860	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics	Robotics	14.750158291163466	3.165093799548448	138391

In this paper, the operation of such a service is simulated for a generic grid network in order to determine the impact of different relocation strategies for idle vehicles on passenger waiting time, empty mileage and parking needs. The tested strategies consist of remaining idle at the latest drop-off location, returning to the initial position, relocating to a random location, relocating according to anticipated demand or relocating to a zone with a low vehicle supply. For the simulated case study, remaining idle outperformed the other relocation strategies in terms of service efficiency and service effectiveness, while the strategy of evenly or randomly dispersing vehicles over the network lead to largest reduction of the number of parked vehicles per link, and the strategy of anticipating demand to largest reduction of deadheading mileages.	grid network;randomness;relocation (computing);terms of service	Konstanze Winter;Oded Cats;Bart van Arem;Karel Martens	2017	2017 5th IEEE International Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (MT-ITS)	10.1109/MTITS.2017.8005630	public transport;automation;externality;relocation;idle;terms of service;transport engineering;grid network;engineering	Robotics	12.964011961409318	0.5550892059639023	138469

In our previous unpublished work, we developed four uncertainty-wise test case minimization strategies relying on Uncertainty Theory and multi-objective search (NSGA-II with default settings), which were evaluated with one real Cyber-Physical System (CPS) with inherent uncertainty. However, a fundamental question to answer is whether these default settings of NSGA-II are good enough to provide optimized solutions. In this direction, we report one of the preliminary empirical evaluations, where we performed an experiment with three different mutation operators and three crossover operators, i.e., in total nine combinations with NSGA-II for the four uncertainty-wise test case minimization strategies using a real CPS case study. Results show that the Blend Alpha crossover operator together with the polynomial mutation operator permits NSGA-II achieving the best performance for solving our uncertainty-wise test minimization problems.	cyber-physical system;dec alpha;multi-objective optimization;polynomial;principle of good enough;test case;uncertainty theory	Shaukat Ali;Yan Li;Tao Yue;Man Zhang	2017	2017 IEEE/ACM 10th International Workshop on Search-Based Software Testing (SBST)	10.1109/SBST.2017.9	uncertainty theory;measurement uncertainty;operator (computer programming);minification;test case;cyber-physical system;crossover;mathematical optimization;polynomial;mathematics	SE	22.246531629313218	-3.529601901492845	138573

The uncertainty in processing times is represented by means of fuzzy numbers, hence the name fuzzy flexible job-shop scheduling. We propose an effective genetic algorithm hybridised with tabu search and heuristic seeding to minimise the total time needed to complete all jobs, known as makespan. To build a high-quality and diverse set of initial solutions we introduce a heuristic method which benefits from the flexible nature of the problem. This initial population will be the starting point for the genetic algorithm, which then applies tabu search to every generated chromosome. The tabu search algorithm relies on a neighbourhood structure that is proposed and analysed in this paper; in particular, some interesting properties are proved, such as feasibility and connectivity. Additionally, we incorporate a filtering mechanism to reduce the neighbourhood size and a method that allows to speed-up the evaluation of new chromosomes. To assess the performance of the resulting method and compare it with the state-of-the-art, we present an extensive computational study on a benchmark with 205 instances, considering both deterministic and fuzzy instances to enhance the significance of the study. The results of these experiments clearly show that not only does the hybrid algorithm benefit from the synergy among its components but it is also quite competitive with the state-of-the-art when solving both crisp and fuzzy instances, providing new best-known solutions for a number of these test	benchmark (computing);computation;experiment;fuzzy number;genetic algorithm;heuristic;hybrid algorithm;local consistency;makespan;neighbourhood (graph theory);scheduling (computing);search algorithm;severo ornstein;software propagation;software release life cycle;synergy;tabu search	Juan José Palacios;Miguel Angel González;Camino R.

Fast A.G.V.’s, with obstacle avoidance capability, can maneuver theniselves among distant manufacturing lines carrying components to each of them. The expensive long and slow conveyor belts are not necessary anymore. Further more. the wireless integration of A.G.V.’s to the global industrial network makes them programmable from any terminal controller at any time. This feature gives a great flexibility to the whole automation to manufacture different products, in the future, without the necessity of new machinery reallocation and, therefore, lower cost.	automation;can bus;obstacle avoidance	Valentinos K.

In order to analyze the performance of an evolutionary algorithm according to this benchmark, one needs to be able to change the current problem in a controlled manner. Several methods have been proposed to achieve this goal. In this paper, we briefly outline the proposed methods, discuss their shortcomings and propose a new method that can generate changes for a given severity level more reliably. We then present the experimental setup and results for the new method and compare it with existing methods. The current results are promising and promote further study.	knapsack problem	A.

Specifically, through introducing new decision variables associated with the number of passengers distributed in each train over each OD pair and formulating the connection constraints between the train stop plan and passenger distributions, the total travel time of all the trains is firstly adopted as the objective function to optimize the train stop plan and timetable with the passenger demands being guaranteed. Then, based on the generated train stop plan and timetable, the passenger distribution plan is further optimized with the purpose of minimizing the total travel time of all the passengers. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches are verified by the obtained train stop plans, timetables and passenger distribution plans for a sample railway corridor and Wuhan–Guangzhou high-speed railway corridor. The computational results showed that the proposed methods can effectively obtain the train stop plan, timetable and passenger distribution plan at the same time.	mathematical optimization;scheduling (computing)	Jianguo Qi;Shukai Li;Yuan Gao;Kai Yang;Pei Liu	2018	JORS	10.1057/s41274-017-0248-x	operations management;train;scheduling (computing);computer science;simulation;schedule;optimization problem	AI	14.324478353238144	1.614893186930855	139114

01936ba6c4dc29cf1da57baa45f9082bf6e4487e	modélisation et optimisation pour le graphicage des lignes de bus. (models and optimisation for bus network timetabling)		This thesis was realized within a collaboration between the university of Angers and the company Perinfo. It deals with the development of new models and algorithms dedicated to bus network timetabling. This manuscript is built around the notion of quality of service. We start by establishing a literature review of the steps of the network planning process. We then propose a model and evaluation functions for the headway evenness and transfer synchronization objectives. Those elements are used inside a local search method based on a set of neighborhoods that we tailor for the problem. Our third contribution is a model for an original and integrated problem which solves simultaneously the timetabling and the vehicle assignment problems. To tackle this complex problem, we propose a hybrid solution method based on an iterated local search procedure and an exact auction algorithm, as well as two speci c neighborhoods. The computational results obtained on a real case study show the superiority of the simultaneous approach compared to the existing solution and to the sequential approach, with respect to quality of service and to the economic costs. Finally, we address an original problem which works backwards given the traditional planning process. This timetabling problem, aiming for better transfer possibilities, is constrained by the sequences of line runs assigned to vehicles and drivers. This approach enables a quality of service improvement without making the resources schedules obsolete. A tabu search method based on two speci c neighborhood mechanisms is developed and assessed on a case study.		Valérie Guihaire	2009				AI	15.401645635938467	1.798699071606324	139521
4358bf5510ce680c151df38066c91d4c6a6c998e	a parameterless decomposition-based evolutionary multi-objective algorithm		Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition has made a great contribution to the field of evolutionary multiobjective optimization problem. The decomposition-based algorithms construct a number of scalar optimization subproblems by using a set of weight vectors, and optimize these subproblems simultaneously to approximate the Pareto front (PF). The weight vectors have a massive influence on the performance of the decomposition-based algorithm, especially for the multiobjective optimization problems (MOP) with a complex PF. To solve this, we propose a parameterless decomposition scheme to adjust the weight vectors automatically. Experiment results indicate that the proposed algorithm can obtain better uniformity solutions for the MOP with complex PF.	approximation algorithm;circuit complexity;evolutionary algorithm;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;qr decomposition;weight function	Fangqing Gu;Yiu-ming Cheung;Hai-Lin Liu;Zixian Lin	2018	2018 Tenth International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)	10.1109/ICACI.2018.8377572	evolutionary computation;scalar (physics);approximation algorithm;multi-objective optimization;evolutionary algorithm;algorithm	DB	24.36933963436075	-3.2274345241739293	140013

These leftovers consist of many different types, materials, styles and sizes so the use of such materials is difficult to manage, resulting in a significant material management problem for manufacturers. This study examines ways to use these leftovers and proposes the application of a genetic algorithm to handle the problem of matching usable leftovers to incoming orders. In order to verify the feasibility of the solution, a decision support system was implemented, based on a genetic algorithm. With lots of experimental results, we conclude this method is thus of considerable value to the managers of manufacturing factories.	decision support system;genetic algorithm	Hsin-Pin Fu;Cheng-Yuan Ku;Tsung-Sheng Chang	2016	Int.

This problem is computationally challenging because, when the goal is to minimize the size of the blackout, it combines a routing and a power restoration component, both of which are difficult on their own. The joint repair/restoration problem has been successfully approached with a 3-stage decomposition, whose last step is a multiple-vehicle, pickup-and-delivery routing problem with precedence and capacity constraints whose goal is to minimize the sum of the delivery times (PDRPPCCDT). Experimental results have shown that the PDRPPCCDT is a bottleneck and this paper proposes a Randomized Adaptive Vehicle Decomposition (RAVD) to scale to very large power outages. The RAVD approach is shown to produce significant computational benefits and provide high-quality results for infrastructures with more than 24000 components and 1200 damaged items, giving rise to PDRPPCCDT with more than 2500 visits.	circuit restoration;computation;decision support system;logarithmic number system;randomized algorithm;routing	Ben Simon;Carleton Coffrin;Pascal Van Hentenryck	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-29828-8_25	mathematical optimization;simulation;operations research	Robotics	13.094267333543167	1.7047580986109883	140182
f9edd345eb5b9f48e3d9f101c53b153b5d59586a	competitive liner shipping network design		We present a solution method for the liner shipping network design problem which is a core strategic planning problem faced by container carriers. We propose the first practical algorithm which explicitly handles transshipment time limits for all demands. Individual sailing speeds at each service leg are used to balance sailings speed against operational costs, hence ensuring that the found network is competitive on both transit time and cost. We present a matheuristic for the problem where a MIP is used to select which ports should be inserted or removed on a route. Computational results are presented showing very promising results for realistic global liner shipping networks. Due to a number of algorithmic enhancements, the obtained solutions can be found within the same time frame as used by previous algorithms not handling time constraints. Furthermore we present a sensitivity analysis on fluctuations in bunker price which confirms the applicability of the algorithm.	algorithm;computation;network planning and design	Christian Vad Karsten;Berit D.

Other techniques primarily solve for full network connectivity, with energy efficiency as a secondary objective. Our technique makes no assumptions about the desired balance between connectivity and energy efficiency. Instead, it produces a range of solutions for the decision-maker to select from. It uses NSGA-II for the primary GA, with a secondary GA periodically adding waypoints for greater connectivity. We introduce the Dual-GA and analyse its performance compared to other algorithms.

3bf52d8cfdd936aeda28f57c0ac7dd8b8e4dab4f	a variable neighborhood search approach for the capacitated m-ring-star problem		In this paper, we proposed an algorithm based on variable neighborhood search (VNS) for the capacitated m-Ring-Star problem. This problem has several real applications in communications networks, rapid transit system planning and optical fiber networks. The problem consists in design m rings or cycles that begins of a central depot and visits a set of customers and transition or steiner nodes. While the nodes don’t belong to a ring these must be allocated or assign to a customer or steiner node that belongs to a ring. The number of customers allocated or visited in each ring must not exceed the maximum capacity. The goal is to minimize the visiting and allocation cost. For solving the problem, we propose a VNS approach based on random perturbation for escaping from the local optimal solutions. Our method reached the optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time in a set of instances from the literature.	variable neighborhood search	Carlos Alberto Franco-Franco;Eduyn López-Santana;Germán Méndez-Giraldo	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-42291-6_1	artificial intelligence;computer science;mathematical optimization;machine learning;combinatorial optimization;variable neighborhood search;business system planning;network planning and design;depot	Vision	16.7306063973895	3.162729393719432	140547

We firstly formulate the widely occurring configuration problems as discrete optimization problems. More interestingly, we propose two intelligent optimizers: a simple-yet-powerful beam search method and a min-conflict heuristic-based micro-genetic algorithm (MGA) to solve this real-life optimization problem. We built a Web-based personal computer configuration advisor to integrate each of the two optimizers as an individual component to configure PCs for general users. In our empirical evaluation, the heuristic-based MGA consistently outperformed the beam search method in most cases. Furthermore, our work opens up numerous exciting directions for future investigation.	heuristic;personal computer	Vincent W. L.

The proposed technique has 2m+1 point estimate method (PEM) to trap the uncertainty associated with the expected error of the loads. The objectives are minimization of the total active power losses which diminish the voltage deviation of the buses. Other than that, a new optimization algorithm based on the bat algorithm (BA) is presented to search the problem space globally. Also, the idea of interactive fuzzy satisfying method is applied in the multiobjective formulation to provide a proper balance between the optimization of the objective functions. In the end, the proposed method is tested on the 69-bus IEEE distribution system to validate its feasibility and effective performance.	bat algorithm;business architecture;dependability;fuzzy concept;load profile;mathematical optimization;problem domain;simulation	Mohammad-Reza Akbari-Zadeh;Reza Kokabi;Shahin Gerami	2014	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-131027	mathematical optimization;control theory	Robotics	17.196172295914227	-4.032117662816591	140650
5fe21f10af70684e74fa63d2ca81d9c4e1ac03c7	the importance of automatic timetabling for a railway infrastructure company		The DB Netz AG is the most important railway infrastructure company in Germany and operates a railway network with a total length of about 34,000 km. One of the main tasks is to generate timetables to sell train-paths or enhance the infrastructure by eliminating bottlenecks. The creation of a timetable for the complete network is complex and time-consuming so there are efforts to atomize this process in essential parts. The software-system TAKT of the professorship “Verkehrsstroemungslehre” at the TU Dresden automatically generates timetables for complex railway networks on the base of periodic event scheduling problems (PESP) by using specialized algorithms. It provides practically useful solutions in appropriate runtimes because of its up to date techniques like a SAT-solver and an innovative routing-algorithm, which finds a well-suited train-path in the network automatically. To calculate a timetable for the whole Eastern German long-distance, regional and local traffic the solver needs a computation time of only few hours. In summary with the use of TAKT at DB Netz timetables for passenger and freight traffic can be generated automatically with a great quality in a very short time.	timeline	Daniel Poehle;Werner Weigand	2012		10.1007/978-3-319-00795-3_73	operations research	NLP	14.612284162635039	1.2154713936264054	140691

Product-development cost, lead time, and reliability are very critical elements in addition to functional features. However, it becomes increasingly challenging to obtain an optimal decision with respect to these multiple criteria as the number of involved entities increases in modern product developments. There is a clear need for planning tools to support effective decision making in this domain. The availability of efficient and accurate multiobjective optimization (MOO) algorithms becomes critical in such a decision support tool. This paper poses the product development as a multiobjective assignment problem in the context of printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) industry. We describe a new class of MOO algorithm based on the principles of differential evolution (DE). The multiobjective DE (MODE) algorithm is shown to approach Pareto-optimal solutions in a wide class of problems with better performance than the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II from the literature, providing a practical tool for product-development decision support. A decision support system based on the object-oriented design methodology is described in this paper with the MODE as the core search engine. Experimental study of this decision support system is conducted using two real-world PCBA designs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed MODE algorithm and some use cases of such decision support system on facilitating decision makers' tradeoff analysis.	assignment problem;benchmark (computing);data structure;decision support system;decision theory;design for manufacturability;dhrystone;differential evolution;entity;functional design;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;new product development;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;penalty method;printed circuit board;printing;sorting;web search engine	Feng Xue;Arthur C.

Through study of the complex network, scale-free networks have been found in various fields. In recent years, it has been proposed that a scale-free property be applied to some optimization problems. We investigate if the new selection method is an effective selection method to apply to genetic programming. Our experimental results on three benchmark problems show that performance of the scale-free selection model is similar to the usual selection methods in spite of different optimizations and may be able to resolve the bloating problem in genetic programming. Further, we show that the optimization problem is relevant to complex network study.	benchmark (computing);complex network;futures studies;genetic programming;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;selection (genetic algorithm);selection rule	Hitoshi Araseki	2012	The 6th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems, and The 13th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligence Systems	10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2012.6505204	mathematical optimization;computer science;machine learning;data mining	Embedded	22.810891975993847	-7.63567027726708	140914

a54ac23019aa8fe30dad6cd7867f8f0f7e07b2e3	genetic local search algorithm for a new bi-objective arc routing problem with profit collection and dispersion of vehicles		We present a new bi-objective arc routing problem in which routes must be constructed in order to maximize collected profit and a non linear dispersion metric. A dispersion metric calculated based on instantaneous positions, suitable to capture routing characteristics found when vehicles have to travel in hostile environments, is a novelty in the routing literature. The inherent combinatorial nature of this problem makes it difficult to solve using exact methods. We propose a Multi-objective Genetic Local Search Algorithm to solve the problem and compare the results with those obtained by a well known multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Computational experiments were performed on a new set of benchmark instances, and the results evidence that local search plays an important role in providing good approximation sets. The proposed method can be adapted to other multi-objective problems in which the exploitation provided by local search may improve the evolutionary procedures usually adopted.	approximation;arc routing;benchmark (computing);computation;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;genetic algorithm;interdependence;iterated function;iterated local search;local search (constraint satisfaction);local search (optimization);nonlinear system;population;powera;search algorithm;tree traversal;variable neighborhood search;whole earth 'lectronic link	Guilherme Dhein;Olinto César Bassi de Araújo;Ghendy Cardoso	2018	Expert Syst.

First, a functional analysis was performed to present kanban flows in exactly the same fashion in a simulation model as they actually appear in a real manufacturing system. One shipping area module, the required number of parts store modules, and one supplier center module were used to develop a designated simulation. Proposed modules have focused dialogs, animation, and modeling functionality. In addition, a procedure to obtain the necessity minimum number of kanbans to achieve no stock-out events is proposed. Then, a numerical example is shown to apply the proposed procedure.	kanban (development);multistage amplifier;numerical analysis;simulation;type system	Kanna Miwa;Junichi Nomura;Soemon Takakuwa	2016	2016 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)		simulation;systems engineering;engineering;mathematical model;mathematics;engineering drawing;statistics	Robotics	10.348891652327971	3.5000173787306617	141369

Various algorithms have been proposed to tackle this challenging  problem, but the use of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) to it is rare. This chapter aims at investigating the  behavior and performances of uni-variate EDAs mixed with different kernel probability densities via fitness landscape analysis.  Based on the analysis, a self-adaptive uni-variate EDA with mixed kernels (MUEDA) is proposed. To assess the effectiveness  and efficiency of MUEDA, function optimization tasks with dimension scaling from 30 to 1500 are adopted. Compared to the recently  published LSGO algorithms, MUEDA shows excellent convergence speed, final solution quality and dimensional scalability.  	estimation of distribution algorithm;global optimization;program optimization	Yu Wang;Bin Li	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-00267-0_6	mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;combinatorics;meta-optimization;estimation of distribution algorithm;fitness approximation;random optimization;statistics;global optimization	HPC	24.166242431412144	-5.227289919543863	141376

Multi-objectivization reformulates the single objective problem into a multiple objective problem. The reformulated problem is then solved with a multiple objective method to obtain a resulting solution to the original problem. Multi-objectivization Via Decomposition (MVD) and the addition of novel objectives are the two major approaches used in multi-objectivization. This paper focuses on analysis of two major MVD methods: helper-objectives and complete decomposition. Helperobjectives decomposition methods identify one or more decomposed objectives that are used simultaneously with the main objective to focus attention on components of the decomposed objectives. Complete decomposition, unlike helper-objectives does not explicitly use the main objective and instead uses decomposed objectives that exhaustively cover all portions of the main objective. This work examines the relationship between helper-objective decompositions and complete decomposition using both an analytic and experimental methodology. Pareto dominance relationships are examined analytically to clarify the relationship between dominant solutions in both types of decompositions. These results more clearly characterize how solutions from the two approaches rank in Paretofrontier based fitness algorithms such as NSGA-II. An empirical study on Job Shop Scheduling Problems shows how fitness signal and fitness noise are affected by the balance of decomposition size. Additionally we provide evidence that, for the settings and instances studied, complete decompositions have a better on-average performance when compared to analogous	algorithm;best, worst and average case;job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;objective-c;pareto efficiency;scheduling (computing)	Darrell F.

The approach is based on Genetic Algorithms (GA), with new crossover operators especially designed for these purposes. The new operators use local homology between parental strings to preserve building blocks found by the algorithm. The approach exploits the subbasin-portal architecture of the fitness functions suitable for this kind of evolutionary modeling. This architecture is significant for Royal Road class fitness functions. Two real-life Systems Biology problems with such fitness functions are implemented here: evolution of the bacterial promoter rrnPl and of the enhancer of the Drosophila even-skipped gene.

Despite their advantages, they have a relatively limited cruising range in comparison to traditional diesel/petrol vehicles, and require significant battery charging time. We propose to model the facility location problem of the placement of charging stations in road networks as a multiple domination problem on reachability graphs. This model takes into consideration natural assumptions such as a threshold for remaining battery load, and provides some minimal choice for a travel direction to recharge the battery. Experimental evaluation and simulations for the proposed facility location model are presented in the case of real road networks corresponding to the cities of Boston and Dublin.	battery charger;decision problem;degree (graph theory);diesel;directed graph;dominating set;facility location problem;mathematical model;order of approximation;planar graph;reachability;rechargeable battery;simulation	Padraig Corcoran;Andrei V.

21253bce51188bb3c00eed7d34ada1ef960691c0	optimizing home hospital health service delivery in norway using a combined geographical information system, agent based, discrete event simulation model		Home hospital services; provide some hospital level services at the patient's residence. The services include for example: palliative care, administering chemotherapy drugs, changing dressings and care for newborns. The rationale of the service is that by providing high quality care to patients at their homes their experience of the care is better and hence they respond to the treatment and/or recover quicker and are less likely to need to report to hospital to receive care for more serious/expensive conditions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the home hospital service, to optimize the current configuration given existing constraints and to evaluate potential future scenarios. Using a combined discrete event simulation, agent based model and geographical information system we assess the system effects of different demand patterns, appointment scheduling algorithms (e.g. travelling salesman problem), varying levels of resource on patient outcomes and impact on hospital visits.	agent-based model;algorithm;design rationale;display resolution;geographic information system;itil;optimizing compiler;scheduling (computing);simulation;travelling salesman problem	Joe Viana;Vigdis Margrethe Ziener;Marita Sommer Holhjem;Irene Gynnild Ponton;Lisa Johanne Thogersen;Tone Breines Simonsen	2017	2017 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)	10.1109/WSC.2017.8247905	operations management;systems engineering;discrete event simulation;agent-based model;computer science;residence;service delivery framework;travelling salesman problem;scheduling (computing);demand patterns;information system	HCI	12.600376529194111	-1.4496587313035842	141600

Since such problems are in general NP?complete, effective heuristic approaches are of interest, and SA is one of them. The idea of SA has its origin in discrete event simulation of alternative call routing in telecommunication networks. We describe an implementation of SA and illustrate its effectiveness by means of numerical examples including multiple knapsack problem and network design. Numerical experiments indicate that SA is capable of bypassing local minima of the problem objective function, and allows for achieving reasonable solutions in a reasonable time.

4b0004e5be6abecc24c911a48f6583f33563bb2f	improving emergency medical dispatching with emphasis on mass-casualty incidents		Dispatching ambulances is a demanding and stressful task for dispatchers. This is especially true in case of mass-casualty incidents. Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate if and to what extent the dispatch operation of the Red Cross Salzburg can be optimized on such occasions with a computerized system. The basic problem of a dynamic multi-vehicle Dial-a-Ride Problem with time windows was enhanced according to the requirements of the Red Cross Salzburg. The general objective was to minimize the total mileage covered by ambulances and the waiting time of patients. Furthermore, in case of emergencies suitable adaptions to a plan should be carried out automatically. Consequently, the problem is solved by using the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search. Evaluation results indicate that the system outperforms a human dispatcher by between 2.5% and 36% within 1 minute of runtime concerning total costs. Moreover, the system's response time in case that a plan has to be updated is less than 1 minute on average.	ambulances;dynamic dispatch;emergencies [disease/finding];keystroke-level model;microsoft windows;numerous;patients;pure red-cell aplasia;red cross;requirement;response time (technology)	Gabriel Kleinoscheg;Harald Burgsteiner;Martin Bernroider;Günter Kiechle;Maria Obermayer	2014	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-397-1-108	total cost;health care rationing;mass-casualty incident;geographic information system;information system;medical emergency;medicine	AI	12.854479936565513	-1.1481930433411176	141856
f027d2f0faee4d50bf13aa06e476a4740556462f	evolutionary learning of fire fighting strategies		The dynamic problem of enclosing an expanding fire can be modelled by a simple discrete variant in a grid graph. While the fire expands to all neighbouring cells in any time step, the fire fighter is allowed to block c cells in the average outside the fire in the same time interval. It was shown that the success of the fire fighter is guaranteed for c > 1.5 but no strategy can enclose the fire for c ≤ 1.5. For achieving such a critical threshold the correctness (sometimes even optimality) of strategies and lower bounds have been shown by integer programming or by direct but often very sophisticated arguments. We investigate the problem whether it is possible to find or to approach such a threshold and/or optimal strategies by means of evolutionary algorithms, i.e., we just try to learn successful strategies for different constants c and have a look at the outcome. We investigate the variant of protecting a highway with still unknown threshold and found interesting strategic paradigms.	correctness (computer science);discrete mathematics;dynamic problem (algorithms);evolutionary algorithm;integer programming;lattice graph	Martin Kretschmer;Elmar Langetepe	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-78133-4_12	artificial intelligence;lattice graph;mathematical optimization;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;correctness;firefighting;dynamic problem;computer science;integer programming	AI	21.61431075926573	-1.5312134593697715	141858

This issue leads to complex process chains on the shop floor and the requirement to split single processes into multistage processes in hard-finishing operations. In both cases, the objective for the process planning is to achieve not only a local optimum for the individual processes but rather an overall optimum for the complete sequence. In order to reach the overall optimum, the process planner needs to integrate the effects between the processes into consideration. These effects which are referred to as cross-process interdependencies lead to balanced settings of process parameters and results in a much more effective operation of the sequence. In this paper, a novel approach dealing with the integration of cross-process interdependencies in the hard-finishing process of multistage grinding is introduced. It is based on an a-priori multicriteria dimensioning procedure which allows the integration of cross-process interdependencies and is implemented in software programmed in JAVA. A multistage plunge grinding process for crankshaft journals is used for evaluation of the results predicted by a developed software prototype.	interdependence	Berend Denkena;Helge Henning	2012	J.

In doing so, the WFG toolkit provides a set of problems that exhibit a variety of different characteristics. This paper presents a comparison between two state of the art MOEAs (NSGA-II and SPEA2) that exemplifies the unique capabilities of the WFG toolkit. By altering the control parameters or even the transformations that compose the WFG problems, we are able to explore the different types of problems where SPEA2 and NSGA-II each excel. Our results show that the performance of the two algorithms differ not only on the dimensionality of the problem, but also by properties such as the shape and size of the underlying Pareto surface. As such, the tunability of the WFG toolkit is key in allowing the easy exploration of these different features."""	evolutionary algorithm;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;pareto efficiency;wait-for graph	Lucas Bradstreet;Luigi Barone;R.

A good dispatching strategy for AGVs should be able to minimize the waiting or idle time of the quay cranes by assigning vehicles to loading or unloading jobs with a minimum total delay time. The AGVs dispatching problem discussed in this paper include the consideration of propagated tardiness. A delay in one job may affect all the subsequent jobs served by the same quay crane. To handle this assignment problem, we propose a hybrid metaheuristic method. This hybrid method is tested with simulations on a container management system and the results are compared with a greedy method. The hybrid method outperforms the greedy method with obvious improvement. Further comparison between the proposed hybrid method and other hybrid methods proves the robustness of this hybrid method.	assignment problem;branch and bound;central processing unit;computation;diversification (finance);greedy algorithm;job stream;loss function;metaheuristic;optimization problem;simulation;time complexity	Li Qin Song;Shell Ying Huang	2013	2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Scheduling (CISched)	10.1109/SCIS.2013.6613252	remotely operated underwater vehicle;minimisation;transport;simulation;statistics	Robotics	14.578051580474295	1.893553902165356	142140

One possible solution to this problem is to combine different algorithms in a team that allows us to solve all scenarios. A parallel methodology is designed in this work, which combines the operation of four multiobjective evolutionary algorithms by using OpenMP to solve different motif discovery scenarios. Our conclusions show that our parallel multi-core team is quite flexible and accurate for this application, and an important tool for discovering relevant DNA motifs.	dna computing;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;sequence motif	David L.

296eaee29933141f8de33e7be1a85e0a09dc7802	the importance of proper diversity management in evolutionary algorithms for combinatorial optimization		Premature convergence is one of the most important recurrent drawbacks of Evolutionary Algorithms and other metaheuristics. As a result, several methods to alleviate this problem have been devised. One alternative is to explicitly control the diversity of the population. In this chapter, a recently proposed survivor selection strategy is incorporated into a memetic algorithm and analyzed using three different combinatorial optimization problems. This strategy is based on adopting multi-objective concepts for solving single-objective problems by considering the contribution to diversity as an explicit objective. Additionally, it incorporates the principle of adapting the balance between exploration and exploitation to the different stages of the optimization by taking into account the stopping criterion and elapsed time. These new methods provide important benefits when compared to more mature methods that rely on different principles to delay convergence of the population. Additionally, new best-known solutions are generated for several instances of the problems, thus providing proofs of the considerable benefits and robustness yielded by the schemes that incorporate this novel replacement strategy.	combinatorial optimization;evolutionary algorithm;program optimization	Carlos Segura;Arturo Hernández Aguirre;Sergio Ivvan Valdez Peña;Salvador Botello Rionda	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-44003-3_6	mathematical optimization;bioinformatics;management science;evolutionary computation	Theory	22.904670198966322	-4.2733565437775445	142215

fcb773fd2d39c558c3b54d9a1ece6b959dbe40c2	gomge: gene-pool optimal mixing on grammatical evolution		Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA) is a recent Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) in which the interactions among parts of the solution (i.e., the linkage) are learned and exploited in a novel variation operator. We present GOMGE, the extension of GOMEA to Grammatical Evolution (GE), a popular EA based on an indirect representation which may be applied to any problem whose solutions can be described using a context-free grammar (CFG). GE is a general approach that does not require the user to tune the internals of the EA to fit the problem at hand: there is hence the opportunity for benefiting from the potential of GOMEA to automatically learn and exploit the linkage. We apply the proposed approach to three variants of GE differing in the representation (original GE, SGE, and WHGE) and incorporate in GOMGE two specific improvements aimed at coping with the high degeneracy of those representations. We experimentally assess GOMGE and show that, when coupled with WHGE and SGE, it is clearly beneficial to both effectiveness and efficiency, whereas it delivers mixed results with the original GE.	context-free grammar;context-free language;degeneracy (graph theory);evolutionary algorithm;experiment;gene expression programming;gene pool;grammatical evolution;interaction;linkage (software);oracle grid engine	Eric Medvet;Alberto Bartoli;Andrea De Lorenzo;Fabiano Tarlao	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-99253-2_18	machine learning;artificial intelligence;operator (computer programming);grammatical evolution;genetic programming;computer science;degeneracy (mathematics);gene pool;evolutionary algorithm;exploit;family of sets	ML	24.080677568126724	-4.138133859696172	142366

ICA is a meta-heuristic algorithm for dealing with different optimization tasks. The basis of the algorithm is inspired by imperialistic competition. It attempts to present the social policy of imperialisms (referred to empires) to control more countries (referred to colonies) and use their sources.

In this paper, a novel Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) solution is proposed to solve the OP. The proposed method is shown to outperform state-of-the-art heuristics for the OP in producing high quality solutions. In comparison with the best known solutions of standard benchmark instances, the method can find the optimal or the best known solution of about 70 % of the instances in a reasonable time, which is about 17 % better than the best known approach in the literature. Moreover, a significant improvement is achieved on the solution of two standard benchmark instances.	benchmark (computing);display resolution;grasp;greedy algorithm;greedy randomized adaptive search procedure;heuristic (computer science);randomized algorithm;travelling salesman problem	Morteza Keshtkaran;Koorush Ziarati	2016	J.

In this paper, we propose two new measures of epistasis: internal epistasis and external epistasis. Then we show that they can quantify the decomposability of a problem, which has a theoretical meaning about how strongly the problem is independently optimizable with a partition of variables. We present examples of the problem decomposition and the results of experiments that support the consistency of the measures.	combinatorial optimization;experiment;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;sensor	Dong-il Seo;Sung-Soon Choi;Byung Ro Moon	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-24855-2_14	optimization problem;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;machine learning	ML	18.626577749667874	-6.657604468471306	142565

Nowadays, there are many efficient algorithms for workflow execution planning, many of which are based on the combination of heuristic and metaheuristic approaches or other forms of hybridization. The coevolutionary genetic algorithm (CGA) offers an extended mechanism for scheduling based on two principal operations: task mapping and resource configuration. While task mapping is a basic function of resource allocation, resource configuration changes the computational environment with the help of the virtualization mechanism. In this paper, we present a strategy for improving the CGA for dynamically changing environments that has a significant impact on the final dynamic CGA execution process.		Denis A.

An underlying principle of these strategies is known as Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP). SCP is an inherently multi-objective (MO) problem but, in the literature, it has been usually dealt with a monobjective approach. In addition, SCP analysis tend to assume that conserved biodiversity does not change throughout time. In this paper we propose a MO approach to the SCP problem which increases flexibility through the inclusion of more objectives, which whilst increasing the complexity, significantly augments the amount of information used to provide users with an improved decision support system. We employed ensemble forecasting approach, enriching our analysis by taking into account future climate simulations to estimate species occurrence projected to 2080. Our approach is able to identify sites of high priority for conservation, regions with high risk of investment and sites that may become attractive options in the future. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to apply MO algorithms to a SCP problem associated to climate forecasting, in a dynamic spatial prioritization analysis for biodiversity conservation.	algorithm;decision support system;ensemble forecasting;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;simulation;while	Shana Schlottfeldt;Jonathan Timmis;Maria Emilia Telles Walter;André Carlos Ponce de Leon Ferreira de Carvalho;José Alexandre Felizola Diniz-Filho;Lorena M.

1e28fc6199df698ab87258030afc71df6b1a3487	algorithme évolutionnaire à états pour l'optimisation difficile. (states-based evolutionary algorithm for difficult optimization)		Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are search methods inspired by the darwinian theory of evolution, working iteratively on a population of potential solutions that are randomly selected and modified. The selection of a representation, the definition of parameters or the attribution of their proper values have a crucial influence on the algorithm performances. A choice that does not match to the fitness function can make the problem more difficult to resolve. Finding suitable parameter settings is therefore a big challenge. Although EAs are recognized as competitive methods on large problems, they are subjects to certain critics such as parameters adjustment/control. By parameter settings, we mean the approach which consists in finding reasonable parameter values before the algorithm execution. In this thesis, we provide arguments that a set of constant parameters during the run seems to be inadequate. Our contribution to the broad area of optimization concerns the automatic adjustment of parameters according to the test problem. In the first part, we expose the problematic of parameters adjustment/control as well as the principal exisitng heuristics. In the second, we introduce two methods for dynamic control of parameters associated with the representation of solutions. In the third, we propose the States based Evolutionary Algorithm (SEA), a parallel variant of AEs ; this new approach manages simultaneously several EAs in order to control dynamically the parameters during optimization process. In the last part, we present an instantiation of the SEA which integrates different mutation rates in order to adapt the best rate to the search. This new instance was tested on the multidimensional knapsack problem. Comparable results were obtained, which proves that the SEA is capable of dynamically controlling the compromise exploration/exploitation.

Solving the optimization problems that arise in water networks is challenging mainly due to the nonlinearities inherent in the physics and the often binary nature of decisions. In this paper, we consider the operational problem of pump scheduling and the design problem of leaky pipe replacement. New approaches for these problems based on simulation-optimization are proposed as solution methodologies. For the pump scheduling problem, a novel decomposition technique uses solutions from a simulation-based sub-problem to guide the search. For the leaky pipe replacement problem a knapsack-based heuristic is applied. The proposed solution algorithms are tested and detailed results for two networks from the literature are provided.	mathematical optimization;scheduling (computing);simulation	Joe Naoum-Sawaya;Bissan Ghaddar;Ernesto Arandia;Bradley Eck	2015	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2015.04.028	mathematical optimization;simulation;integer programming;operations management;mathematics	Robotics	13.00890144102159	2.4772246713553816	143404

As one of the local search methods, taboo search provides a promising alternative for the job shop scheduling problem; however, it has to be tailored each time with respect to parameters for every instance in order to produce desirable solution. In order to improve its search efficiency, an approach is proposed for the job shop scheduling problem by using taboo search with fuzzy reasoning. There are two parts in this approach: taboo search module and fuzzy reasoning module that performs the function of adaptive parameter adjustment in taboo search. The performance issues of this approach are also discussed by means of commonly used benchmarks.	fuzzy concept;job shop scheduling;scheduling (computing);tabu search	Guohua Wan;Feng Wan	2003		10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244635	fuzzy logic;job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;flow shop scheduling;computer science;local search;machine learning;mathematics	AI	20.32622308894146	-1.8299588883190787	143474

In this contribution we propose an extension of the Vehicle Routing Problem, which adapts most of the needs for operating electric vehicles. This includes an objective function that considers energy consumption depending on driving resistances and loading weight, as well as additional restrictions to handle the maximum range depending on battery capacity and recharging options. To illustrate the problem a set of test instances is solved. For this purpose we present an adapted tabu search heuristics.

Different compact unstructured representations are introduced, the complexity of which is self-adaptive, i.e. is evolved by the algorithm itself. The Voronoi-based representations are variable length lists of alleles that are directly decoded into object shapes, while the IFS representation, based on fractal theory, involves a much more complex morphogenetic process. First results demonstrates that Voronoi-based representations allow one to push further the limits of Evolutionary Topological Optimum Design by actually removing the correlation between the complexity of the representations and that of the discretization. Further comparative results among all these representations on simple test problems seem to indicate that the complex causality in the IFS representation disfavors it compared to the Voronoi-based representations.	causality;discretization;evolutionary algorithm;fractal;numerical analysis	Hatem Hamda;François Jouve;Evelyne Lutton;Marc Schoenauer;Michèle Sebag	2002	Applied Intelligence	10.1023/A:1013666503249	mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;machine learning	AI	24.25507073723342	-8.76315205525395	143806

Traditional optimization methods for vehicle and crew scheduling in such cases usually produce schedules that contain irregularities which are not desirable especially from the point of view of the bus drivers. We propose a solution method which improves regularity while partially integrating the vehicle and crew scheduling problems. The approach includes two phases: first we solve the LP relaxation of a set partitioning formulation, using column generation together with Lagrangean relaxation techniques. In a second phase we generate integer solutions using a new combination of local branching and various versions of follow-on branching. Numerical tests with artificial and real instances show that regularity can be improved significantly with no or just a minor increase of costs.	algorithm;branch and price;cplex;column generation;crew scheduling;heuristic;integer programming;international symposium on algorithms and computation;lagrangian relaxation;lecture notes in computer science;linear programming relaxation;louvain modularity;mathematical optimization;network model;numerical method;operations research;point of view (computer hardware company);procedural generation;real life;schedule (project management);scheduling (computing);springer (tank);transportation science	Ingmar Steinzen;Leena Suhl;Natalia Kliewer	2007		10.1007/s00291-008-0136-5	column generation;job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;computer science;linear programming relaxation;operations management;mathematics;set cover problem;algorithm	EDA	15.652118349557291	3.4206006033744387	143852

AGVs can move freely in the warehouse (an open path AGV system is adopted), and their transportation activities can be modelled as a sequence of elementary or basic actions. In the paper, a coloured Petri net (CPN) model is proposed. It allows representing any sequence of elementary actions of AGVs (including pick-up and drop-off activities), and accurately models the interactions among AGVs, in order to guarantee the safety during the execution of activities. The CPN model can be used to analyse and implement deadlock prevention and deadlock recovery strategies, and it has been adopted in the building of a discrete-event simulator which is employed to analyse the system's performance and to evaluate scheduling policies for transportation tasks.	algorithm;color;coloured petri net;deadlock;heuristic (computer science);interaction;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;scheduling (computing);simulation	Davide Giglio	2014	2014 11th International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics (ICINCO)	10.5220/0005054807340745	simulation;engineering;engineering drawing	Robotics	12.00190973802093	3.452538344100892	144237

Also, we developed a graphical interface to allow the user input parameters and having as objective to reduce processing time through a parallel implementation.

Because very specialized steel grades are produced the variety of the chemical analysis of the heats is very high and the lot sizes are small. One of the most constraining factors in the production is the infiltration of chemical elements between consecutive heats in the electric arc furnace. To find a schedule that violates no compatibility constraints is theoretically in the worst case an NP-hard problem. An earlier attempt to solve the problem with conventional software failed due to this complexity. Some difficult to schedule jobs remained unscheduled. The expert system solves the problem because it first determines the criticality of jobs and applies then a heuristic based on the criticality values to guide the search for a feasible schedule. Important is further the system’s capability to use and relax constraints locally. The expert system was fielded successfully in 1992 at Böhler Uddeholm in Kapfenberg.	best, worst and average case;expert system;heuristic;np-hardness;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);self-organized criticality	Jürgen Dorn;Reza Shams	1996	IEEE Expert	10.1109/64.482954	critical value;computer science;artificial intelligence;np-hard;scheduling;expert system;electric arc furnace	AI	11.119601187179471	3.734798401173913	144696

The suppliers offer total quantity discounts and the company aims at selecting a set of suppliers so to satisfy product demand at minimum purchasing cost. The problem, known as Total Quantity Discount Problem (TQDP), is strongly NP-hard. We study different families of valid inequalities and provide a branch-and-cut approach to solve the capacitated variant of the problem (Capacitated TQDP) where the quantity available for a product from a supplier is limited. A hybrid algorithm, called HELP (Heuristic Enhancement from LP), is used to provide an initial feasible solution to the exact approach. HELP exploits information provided by the continuous relaxation problem to construct neighborhoods optimally searched through the solution of mixed integer subproblems. A streamlined version of the proposed exact method can optimally solve in a reasonable amount of time instances with up to 100 suppliers and 500 products, and largely outperforms an existing approach available in the literature and CPLEX 12.2 that frequently runs out of memory before completing the search.	exact algorithm	Daniele Manerba;Renata Mansini	2012	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2012.04.028	mathematical optimization;economics;operations management;mathematics;welfare economics;branch and cut	Theory	15.992828677406063	3.387550014313919	144701

It has traditionally been solved as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem but upcoming changes to the power system drastically increase the MIP solution time. In this paper, we discuss the benefits that using planning may have over the established methods. We provide a formal description of Unit Commitment, and we present its formulation as MIP and as a planning problem. This is a novel and interesting application area for planning, with features that make the domain challenging for current planners.	automated planning and scheduling;ibm power systems;integer programming;linear programming;systems engineering;uc browser;whole earth 'lectronic link	Joshua Campion;Chris Dent;Maria Fox;Derek Long;Daniele Magazzeni	2013			planning;simulation;power system simulation;operations research	AI	13.34867229394168	1.8034788161365551	144711

In SLADE, the population is initialized by symmetric Latin hypercube design (SLHD) to increase the diversity of the initial population. Moreover, the trial vector generation strategy assigned to each target individual is adaptively selected from the strategy candidate pool to match different stages of the evolution according to their previous successful experience. SLADE employs Cauchy distribution and normal distribution to update the control parameters CR and F to appropriate values during the evolutionary process. A large amount of simulation experiments and comparisons have been made by employing a set of 25 benchmark functions. Experimental results show that SLADE is better than, or at least comparable to, other classic or adaptive DE algorithms, and SLHD is effective for improving the performance of SLADE. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) within the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

2086e0f6fa7eeb45b0cf0ec8d0154ff80b7e602a	engineering works scheduling for hong kong's rail network		"""This paper describes how AI is used to plan, schedule, and optimize nightly engineering works for both the commuter and rapid transit lines in Hong Kong. The MTR Corporation Limited operates and manages all the rail lines in Hong Kong. Its """"Engineering Works and Traffic Information Management System"""" (ETMS) is a mission critical system that manages all information related to engineering works and their related track possessions and engineering train movements. The AI Engine described in this paper is a component of this ETMS. In Hong Kong, the maintenance, inspection, repair, or installation works along the rail lines are done during the very short non-traffic hours (NTH) of roughly 4 to 5 hours each night. These engineering works can be along the running tracks, track-side, tunnel, freight yards, sub-depots, depot maintenance tracks, etc. The proper scheduling of necessary engineering works is crucial to maintaining a reliable and safe train service during normal hours. The AI Engine optimizes resource allocation to maximize the number of engineering works that can be performed, while ensuring all safety, environment, and operational rules and constraints are met. The work described is part of a project to redesign and replace the existing ETMS, deployed in 2004, with an updated technology platform and modern IT architecture, to provide a more robust and scalable system that potentially can be deployed to other cities around the world."""	scheduling (computing)	Andy Hon Wai Chun;Ted Yiu Tat Suen	2014			artificial intelligence	AI	13.030178593842443	0.729489027644117	144907

This task runs across the internet, for outdoor activities and of course within car navigation systems. Nowadays search for the shortest path gets more popular compared to the past because of rising fuel prices. That is why driving along an optimised route has financial benefits on the one hand, and on the other hand it helps to save energy resources of our environment. In this paper a hierarchical approach of route computation based on traverse elements is discussed. Furthermore an experimental setup is implemented based on an open source database management system (PostgreSQL/PostGIS) to verify the theoretical approach presented.

We consider two variants of the problem. In the first, proposed for the International Planning Competition in 2004, the in-bound and out-bound airplanes have fixed parking and take-off positions. In the second, more realistic variant a controller can assign dynamically for each airplane the runway for take-off or the parking position, such that the total movement of planes at the airport is minimized. We are particularly interested in the second variant, which has an implicitly defined goal state where multiple states could satisfy the goal condition, and the impact of this fact on domain-independent and domain-dependent heuristics. We compare domain-independent heuristics in the Fast Downward planner on this domain to a domain-dependent heuristic.	controller (computing);heuristic (computer science)	Augusto B.

b16fc39253a12e8020e347eedc3ecfb9fb923a7b	self-organizing map-based weight design for decomposition-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm		Many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs), in which the number of objectives is greater than three, are undoubtedly more challenging compared with the bi- and tri-objective optimization problems. Currently, the decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms have shown promising performance in dealing with MaOPs. Nevertheless, these algorithms need to design the weight vectors, which has significant effects on the performance of the algorithms. In particular, when the Pareto front of problems is incomplete, these algorithms cannot obtain a set of uniformly distribution solutions by using the conventional weight design methods. In the literature, it is well-known that the self-organizing map (SOM) can preserve the topological properties of the input data by using the neighborhood function, and its display is more uniform than the probability density of the input data. This phenomenon is advantageous to generate a set of uniformly distributed weight vectors based on the distribution of the individuals. Therefore, we will propose a novel weight design method based on SOM, which can be integrated with most of the decomposition-based algorithms for solving MaOPs. In this paper, we choose the existing state-of-the-art decomposition-based algorithms as examples for such integration. This integrated algorithms are then compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms on eleven redundancy problems and eight nonredundancy problems, respectively. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	evolutionary algorithm;human body weight;moea framework;mathematical optimization;organizing (structure);pareto efficiency;self-organization;self-organizing map;triangular function;turing test;weight function	Fangqing Gu;Yiu-ming Cheung	2018	IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation	10.1109/TEVC.2017.2695579	mathematical optimization	DB	24.17757012264853	-3.3789360781984454	145415
8f0d0fa59ba62dac3e8435f9ec739f2e8318bdd5	solving kriegspiel-like problems: examining efficient search methods	search method	We recently proposed a deterministic approach for solving problems with uncertainty, called the Uncertainty Paradigm. Under this paradigm, deterministic solving of such a problem is resolved into a plain AND/OR-tree search. The search under this paradigm is denoted by the Uncertainty Paradigm Search (UPS). As an application, we have chosen the domain of Tsuitate-Tsume-Shogi, which is the mating problem of Kriegspiel-like variant of Shogi. The early implementation of UPSwas based on a simple depth-first full-width search with iterative deepening (ID), which was unable to solve several hard problems. This paper explores an efficient search method using UPDS (Uncertainty Paradigm PDS) algorithm, which is a specialized version of PDS (Proof-number and Disproof-number Search) for UPS. UPDS generally performs better than ID or PDS, but fails to solve some easy problems. In addition, several variations of UPDS and ID have also been examined to tackle some hardest problems. All problems in the test set have been solved by a particular variation of UPDS, which shows superiority of the depth-first variants of the proof-number search in UPS.

0d6e3b9ef516899aff18e89e69df728c740c1e4f	explaining producer/consumer constraints		Resource-constrained project scheduling problems are one of the most studied scheduling problem, and constraint programming with nogood learning provides the state-of-the-art solving technology for them, at least when the aim is minimizing makespan. In this paper we examine the closely related problem of scheduling producers and consumers of discrete resources and reservoirs. Producer/consumer constraints model consumable resources, such as raw materials (e.g., water) and money, in which event times relate to a production or consumption event. In this paper, we investigate what is the most appropriate language of learning: should we learn about the event times for production and consumption, or should be instead learn about the temporal relationships between events? For this reason, we explore global constraint propagators with explanation for producer/consumer constraints and contrast this with simple decomposition approaches. Experiments on resource-constrained project scheduling problems involving producer/consumer constraints show that nogood learning solvers are highly effective at these problems.	constraint programming;lazy evaluation;makespan;propagator;scheduling (computing)	Andreas Schutt;Peter J.

Unlike most previous work, the basis of RMEA is repeated and alternated executions of two different stages i.e. exploration and exploitation during evolution. RMEA uses dissimilar information across the population and similar information within population neighbourhood in mutation operation for achieving global exploration and local exploitation, respectively. It is applied on two unimodal, two multimodal, one rotated multimodal and one composition functions. The experimental results indicated the effectiveness of using different object-oriented stages and their repeated alternation during evolution. The comparison of RMEA with other algorithms showed its superiority on complex problems.	alternation (formal language theory);evolutionary algorithm;multimodal interaction;multistage amplifier	Md.

For interactive use, we need to solve similar constraint satisfaction problems repeatedly for each screen refresh, with each successive problem differing from the previous one only in the position of an input device and the previous state of the system. We present an algorithm for solving such systems of constraints using projection. The solution is compiled into very efficient, constraint-free code, which is parameterized by the new inputs. Producing straight-line, constraint-free code of this sort is important in a number of applications: for example, to provide predictable performance in real-time systems, to allow companies to ship products without including a runtime constraint solver, to compile Java applets that can be downloaded and run remotely (again without having to include a runtime solver), or for applications where runtime efficiency is particularly important. Even for less time-critical user interface applications, the smooth performance of the resulting code is more pleasing than that of code produced using other current techniques.	alan m. frieze;algorithm;approximation;code reuse;compiler;constraint graph;constraint logic programming;constraint satisfaction problem;cryptographic service provider;cut (graph theory);feedback vertex set;graphical user interface;input device;interactivity;java applet;linear equation;nonlinear system;pixel;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;requirement;response time (technology);rounding;smoothing;social inequality;solver;variable elimination;window of opportunity	Warwick Harvey;Peter J.

In other words, the choice of the most appropriate algorithm depends upon the specific problem under investigation, and a certain algorithm, while providing good performance (both in terms of solution quality and convergence speed) on certain problems, may reveal weak on certain others. This apparently straightforward concept is not always acknowledged by optimization practitioners. A typical example, in the field of traffic simulation, concerns the calibration of traffic models. In this paper, a general method for verifying the robustness of a calibration procedure (suitable, in general, for any simulation optimization) is proposed based on a test with synthetic data. The main obstacle to this methodology is the significant computation time required by all the necessary simulations. For this reason, a Kriging approximation of the simulation model is proposed instead. The methodology is tested on a specific case study, where the effect on the optimization problem of different combinations of parameters, optimization algorithms, measures of goodness of fit, and levels of noise in the data is also investigated. Results show the clear dependence between the performance of a calibration procedure and the case study under analysis and ascertain the need for global solutions in simulation optimization with traffic models.	algorithm;approximation;computation;kriging;mathematical optimization;metamodeling;nfl;no free lunch in search and optimization;optimization problem;simulation;surrogates;synthetic data;time complexity;verification and validation	Biagio Ciuffo;Vincenzo Punzo	2014	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2013.2287720	econometrics;mathematical optimization;calibration;meta-optimization;machine learning;methodology;mathematics;goodness of fit;statistics;approximation theory	EDA	17.270819691595413	-7.06093641472168	145926

The problem consists in scheduling the transmission of oil products from source nodes to terminals in due times. The minimization of two objectives is considered: delivery time and fragmentation, that is, the consecutive transmission of distinct products in the same polyduct. The performance of a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is compared to the performance of two versions of the NSGA II algorithm in a set of 15 instances. The results show that the Particle Swarm algorithm outperforms the NSGA II.	algorithm;fragmentation (computing);particle swarm optimization;scheduling (computing)	Thatiana C.

Numerous factors can affect throughput in such highly integrated systems. These include numbers and types of equipment, physical layout, storage capacity and operating strategies. This study aims to improve operating strategies by developing an analytical tool to assist in load planning of container trains. The problem investigated can be described as a dynamic assignment problem with many uncertain parameters. Numerical investigations focus on tuning the proposed model to deal with the uncertainties.	assignment problem;experiment;heuristic;integrated circuit layout;local search (optimization);mathematical model;numerical analysis;offset binary;operating environment;operating system;simulation;throughput	Paul Corry;Erhan Kozan	2006	Computers & OR	10.1016/j.cor.2004.05.013	integrable system;mathematical optimization;computer science;mathematics;assignment problem;operations research;container	Robotics	14.497333777752555	2.073857821897664	146409
