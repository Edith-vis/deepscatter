082aed4ea5bd2e24ee7f5a9f2bbc36ba86776237	quantum-to-the-home: achieving gbits/s secure key rates via commercial off-the-shelf telecommunication equipment		There is current significant interest in Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) networks, that is, end-to-end optical connectivity. Currently, it may be limited due to the presence of last-mile copper wire connections. However, in near future, it is envisaged that FTTH connectionswill exist, and a key offeringwould be the possibility of optical encryption that can best be implemented usingQuantum KeyDistribution (QKD).However, it is very important that theQKD infrastructure is compatible with the already existing networks for a smooth transition and integration with the classical data traffic. In this paper, we report the feasibility of using off-the-shelf telecommunication components to enable high performance Continuous Variable-Quantum Key Distribution (CV-QKD) systems that can yield secure key rates in the range of 100Mbits/s under practical operating conditions. Multilevel phase modulated signals (m-PSK) are evaluated in terms of secure key rates and transmission distances. The traditional receiver is discussed, aided by the phase noise cancellation based digital signal processing module for detecting the complex quantum signals. Furthermore, we have discussed the compatibility of multiplexers and demultiplexers for wavelength division multiplexed Quantum-to-the-Home (QTTH) network and the impact of splitting ratio is analyzed.The results are thoroughly compared with the commercially available high-cost encryption modules.

Advances in energy-harvesting techniques enable increases in WSN lifetime by prolonging operation of the wireless nodes. While the primary objective of energy harvesting is to prolong network lifetime, it may cause lower values of other QoS metrics during that lifetime. From the author's previous work, cross-layer protocol interactions are represented through a set of concatenated parameters and resource levels for a real-time WSN under energy harvesting (EH-WSN). The cross-layer parameters that determine QoS values in the EH-WSN are established in terms of solutions to stochastic dynamic programming conditions derived from multivariate point-process (MVPP) models of transient information flows. Simulation results evaluate the extent to which QoS values are degraded in an EH-WSN compared to a WSN of the same structure without energy harvesting.	communications protocol;concatenation;dynamic programming;exception handling;exponential hierarchy;interaction;minimum viable product;point process;quality of service;real-time clock;simulation;stochastic programming	William S.

Apart from providing energy savings, the use of LED lighting technology creates scope for an innovative optical wireless communication technology known as visible light communication (VLC), which takes advantage of the superior modulation capability of LEDs to transmit data through a wireless channel. VLC is capable of concurrently providing communication as well as illumination. For making commercial implementation of VLC feasible, it is necessary to incorporate it with dimming schemes that will provide energy savings, moods, and increase the aesthetic value of the place using this technology. However, general dimming techniques have an adverse effect on communication since they limit the achievable data rate of a VLC link. This drives the necessity of formulating efficient dimming techniques, which will create a balance between the two most basic functions of VLC: illumination and communication. This paper focuses on dimming mechanisms that can be implemented in VLC systems to save energy and provide precise illumination control. The motivation behind this control mechanism, current challenges in practical implementation, driver circuitry, recent progress, and future prospects are also concisely presented.	concurrent computing;data rate units;diode;electronic circuit;modulation;oled;optical wireless;vlc media player	Fahad Zafar;Dilukshan Karunatilaka;Rajendran Parthiban	2015	IEEE Wireless Communications	10.1109/MWC.2015.7096282	telecommunications;computer science;light-emitting diode	Mobile	20.211736676282822	82.82570140772846	58435
91e7b805b4dc9e8ef1b3c7ac16e90437af79e947	understanding link behavior of non-intrusive wireless body sensor networks	routing protocols;body sensor networks;radio link	The wireless body sensor network (BSN) is used to detect and transmit physiological data such as vital signs by using radio wave communication. It offers a large saving potential for future healthcare applications because hospitalization of patients with chronic diseases can be kept at a minimum. The radio wave communication on the human body is impacted by the dielectric properties, the posture, and the movement of the body. Under these conditions a highly dynamic link-state and link quality are observed. In this paper we present a study of the link layer behavior of wireless BSNs operating at 2.45 GHz. We report on a wearable body-centric network operation in realistic environments from which we characterize the wireless channels based on a novel test framework. Our test framework uses a 200 ms time resolution for sampling of the wireless links between on-body sensor nodes. We record the received signal strength indicator and link quality indicator values as well as the packet delivery statistics in real-time. Based on recorded experiments we quantify the potential packet delivery performance and energy gain that can be obtained by using dynamic routing and adaptive transmission power schemes, respectively. Subsequently we formulate a set of requirements for the next revision of our prototype wireless BSN developed at Aarhus University School of Engineering in Denmark.

With high bandwidth cellular access links pushing the bottleneck to the network core, the risk of poor bandwidth utilization of the access link increases, which leads to energy wastage as the radio interface must stay active longer. In addition, small sized packet transmissions from applications wake up the interface frequently, but do not require the entire bandwidth capacity. In this work, we improve the radio usage by aggregating packet transmission from multiple applications. We introduce different time delays while transmitting packets from foreground and background applications such that user experience is minimally impacted. Through empirical observations, we determine the impact of different types of traffic on bandwidth utilization. Naive attempts to improve bandwidth utilization lead to increase in the number of packets missing the deadline for dispatch. With these observations, we propose a technique that balances the bandwidth utilization and deadline misses. Simulation driven experiments using synthetic traces and real trace based on application usage on Android based smartphones show energy gain of around 10% over other competing techniques.	android;call stack;dynamic dispatch;energy drift;experiment;mobile phone;network packet;simulation;smartphone;synthetic intelligence;tracing (software);transmitter;user experience	Swadhin Pradhan;Sourav Kumar Dandapat;Niloy Ganguly;Bivas Mitra;Pradipta De	2015	2015 7th International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)	10.1109/COMSNETS.2015.7098664	synchronization;bandwidth management;lead;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer performance;computer security;bandwidth;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Mobile	11.205644653830486	87.89998662010001	58739

Thus, spectrum allocation can avoid interference that caused by two interference SUs using the same channel. Different spectrum allocation can lead to different network topologies and consequently have effect on the network connectivity. The aim of this paper is twofold: 1) based on the Laplacian spectrum of graphs, we represent the cognitive radio Ad-Hoc network connectivity with knowledge of the effects of the different labeling rules of spectrum allocation; 2) we give a deep analysis of the network connectivity and the impact that different parameters have on it. The results show that the different labeling rules of Color-Sensitive Graph Coloring have different influence on the network connectivity. For the different labeling rules of Color-Sensitive Graph Coloring, we can obtain the different relationship between the probability of primary users' activity and the network connectivity.	coexist (image);cognitive radio;frequency allocation;graph coloring;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);network topology	Yun Li;Zhi Wang;Bin Cao;Wei Huang	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134090	wireless ad hoc network;combinatorics;computer science;resource management;mathematics;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	16.34159192668472	88.07422072279644	59236

In this paper we proposed a distributed topology control algorithm for ad hoc networks with directional antennas. The topology is controlled not only by adjusting the transmission powers of nodes but also by changing the antenna's pattern (direction). A node grows its transmission power until it finds some neighbor nodes in every sector of its directional antenna. We also employ two planarized optimizations that further reduce some redundant edges and make the topology as a planar graph eventually. The resulting network topology increases network lifetime by reducing transmission power and decreases traffic interference by having low node degrees. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);moe;microsoft research;network topology;planar graph;programmable logic array;routing;simulation;topology control	Peng He;Jiandong Li;Wei Dong	2007	21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (AINAW'07)	10.1109/AINAW.2007.38	wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;graph theory;directional antenna;distributed computing;network topology;computer network;logical topology	Mobile	10.199240490828888	81.52616061542439	59400

In sensor networks, it is important to reduce the energy consumption, since sensor nodes have limits in battery. Most researches achieve this by reducing sensor amount of transmitted data. However, there is a problem that the amount of transmitted data become large and their energy consumption becomes high when there are a lot of nodes in the sensing area. To solve the problem, we previously proposed a data gathering method. In this method, the data sink estimates the data value of nodes, broadcasts the estimated values, and then, sensor nodes whose observed values are largely different from the estimated values send the data. However, this method has a problem that it cannot sufficiently reduce the energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a new broadcast-based data gathering method. In this method, the data sink reduces the nodes which send their observed values when the reliability of gathered values by the data sink is high.	download;sensor;simulation;unified extensible firmware interface	Shinya Kitajima;Tomoki Yoshihisa;Takefumi Ogawa;Takahiro Hara;Shojiro Nishio	2009	2009 Tenth International Conference on Mobile Data Management: Systems, Services and Middleware	10.1109/MDM.2009.94	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;environmental monitoring;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	10.49149998123693	75.85651931452819	59445

In this paper, we present measurements within different environments and discuss the effects during the ranging process that lead to incorrect measurements. As the key contribution of our paper we present a method of gaining a quality measure for obtained range measurements, which enables to filter out erroneous measurements. In addition, we show first results applying this approach.	error detection and correction;multipath propagation;overhead (computing);sensor;software propagation;statistical classification;ultra-wideband	Frank Hartmann;Christian Enders;Wilhelm Stork	2016	2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)	10.1109/TSP.2016.7760858	telecommunications;mathematics;quantum mechanics;statistics;measurement uncertainty;time	Robotics	20.43256498713819	75.55821845883301	59957

As sensor nodes are typically battery operated, it is important to efficiently use the limited energy of the nodes to extend the lifetime of the sensor network. In this paper, the border coverage problem in sensor networks is rigorously analyzed. Unlike previous works in this area, we provide distributed algorithms that allow the selection and activation of an optimal border cover for both 2D and 3D sensor networks. We also provide self healing algorithms as an optimization to our border coverage algorithms which allow the border cover to adaptively reconfigure and repair itself in order to improve its own performance. Border coverage is crucial for optimizing sensor placement for intrusion detection and a number of other useful applications. Mathematical as well as experimental proofs are provided to validate the correctness and efficiency of our algorithms.	correctness (computer science);distributed algorithm;intrusion detection system;mathematical optimization;multi-function printer;sensor;software deployment	Mohamed Khalil Watfa;Sesh Commuri	2006			wireless sensor network;computer network;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;ant;wi-fi array;wireless wan;mobile wireless sensor network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;sensor node	Mobile	10.285828745350816	78.40573505385774	60038
4cae83af53aa4a71740a9114cfbcc2c859d21dfa	arima-based time variation model for beneath the chassis uwb channel	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;communications engineering networks	Intra-vehicular wireless sensor network (IVWSN) enables the integration of the wireless sensor network technology into the vehicle architecture through either eliminating the wires between the existing sensors and the corresponding electronic controller units (ECUs) or empowering new sensor technologies that are not currently implemented due to technical limitations. Ultra-wideband (UWB) has been determined to be the most appropriate technology for IVWSNs since it provides energy efficiency through the low duty-cycle operation and high reliability by exploiting the large bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a time variation model for UWB-based IVWSN-based on the extensive amount of data collected from the transmitter and receiver antennas at various locations and separation distances beneath the chassis of a vehicle moving at different speeds on different types of roads. We adopt the commonly used Saleh-Valenzuela (SV) model to represent the clustering phenomenon in the received power delay profiles (PDPs). The proposed novel time variation model then determines the time evolution of the PDPs by representing the changes in their cluster breakpoints, slopes, and break point amplitudes with the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. ARIMA(5,1,0) has been demonstrated to fit the breakpoint, cluster slope, and breakpoint amplitude sequences collected at different vehicle speeds with different transmitter and receiver locations on asphalt and stone roads by using Box-Jenkins procedure. This model is validated with diagnostic checking. The absolute values of the model coefficients are observed to be mostly larger on asphalt road than their counterparts on the stone road while exhibiting no dependence on the vehicle speed nor the location of transmitter and receiver antennas.

Examples of such events include the sound of thunder, the shades of moving clouds, or the vibrations in seismic data. Because our localization method does not generate signals for distance measurements, it saves energy. In fact, the algorithm may use existing sensor recordings to determine the locations of nodes at which the recordings were taken. Moreover, the method does not accumulate errors, making it also effective for large and sparse sensor networks. The localization uses time synchronization; we provide an algorithm to compensate for clock synchronization errors. Versions for both two dimensional and three dimensional localization of the algorithm are presented. Simulation results suggest that the algorithm can provide a high degree of accuracy when many events are recorded.	algorithm;clock synchronization;internationalization and localization;simulation;sparse matrix	YoungMin Kwon;Gul A.

Most proposed models in the literature assume a distance based sensing and 2D freespace communication for a randomly deployed WSN scenario. However, random sensor deployment commonly takes place in 3D inaccessible terrains. In this study, we investigate the incorporation of a realistic 3D terrain model into the performance evaluation of a target tracking WSN. Our observation is that the unrealistic and contradicting 2D terrain assumptions, in which communication and sensing is not blocked due to neglected topographic formations, result in optimistic and unrealistic WSN performance. The performance evaluations compare the mean error of target localization for a given target route in various artificially generated yet realistic terrains. The effect of terrain parameters on mean error is also investigated. Our simulations show that the performance predictions could be misleading on the paper design due to unrealistic assumptions with regards to the WSN deployment region.	digital elevation model;mean squared error;performance evaluation;randomness;scenery generator;sensor;simulation;software deployment;terrain rendering;topography	M.

One possible solution gaining popularity is based on the use of a reduced number of mobile nodes with controllable trajectories in the monitored field. In this framework, we present a distributed technique for iteratively computing the trajectories of the mobile nodes in a greedy fashion. The static sensor nodes actively assist the mobile nodes in this task by means of a bidding protocol, thus participating towards the goal of maximizing the area coverage of the monitored field. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated on various simulation scenarios with different number of mobile and static nodes in terms of achieved coverage and mean time to achieve X% coverage. Comparison with previous state-of-the-art techniques reveals the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method. & 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper describes a new scheme of mobile sensing that aims at providing a good coverage and throughput while maintaining better energy efficiency and high network availability. To achieve this, some features of the social foraging behavior of the Escherichia coli bacteria have been used, especially the chemotaxis and swarming processes that allow bacteria to move. Particularly, a description and a formulation of a mobile sensing scheme based on an approach inspired by the Bacterial Foraging Optimization have been provided. Models that allow mobile sinks to move over the network in a self-organized and self-adaptive way have been proposed. The proposal has been experimented in order to elaborate the impact of mobility on delay, network coverage and successful amount of collected data. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal.	algorithm;displacement mapping;linear programming;mathematical optimization;mobile phone;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;self-organization;sensor;simulation;throughput	Ado Adamou Abba Ari;Abdelhak Mourad Guéroui;Nabila Labraoui;Blaise Omer Yenke;Chafiq Titouna;Irepran Damakoa	2016	2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794867	simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;swarm intelligence;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;escherichia coli;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	11.06535516423836	78.31125528017775	61109
d625afedc4c802947d25e34b1d7e928248ca3628	an innovative approach for the management of cross-coupling interference in street lighting networks		Power Line Communications (PLCs) are used for measuring various metrics, that can give signs about the health of the power grid equipment and for maintenance actions. These measurements may include the values of voltage, current, temperature and pressure of the power grid equipment. As it is known, the communication may also depend on the structure of the transmission medium, i.e. the parasitic capacitances and inductances and the cross-coupling interference between phases. This paper introduces an innovative solution with the aim to reduce the impact of noise and interferences in street light systems based on PLCs for telemetry. The proposed solution can cope with several problems, such as the capacitive and the inductive coupling among phases and attenuation. The goal of the solution introduced in this work is to make the communication, among master and slave nodes, reliable and immune to noise. The proposed solution also allows a significant reduction of power consumption with a consequent lowering of CO2 emissions, acting on the automatically dimming and switching off the street lamps.	capacitive sensing;fault tolerance;hoc (programming language);inductive coupling;information exchange;interference (communication);master/slave (technology);network architecture;power-line communication;routing	Giovanni Pau;Mario Collotta;Salvatore Tirrito;Riccardo Caponetto	2017	JoWUA		coupling;architectural engineering;interference (wave propagation);engineering	EDA	17.876669138124726	82.95739986868053	61459

We have modeled the coverage problem as two sub-problems: floorplan and placement. The floorplan problem is to partition the service area into well-defined geometric cells, whereas the placement problem is to assign the sensor devices into a set of cells. The cardinality of the set of cells is considered as all possible candidate locations to place the sensors; therefore, we transformed the search space from continuous to discrete. Thus, we have reduced the complexity of the coverage problem, but we have merged the two sub-problems (floorplan and placement) into a single optimization problem to achieve good solutions. The objective function is to maximize the coverage of the service area while not exceeding a given budget. The merged optimization problem has been coded into the evolutionary approach. We have conducted five studies, where three studies compare the behavior of coverage ratio, cost, and radius of coverage of all allocated sensors with the number of generations separately. The fourth study examines the cell size versus coverage ratio. The fifth study looks at the average number of neighbors covered by a sensor with respect to the generations. Our experimental results present interesting findings in all five studies and our computerized evolutionary methodology generates solutions under 5 minutes.	data recovery;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;iterative and incremental development;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;sensor	Sami J.

Conventional location information comes from manual setting or GPS device. However, manual location setting requires huge cost of human time, and GPS location setting requires expensive device cost and large device size. Furthermore, GPS can not operate in indoor environment. Both approaches are not applicable to localization task of wireless sensor networks. In this paper, an accurate and efficient localization algorithm based on multidimensional scaling (AIDS) is proposed in hierarchical network environment. Through localized computation of multidimensional scaling within a cluster, the computation overhead can be distributed to each cluster. On the other hand, MDS- based localization approach requires the estimation of multihop distance. Through restricting estimation of multihop distances within a cluster, the proposed localization algorithm achieves better accuracy and can operate in non-convex network environment. Experimental results reveal that the proposed HMDS localization algorithm outperforms MDSMAP algorithm in terms of accuracy.	algorithm;computation;gps navigation device;global positioning system;head-mounted display;image scaling;multidimensional scaling;overhead (computing);tree network	Gwo-Jong Yu;Shao-Chun Wang	2007	22nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (aina 2008)	10.1109/AINA.2008.152	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	15.290286562825072	74.76139429183687	61559

Generally, actuating multiple sensors can achieve better tracking performance but with high energy consumption. Tracking accuracy, reliability, and energy consumed are affected by the sampling interval between two successive time steps. In this paper, an adaptive energy-efficient multisensor scheduling scheme is proposed for collaborative target tracking in WSNs. It calculates the optimal sampling interval to satisfy a specification on predicted tracking accuracy, selects the cluster of tasking sensors according to their joint detection probability, and designates one of the tasking sensors as the cluster head for estimation update and sensor scheduling according to a cluster head energy measure (CHEM) function. Simulation results show that, compared with existing single-sensor scheduling and multisensor scheduling with a uniform sampling interval, the proposed adaptive multisensor scheduling scheme can achieve superior energy efficiency and tracking reliability while satisfying the tracking accuracy requirement. It is also robust to the uncertainty of the process noise.	approximation algorithm;computer cluster;elegant degradation;local optimum;monte carlo method;randomness;sampling (signal processing);scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation	Jianyong Lin;Wendong Xiao;Frank L.

Renewable energy harvesting and depletion of sensor devices are stochastic and thus, energy availability in the devices is sporadic rather than continuous. Therefore, the optimal deployment of data routing devices (i.e., relay nodes) and their activity scheduling to ensure that, the data from all source sensors could be routed to the sink while keeping the network functional perpetually, is a challenging research problem. In this paper, we develop a multi-constraint mixed integer linear program (MILP) to minimize the number of relay nodes to be deployed in the network, while considering connectivity, sustainability and unpredictable energy harvesting and depletion rates. We refer to this problem as SMRMC (sustainable minimum-relay maximum-connectivity deployment) which is proved to be NP-hard. A light weight k connected greedy solution to the SMRMC problem has been developed first for k = 1 , and thereafter, a generalized solution has been presented for any k ( k ≥ 2) by constructing convex-polytopes among the existing relay nodes. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to validate the performance of the proposed deployment strategies. Performance studies carried out in MATLAB, show that the proposed SMRMC algorithms can achieve up to twice the network lifetime compared to state-of-the-art approaches whilst deploying minimum number of relay nodes. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.	activity tracker;depletion region;emergence;exception handling;experiment;greedy algorithm;linear programming;matlab;problem domain;problem solving;relay;routing;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;software deployment;while	Nusrat Mehajabin;Md.

646046dfffb7826d78ebc1c08b5c3192fec1319e	extending wireless algorithm design to arbitrary environments via metricity	sinr model;experiments;wireless interference models;wireless algorithm design;wireless ad hoc networks	Efficient spectrum use in wireless sensor networks through spatial reuse requires effective models of packet reception at the physical layer in the presence of interference. Despite recent progress in analytic and simulations research into worst-case behavior from interference effects, these efforts generally assume geometric path loss and isotropic transmission, assumptions which have not been borne out in experiments.  Our paper aims to provide a methodology for grounding theoretical results into wireless interference in experimental reality. We develop a new framework for wireless algorithms in which distance-based path loss is replaced by an arbitrary gain matrix, typically obtained by measurements of received signal strength (RSS). We experimentally evaluate the framework in two indoors testbeds with 20 and 60~motes, and confirm superior predictive performance in packet reception rate for a gain matrix model over a geometric distance-based model.  At the heart of our approach is a new parameter ζ called metricity which indicates how close the gain matrix is to a distance metric, effectively measuring the complexity of the environment. A powerful theoretical feature of this parameter is that all known SINR scheduling algorithms that work in general metric spaces carry over to arbitrary gain matrices and achieve equivalent performance guarantees in terms of ζ as previously obtained in terms of the path loss constant. Our experiments confirm the sensitivity of ζ to the nature of the environment. Finally, we show analytically and empirically how multiple channels can be leveraged to improve metricity and thereby performance. We believe our contributions will facilitate experimental validation for recent advances in algorithms for physical wireless interference models.	algorithm design;best, worst and average case;catastrophic interference;euclidean distance;experiment;interference (communication);network packet;rss;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation	Helga Gudmundsdottir;Eyjólfur Ingi Ásgeirsson;Marijke H.

Such demonstrations have been based on a dedicated proof-of-concept environment, which serves for validating the work in the areas of cognitive networks, reconfigurable terminals, enhanced radio resource and spectrum efficiency, and dynamic and robust reconfigurations. In this framework, this paper presents a real time demonstrator running IP-based applications for the validation of ASM/JRRM algorithms. Such a demonstrator tries to reproduce in a realistic way a B3G heterogeneous radio access network, which considers different RATs (UTRAN, GERAN, WLAN), interfacing a common Core Network. This demonstrator serves for testing the ASM/JRRM strategies that are proposed within the E2R project. In addition, the E2R ASM/JRRM demonstrator incorporates the capacity to evaluate the QoS experienced by the user when using real applications under controlled conditions of the used RAT and the CN.	algorithm;application programming interface;cognitive network;emulator;olami–feder–christensen model;quality of service;radio access network;radio resource management;real-time web;reconfigurable computing;spectral efficiency	Antoni Gelonch;Xavier Revés;Vuk Marojevic;Jad Nasreddine;Jordi Pérez-Romero;Oriol Sallent	2010	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-009-9710-7	radio access network;spectrum;real-time computing;simulation;core network;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;resource management;operating system;proof of concept;computer network	Mobile	21.90287812172062	88.44252846228596	62454

However, the spatial-temporal profiles of such ambient energy sources typically exhibit great variations, and can only provide intermittent recharging opportunities to support low-rate data services. In order to provide steady and high recharging rates, and achieve energy-efficient data gathering from sensors, in this paper, we propose to utilize mobility for the joint design of energy replenishment and data gathering. In particular, a multifunctional mobile entity, called SenCar in this paper, is employed, which serves not only as a data collector that roams over the field to gather data via short-range communication but also as an energy transporter that charges static sensors on its migration tour via wireless energy transmissions. Taking advantages of the SenCar's controlled mobility, we give a two-stage approach for the joint design. In the first stage, the locations of a subset of sensors are periodically selected as anchor points, where the SenCar will sequentially visit to charge the sensors at these locations and gather data from nearby sensors in a multi-hop fashion. In order to achieve a desirable balance between the energy replenishment amount and data gathering latency, we provide a selection algorithm to search for a maximum number of anchor points where sensors hold the least battery energy, and meanwhile by visiting them the tour length of the SenCar is no more than a threshold value. In the second stage, we consider data gathering performance when the SenCar migrates among these anchor points. We formulate the problem into a network utility maximization problem and propose a distributed algorithm to adjust data rates, link scheduling and flow routing so as to adapt to the up-to-date energy replenishing status of sensors. The effectiveness of our approach is validated by extensive numerical results. Comparing with solar harvesting networks, our solution can improve the network utility by 48% on average.

As a result, small-cell-based densification is expected to play a key role for satisfying quality-of-service demands for future wireless networks. Since operators desire to expand coverage and services in accordance with the growing demands, wireless backhaul solutions for small cells are increasingly appealing from the viewpoint of the deployment and service expansion costs. Particularly, millimeter-wave backhaul solutions are being considered as an important element in realizing small-cell deployments. In this paper, we will study the feasibility and performance of a Wi-Fi-based millimeter-wave backhaul. Such a solution will have several advantages including the elimination of spectrum costs and the possibility of multiple-vendor solutions due to compatibility with a worldwide standard.	backhaul (telecommunications);quality of service;requirement;software deployment;wireless router	Majid Ghanbarinejad;George Calcev;Diana Maamari	2016	2016 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2016.7849085	simulation;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	22.00429373873835	87.04442998062429	62864
0fa97beba1beb798be81f053057cf5606df4937e	practical millimeter wave research on custom testbeds and commercial off-the-shelf devices		The high bandwidth available at millimeter-wave frequencies allows for very high data rates, and the latest wireless technologies, such as IEEE 802.11ad, are already exploiting this part of the radio spectrum to achieve rates of several GBit/s. Unfortunately, experimental millimeter-wave research is hampered by the lack of inexpensive yet flexible testbed platforms. While off-the-shelf 802.11ad devices only provide very limited programmability, current software-defined radios typically do not offer the bandwidth necessary for millimeter-wave systems. This keynote talk will give an overview of recent work that deals with millimeter-wave networking challenges, with a particular focus on the testbed platforms we developed. The talk covers low overhead continuous beam tracking on an 802.11ad compliant system with a phased array and an implementation of compressive beam training on commercial off-the-shelf devices. The very large bandwidth at mm-wave frequencies also allows, in principle, to design highly accurate location systems. Location information can in turn be used to facilitate beam training, optimize access point association, predict (and counteract) future blockage, etc. The talk will present a location system we implemented on off-the-shelf 802.11ad devices, that only uses coarse angle information extracted from the beam training process. Finally, the talk will present some ongoing work on a full-bandwidth software-defined radio platform for millimeter wave experimentation.	bandwidth (signal processing);overhead (computing);phased array;testbed;wireless access point	Joerg Widmer	2018		10.1145/3267204.3267217	commercial off-the-shelf;gigabit;radio spectrum;wireless;testbed;extremely high frequency;bandwidth (signal processing);electronic engineering;phased array;computer science	Mobile	21.517574036239534	83.55608465161885	62941

This paper considers a smart parking infrastructure where sensors are laid down on the parking spots to detect car presence and RFID readers are embedded into parking gates to identify cars and help in the billing of the smart parking. Both types of devices are endowed with wired and wireless communication capabilities for reporting to a gateway where the situation recognition is performed. The sensor devices are tasked to play one of the three roles: (1) slave sensor nodes located on the parking spot to detect car presence/absence; (2) master nodes located at one of the edges of a parking lot to detect presence and collect the sensor readings from the slave nodes; and (3) repeater sensor nodes, also called """"anchor"""" nodes, located strategically at specific locations in the parking lot to increase the coverage and connectivity of the wireless sensor network. While slave and master nodes are placed based on geographic constraints, the optimal placement of the relay/anchor sensor nodes in smart parking is an important parameter upon which the cost and efficiency of the parking system depends. We formulate the optimal placement of sensors in smart parking as an integer linear programming multi-objective problem optimizing the sensor network engineering efficiency in terms of coverage and lifetime maximization, as well as its economic gain in terms of the number of sensors deployed for a specific coverage and lifetime. We propose an exact solution to the node placement problem using single-step and two-step solutions implemented in the Mosel language based on the Xpress-MPsuite of libraries. Experimental results reveal the relative efficiency of the single-step compared to the two-step model on different performance parameters. These results are consolidated by simulation results, which reveal that our solution outperforms a random placement in terms of both energy consumption, delay and throughput achieved by a smart parking network."""	actuator device component;aerial photography;anatomy, regional;chimeric antigen receptor;drug vehicle;electronic billing;embedded system;embedding;emergence;exanthema;expectation–maximization algorithm;greater;integer (number);integer programming;interference (communication);library (computing);linear programming;mathematical optimization;mosel vitelic corporation;multi-objective optimization;node - plant part;numerous;optimization problem;plant components, aerial;population parameter;radio frequency identification device;radio-frequency identification;reading (activity);relay device component;relevance;repeater device component;scalability;simulation;smart city;throughput;topology control;unmanned aerial vehicle;vertebral column;xpress;sensor (device)	Antoine B.

The findings of five previous SSPA and TWTA studies, including the 1991 European Space and Technology Center study, the 1993 National Aeronautics and Space Administration study, and three Boeing studies conducted in 2005, 2008, and 2013, are tabulated and summarized. The results of these studies are then compared with new analyses of two validated sources of amplifier data: a commercially licensed database, Seradata’s Spacetrak, and a publicly available database, Gunter’s Space Page. The new analyses consider a total of 18,902 amplifiers (6428 TWTAs, 2158 SSPAs, and 10,316 unspecified amplifiers) onboard 565 communications satellites launched from 1982 to 2016. This new study contains the largest number of satellites and amplifiers to date and compares output power, redundancy, and bandwidth capabilities. We find an increase in output power from the 1993 study of >200% for Ku-band TWTAs and C-band SSPAs, and >1000% increase for C-band TWTAs. The ratio of operational to redundant amplifiers is 10 times higher for TWTAs than SSPAs, and the majority of amplifiers over the past 30 years operate with bandwidth less than 100MHz. A second analysis is conducted using failure records and telemetry of 16 geostationary satellites equipped with 659 amplifiers: 535 SSPAs and 124 TWTAs. We find that <2% of TWTAs and 5% of SSPAs experience anomalies. Overall, this research was performed to update and clarify how the power and bandwidth needs and redundancy trends of the SatCom community have evolved over the past 30 years.

The case of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks present additional features such as the fact of transmitting multimedia rich data or the fact of having directional sensing areas. This paper presents a scheduling scheme for clustered nodes according to overlapped Field of View (FoV) regions. This approach schedules nodes applying coordination and collaborations among members of clusters to sense the environment while each cluster covers a specific region defined by the degree of overlapping FoV. The objective of this mechanism is to increase power conservation by avoiding similar sensing and redundant processing. Evaluation shows that the proposed scheduling reduces the average energy consumption and thus improves network lifetime.	field of view in video games;object detection;scheduling (computing);transmitter	Mohammad Alaei;José M.

The proposed algorithm is capable of determining both the localisation estimate and, if necessary, the orientation estimate of the nodes. Apart from that, it is able to cope with the random orientation of the nodes, especially in a randomly scattered sensor network application. Its cooperative approach is applicable whether there is a presence or absence of anchor nodes in the network, operating in a blind asynchronous DS-CDMA system. Many conventional positioning techniques suffer performance degradation in a multipath environment or near-far problem in a sensor network setting, thus compromising the reliability of the system. The approach put forward in this study thus addresses these issues and is also robust against other environmental uncertainties. A representative example is also included at the end to illustrate the idea as well as to highlight the effectiveness of the algorithm.		J. W. P.

IEEE802.15.4g operates at sub-GHz frequencies to offer 2⁻3× longer communication range compared to its 2.4 GHz counterpart. Although the standard offers 3 PHYs (Frequncy Shift Keying, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing and Offset-Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) with numerous configurations, 2-FSK at 50 kbps is the mandatory and most prevalent radio setting used. This article looks at whether IEEE802.15.4g can be used to provide connectivity for outdoor deployments. We conduct range measurements using the totality of the standard (all modulations with all further parametrization) in the 863⁻870 MHz band, within four scenarios which we believe cover most low-power wireless outdoor applications: line of sight, smart agriculture, urban canyon, and smart metering. We show that there are radio settings that outperform the """"2-FSK at 50 kbps"""" base setting in terms of range, throughput and reliability. Results show that highly reliable communications with data rates up to 800 kbps can be achieved in urban environments at 540 m between nodes, and the longest useful radio link is obtained at 779 m.

Ad-hoc networks may exhibit characteristics which make the use of traditional clock-synchronization algorithms infeasible. Recently, algorithms suitable for ad-hoc networks have been presented.We first propose an improvement to an existing algorithm. While needing less computation and no more communication or memory than the original algorithm, our new algorithm always yields equal or better results and thus outperforms the original algorithm. We then examine how even better synchronization can be obtained, possibly at the cost of additional computation, communication, and memory. To this end, we introduce a model for internal synchronization. This model allows us to find an algorithm which makes use of all the data a node can obtain from the network for a given communication pattern and thus provides optimal synchronization in our model."""	algorithm;clock synchronization;computation;happened-before;hoc (programming language);requirement;sensor;simulation;synchronization (computer science)	Lennart Meier;Philipp Blum;Lothar Thiele	2004		10.1145/989459.989471	clock synchronization;embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;theoretical computer science;self-clocking signal;distributed computing;data synchronization;synchronization;computer network	Embedded	10.623776880777216	82.75584573604552	63978

In this article, we propose a distributed range-free algorithm to improve localization accuracy by using one-hop neighbors as well as anchors. When an unknown node knows which nodes it can directly communicate with, but does not know how far they are exactly placed, the node should have a location having the average distance to all neighbors since the location minimizes the sum of squares of hop distance errors. In the proposed algorithm, each node initializes its location using the information of anchors and updates it based on mass spring method and Kalman filtering with the location estimates of one-hop neighbors until the equilibrium is achieved. Subsequently, the network has the shape of isotropic graph with minimized variance of links between one-hop neighbors. We evaluate our algorithm and compare it with other range-free algorithms through simulations under varying node density, anchor ratio, and node deployment method.	algorithm;hop-by-hop transport;kalman filter;refinement (computing);simulation;software deployment	Sangwoo Lee;Hyunjae Woo;Chaewoo Lee	2012	EURASIP J.

However, for this cooperation to be possible, all vehicles will have to be equipped with compatible wireless modules, based on, e.g. IEEE 802.11p (used in ITS-G5 or WAVE), which implements intelligent transport systems operating in the 5 GHz frequency band. During the implementation phase of the system, there will be many older vehicles without such equipment that can cause hazard as information about them will not be available to vehicles equipped with IEEE 802.11p modules. In this paper, we present a system to be used as a roadside unit (RSU), developed explicitly for infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication that can solve the aforementioned traffic safety problems. The system consists of a universal medium-range radar (UMRR) and an IEEE 802.11p modem integrated together to detect vehicles, with or without communication capabilities, and forward their position and speed vectors to vehicles, with IEEE 802.11p modules installed, for collision avoidance. Tests have been performed by using our system in parallel with vehicles in which IEEE 802.11p modules are installed and comparing the content in the Cooperative Awareness Messages obtained from both systems. Accuracy tests have been performed in order to verify the system, and Kalman filtering is applied on the radar data to improve the accuracy of the system further.	frequency band;kalman filter;modem;radar;wave	Dimitrios Vlastaras;Taimoor Abbas;Daniel Leston;Fredrik Tufvesson	2014	EURASIP J.

However, existing device-free solutions mainly use special sensors or active RFID tags, which are much more expensive compared to passive tags. In this paper, we propose a novel motion detection and tracking method using passive RFID tags, named Twins. The method leverages a newly observed phenomenon called critical state caused by interference among passive tags. We contribute to both theory and practice of this phenomenon by presenting a new interference model that precisely explains it and using extensive experiments to validate it. We design a practical Twins based intrusion detection system and implement a real prototype by commercial off-the-shelf RFID reader and tags. Experimental results show that Twins is effective in detecting the moving object, with very low location errors of 0.75 m in average (with a deployment spacing of 0.6 m).

First, the potential performance gain with channel assignment is strongly related to the accuracy of the utilized interference model. Usually simplified distance-based interference models are used, such as the 2-hop model, that has shown only poor accuracy in testbed validations. Thus, a measurement-based interference model has been developed in the scope of this thesis that outperforms the simplified distance-based models. Second, with the dawn of the Internet of Things, the number of co-located networks and devices operating in the unlicensed frequency spectrum is exploding. Therefore, channel assignment algorithms have to become aware of the radio activity of external networks. An external interference-aware channel assignment algorithm has been developed that uses a spectrum sensing software component to detect external sources of interference. First experimental results in a large-scale multi-radio testbed promise that our approach increases the accuracy of the interference estimation and leads to a higher network performance.	algorithm;component-based software engineering;interference (communication);internet of things;mesh networking;network performance;spectral density;testbed;wireless mesh network	Felix Juraschek	2013	"""2013 IEEE 14th International Symposium on """"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks"""" (WoWMoM)"""	10.1109/WoWMoM.2013.6583426	wireless mesh network;estimation;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;radio resource management;wireless network;interference;accuracy and precision;network performance;internet of things;statistics;computer network;testbed	Mobile	20.602159984590003	80.63662240733721	64796

In a typical long-haul sensor network, sensors are remotely deployed over a large geographical area to perform tracking and/or monitoring of one or more dynamic targets. A remote fusion center fuses the information provided by these sensors so that a final estimate of certain target characteristics - such as the position - is expected to possess much improved quality. However, imperfect communication conditions can become the bottleneck for desired estimation and fusion performance. The link-level loss and delay - such as that over a satellite channel - can easily reduce the chance that an estimate is successfully received by the fusion center, thereby limiting the potential information fusion gain and resulting in suboptimal accuracy performance of the underlying task. In this work, we explore the effect of information feedback in the context of state estimation and fusion in a communication-constrained long-haul sensor network. Different feedback configurations and schedules are proposed. In particular, the joint impact of communication delay/loss, information feedback, and computation constraints is explored by means of analytical and simulation studies.	computation;feedback;fuser (unix);geographic coordinate system;schedule (computer science);sensor;simulation	Qiang Liu;Xin Wang;Nageswara S.

The site survey is one part of the verification and optimization process of the network operator. Mobile network operators' responsibility is to ensure the broadly available, reliable network series that are essential for customer experience. Technically that means mobile network coverage of the desired area without holes and with good capacity. The operator performs network planning in order to optimize coverage and capacity. It is essential to know the antenna pattern to plan and design an effective and efficient mobile network. Antenna manufacturers provide antenna radiation patterns measured in the standard anechoic chamber. Understanding how real site implementation differs from the laboratory measurements is also crucial. This study focuses on developing in-situ antenna measurements for the antenna patterns recorded in the laboratory. The evaluation of antenna radiation patterns in a real environment will provide additional information about what kind of effect the antenna site mast, installation, and antenna performance parameters will have on the theoretical radiation pattern.

This method exploits a mobile sink equipped with a directional antenna to accomplish the desired task. In this paper we provide a careful analysis of the MoSBoD scheme in terms of energy efficiency and completion time (latency). Based on the results, we extend our previous work along two fronts. On the one hand, in order to improve the quality of the boundary identified using MoSBoD, we use a more restrictive definition of the boundary, which leads to reduced completion time for the boundary identification as well as to reduced energy consumption from the network. On the other hand, we propose a modification of the MoSBoD method which further reduces the completion time based on a selective increase of the duty cycles of sensor nodes. This strategy also increases the energy consumption. It is therefore required to carefully balance the expected reduction in the completion time with the increase in energy consumption. Thus, we also provide a deterministic model based analysis for energy consumption and completion time of the new boundary identification scheme, comparing it with the state-of-the-art.	duty cycle;identification scheme	Majid I.

In this work an approach is proposed which on a periodic basis it schedules the interfaces into active and inactive phases by using a layered state model and a tiered-based architecture. The model takes into account metrics like the signal strength and devices' capacity limitations, and encompasses them into the layered asynchronous scheduling scheme for end-to-end reliability and performance measures extraction. Each device schedules the next state (active, semi-sleep or sleep state) according to traffic and channel data rate measures, combined with the layered state scheme. Through the designed tiered architecture, and through experimental simulation, the proposed QoS energy-aware management scheme is thoroughly evaluated in order to meet the parameters' values where the optimal QoS and throughput response for each device/user is achieved.	data rate units;end-to-end principle;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);semiconductor industry;simulation;throughput;uml state machine	Constandinos X.

d1df7c046a351a815fef202a32e4b14b565c2b3b	construction of transmission timing control system using fpga for qzss short message synchronized ss-cdma communication		We have proposed synchronized Spread-Spectrum Code-Division Multiple-Access (SS-CDMA) communication for location and short message communication system using Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) as a safety confirmation system at the time of grade disaster. In this communication, the satellite reception timings of all uplink signals are synchronized using transmission timing control method in order to realize high-density user multiple access. Transmission timing control is performed using positioning / timing information obtained from QZSS and Global Positioning System (GPS). In this paper, we construct a transmission timing control system using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and evaluate transmission timing control error. As a result of the measurement, it is found that the transmission timing control error increases in proportion to the delay time, and it affects the satellite reception timing of the signal.	control system;field-programmable gate array;global positioning system;quasi-zenith satellite system;telecommunications link	Rei Kawai;Hiroshi Oguma;Suguru Kameda;Noriharu Suematsu	2017	2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190972	code division multiple access;global positioning system;field-programmable gate array;communications system;telecommunications link;real-time computing;synchronization;quasi-zenith satellite system;control system;computer science	Embedded	23.28923398946293	76.74507899210003	67094

This may be inefficient in energy constraint devices networks such as Cognitive Radio Wireless Sensor Network (CR-WSN). In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning based clustered Cooperative Channel Sensing (RL-CCS) that learns channels’ dynamic behaviors in terms of channel availability, sensing energy cost, and channel impairment to achieve optimal sensing sequence and optimal set of channels. The problem of selecting optimal policy is formulated as a Markov Decision Problem (MDP) to determine optimal solutions that minimize sensing energy while improving Primary User (PU) detection and channel utilization in CR-WSN. Simulation results show convergence and adaptability of the algorithm to dynamic environment in achieving optimal solutions. The results also indicate that with optimal channel sensing sequence and optimal sets of channels, sensing energy cost savings of 15.14% per channel sensing cycle can be achieved while improving PU detection accuracy and channel utilization compared to the sensing sequence based on Greedy search approach. Performance comparison of the proposed algorithm with other benchmark schemes indicates viability of our proposed approach over the other schemes in minimizing sensing energy and improving PU detection performance.

Coverage and lifetime are two paramount problems in a WSN due to constraint of associated battery power. All previous theoretical analysis on the coverage and lifetime is primarily focused on the random uniform distribution of sensors or some specific network scenarios (e.g., a controllable WSN). In this paper, we provide an analytical framework for the coverage and lifetime of a WSN that follows a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution. We also study the coverage and lifetime when the dimensions of Gaussian dispersion (i.e., x, y) admit different Gaussian parameters (i.e., standard deviation, sigmaxnesigmay). We identify intrinsic properties of coverage/lifetime in terms of Gaussian distribution parameters, which is a fundamental issue in designing a WSN. Following the results obtained, we further determine the sensor deployment strategies for a WSN that could satisfy a predefined coverage and lifetime. Two deployment algorithms are developed based on using our analytical models and are shown to effectively increase the WSN lifetime.	algorithm;code coverage;sensor;software deployment;time complexity	Demin Wang;Bin Xie;Dharma P.

A binary sensor is an extremely coarse sensor, capable of measuring data to only 1-bit accuracy. Our proposed stochastic framework employs a large number of cheap binary sensors operating in a noisy environment, yet collaboratively they are able to obtain accurate measurements. The main contributions of this paper are: (a) The theoretical accuracy analysis of the proposed stochastic binary sensor network, (b) an adaptive data collection framework based on the current measurements in order to reduce the energy consumption, and (c) a novel coding scheme for energy-efficient routing. To quantify the performance of our proposed stochastic approach, we present the simulation results of two stochastic binary sensor networks for anomaly detection using our proposed coding scheme and adaptive data gathering framework. For many scenarios, our proposed framework can reduce the energy consumption over the traditional approach by an order of magnitude.	1-bit architecture;anomaly detection;decade (log scale);emoticon;routing;sensor;simulation	Thinh P.

The general design of such sensor node is motionless, but the mobile sensor is useful in some aspects. Nodes can be distributed at any corner easily, move to a specific emergent area, or replace the power exhausted nodes. Mobile sensor nodes can increase the interaction between user and system. Moreover, the ability of auto-recharging for mobile sensor nodes can solve the powerlessness problem for sensor network. We had designed a mobile sensor node with compass to correct the direction of movement; six IR sensors let mobile nodes with the ability of obstacle avoidance. We propose an algorithm called triangular selection path planning (TSPP) method, and along with the dead-reckoning (DR) algorithm to merge heading readings from compass and two encoders mounted on the wheels to compute the dead-reckoned location estimation. With these technologies, our mobile sensor node can know their own position accurately and achieve the destination efficiently.	algorithm;course (navigation);dead reckoning;emergence;encoder;motion planning;obstacle avoidance;sensor node;wheels	Ren C.

Conventional power management in radio communication primarily focuses independently on the physical layer, medium access control (MAC) or routing and approaches differ depending on the levels of abstraction. At the physical layer, the fundamental trade-off that exists between transmission rate and energy is exploited. This leads to the lazy scheduling approach, which consists of transmitting with the lowest power over the longest feasible duration. At MAC level, power reduction techniques tend to keep the transmission as short as possible to maximize the radio's power-off interval. Those two approaches seem conflicting and it is not clear which one is the most appropriate for a given network scenario. In this paper, we propose a transmission strategy that combines both techniques optimally. We present a cross-layer solution to determine the best transmission strategy taking into account the transceiver power consumption characteristics, the system load and the scenario constraints. Based on this approach, we derive a low complexity, on-line scheduling algorithm that can be used to optimally organize the forwarding of the sensed information from cluster heads to the data sink (uplink) in a hierarchical sensor network. Results, considering Coded Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation, show that depending on the scenario, a 50% extra power reduction is achieved in a realistic uplink data gathering context, compared to the case where only transmission rate scaling or shutdown is considered.	access control;algorithm;image scaling;imperative programming;lazy evaluation;load (computing);modulation;network packet;online and offline;optimizing compiler;power management;principle of abstraction;routing;scheduling (computing);shutdown (computing);software deployment;telecommunications link;transceiver;transmitter	Sofie Pollin;Bruno Bougard;Rahul Mangharam;Liesbet Van der Perre;Francky Catthoor;Ragunathan Rajkumar;Ingrid Moerman	2005	Proceeedings of the Second European Workshop on Wireless Sensor Networks, 2005.	10.1109/EWSN.2005.1462021	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	12.43853380704717	82.84448917094373	67732
195e1479cea0857554c5b8b085de248c69018aa9	reducing cellular signaling traffic for heartbeat messages via energy-efficient d2d forwarding		Mobile Instant Messaging (IM) apps, such as WhatsApp and WeChat, frequently send heartbeat messages to remote servers to maintain always-online status. Periodic heartbeat messages are small in size, but their transmissions incur heavy signaling traffic to frequently establish and release communication channels between base stations and smartphones, known as signaling storm. Meanwhile, smartphones also need to activate cellular data communication module frequently for transmitting short heartbeat messages, resulting in substantial energy consumption. To address these issues, we propose a Device-to-Device (D2D) based heartbeat relaying framework, in order to reduce signaling traffic and energy consumption in heartbeat transmission. The framework selects the smartphones as relays to opportunistically collect heartbeat messages from nearby smartphones using energy-efficient D2D communication. The collected heartbeat messages are transmitted to the BS in an aggregated manner to reduce cellular signaling traffic. Based on the periods and the expiration time of the collected heartbeat messages, the framework schedules the transmissions of collected heartbeat messages to minimize signaling and energy consumption while satisfying time constrains. We implement and evaluate our solution on Android smartphones. The results from real-world experiments show that our solution achieves more than 50% signaling traffic reduction and up to 36% energy saving.	android;bittorrent;cell signaling;experiment;heartbeat message;instant messaging;mobile app;online advertising;prototype;relay;smartphone;transmitter;whatsapp messenger	Yanqi Jin;Fangming Liu;Xiaomeng Yi;Minghua Chen	2017	2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)	10.1109/ICDCS.2017.236	computer network;real-time computing;mobile instant messaging;energy consumption;computer science;efficient energy use;android (operating system);mobile telephony;server;heartbeat;base station	Mobile	14.544318918460686	84.29406818862478	67793

The goal of these data-gathering networks is a description of the process that provides the required fidelity with a minimum expenditure of energy. Our approach combines (1) channel coding and estimation/decision processing of coded messages for in-network data censoring with (2) estimation of the encoded and censored information at a fusion center where energy is plentiful. Nodes examine their own messages together with messages from preceding nodes, and compute the fidelity of the estimate at the next node as a function of data censoring proposals. Our algorithm exploits redundancy of two types: intra-message redundancy from channel coding, and inter-message redundancy due to spatio-temporal correlation of the samples. This redundancy is used to alleviate overall energy consumption and message congestion near the fusion center by allowing relaying nodes to censor messages that might otherwise be forwarded, if those messages can be inferred from other messages, given the correlation model. The effect of censoring on fidelity and energy consumption is characterized, and our censoring algorithm shown to provide significant energy savings.	algorithm;censoring (statistics);channel capacity;code word;fidelity of quantum states;forward error correction;network congestion;sensor;simulation	Sheryl L.

The indoor or outdoor localization of such a target has been widely addressed in the literature but if a third degree of freedom like rotation has to be also taken into consideration the difficulty in estimating the target position and orientation is significantly increased. A network consisting of only a small number of low cost infrared transmitters/receivers is used in this paper to estimate the position of a mobile target on a plane as well as its draft orientation with an angular step of 45 or less. The distance and orientation estimation is based on the success rate that infrared patterns are retrieved at the target. This success rate parameter is calculated by simple ultra low cost microcontrollers. The architectural complexity and cost of the overall localization system is significantly lower than other approaches without sacrificing speed and accuracy. An error correction scheme like Turbo decoding is applied in order to increase the reliability and stability of the results by correcting burst errors introduced by real time noise.	angularjs;cubic function;error detection and correction;microcontroller;transmitter	Nikos Petrellis;Fotios Gioulekas;Michael K.

Diversity navigation employing multiple sensing technologies can overcome the limitation of individual technologies, especially when operating in harsh environments such as indoors. To characterize the diversity of navigation systems in real environments, we performed an extensive measurement campaign, where data from heterogenous sensors were collected simultaneously. The performance of Bayesian navigation algorithms, relying on the particle filter implementation, is evaluated based on measured data from ultrawideband, ZigBee, and inertial sensors. This enables us to quantify the benefits of data fusion as well as the effect of statistical mobility models for real-time diversity navigation.	algorithm;bayesian network;gps navigation device;global positioning system;mobile device;particle filter;real-time web;sensor;ultra-wideband;variable (computer science)	Andrea Conti;Davide Dardari;Matteo Guerra;Lorenzo Mucchi;Moe Z.

Some of these new scenarios involve the assurance of predefined performance goals. To guarantee that these goals are achieved, a careful constant monitoring must exist. However, this monitoring depletes nodes energy (especially in middle nodes that have to retransmit the information to the sink), increases interference between nodes and causes an overhead in the used bandwidth, a foreseeable result if measuring performance of a large multilevel WSN. In the protocol to be presented, data fusion is used to enhance the benefits of continuous monitoring while minimizing its implied overhead, using the specific characteristics of WSNs in its favor.	data retrieval;interference (communication);overhead (computing);requirement;software deployment;tire-pressure monitoring system	Vasco Pereira;Edmundo Monteiro;Jorge Sá Silva	2016	NOMS 2016 - 2016 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium	10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502910	data modeling;communications protocol;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;data integration;database;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;measurement;computer network	Mobile	10.811825178665423	75.5192281344556	68208

Earlier systems have been deployed in order to demonstrate that indoor localisation can be done. Many researchers are referring to location estimation as a crucial component in numerous applications. There is no standard in indoor localisation thus the selection of an existing system needs to be done based on the environment being tracked, the accuracy and the precision required. Modern localisation systems use various techniques such as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Time of Arrival (TOA), Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and Angle of Arrival (AOA). This paper is a survey of various active and passive localisation techniques developed over the years. The majority of the localisation techniques are part of the active systems class due to the necessity of tags/electronic devices carried by the person being tracked or mounted on objects in order to estimate their position. The second class called passive localisation represents the estimation of a person’s position without the need for a physical device i.e. tags or sensors. The assessment of the localisation systems is based on the wireless technology used, positioning algorithm, accuracy and precision, complexity, scalability and costs. In this paper we are comparing various systems presenting their advantages and disadvantages. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

As a consequence, solutions for efficient and synergistic cooperation among objects acquire great relevance. Along this line, this paper focuses on the adoption of the promising MIFaaS (Mobile-IoT-Federation-as-a-Service) paradigm to support delay-sensitive applications for high-end IoT devices in next-to-come fifth generation (5G) environments. MIFaaS fosters the provisioning of IoT services and applications with low-latency requirements by leveraging cooperation among private/public clouds of IoT objects at the edge of the network. A performance assessment of the MIFaaS paradigm in a cellular 5G environment based on both Long Term Evolution (LTE) and the recent Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is presented. Obtained results demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms classic approaches, highlighting significant benefits derived from the joint use of LTE and NB-IoT bandwidths in terms of increased number of successfully delivered IoT services.

In particular, we explore the concept of the curvature of a wireless network via the clustering coefficient. Clustering coefficient analysis is a computationally simplified, semilocal approach, which nevertheless captures such a large-scale feature as congestion in the underlying network. The clustering coefficient concept is applied to three cases of indoor sensor networks, under varying thresholds on the link packet reception rate (PRR). A transition from positive curvature (“meshed” network) to negative curvature (“core concentric” network) is observed by increasing the threshold. Even though this paper deals with network curvature per se, we nevertheless expand on the underlying congestion motivation, propose several new concepts (network inertia and centroid), and finally we argue that greedy routing on a virtual positively curved network achieves load balancing on the physical network.	clustering coefficient;greedy algorithm;load balancing (computing);low-power broadcasting;network congestion;network packet;production rule representation;routing	Fariba Ariaei;Mingji Lou;Edmond A.

Accurate counting information (e.g., the distribution of the total number of targets) is often important for decision making. As a complementary solution to double-counting in communication, this paper presents the first work that deals with double-counting in sensing for wireless sensor networks. The probability mass function (pmf) of target counts is derived first. This, however, is shown to be computationally prohibitive when a network becomes large. A partitioning algorithm is then designed to significantly reduce computation complexity with a certain loss in counting accuracy. Finally, two methods are proposed to compensate for the loss. To evaluate the design, we compare the derived probability mass function with ground truth obtained through exhaustive enumeration in small-scale networks. In large-scale networks, where pmf ground truth is not available, we compare the expected count with true target counts. We demonstrate that accurate counting within 1%-3% relative error can be achieved with orders of magnitude reduction in computation, compared with an exhaustive enumeration-based approach.

A common complication for such postdisaster ad hoc communication is how to efficiently control the forwarding behaviors of relay nodes so as to save their energy consumption and buffer usage while simultaneously guaranteeing the desired delivery performance. Different from previous studies, we consider in this paper an explicit probabilistic stopping mechanism, where a relay node that is actively disseminating a message will stop spreading the message with a certain probability, after meeting another node having already received the message. Besides developing a two-dimensional Markov chain framework to characterize the message propagation process, we also derive the average time required for completion of message propagation, the probability distribution, the expectation, the variance of the fraction of nodes finally receiving the message, etc. Our results reveal that the explicit probabilistic stopping mechanism is very desirable for postdisaster communication, even being able to guarantee a majority of nodes in final message reception. What is more, the developed framework provides us a deeper understanding on how network parameters may affect these important performance metrics, which further enables network designers to accordingly tune controllable parameters.	early stopping;hoc (programming language);markov chain;mobile phone;performance;relay;scalability;software propagation	Jiajia Liu;Nei Kato	2016	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2466621	optimized link state routing protocol;routing;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;probabilistic logic;markov process;computer security;measurement;statistics;computer network	Mobile	12.970671497582478	88.36111548708432	68997

We introduce an M-M (multiple sensors to multiple targets) probabilistic target coverage problem and its service solution for the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in this paper to improve the utilization of randomly deployed sensors and to maximize the network lifetime as well. The intention of the M-M probabilistic target coverage problem is to detect/cover multiple targets by multiple sensors cooperatively and simultaneously, where each target is given a realistic detection probability threshold. We designed a heuristic algorithm to solve this problem. Simulation results show that the resulting network lifetime of our algorithm are longer than the target coverage approach, and our algorithm is more appropriate for the demand of the different observed target importance.	algorithm;existential quantification;heuristic (computer science);randomness;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;software deployment	Jau-Wu Huang;Chia-Mao Hung;Kai-Chao Yang;Jia-Shung Wang	2011	2011 17th IEEE International Conference on Networks	10.1109/ICON.2011.6168506	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;operating system;data mining;scheduling;computer network	Robotics	12.783382411219684	77.85545846061702	69207

Recent studies have demonstrated that using rechargeable sensor nodes with energy harvesting capability has a great potential to extend the network lifetime. However, due to the high cost of rechargeable nodes, equipping every node with an energy harvesting unit is not practical in a large scale WSN. In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing the network lifetime of a hybrid WSN consisting of both common nodes and rechargeable nodes. Furthermore, we consider a new confident information coverage model which is more efficient for environment monitoring applications. We propose a novel priority-based greedy scheduling (PGS) algorithm to schedule the sensor nodes into a series of set covers that are activated sequentially, each satisfying the required coverage. Also, it can effectively exploit the advantages of using collaboration among sensors for the coverage requirement. Our simulations validate that the PGS algorithm can provide substantial performance improvement as compared to other peer algorithms.	greedy algorithm;rechargeable battery;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation	Zehui Xiong;Bang Wang;Zhongsi Wang	2015	2015 11th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks (MSN)	10.1109/MSN.2015.20	job shop scheduling;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	11.090372186218547	79.52960362893224	69260

In this paper we present a number of information theoretic bounds on the performance of a distributed transmission array that is formed by a large number of cheap, unreliable sensors. We formulate this problem in terms of classical network information theory concepts, formulation which leads us to consider two important cases: transmission of correlated sources over multiple independent channels, and rate/distortion with separate encoders.	distortion;distributed transmission system;encoder;information theory;sensor;stochastic process	João Barros;Sergio D.

Since the data collected by sensor nodes are forwarded to the sink, therefore proper placement of sinks has a great impact on the performance of the WSNs. This paper introduces two sink placement strategies and discusses their advantages and disadvantages in comparison with an existing strategy. The two strategies are compared with the Geographic Sink Placement (GSP) [3] strategy which is used as a benchmark. Both GSP and proposed two strategies are implemented and evaluated in a simulation environment. Performances of these strategies are analyzed and analysis results are presented in this paper. It has been observed that the proposed strategies exhibit better performances with respect to energy usage and lifetime in comparison with GSP.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);contract net protocol;guardian service processor;network performance;performance;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;software deployment	Debasree Das;Zeenat Rehena;Sarbani Roy;Nandini Mukherjee	2013	2013 Fifth International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)	10.1109/COMSNETS.2013.6465578	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	10.210542265532613	78.58433030838398	69313

However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing results is derived under a mobility model which is able to reproduce the power law+exponential tail dichotomy of the pairwise node intercontact time distribution which has been observed in traces of several real opportunistic networks. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: first, we present a simple pairwise contact model-called the Home-MEG model-for opportunistic networks based on the observation made in previous work that pairs of nodes in the network tend to meet in very few, selected locations (home locations); this contact model is shown to be able to faithfully reproduce the power law+exponential tail dichotomy of intercontact time. Second, we use the Home-MEG model to analyze flooding time in opportunistic networks, presenting asymptotic bounds on flooding time that assume different initial conditions for the existence of opportunistic links. By comparing asymptotic bounds with the results of simulations performed using a realistic human mobility model, we demonstrate the capability of the proposed Home-MEG model to faithfully predict the speed of information spreading in large-scale opportunistic networks. Finally, our bounds provide some analytical evidences that the speed of information spreading in opportunistic networks can be much faster than that predicted by simple geometric mobility models.	bluetooth;initial condition;magnetoencephalography;malware;markov chain;simulation;software propagation;tcp congestion control;tail call;time complexity;tracing (software);unicast	Luca Becchetti;Andrea E.

Apart from providing healthcare professionals with extensive logs of a patient's physiological history, BANs can be used to identify and react to emergency situations. We identify three important factors that afflict wireless communication in BANs: impermeability of the human body to radio waves at frequencies commonly used in BANs, efficient operation in mobile and time-varying environments, and mission-critical requirements for quick response to emergencies. An understanding of the link layer behavior of wireless sensor nodes placed on the body is crucial to address these and other challenges such as reducing energy consumption and increasing network lifetime.  In this paper, we investigate link layer behavior by placing nodes on the body and directly measuring metrics of interest to engineers such as packet delivery ratio (PDR) and RSSI. Emulating a possible real-life BAN operating at the 2.4 GHz band with 12 sensor nodes, we collect over 80 hours of data from 14 volunteers in $3$ different environments that BANs are expected to operate in. We analyze the data to reveal several link layer characteristics to provide insight and guidelines for the designing of BANs. We also evaluate the performance of common routing metrics on our data.  Our analysis helps us make the following conclusions. Link PDR is highly affected by the environment and not significantly by the volunteer for the experiment. Routing between nodes on the same side of the body is preferred to routing between nodes on the opposite sides. For links with the same source, failure of packet transmission to a certain node, in some cases, implies the increased probability of reception for other nodes. Most errors occur in bursts of length 1, but a small fraction occur in longer periods ($40$ packets or more).	burst error;design review (u.s. government);emulator;mission critical;network packet;radio wave;real life;requirement;routing;sensor web	Anirudh Natarajan;Buddhika de Silva;Kok-Kiong Yap;Mehul Motani	2009		10.1145/1614320.1614347	link layer;human body;telecommunications;computer science;body area network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;wireless;computer network;rmon	Mobile	10.57847892338734	85.1755378075568	69519

To achieve this, we explore the design and development of a multiband global navigation satellite system (GNSS) front-end which is intrinsically capable of synchronizing side channel information from non-RF sensors, such as inertial measurement units and integrated power meters, to allow the simultaneous production of substantial amounts of sampled spectrum while also allowing low-cost, real-time monitoring and logging of detected RFI events. While the inertial measurement unit and barometer are not used in the RFI investigation discussed, the design features that provide for their precise synchronization with the RF sample stream are presented as design elements worth consideration. The designed system, referred to as Four Independent Tuners with Data-packing (FITWD), was utilized in a data collection campaign over multiple European and Scandinavian countries in support of the determination of the relative occurrence rates of L1/E1 and L5/E5a interference events and intensities where it proved itself a successful alternative to larger and more expensive commercial solutions. The dual conclusions reached were that it was possible to develop a compact low-cost, multi-channel radio frequency (RF) front-end that implicitly supported external data source synchronization, and that such monitoring systems or similar capabilities integrated within receivers are likely to be needed in the future due to the increasing occurrence rates of GNSS RFI events.	analog;bands;cns disorder;catastrophic interference;conceptualization (information science);conflict (psychology);data collection;deploy;dual;dynamic range;embedded system;embedding;entity name part qualifier - adopted;interference (communication);interpretation (logic);l band;large;manuscripts;neoplasm metastasis;numerous;out-of-band agreement;radio frequency;real-time clock;sampling - surgical action;satellite navigation;set packing;side-channel attack;solutions;subgroup;sensor (device)	Aiden Morrison;Nadezda Sokolova;James Thomas Curran	2018		10.3390/s18082594	software deployment;engineering;electronic engineering;synchronization;radio frequency;inertial measurement unit;side channel attack;front and back ends;electromagnetic interference;gnss applications	Mobile	20.334684267074874	79.96478196133512	69603

Due to the use of an impulsive signal to achieve very wide bandwidth transmission in UWB, it is also possible to achieve high precision ranging and positioning. Therefore, application of UWB is widely researched in ITS radars, indoor ranging and positioning, etc. One of the important applications of UWB in ITS is an on-board radar for safety driving to avoid incident in advance. In UWB radar, each vehicle transmits UWB signal and waits for the reflected wave from the target vehicle and the round trip time of the transmitted signal is measured to obtain the distance against the target vehicle. In this process, the distance and relative velocity against the target vehicle can be derived. In this paper, the UWB radar system assisted by communication is proposed in order to improve safety by obtaining additional information of the target vehicle by communication. Moreover, by combining communication with the UWB radar, it is possible to improve precision of ranging against the distant vehicles. The basic characteristics are examined by computer simulation.	computer simulation;frequency band;on-board data handling;radar;ultra-wideband;velocity (software development);waits	Hiroki Takahara;Kohei Ohno;Makoto Itami	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety (ICVES 2012)	10.1109/ICVES.2012.6294272	electronic engineering;geography;telecommunications;remote sensing	Robotics	23.502562853478732	76.95876446986688	69770

One of major concerns is to derive bounds on the number of edge-disjoint directed paths (or highways). However, it is non-trivial to obtain bounds on the number of directed highways in DIR networks since the conventional undirected percolation theory cannot be directly used in DIR networks. In this paper, we exploit the directed percolation theory to derive bounds on the number of directed highways. In particular, we make new constructions in bond directed percolation model. We show that with high probability there are at least Ω(√n/log log √n) directed highways in a network with n nodes, which is much tighter than the existing results in DIR networks.	directed percolation;graph (discrete mathematics);hoc (programming language);percolation theory;with high probability	Raymond Chi-Wing Wong;Wei Zhang;Liqun Fu	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343533	throughput;combinatorics;telecommunications;computer science;directional antenna;wireless network;lattice;mathematics;computer network	Arch	14.021468991701504	87.630261255285	69807
df1a89f319a8aa3e085b2037804152f9b954c60d	a fusion approach of rssi and lqi for indoor localization system using adaptive smoothers	communications;networks;and	Due to the ease of development and inexpensiveness, indoor localization systems are getting a significant attention but, with recent advancement in context and location aware technologies, the solutions for indoor tracking and localization had become more critical. Ranging methods play a basic role in the localization system, in which received signal strength indicator(RSSI-) based ranging technique gets the most attraction. To predict the position of an unknown node, RSSI measurement is an easy and reliable method for distance estimation. In indoor environments, the accuracy of the RSSI-based localization method is affected by strong variation, specially often containing substantial amounts of metal and other such reflective materials that affect the propagation of radio-frequency signals in nontrivial ways, causing multipath effects, dead spots, noise, and interference. This paper proposes an adaptive smoother based location and tracking algorithm for indoor positioning by making fusion of RSSI and link quality indicator (LQI), which is particularly well suited to support context aware computing. The experimental results showed that the proposed mathematical method can reduce the average error around 25%, and it is always better than the other existing interference avoidance algorithms.

We formulate the Multi-View Assignment Problem (MVAP) as a quadratic mixed-integer problem, and show that it is NP-hard. We propose a polynomial time $4$-approximation based on a transformation of MVAP to a General Assignment Problem with dependent profits in which items are sets of sensors with an overlapping field of view, and based on a reduction of the set of items to be assigned. We show that the reduction of the set of items does not affect the solution of the problem if it results in the dominating set of items. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to optimal for small systems, performs well even if the reduction finds an approximately dominating set, and scales well with the number of sensors in the system.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;assignment problem;computational complexity theory;computational resource;dominating set;fog computing;generalized assignment problem;greedy algorithm;np-hardness;numerical analysis;polynomial;sensor;time complexity;unmanned aerial vehicle	Emil Eriksson;György Dán;Viktoria Fodor	2016	2016 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2016.7849015	mathematical optimization;simulation;mathematics;distributed computing	AI	18.057621326274468	80.26544370812246	70110

Understanding the potential of this platform for both me sh and single-hop networks is becoming more important as smart antennas begin to appear in emerging networking standards. Prior attempts to test non-stan dard antenna platforms have typically focused around simulations, fixed (non-s teerable) directional antenna testbeds, and small scale temporary setups utilizing 1 o r 2 phased array antenna nodes over the span of a few hundred meters.

c0935cdc9e55651ae4dd33c8263ccebf6884afdd	redundancy reduction for indoor device-free localization		To improve localization accuracy, device-free passive localization studies usually deploy a number of sensor nodes in indoor environments, which causes redundant features and produces large data volumes and high deployment costs. This paper proposes the concept of a two-level redundancy and formulates the node reduction problem as a redundancy control problem. With the goal of using fewer nodes while maintaining high localization accuracy, a method is proposed to control the two-level redundancy efficiently and reduce the number of nodes greatly. Experiments are performed in two completely different environments. The proposed method is able to maintain accuracy levels above 90% and can efficiently reduce the total number of nodes by 59.09% in a large room (150 $${\mathrm{m}}^2$$ m 2 ) and by 68.75% in a small room (25 $${\mathrm{m}}^2$$ m 2 ). Furthermore, due to reduced nodes the proposed method can drastically reduce the needed amount of localization data and the hardware costs.	approximation algorithm;experiment;feature selection;increment and decrement operators;internationalization and localization;local-density approximation;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;partial least squares regression;principal component analysis;selection algorithm;software deployment;transmitter	Jinjun Liu;Ning An;Md.

Multiple transmitters send data to a common receiver whose only source of energy is a finite size battery which is recharged only from the energy harvested from incoming RF signals. The nodes access the channel randomly resulting in a packet collision when multiple transmitters simultaneously access the channel. The receiver takes samples from the received RF signal to calculate the probability of a collision. The objective is to maximize the receiver goodput subject to the instantaneous availability of receiver energy. We develop an asymptotically optimal dynamic control algorithm, where the receiver makes an energy harvesting or decoding decision according to the current channel measurements and battery level.	access network;asymptotically optimal algorithm;collision domain;goodput;network packet;radio frequency;randomness;transmitter	Yunus Sarikaya;Ozgur Ercetin	2017	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2017.2701818	wireless wan;wireless network;radio receiver design;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;base transceiver station;wi-fi array;fixed wireless	Mobile	14.805495741482602	83.10769200130586	70272

A mobile robot navigates through the sensor deployment area broadcasting its positional estimate and the uncertainty in its estimate. Distributed computationally-inexpensive, discrete-time Kalman Filters, implemented on each static sensor node, fuse information obtained over time from the robot to decrease the uncertainty in each node's location estimate. On the other hand, due to dead reckoning and other systematic errors, the robot loses positional accuracy over time. Updates from GPS and from the localized sensor nodes serve in improving the localization uncertainty of the robot. A Continuous-Discrete Extended Kalman Filter (CD EKF) running on the mobile robot fuses information from multiple distinct sources (GPS, various sensors nodes) for robot navigation. This two-part procedure achieves simultaneous localization of the sensor nodes and the mobile robot. Also presented is an adaptive localization strategy to navigate the mobile robot to the area of least localized sensor nodes. This ensures that the robot maneuvers to an area where the sensor nodes possess the largest uncertainty in location, so that it can maximize the usefulness of its positional information in best localizing the overall network.	dead reckoning;extended kalman filter;global positioning system;internationalization and localization;mobile robot;robotic mapping;sensor node;software deployment	Koushil Sreenath;Frank L.

Due to the constraints of limited sensing range, it is of great importance to design node coordination mechanism for reliable tracking so that at least the target can always be detected with a high probability, while the total network energy cost can be reduced for longer network lifetime. In this paper, we deal with this problem considering both the unreliable wireless channel and the network energy constraint. We transfer the original problem into a dynamic coverage problem and decompose it into two subproblems. By exploiting the online estimate of target location, we first decide the locations where the mobile nodes should move into so that the reliable tracking can be guaranteed. Then, we assign different nodes to each location in order that the total energy cost in terms of moving distance can be minimized. Extensive simulations under various system settings are employed to evaluate the effectiveness of our solution.	robotics;sensor;simulation;software deployment	Yifei Qi;Peng Cheng;Jing Bai;Jiming Chen;Adrien Guenard;Yeqiong Song;Zhiguo Shi	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2584000	embedded system;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;wireless site survey;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;sensor;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;mobile computing;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	12.623927485207666	77.89138948463606	70488

This paper presents a lightweight and distributed inter-user interference mitigation (IIM) scheme, that can be easily integrated with the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol stack. The proposed scheme takes into consideration the generic property of low channel utilization in BSNs and enables affected BSNs to adaptively reschedule their transmission time or switch channels. Based on the detected information from neighboring BSNs, BSNs reschedule their transmissions in a distributed and coordinated manner, so that wireless channels can be effectively utilized by multiple BSNs. Moreover, the IIM scheme is performed only when the performance of the BSN is degraded to an unacceptable level due to severe interference to reduce the rescheduling cost. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the network throughput by 18% and reduces the energy consumption by 22% as compared with the existing beacon schedule scheme.	interference (communication)	Wen Sun;Yu Ge;Lawrence Wai-Choong Wong	2013	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2013.09.013	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	11.660469835866495	83.4012852048091	70618

The stationary antennas on the islands are connected to high-speed commercial computer networks, which are available on practically all inhabited islands at the Aegean sea, thus implementing a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

The wavefield space is the signal space spanned by the channel parameters which characterize the multipath fading environment, Using this basic intuition it is possible to reliably transmit data at rates exceeding the famous Shannonian spectral efficiency of Logz (1 + SNR) bit/see/Hz where SNR is the signal-tonoise ratio over the bandwidth occupied by the signal. This exciting possibility has generated significant interest in the communications community. However, it is not clear at this point how a realistic and cost-effective radio could take advantage of such an enhancement. WJ Communications has invested significantly in the reasearch of this subject and sponsored the study of a new transmission scheme, STREAMT~, [Spatial Transmission with Radio Enhanced Adaptive Modulation] able to achieve very high speed bandwidth-efficient wireless data communications in arbitrary environment: outdoor/indoor, mobile/fixed, lineof-sight/obstructed.

7ce0158a1331c5d72228a9ac3fcdd389e471a793	cramer-rao bound for aoa-based vlp with an aperture-based receiver		Visible light positioning (VLP) for indoor applications has recently received considerable attention. In this paper, an aperture based receiver is considered and the position is estimated based on the angle-of-arrival (AOA), because the AOA can be determined by comparing the relative differences in the received signal strengths (RSS) in the different photodiodes (PDs) of the receiver. Hence, in contrast to RSS based positioning solutions, knowledge of the transmitted signal strengths is not required. The performance of the proposed approach depends on the transmitted signal strength only through the dependency on the signal-to-noise ratio. To evaluate the accuracy of the estimates of the AOA, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound, and show that the expected error on the AOA is very small. Applying triangulation to determine the position of the receiver, it follows that centimetre accuracy can be obtained with the aperture-based receiver.	angle of arrival;rss;signal-to-noise ratio	Heidi Steendam;Thomas Q.

89327f95efe4b5ee1f7d8692a5bf0b9456212037	confident information coverage hole healing in hybrid industrial wireless sensor networks		The emergence of coverage holes will dramatically degrade the quality of service of the industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs). Based on the novel confident information coverage (CIC) model, this work focuses on how to heal the CIC holes in hybrid IWSNs containing both static nodes and mobile nodes. We pinpoint the CIC hole healing (CICHH) problem with the goal of selecting and dispatching some randomly scattered mobile nodes to the CIC holes detected by the stationary nodes such that the CIC holes can be repaired and the CIC performance can be satisfied, and prove its NP-completeness. For handling the CICHH problem, we devise two energy-efficient heuristic solutions including a centralized CICHH algorithm and a distributed one. Both the proposed schemes aim at efficiently healing the CIC holes while minimizing the total moving energy consumption of the dispatched mobile nodes, or maximizing the mobile nodes’ average remaining energy after movement, or minimizing the maximum mobile energy consumption of each dispatched mobile node. Experimental simulation results show the proposed schemes can energy-efficiently heal the CIC holes and outperform three peer algorithms in terms of energy efficiency and coverage ratio.	algorithm;centralized computing;emergence;heuristic;np-completeness;quality of service;randomness;simulation;stationary process	Xianjun Deng;Zujun Tang;Laurence Tianruo Yang;Man Lin;Bang Wang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2017.2764038	computer science;wireless sensor network;wireless;energy consumption;computer network;quality of service;efficient energy use;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Mobile	10.579841427663785	79.29777172602859	71063

103ac969380f2000831774fdcd1d19958b444f2a	optimization of cognitive radio secondary information gathering station positioning and operating channel selection for iot sensor networks		The Internet of Things (IoT) is the interconnection of different objects through the internet using different communication technologies. The objects are equipped with sensors and communications modules. The cognitive radio network is a key technique for the IoT and can effectively address spectrum-related issues for IoT applications. In our paper, a novel method for IoT sensor networks is proposed to obtain the optimal positions of secondary information gathering stations (SIGSs) and to select the optimal operating channel. Our objective is to maximize secondary system capacity while protecting the primary system. In addition, we propose an appearance probability matrix for secondary IoT devices (SIDs) to maximize the supportable number of SIDs that can be installed in a car, in wearable devices, or for other monitoring devices, based on optimal deployment and probability. We derive fitness functions based on the above objectives and also consider signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and position constraints. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used to find the best position and operating channel for the SIGSs. In a simulation study, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with a random resources allocation algorithm (parts of this paper were presented at the ICTC2017 conference (Wen et al., 2017)).	cognitive radio	Wen Jinyi;Qin Yang;Sang-Jo Yoo	2018	Mobile Information Systems	10.1155/2018/4721956	the internet;software deployment;computer network;wireless sensor network;interconnection;cognitive radio;computer science;wearable technology;distributed computing;communication channel;particle swarm optimization	Mobile	17.467124750591545	80.6402394023098	71434

Using the random connection model, we study the unreliability of wireless secondary links in CR ad hoc networks, which has not been well studied in the existing literature. By introducing two auxiliary random graphs and using continuum percolation theory, we study the impacts of key system parameters on connectivity and transmission delay in a CR network. We first characterize three behavioral regions of connectivity for a secondary network, i.e., disconnectivity, long-term connectivity and instantaneous connectivity regions. We show that the unreliability of secondary links does not affect the disconnectivity region, but affects the long-term connectivity and instantaneous connectivity regions. Using the ergodic theorem, we then study the scaling behavior of transmission delay with respect to the distance between two randomly chosen secondary users in a connected secondary network for two cases. Specifically, when propagation delay is negligible, we show that transmission delay scales linearly and sub-linearly with distance in the long-term connectivity and instantaneous connectivity regions, respectively. When propagation delay is considered, we show that transmission delay scales linearly with respect to distance in both the long-term connectivity and instantaneous connectivity regions.	cognitive radio;continuum percolation theory;ergodic theory;ergodicity;hoc (programming language);key;propagation delay;random graph;randomness;regional lockout;software propagation;triune continuum paradigm	Yushan Liu;Ying Cui;Xinbing Wang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2463816	wireless ad hoc network;transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;interference;wireless;computer network	Mobile	14.011845253709883	87.80493742295006	71981

Most of the existing distributed TDMA scheduling techniques can be classified as either static or dynamic. The primary purpose of static TDMA scheduling algorithms is to improve the channel utilization by generating a schedule of smaller length. But, they usually take longer time to schedule, and hence, are not suitable for WSNs, in which the network topology changes dynamically. On the other hand, dynamic TDMA scheduling algorithms generate a schedule quickly, but they are not efficient in terms of generated schedule length. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for TDMA scheduling in WSNs, which can generate a compact schedule similar to static scheduling algorithms, while its runtime performance can be matched with those of dynamic scheduling algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed distributed TDMA scheduling algorithm has the capability to trade-off schedule length with the time required to generate the schedule. This would allow the developers of WSNs, to tune the performance, as per the requirement of prevalent WSN applications, and the requirement to perform re-scheduling. Finally, the proposed TDMA scheduling is fault-tolerant to packet loss due to erroneous wireless channel. The algorithm has been simulated using the Castalia simulator to compare its performance with those of others in terms of generated schedule length and the time required to generate the TDMA schedule. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm generates a compact schedule in a very less time.	analysis of algorithms;data rate units;distributed algorithm;fault tolerance;network packet;network topology;run time (program lifecycle phase);scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Ashutosh Bhatia;R.

In this work, we deal with the power consumption problem in one application of WSNs: objects tracking in a monitored region. Different protocols have been proposed to minimize the energy consumption in such environments. Most of them are based in prediction techniques to know in advance the locations of the object, taking advantage of this information to switch off the sensor nodes as much as possible. However, little work has been done to utilize regularity in the object's behavior to reduce energy consumption. In this paper we propose a profile-based algorithm (PBA) that aims to use the information contained in the network and in the object itself to optimize energy consumption, thus extending lifetime. Simulations show that this method outperforms prediction-based strategies for a wide range of predictability values	algorithm;communications protocol;computation;computer simulation;pre-boot authentication;sensor	Oscar Garcia;Alejandro Quintero;Samuel Pierre	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications	10.1109/WIMOB.2006.1696370	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Robotics	11.23498694944332	77.02802467878294	72149
1512f19f1bf14c3ad7ab09145a4b3f7125c1b6c3	quantifying sensing quality of crowd sensing networks with confidence interval		Quantifying sensing quality is fundamentally important for crowd sensing networks. Existing works which focus on quantifying the sensing quality of individual user are not applicable for that of the overall crowd sensing networks. However, it is nontrivial to quantify the sensing quality of crowd sensing networks for two main challenges. First, it is difficult to quantify the sensing quality of crowd sensing networks with the uncertainty, originating from the noisy sensing data and the complex inference of sensing information. Even worse, it is nearly impossible to conduct multiple times of repeated evaluation experiments to quantify the uncertain sensing quality based on the statistical information in crowd sensing networks, due to the dynamic nature of networks and the uncontrolled mobility of users. To address these challenges, inspired by the channel capacity, we investigate the physical essence of sensing quality deeply, and propose a confidence-interval based metric to quantify the uncertain sensing quality, leveraging the lower bound of sensing variance. Moreover, we exploit the Fisher Information of the crowd sensing data to compute the confidence interval without repeating evaluation experiments for multiple times. The extensive simulations demonstrate that our method can achieve a more accurate sensing quality for crowd sensing networks than the status quo methods.	channel capacity;digital footprint;experiment;fisher information;simulation;uncontrolled format string;vii	Chaocan Xiang;Panlong Yang;Xiaochen Fan;Liangyi Gong	2017	2017 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computed, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)	10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397538	fisher information;distributed computing;computer science;noise measurement;confidence interval;inference;exploit;channel capacity	Mobile	14.482726589052	77.3665807026204	72511

However, combining the power saving schemes is yet to be investigated in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a power saving scheme combining power management and power control simultaneously for wireless sensor networks. We perform real testbed experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed power saving scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that we can reduce power consumption of sensor nodes using the proposed scheme at an expense of marginal decrease in delivery ratio.	artificial intelligence;experiment;marginal model;power management;software deployment;testbed	Md.

The algorithm differs form other cooperative localization algorithms in which it does not require nodes to disclose their location or even to measure (or share) their mutual distances. This is achieved by a combination of two factors: a) a novel closed-form statistical relationship between the hop- and Euclidean-distances of distributed random Breadth Search First (BSF) paths; and b) novel multihop localization algorithms. The results, compared against conventional multihop distance collection indicate that, remarkably, the privacy offered by the proposed cooperative localization algorithm does not incur any significant sacrifice in accuracy.	algorithm;bean scripting framework;breadth-first search;cooperative mimo;emoticon;euclidean distance;privacy;routing	Golaleh Rahmatollahi;Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu;Stefano Severi	2011	2011 Conference Record of the Forty Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (ASILOMAR)	10.1109/ACSSC.2011.6190273	computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Robotics	17.47753543699348	77.33131261568798	72917
6abf69805c3c01558369c525e95b2477f8b7e9f5	exploiting the use of convolutional neural networks for localization in indoor environments		Indoor localization has been an active research area for the last two decades. A great number of sensors have been applied in the task of localization, some with high computational and energy demands, like laser beams, or with issues related to the coverage area, for example, by making use of images obtained by a network of cameras. A different approach, that presents less energy demands and a wide area of coverage, can be created by means of signal strength of wireless networks. The open issue with signal strength is it high instability due to interferences, attenuation and fading; which, in general, makes the localization systems to present less than desired accuracy. In this article we exploit the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) in the task of localization. The main motivation behind the employment of ConvNets is its inherent ability of feature extraction, which we believe can deal better with the noise without a filtering step. We evaluate how ConvNets can be employed and which are the best topologies that lead to the lowest errors.		Bruno V. Ferreira;Eduardo Carvalho;Mylena R.

In this paper, we study the survivability properties of time-varying networks against unpredictable interruptions. We first show that the traditional definition of survivability is not effective in time-varying networks, and propose a new survivability framework. To evaluate the survivability of time-varying networks under the new framework, we propose two metrics that are analogous to MaxFlow and MinCut in static networks. We show that some fundamental survivability-related results such as Menger's Theorem only conditionally hold in time-varying networks. Then we analyze the complexity of computing the proposed metrics and develop approximation algorithms. Finally, we conduct trace-driven simulations to demonstrate the application of our survivability framework in the robust design of a real-world bus communication network.	approximation algorithm;dynamic connectivity;max-flow min-cut theorem;maximum flow problem;menger sponge;menger's theorem;simulation;telecommunications network;time-varying network	Qingkai Liang;Eytan Modiano	2016	IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524490	computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;complex network;computer network	Vision	14.193709578840586	86.67961251749932	73011

Due to the growing number of mobile users and global connectivity, one of the most critical issues regarding the design of universal mobile telecommunications service (UMTS) networks pertains to the assignment of Node Bs to radio network controllers (RNCs), which is an NP-hard problem. Hence, for real-sized mobile networks, this problem cannot be practically solved by using exact methods. This paper proposes a hybrid genetic algorithm (HA) with migration to solve the problem of assigning Bs to RNCs as a design step of large-scale UMTS mobile networks. Computational results obtained from extensive tests confirm the effectiveness of the HA to provide superior solutions compared to other heuristic methods that are well documented in the literature. Such an algorithm is particularly suitable to design large-scale cellular mobile networks with Node Bs whose quantity varies between 100 and 500 and whose the number of RNCs ranges between five and ten.	computation;experiment;genetic algorithm;global optimization;heuristic;location (geography);memetic algorithm;mobile phone;population;refinement (computing);tabu search;the offspring	Alejandro Quintero;Samuel Pierre	2008	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2007.912601	cellular network;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;operating system;evolutionary algorithm;computer network	Mobile	18.581979835426587	85.94519497995934	73360

In this paper, we formulate this problem as a decision problem, whose goal is to determine whether every point in the service area of the sensor network is covered by at least k sensors, where k is a given parameter. The sensing ranges of sensors can be unit disks or non-unit disks. We present polynomial-time algorithms, in terms of the number of sensors, that can be easily translated to distributed protocols. The result is a generalization of some earlier results where only k =1 is assumed. Applications of the result include determining insufficiently covered areas in a sensor network, enhancing fault-tolerant capability in hostile regions, and conserving energies of redundant sensors in a randomly deployed network. Our solutions can be easily translated to distributed protocols to solve the coverage problem.

Sleep scheduling is one of the efficient strategies to achieve energy saving. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for the sleep scheduling, which is based on Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP). A sleep scheduling algorithm with online planning (Dec-POP-SSA) with respect to Dec-POMDP is also presented. In Dec-POMDP, due to the hardness of obtaining the state spaces and the reward with mold-free environment, quasi-Monte Carlo is applied to collect state spaces such that the real-time acquisition of beliefs state is achieved, and the reward is evaluated in tracking reward and coverage connectivity intensity. Instead of producing the entire plan, Dec-POP-SSA need only find actions for the current step. We also give the theoretical analysis on the upper bound for Dec-POP-SSA. The numerical experiments show that Dec-POP-SSA may receive the highest reward.	algorithm;experiment;linear network coding;markov chain;monte carlo method;network congestion;numerical analysis;partially observable markov decision process;quasi-monte carlo method;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);sensor;sleep mode	Jing Zhang;Li Xu;Shuming Zhou;Xiucai Ye	2014	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-014-1354-z	fair-share scheduling;quasi-monte carlo method;real-time computing;simulation;wireless sensor network;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds	Robotics	14.154997030790925	81.54239600621084	73724

The motivation for the implementation of digital radio compression is the high bandwidth requirements associated to its transport, which has a critical impact in the cost of an optical transport network, such as the fronthaul networks in the context of Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architectures. An important aspect that must be taken into account in the development of access networks, and C-RAN in particular, is the end-to-end latency, including the compression overhead, which must be compliant with the standard imposed limits. The compression algorithm implemented in the context of this work, in addition to achieve considerable compression ratios with acceptable Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) degradation, features a low latency and reduced hardware complexity. The EVM evaluation is based on two laboratorial setups: the first one devoted to the separate evaluation of the compression technique, and the second one based on a C- RAN-like testbed with the integration of a Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) optical link and a power amplifier.	algorithm;audio power amplifier;c-ran;common public radio interface;companding;compaq lte;data compression;dynamic range;elegant degradation;end-to-end principle;interrupt latency;multiplexing;nonlinear system;overhead (computing);radio access network;requirement;software deployment;testbed	Gustavo Anjos;Jorge A.

Power-constrained wireless sensor networks are usable as long as they can communicate sensed data to a processing node. Sensing and communications consume energy, therefore judicious power management and sensor scheduling can effectively extend network lifetime. To cover a set of targets with known locations when ground access in the remote area is prohibited, one solution is to deploy the sensors remotely, from an aircraft. The lack of precise sensor placement is compensated by a large sensor population deployed in the drop zone, that would improve the probability of target coverage. The data collected from the sensors is sent to a central node (e.g. cluster head) for processing. In this paper we propose un efficient method to extend the sensor network life time by organizing the sensors into a maximal number of set covers that are activated successively. Only the sensors from the current active set are responsible for monitoring all targets and for transmitting the collected data, while all other nodes are in a low-energy sleep mode. By allowing sensors to participate in multiple sets, our problem formulation increases the network lifetime compared with related work [M. Cardei et al], that has the additional requirements of sensor sets being disjoint and operating equal time intervals. In this paper we model the solution as the maximum set covers problem and design two heuristics that efficiently compute the sets, using linear programming and a greedy approach. Simulation results are presented to verify our approaches.	active set method;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);linear programming;maximal set;organizing (structure);power management;requirement;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;sleep mode;transmitter	Mihaela Cardei;My T.

The goal of the nano-biosensor network is to detect a target signal that propagates via Brownian motion in the monitoring area. Three simple nanomachine placement strategies are investigated: random, proportional, and regular placement. In the random placement, nanomachines are distributed randomly over the area. In the proportional placement, more nanomachines are placed where signals appear more frequently. In the regular placement, nanomachines are distributed to maintain a specific distance from adjacent nanomachines. Three placement strategies are evaluated through simulation based on the mean residence time which is defined as the average amount of time that a target signal stays in the monitoring area. Our simulation results show that the regular placement performs best when signal arrival locations follow normal distribution. Simulation results are also provided to show the impact of nanomachine failure on the mean residence time.	brownian motion;gnu nano;nanonetwork;nanorobotics;randomness;sensor;simulation	Yutaka Okaie;Tadashi Nakano	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214068	telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;mobile computing	EDA	14.51427990530555	85.36508123425874	74723

We first examine static models, where each link of the network is functional (active) with some probability, independently of all other links, where the probability may depend on the distance between the two nodes. We obtain analytical upper and lower bounds on the critical density for phase transition in this model. We then examine dynamic models, where each link is active or inactive according to a Markov on- off process. We show that a phase transition also exists in such dynamic networks, and the critical density for this model is the same as the one for static networks under some mild conditions. Furthermore, due to the dynamic behavior of links, a delay is incurred for any transmission even when propagation delay is ignored. We study the behavior of this transmission delay and show that the delay scales linearly with the Euclidean distance between the sender and the receiver when the network is in the subcritical phase, and the delay scales sub-linearly with the distance if the network is in the supercritical phase.	euclidean distance;interrupt latency;markov chain;percolation;propagation delay;software propagation	Zhenning Kong;Edmund M.

At detection thresholds Td ≥ −62dBm, long-term spectrum holes were dominant on all Wi-Fi channels. However, at Td < −62dBm channel availability decreased making CR operation more challenging. Wi-Fi traffic was dominated by management packets which correlated strongly with channel occupancy and far exceeded data and control packets. We noted management and data packet redundancies in the current IEEE 802.11 standard causing inefficient spectrum utilization. About 2/3rd of management packets were beacons, and more than 1/2 of data packets were data-reserved and null (no data). We also noted, at Td ≤ − 82dBm, a large number of Wi-Fi users more than can be attributed to the immediate surroundings of sensors, but a small set of them was dominant producing the bulk of spectrum occupancy and interference. In addition, at least 25% of these users were detected only once over the 5.5 hours measurement time span. The measurements showed spatial variations of the Wi-Fi environment over a small sensing area (21m-by-45m). We noted considerable non-homogeneity in the distribution of Wi-Fi interference at Td ≥ −62dBm, but some non-homogeneity at Td ≤ −82dBm. We also noted significant correlated fluctuations of received signal strength and non-reciprocal links over short distances between sensors.	cognitive radio;global positioning system;interference (communication);link building;network packet;sfiaplus;sensor;software deployment	Salim A.

We consider a class of such networks where sensors take measurements of one or more dynamic targets and send state estimates of the target(s) to a fusion center via satellite links. The severe loss and delay inherent over the satellite channels render insufficient the number of estimates successfully arriving at the fusion center, thereby limiting the potential fusion gain and resulting in suboptimal accuracy performance of the fused estimates. The system can adopt certain retransmission-based transport protocols so that lost messages can be recovered over time. However, excess delay may be incurred that can potentially violate the deadline for reporting the estimate. For many applications, though, retrodiction/smoothing techniques can be applied so that the chances of incurring such excess delay are greatly reduced. In this work, we analyze the extent to which retrodiction, along with message retransmission, can improve the performance of delay-sensitive state estimation tasks. Results of numerical and simulation studies of an illustrative example and a ballistic target tracking application are shown in the end to demonstrate the validity of our analysis.	geographic coordinate system;lossy compression;numerical analysis;offset binary;requirement;retransmission (data networks);sensor;simulation;smoothing;system requirements	Qiang Liu;Xin Wang;Nageswara S.

Due to limited communication resources, the network selects only a subset of sensor measurements for estimation or detection as long as the resulting fidelity is tolerable. We present a distributed sampling scheme based on the concept of innovations diffusion to select the sensor nodes. In the proposed scheme, sensor selection is accomplished through local communication and signal processing. In order to conserve energy and prolong system lifetime, the proposed algorithm selects a nearly minimum number of active sensors to ensure a desired fidelity for each working period.

Wireless backhaul with stationary or moving nodes is one of the best candidate use-cases. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis on the architecture and design of mmW transceiver with automatic gain control (AGC) for mobility management. The focus is on the RF component requirements, especially, power amplifiers, low-noise amplifier and antennas as well as on their impact on the link-budget.

Here, each node of the investigated WSN may be randomly and alternatively in an ACTIVE status or a SLEEP status. When a referenced sensor node is in an ACTIVE status, it may generate data packets with a given stochastic process and may transmit/receive a data packet with a random period of time. However, when the referenced sensor node is in a SLEEP status, it may only be able to stochastically generate date packets but not transmit/receive. If all possible next-hop nodes of the referenced node are in SLEEP statuses, we will say the environment of the referenced node to be in an OFF period. If there exists at least one next-hop node of the referenced node to be in ACTIVE status, we will say that its environment is in an ON period. In this shorter paper, we first derive the steady-state probability distribution of number of data packets in the referenced node and then obtain the distribution function for a node to be in an ON period and in an OFF period, respectively. The novelty of this note is in its development of a stochastic model in WSN with active/sleep feature and the explicit results obtained for above two performance characteristics. These results are expected to be useful as the fundamental results in the theoretic analysis and design of various WSNs with active and sleep status consideration.	network packet;randomness;sensor node;steady state;stochastic process;theory	Wei Wayne Li	2011	2011 4th IFIP International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security	10.1109/NTMS.2011.5721073	probability distribution;wireless ad hoc network;stochastic process;real-time computing;exposed node problem;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network	Embedded	13.548634972657561	85.70258064802253	76179

One of such fundamental communication tasks is broadcast, also known as a 1-to-all communication. We present a randomized algorithm that accomplishes broadcast in OD+log1/i¾? rounds with probability at least 1-i¾? on any uniform-power network of n nodes and diameter D, when each station is equipped with its coordinates and local estimate of network density. Next, we develop algorithms for the model where no estimate of local density is available, except of the value n of the size of a given network. First, we provide a simple and almost oblivious algorithm which accomplishes broadcast in ODlognlogn+log1/i¾? rounds with probability at least 1-i¾?. We further enhance this algorithm with more adaptive leader election routine and show that the resulting protocol achieves better time performance OD+log1/i¾?logn with probability at least 1-i¾?. Our algorithms are the first provably efficient and well-scalable randomized distributed solutions for the global broadcast task in the ad hoc setting with coordinates. This could be also contrasted with the complexity of broadcast by weak devices, for which such scalable algorithms with respect to D and logn cannot be obtained [11].		Tomasz Jurdzinski;Dariusz R.

In this paper, to achieve energy efficiency and quick reaction to real time event monitoring, a novel algorithms for collecting WSN data based on clustering is proposed. The algorithm depends on the similarity to cluster sensor nodes. In every cluster, only one representative node needs to report its data. Hence, the time slots of other nodes can be saved. When there is an event monitoring query offered by users, the query evaluation can return a query answer as soon as possible. Significant reaction time then can be saved. Furthermore, with the reduced reaction time, less sensor nodes are involved in the data communication, the energy efficiency can also be achieved in terms of transmission because of longer sleeping time can be guaranteed.

Selecting best sensor deployment has a dependence on the deployment environments. Existing works address sensor deployment within three types of environments including one dimensional line, 2-D field and 3-D space. However, in many applications the deployment environments usually have network structures, which cannot be simply classified as the three types. The deployed locations and communications of sensor nodes are limited onto the network edges, which make the deployment problem distinct from that in other types of environments. In this paper, we study sensor deployment in network-structured environments and aim to achieve k-coverage while minimizing the number of sensor nodes. Furthermore, we jointly consider the optimization of sink deployment and routing strategies with the goal to minimize the network communication cost of data collection. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to tackle sensor/sink deployment under the deployment constraints imposed by the network structure. The hardness of the problems is shown. Polynomial-time algorithms are proposed to determine optimal sensor/sink deployment and routing strategies in tree-topology network structure. Efficient approximation algorithms are proposed for the general graph network structure and their performances are analyzed. Theoretical results and extensive simulations show the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.	approximation algorithm;baseline (configuration management);data structure;ibm notes;mathematical optimization;microsoft research;network topology;optimization problem;performance;polynomial;routing;sensor;simulation;software deployment;time complexity;tree network;unified model;xfig	Shuguang Xiong;Lei Yu;Haiying Shen;Chen Wang;Wei Lu	2012	2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195455	wireless sensor network;deployment diagram;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;approximation algorithm;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	12.23670487500121	78.57078800653744	76430

ITS make it possible to imagine a future in which cars will be able to foresee and avoid collisions, navigate the quickest route to their destination, making use of up-to-the minute traffic reports, identify the nearest available parking slot and minimize their carbon emissions. Also demand for voice, data and multimedia services, while moving in car increase the importance of broadband wireless systems [1]. Efforts are being imparted towards the convergence of mobile communications, computing and remote sensing. Spread spectrum based digital RADAR can be utilized as a remote sensing device in ITS. This paper reviews the development of DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) based digital RADAR. It is quite capable of detecting target in the open field. The experiments carried out for different standard target like flat plates, spheres etc. are also reviewed. The operational digital RADAR is capable of rejecting interference, but fails in a strong multipath scenario. Again RAKE processing is established in communication. The approach is implementing RAKE processing at the RADAR receiver to exploit multipath.	experiment;gps navigation device;interference (communication);multipath propagation;radar;rake;requirement;sensor	Amutha Jayakumar;Asha Durafe	2011		10.1145/1980022.1980363	electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	23.10576109624776	78.00446777776177	76610

Although their application may vary greatly, WSNs share a common set of characteristics such as a limited energy supply and simple hardware. A common issue related with the application of WSNs is sensor localization, for some types of applications it is important that the sensors know the relative or absolute position of other sensors in the network, such as surveillance of monitoring networks. If sensors are randomly placed they may resort a wide range of methods such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) or received signal strength indicators (RSSI). In this work we present an alternative to relative sensor localization by employed a crossed dipole antenna in the reception and a known polarization in the transmission.

For this purpose, the expected energy consumption for downloading remaining chunks to be received is stochastically modeled by considering the time-varying wireless network conditions and video characteristics. Then, based on the derived energy model as well as the mobile device’s remaining battery energy, the proposed HARCS scheme adaptively selects the video quality level of each chunk. Measurement results show that HARCS can extend the video playback time up to 57.64% when compared with the conventional adaptation scheme that only considers the wireless network status.	download;elegant degradation;hypertext transfer protocol;mobile device	Sung-Woong Jo;Wonsuk Yoo;Jong-Moon Chung	2018	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2820685	wireless network;computer network;battery (electricity);real-time computing;computer science;energy consumption;wireless;mobile device;video quality;upload	Mobile	11.456128294898802	86.84031152018078	77098

We first model a practical multi-hop M2M communication network that takes various network dynamics into consideration. Then, we mathematically derive the distributed optimal duty cycle control policy to optimise the energy efficiency, end-to-end delay and transmission reliability. Finally, a RL based practical duty cycle control is developed to learn the optimal policy directly without priori network information, which contributes to the smart duty cycle control under various network dynamics. Simulation results show that the proposed RL based duty cycle control achieves the best balance between optimality and stability, compared with the optimal and the existing IEEE 802.15.4 duty cycle controls.	access control;algorithm;duty cycle;end-to-end principle;internet of things;machine to machine;mathematical optimization;network packet;q-learning;reinforcement learning;simulation;telecommunications network	Yun Li;Kok Keong Chai;Yue Chen;Jonathan Loo	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)	10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247384	communications protocol;real-time computing;logic gate;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;reliability;computer security;statistics;computer network	Robotics	11.955781176737464	85.60072455421542	77168

While a GPS receiver in each node would be ideal, in many cases an approximation algorithm is necessary for networks with only a few GPS enabled nodes. These algorithms however require collaboration of large portions of the network, thus imposing an overhead for nodes which do not need positioning, or are mobile. We propose Local Positioning System (LPS), a method that makes use of local node capabilities – angle of arrival, range estimations, compasses and accelerometers, in order to internally position only the groups of nodes involved in particular conversations. Localized positioning enables position centric uses, like discovery, flooding and routing in networks where global positioning is not available.	angle of arrival;approximation algorithm;central processing unit;computer simulation;geographic routing;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);lightweight portable security;network packet;overhead (computing);preprocessor;scalability;transformation matrix	Dragos Niculescu;B.

The most common dual-band communication for sensor network applications use 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz radios. There are now some testbeds such as Flocklab and Twonet that allow experimentation with dual-radio systems. However, there is no widely accepted efficient and comprehensive mechanism to survey all the channels of the dual band systems during networking experiments. In this work, we evaluate two mechanisms that can survey the RF environment in multiple channels in both the bands concurrently. We implement these two mechanisms on Twonet and evaluate them. We find that the channel scanning methodology is generally sound but sometimes static channel assignment may be attractive due to its simplicity.	experiment;radio frequency;testbed	Shengrong Yin;Omprakash Gnawali;Philipp Sommer;Branislav Kusy	2014	2014 IEEE 11th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MASS.2014.30	wireless site survey;telecommunications;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	18.98906056439712	78.39311383621936	77242

The constraint on trajectory of the mobile sink causes the different connection time between the mobile sink and the sensor node, which might result in the imbalance depletion of energy. We propose here an efficient data gathering policy to jointly consider the constrainedmobility of the sink and the different connection time at the sensor node.The policy increases the network lifetime in wireless sensor networks with path-constrained mobile sink by optimizing the assignment sensor node. In addition, we also propose the policy to cope with the overlapped connection time of the sink and sensor node due to the movement of the sink. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policy: by carefully considering the trajectory of the sink and effectively assigning the sensor node, the network lifetime is increased.	benchmark (computing);depletion region;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;hot spare;iteration;recursion;scheduling (computing);sensor node;simulation;social inequality;subgradient method;total variation diminishing	Thong Huynh;Won-Joo Hwang	2015	IJDSN	10.1155/2015/679093	real-time computing;telecommunications;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	10.679364666882716	79.25027082097769	77404

Numerous localization schemes have been proposed, among which mobile-anchor-node-assisted localization (MANAL) can reduce costs and overcome environmental constraints. A mobile anchor node (MAN) provides its own location information to assist the localization of sensor nodes. Numerous path planning schemes have been proposed for MANAL, but most scenarios assume the absence of obstacles in the environment. However, in a realistic environment, sensor nodes cannot be located because the obstacles block the path traversed by the MAN, thereby rendering the sensor incapable of receiving sufficient three location information from the MAN. This study proposes the obstacle-tolerant path planning (OTPP) approach to solve the sensor location problem owing to obstacle blockage. OTPP can approximate the optimum beacon point number and path planning, thereby ensuring that all the unknown nodes can receive the three location information from the MAN and reduce the number of MAN broadcast packet times. Experimental results demonstrate that OTPP performs better than Z-curves because it reduces the total number of beacon points utilized and is thus more suitable in an obstacle-present environment. Compared to the Z-curve, OTPP can reduce localization error and improve localization coverage.	approximation algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;broadcasting (networking);motion planning;network packet;node - plant part;rendering (computer graphics);z curve	Rong-Guei Tsai;Pei-Hsuan Tsai	2018		10.3390/s18030889	engineering;electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;rendering (computer graphics);obstacle;real-time computing;motion planning;network packet;broadcasting	Robotics	15.563122223781614	75.4852068172234	77637

However, previous works on data collection assume that a node can transmit data to any node within its transmission range, which is not reasonable in CWSNs. To ensure that the previous works can be applied in CWSNs, this paper focuses on the joint channel and sink assignment problem, which is a critical preparatory work for data collection in CWSNs. Because the capacity performance of a CWSN is usually considered as a key problem in fundamental understanding, we are interested in finding a joint channel and sink assignment for each sensor node, such that the minimum capacity of all sensor nodes is maximized. We formulate our problem as a mixed integer linear program by some elaborate mathematical skills. Then, two algorithms based on greedy strategy and linear relaxation technique are proposed. Extensive simulations results show that our algorithms are efficient and able to achieve near-optimal performance.

A large class of these problems---including probabilistic inference, regression, and control problems---can be solved by message passing on a data structure called a junction tree. In this paper, we present a distributed architecture for solving these problems that is robust to unreliable communication and node failures. In this architecture, the nodes of the sensor network assemble themselves into a junction tree and exchange messages between neighbors to solve the inference problem efficiently and exactly. A key part of the architecture is an efficient distributed algorithm for optimizing the choice of junction tree to minimize the communication and computation required by inference. We present experimental results from a prototype implementation on a 97-node Mica2 mote network, as well as simulation results for three applications: distributed sensor calibration, optimal control, and sensor field modeling. These experiments demonstrate that our distributed architecture can solve many important inference problems exactly, efficiently, and robustly.	computation;data structure;distributed algorithm;distributed computing;experiment;mathematical optimization;message passing;node (computer science);optimal control;prototype;routing;sensor node;simulation;software deployment;systems architecture;tree decomposition	Mark A.

This is due to its fine time resolution, energy efficiency and robustness to interference in harsh environments. This paper presents a thorough applied examination of prototype IEEE 802.15.4a impulse UWB transceiver technology to quantify the effect of line of sight (LOS) and non line of sight (NLOS) ranging in real indoor and outdoor environments. The results included draw on an extensive array of experiments that fully characterize the 802.15.4a UWB transceiver technology, its reliability and ranging capabilities for the first time. The goal of this work is to validate the technology as a dependable wireless communication mechanism for the subset of sensor network localization applications where reliability and precision positions are key concerns.

Because most of WSN applications occur at indoor environment, the requirements of reliability and precision of ranging or localization become the key concerns of the development of indoor location system. GPS, which is widely used in outdoor applications such as vehicle navigation, has been proved that cannot be implemented in an indoor environment (Hein, Rodriguez, Wallner, Eissfeller, & Hartl, 2007). For short to medium range, various wireless systems such as the WiFi, ZigBee, and RFID may provide ranging or location information with different levels of precision (Liu, Darabi, Banerjee, & Liu, 2007; Gu, Lo, & Niemegeers, 2009). Ultra Wide Band (UWB) stands out providing high accuracy of ranging estimation due to its fine time resolution, energy efficiency. IEEE 802.15.4a UWB transceiver technology is emerging as an ideal fit for the requirements of the next generation wireless sensor network (Di Benedetto, Kaiser, Molisch, Oppermann, Politano, & Porcino, 2005). IEEE has recognized the need to standardize UWB technology for use in personal area networks (PANs) and has established the IEEE 802.15.4a standard specifying a new UWB physical layer for WSNs (IEEE, 2007). Accurate range-based localization depends on a precise ranging measurement of the wireless sensor systems. Generally, distance estimates can be computed out based on the measurements of different parameters such as received signal strength (RSS), angle of arrival (AOA) and time of arrival (TOA) of every two signals exchanged between them. However, UWB techniques employing RSS methods cannot obtain accurate ranging estimates due to its strong dependence on the channel parameters, which makes the received energy more sensitive to distance changes in NLOS areas. AOA methods can facilitate accurate ranging when the UWB signal bandwidth is increased, but it needs multiple antennae that make system larger and costly. TOA parameter based methods provide more accurate range estimates but lower cost compared to the RSS and the AOA. The IEEE 802.15.4a standard based on an impulse UWB signal supports a TOA ranging mechanism (IEEE, 2007). Extensive researches have focused on the design of distance estimation algorithms based on UWB signals in the last few years (Dardari, Conti, Ferner, Giorgetti, & Win, 2009; Güvenç, Sahinoğlu, & Orlik, 2006; Sahinoglu, Gezici, & Güvenc, 2008; Yu, Montillet, Rabbachin, Cheong, & Oppermann, 2006). In general, these studies proposed scenarios for optimizing the accuracy based on the time of arrival method. Only a few studies mention practical aspects such as the design of real ranging architecture and reliability of distance estimation. Some UWB based systems can already be found in the market such as the UBISENSE UWB location system; these expensive systems utilize UWB for distance estimation with different methods and algorithms. Employing prototype fully IEEE 802.15.4a compliant transceiver technology, the world’s first IEEE 802.15.4a UWB wireless packet was transmitted and successfully coherently received in real-time in March 2009 (Connell, 2009). This impulse UWB prototype transceiver technology can easily be placed in the next generation Wireless WSN category and reduce the cost and complexity of the system deployment. The goal of this paper is to examine the characterization, reliability and ranging precision of IEEE 802.15.4a impulse UWB based transceiver for both indoor and outdoor environments. A real ranging implementation based on double sided two way ranging algorithm as part of this work is described in detail. To fully test the reliability of the IEEE 802.15.4a UWB ranging system, a distance measuring experiment is firstly implemented in an indoor environment to investigate the case of LOS with multi-path, and also the case of NLOS with different materials, for instance, chair, counter, door and walls; secondly, the outdoor open field case is evaluated with reflections are presented at the receiver. These aspects are not usually considered in the existing studies, but have an important impact on the implementation of real system ranging data processing and supplying real results for the next ranging optimization work. 14 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/experimental-evaluation-ieee-802ultra/66859?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Computer Science, Security, and Information Technology.

84311a23aca79b3720574b5fb1b1be8df2114b48	optimal status update for age of information minimization with an energy harvesting source		In this paper, we consider a scenario where an energy harvesting sensor continuously monitors a system and sends time-stamped status updates to a destination. The destination keeps track of the system status through the received updates. We use the metric Age of Information (AoI), the time that has elapsed since the last received update was generated, to measure the “freshness” of the status information available at the destination. Our objective is to design optimal online status update policies to minimize the long-term average AoI, subject to the energy causality constraint at the sensor. We consider three scenarios, i.e., the battery size is infinite, finite, and one unit only, respectively. For the infinite battery scenario, we adopt a best-effort uniform status update policy and show that it minimizes the long-term average AoI. For the finite battery scenario, we adopt an energy-aware adaptive status update policy, and prove that it is asymptotically optimal when the battery size goes to infinity. For the last scenario where the battery size is one, we first show that within a broadly defined class of online policies, the optimal policy should have a renewal structure. We then focus on a renewal interval, and prove that the optimal policy should have a threshold structure, i.e., if the AoI in the system is below a threshold when an energy arrival enters an empty battery, the sensor should store the energy first and then update when the AoI reaches the threshold; otherwise, it updates the status immediately. Simulation results corroborate the theoretical bounds.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;best-effort delivery;causality;replay attack;simulation	Xianwen Wu;Jing Yang;Jingxian Wu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking	10.1109/TGCN.2017.2778501	battery (electricity);infinity;mathematical optimization;asymptotically optimal algorithm;mathematics;information age;energy harvesting;minification	Metrics	16.855911090186915	82.876288179551	78257

However, even though it have proven good scalability and suitability for real-time communications, but static scheduling lacks of adaptability in several situations by not admitting some real-time flows where slots remain available. To solve mentioned problem, in this paper, we propose an adaptive cluster-based scheduling scheme for real-time flows by utilizing the time slots for flows according to type of flows such as inside or outside cluster. So, the proposed scheme can achieve better utilization of channel by minimizing the number of unused channels for real-time flows than static scheme through new adaptive TDMA scheduling scheme . Simulation results show that more flows are admitted and delivered within the deadline in the proposed scheme by utilizing unused time slots accordingly.	algorithm;real-time clock;routing;scalability;scheduling (computing);sensor node;simulation	Ali Gohar;Kyong Hoon Kim;Ki-Il Kim	2016	Comput.

Due to physical limitations, previous works have only considered recharging a single node at a time, which has limited efficiency and scalability. Recent advance on multi-hop wireless charging is gaining momentum to provide fundamental support to address this problem. However, existing single-node charging designs do not consider and cannot take advantage of such opportunities. In this paper, we propose a new framework to enable multi-hop wireless charging using resonant repeaters. First, we present a realistic model that accounts for detailed physical factors to calculate charging efficiencies. Second, to achieve balance between energy efficiency and data latency, we propose a hybrid data gathering strategy that combines static and mobile data gathering to overcome their respective drawbacks and provide theoretical analysis. Then we formulate multi-hop recharge schedule into a bi-objective NP-hard optimization problem. We propose a two-step approximation algorithm that first finds the minimum charging cost and then calculates the charging vehicles' moving costs with bounded approximation ratios. Finally, upon discovering more room to reduce the total system cost, we develop a post-optimization algorithm that iteratively adds more stopping locations for charging vehicles to further improve the results. Our extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithms can handle dynamic energy demands effectively, and can cover at least three times of nodes and reduce service interruption time by an order of magnitude compared to the single-node charging scheme.	approximation algorithm;genetic algorithm;interrupt;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;rechargeable battery;routing;scalability;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation	Cong Wang;Ji Li;Fan Ye;Yuanyuan Yang	2015	2015 IEEE 35th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	10.1109/ICDCS.2015.22	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	12.281291003102535	79.90701836489355	78389
0c59e04b78c0dc6a8f94f8ae58fcd54db1519374	wireless interface agent for sdn mmwave multi-hop networks: design and experimental evaluation		Millimeter wave (mmwave) communications will likely be an enabler for 5G due to its multi-gigabit per second throughput capabilities. Furthermore,mmWave communications will have to be integrated in a new redesigned network required by 5G to fulfill its ambitious targets. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a management agent for wireless devices deployed in a heterogeneous SDN wireless multi-hop research platform featuring mmwave communications for crosshauling (backhaul and fronthaul) purposes. The performance of the deployed mmwave network, based on the IEEE 802.11ad standard, is measured employing this agent. We measure the downtime in the presence of link up/down events, with obtained response times in the order of 10s-to-100s of milliseconds depending on the case. Furthermore, the TCP performance over the multi-hop 802.11ad mmwave network is also experimentally evaluated. In fact, TCP throughput up to around 800Mbps are obtained for single and multi-hop scenarios despite neighboring links using the same channel. Finally, one can also observe the impact of MTU size on TCP throughput, which may hinder the full exploitation of the mmWave link capacity when combined with other transport technologies, since the advantages of big MTUs (much bigger than the typical 1500 bytes) offered by mmwave devices may not be reaped.	backhaul (telecommunications);byte;data rate units;downtime;experiment;gigabit;intelligent user interface;management agent;software-defined networking;throughput	Jorge Baranda;Iñaki Pascual;Josep Mangues-Bafalluy;José Núñez-Martínez	2018		10.1145/3264492.3264495	throughput;mesh networking;wireless;computer network;wireless network interface controller;downtime;backhaul (telecommunications);management agent;computer science;communication channel	Mobile	21.150241872345752	87.74790793874186	78423

In this paper, a combined routing path selection and power allocation strategy is presented that is especially designed for distributed detection in sensor networks with a serial topology. The objective is to minimize the global probability of detection error of the serial network under a total network power constraint. The cross-layer approach for the selection of a routing path through the network is based on the local observation SNR of the sensors as well as fading conditions and is efficiently implemented by a backward greedy algorithm. After the routing path is established, a subsequently performed power allocation algorithm aims to optimally distribute a total power budget with respect to the detection performance of the sensor network.	greedy algorithm;routing;sensor;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio	Daniel Bielefeld;Gernot Fabeck;Rudolf Mathar	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5494229	routing;electronic engineering;static routing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;resource management;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;brooks–iyengar algorithm;signal processing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;path vector protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Embedded	15.944635319730878	79.62638110157458	78435

Two types of the node distribution are considered: a uniform distribution of the Cartesian coordinates and a uniform distribution of the polar coordinates. The focus here is on the one-hop neighborhood of the specific node. The nodes of network are in a disk having its radius equal to the transmission range of the nodes. This approach highly simplifies calculation of the link probabilities in a network. The simulation results indicate an acceptable accuracy of the proposed mathematical expressions even in a widely used random geometric graph model of the network in the rectangle area.	cartesian closed category;clique (graph theory);degree distribution;geometric graph theory;hoc (programming language);hop-by-hop transport;random geometric graph;simulation	Nihad Borovina;Branislava Perunicic-Drazenovic	2012		10.1145/2386980.2386994	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;degree distribution;mathematics;distributed computing	Mobile	14.524131049359248	87.5628396177795	78853

With the increase in sensor nodes, data forwarding, route selection, network reliability and data accuracy are vital characteristics of WSNs that suffer from the growth in scale. In this paper, we propose a data fusion based approach to drastically improve network lifetime, reduce excessive network load, and improve overall WSN performance. Our proposed approach utilizes employment of data fusion to intelligently select a subset of nodes with information needed for the data fusion, while removing all redundant nodes without impacting the fused data quality. We also introduce two methods for reducing the number of sensor nodes in a generic estimation problem using data fusion for reliability improvement of the sensed data in the presence of noise. The first method is based on observation similarity, while the second method leverages convex optimization. Our results show that our proposed methods can greatly improve large-scale WSN operation efficiency.	convex optimization;data quality;mathematical optimization;operand forwarding;sensor	Mohammadreza Soltani;Michael Hempel;Hamid Sharif	2015	2015 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2015.7289257	real-time computing;convex optimization;wireless sensor network;computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;data mining;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;reliability;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	11.3293409580576	75.31029297756723	79097

We propose the concept of virtual chain, where an edge may correspond to a multihop data propagation path to conserve power. In contrast, an edge in previous work can only be a costly direct communication link. Furthermore, we propose a power-efficient leader scheduling scheme which selects the node that has the maximum residual power to be the leader of the chain. In contrast, nodes in previous work play the role of leader by turns, which results in nonuniform energy consumption among sensors. Simulation results show that our strategies successfully conserve power.	algorithm;computation;linear programming;minimum spanning tree;pegasus;scheduling (computing);sensor;shortest path problem;simulation;software propagation;time complexity	Li-Hsing Yen;Ming-Zhou Cai;Yang-Min Cheng;Ping-Yuan Yang	2005	Proceeedings of the Second European Workshop on Wireless Sensor Networks, 2005.	10.1109/EWSN.2005.1462023	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Embedded	11.239895266746542	80.03207001377899	79513

21da637c30692702c94f333391ab39c11a6b8f6f	orchestra: robust mesh networks through autonomously scheduled tsch	wireless sensor network;scheduling;tsch;rpl	Time slotted operation is a well-proven approach to achieve highly reliable low-power networking through scheduling and channel hopping. It is, however, difficult to apply time slotting to dynamic networks as envisioned in the Internet of Things. Commonly, these applications do not have pre-defined periodic traffic patterns and nodes can be added or removed dynamically.  This paper addresses the challenge of bringing TSCH (Time Slotted Channel Hopping MAC) to such dynamic networks. We focus on low-power IPv6 and RPL networks, and introduce Orchestra. In Orchestra, nodes autonomously compute their own, local schedules. They maintain multiple schedules, each allocated to a particular traffic plane (application, routing, MAC), and updated automatically as the topology evolves. Orchestra (re)computes local schedules without signaling overhead, and does not require any central or distributed scheduler. Instead, it relies on the existing network stack information to maintain the schedules. This scheme allows Orchestra to build non-deterministic networks while exploiting the robustness of TSCH.  We demonstrate the practicality of Orchestra and quantify its benefits through extensive evaluation in two testbeds, on two hardware platforms. Orchestra reduces, or even eliminates, network contention. In long running experiments of up to 72~h we show that Orchestra achieves end-to-end delivery ratios of over 99.99%. Compared to RPL in asynchronous low-power listening networks, Orchestra improves reliability by two orders of magnitude, while achieving a similar latency-energy balance.	end-to-end principle;experiment;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;internet of things;low-power broadcasting;mesh networking;overhead (computing);protocol stack;routing;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);testbed	Simon Duquennoy;Beshr Al Nahas;Olaf Landsiedel;Thomas Watteyne	2015		10.1145/2809695.2809714	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;scheduling	Mobile	10.097486830387918	84.2839851506342	79774

83300e2eab17873ff05dbd1ca7871ced43d03749	ieee 1588 clock synchronization performance over time-varying wireless channels		One of the major requirements of Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) is a high clock synchronization performance between nodes. This is especially critical in Industrial Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (IWSAN), where every sensor and actuator of the network must take samples with very precise timing. In this paper, we detail the challenges of distributing a global base time in wireless communications and address some insights to achieve a very high clock synchronization performance. Besides this, Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been proposed to be used in the next generation of industrial communication standards, such as SHARP, due to their robustness in high dispersive channels. Based on these considerations, we have built an IEEE 802.11a/g modem with hardware timestamping and we have evaluated the clock synchronization over several wireless channels. The wireless channels have been run in a channel emulator and they represent four different scenarios: small office, big office, open space, and small factory. The results show that clock synchronization is quite affected by channel dispersion and channel Doppler speed, but the performance of our system is good enough to its use in industrial scenarios and comparable to Ethernet-based synchronization at channels with low and medium dispersion.	clock synchronization;dispersive partial differential equation;emulator;modem;multiplexing;precision time protocol;principle of good enough;requirement;small office/home office;spatial variability	Oscar Seijo;Inaki Val;Jesús A.

We formulate the sensor localization into a variant of the classical MDS, in which the squared error between the measured inter-sensor distances and the calculated ones based on estimated sensor locations is used as a stress function. The proposed formulation is applicable even if the distances of several sensor pairs are unknown, and thus it does not require the minimum-hop-count assumption to estimate all inter-sensor distances. This feature is suitable especially for anisotropic networks, in which the minimum-hop-count assumption does not hold in general. We propose a technique, referred to as stress relaxation in this paper, which allows us to get a good solution while avoiding local minimums of the stress function. Simulation experiments verify that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the localization scheme based on the classical MDS.	algorithm;experiment;internationalization and localization;linear programming relaxation;relaxation (approximation);sensor;simulation	Shigeo Shioda;Junya Komatsu;Keiichi Nishihara	2015	2015 IEEE 82nd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2015-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2015.7390878	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;stress;wireless;statistics;measurement uncertainty	Vision	16.497653980223483	75.23006331691825	80743

While taking the challenging healthcare requirements into account, this paper aims for the study of energy consumption in BSN scenarios. For that purpose, the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC limitations are first examined, and other potential MAC layer alternatives are further explored. Our intent is to introduce energy-aware radio activation polices into a high-performance distributed queuing medium access control (DQ-MAC) protocol and evaluate its energy-saving achievements, as a function of the network load and the packet length. To do so, a fundamental energy-efficiency theoretical analysis for DQ-MAC protocols is hereby for the first time provided. By means of computer simulations, its performance is validated using IEEE 802.15.4 MAC system parameters.		Begonya Otal;Luis Alonso;Christos V. Verikoukis	2010	EURASIP J.

fdbe9f7b1b06ba6503a316d2fe4746c053e5110e	on-demand deployment of multiple aerial base stations for traffic offloading and network recovery		Abstract Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being utilized for a wide spectrum of applications in wireless networks leading to attractive business opportunities. In the case of abrupt disruption to existing cellular network operation or infrastructure, e.g., due to an unexpected surge in user demand or a natural disaster, UAVs can be deployed to provide instant recovery via temporary wireless coverage in designated areas. A major challenge is to determine efficiently how many UAVs are needed and where to position them in a relatively large 3D search space. We first consider a discrete set of possible UAV locations distributed in a given 3D space and formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). Owing to the complexity of the MILP problem, we present an effective greedy approach that mimics the behavior of the MILP for small network scenarios and scales efficiently for large network scenarios. Afterwards, we propose and evaluate a more practical approach for multiple UAV deployment in a continuous 3D space, based on an unsupervised learning technique that relies on the notion of electrostatics with repulsion and attraction forces. We present performance results for the proposed algorithm as a function of various system parameters and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to the close-to-optimal greedy approach and its superiority compared to recent related work from the literature.	aerial photography;denial-of-service attack;integer programming;linear programming;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;software deployment;time complexity;unmanned aerial vehicle;unsupervised learning	Sanaa Sharafeddine;Rania Islambouli	2018	CoRR		wireless network;distributed computing;software deployment;computer science;unsupervised learning;wireless;linear programming;integer;cellular network;base station	AI	17.539873798076837	84.71446844422185	81037

LTE introduces a new radio access network that implements technologies, which provide higher data rates, improvements in efficiency and quality of service, lower costs, and integration with existing open standards. The LTE radio access network is connected with a core network known as SAE (system architecture evolution) that implements flat network architecture and is exclusively packet switched. Peak data rates of 100 Mb/sec on the downlink and 50 Mb/sec on the uplink within a 20 MHz spectrum allocation. Control plane capable of carrying signalization for 200 simultaneously active users for spectrum allocations up to 5 MHz and for at least 400 users for higher spectrum allocations. Switch time between idle and active state shorter than 100 msec. Radio access network latency below 10 msec. Spectral efficiency 5 bit/sec/Hz on the downlink and 2.5 bit/sec/Hz on the uplink. Radio access network optimized for mobile user speeds up to 15 km/hr. The system should support high performance for speeds up to 120 km/hr. Links should be maintained at speeds up to 350 km/hr or up to 500 km/hr depending on the frequency band. The system should support the targeted performance within a 5-km range. A slight degradation in performance is tolerated within a 30-km range. Ranges up to 100 km or even more should not be precluded by the specifications. Enhanced broadcast and multicast transmissions compared to HSPA standards. Scalable bandwidth allocation of 1.25 MHz, 1.6 MHz, 2.5 MHz, 5 MHz, 10 MHz, 15 MHz, and 20 MHz.

In these types of networks, solar powered mesh access points (MAPs) and mesh points (MPs) can be used to provide tether-less infrastructure extension in an inexpensive and flexible manner. Unlike conventional WLAN networks, power saving on the access points (APs) is an important feature which can result in significantly reduced solar-powered AP node costs. Unfortunately, when infrastructure nodes conserve power, they become less responsive and this can significantly lengthen the hand off process. In this paper we propose and analyze different algorithms for mitigating these effects, so that real-time handoff can occur as fast as possible. Three different algorithms are proposed for dynamically activating the power saving infrastructure.

A proof-of-concept SEI system was developed to investigate whether it is possible to distinguish between the RF signals produced by two nominally-identical access remotes. It was determined that it is possible to distinguish between the remotes with an accuracy of 98%.	access control;control system;lambert's cosine law;offset binary;online and offline;radio frequency;sampling (signal processing);software engineering institute	J.

However, for transmitting a multicast message to more than one receiver, the protocol could not guarantee that all receivers can wake up simultaneously and then receive the multicast message. In this paper, we propose a new asynchronous PS protocol, named CRT-MAC PS protocol, for the multicast transmission in the asynchronous ad hoc networks. We define the difference m-pair property to guarantee that m different wakeup frequencies have the intersection. Thus, m wireless hosts with m different wakeup frequencies satisfying the difference m-pair property could wake up simultaneously. The CRT-MAC PS protocol utilizes the concept of Chinese Remainder Theorem to generate m wakeup frequencies which satisfy the difference m-pair property. When m wireless hosts use the wakeup frequency generated by the Chinese Remainder Theorem to transmit the multicast message, they will wake up simultaneously and receive the multicast message.	asynchronous i/o;cathode ray tube;hoc (programming language);multicast;ps (unix);transmitter;unicast	Yu-Chen Kuo;Chih-Nung Chen	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Sensor Networks, Ubiquitous, and Trustworthy Computing (sutc 2008)	10.1109/SUTC.2008.40	wireless ad hoc network;multicast;ip multicast;telecommunications;information science;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;ubiquitous computing;xcast;computer network	Embedded	10.220167670881994	82.5474228187279	81931
0ba374a78f2c0d5308a1d11f3bc7157895453d22	survey of spectrum sharing for inter-technology coexistence		Increasing capacity demands in emerging wireless technologies are expected to be met by network densification and spectrum bands open to multiple technologies. These will, in turn, increase the level of interference and also result in more complex inter-technology interactions, which will need to be managed through spectrum sharing mechanisms. Consequently, novel spectrum sharing mechanisms should be designed to allow spectrum access for multiple technologies, while efficiently utilizing the spectrum resources overall. Importantly, it is not trivial to design such efficient mechanisms, not only due to technical aspects, but also due to regulatory and business model constraints. In this survey we address spectrum sharing mechanisms for wireless inter-technology coexistence by means of a technology circle that incorporates in a unified, system-level view the technical and nontechnical aspects. We thus systematically explore the spectrum sharing design space consisting of parameters at different layers. Using this framework, we present a literature review on intertechnology coexistence with a focus on wireless technologies with equal spectrum access rights, i.e. (i) primary/primary, (ii) secondary/secondary, and (iii) technologies operating in a spectrum commons. Moreover, we reflect on our literature review to identify possible spectrum sharing design solutions and performance evaluation approaches useful for future coexistence cases. Finally, we discuss spectrum sharing design challenges and suggest future research directions.	coexist (image);interaction;interference (communication);performance evaluation	Andra M.

The proposed AOA-based method leads us to a non-iterative closed-form solution of the positioning problem, and an statistical analysis of that solution is also included. The comparison between this method and the classical AOA-based positioning technique is discussed in terms of computational load, convergence of the solution and also in terms of the bias and variance of the position estimate.	angle of arrival;iterative method;telecommunications network	Alba Pagès-Zamora;Josep Vidal;Dana H.

While the impact of the former on network capacity extensively studied extensively in the literature, the impact of energy constraints has not received much attention. In this paper, we study the capacity limitations resulting from the energy supplies in wireless nodes. We define the energy-limited capacity of a wireless network as the maximum amount of data the network can deliver before the nodes run out of energy. This energy-limited capacity is an important parameter in networks where operating lifetime is critical, such as ad hoc networks deployed in hazardous environments and sensor networks. We study two types of static networks, networks without any infrastructure support and networks where base stations with unlimited energy are deployed to support data forwarding. We consider two kinds of traffic models motivated by ad hoc networks and sensor networks. We derive upper and lower bounds on the energy-limited capacity of these networks. While throughput has been shown to not scale with node density in static networks by previous studies, our results show that, depending on the energy consumption characteristics of wireless communication, the energy-limited capacity can scale well under both traffic models. In addition, we show that the deployment of base stations can improve the energy-limited capacity of the network, especially for networks with sensor traffic.		Wenrui Zhao;Mostafa H. Ammar;Ellen W.

7091733aff90621fbbee842fdf476fb53cc68345	optimal weighted k-nearest neighbour algorithm for wireless sensor network fingerprint localisation in noisy environment		The weighted K-nearest neighbour (WKNN) algorithm is widely applied to fingerprint positioning. However, the node position estimated by the WKNN algorithm is not optimal in a noisy environment. To obtain the optimised node location estimate, the authors propose an optimal WKNN (OWKNN) algorithm for wireless sensor network (WSN) fingerprint localisation in a noisy environment. The proposed OWKNN algorithm is composed of an adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) and a memetic algorithm (MA). First, the AKF is utilised to reduce the measurement noise of the received signal strength indication (RSSI) between the nodes in the WSN. Then, the MA is employed to optimise the calibration point weight for estimating the position of a target node in the WSN according to the filtered RSSI and a calibrated radio map. Finally, an optimal node location estimate is achieved based on the optimised weight. The extensive experimental results reveal that the localisation accuracy of the proposed algorithm is at least ∼50% higher than those of the state-of-the-art fingerprint localisation algorithms regardless of the placement of the target node, number of beacon nodes, and size of the calibration cell.	fingerprint;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;nearest neighbour algorithm	Xuming Fang;Zonghua Jiang;Lei Nan;Lijun Chen	2018	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2017.0515	mathematics;wireless sensor network;real-time computing;calibration;fingerprint;kalman filter;algorithm;nearest neighbour algorithm;received signal strength indication;memetic algorithm	Mobile	16.33459169665744	75.48563366704617	82419

The interference caused by coexistence may significantly affect the performance of wireless body area networks (WBANs) where reliability is particularly critical for health monitoring applications. In this paper, we analytically study the effects of dynamic coexistence on the operation of IEEE 802.15.4-based health monitoring WBANs. The current IEEE 802.15.4 standard lacks mechanisms for effectively managing the coexistence of mobile WBANs. Considering the specific characteristics and requirements of health monitoring WBANs, we propose the dynamic coexistence management (DCM) mechanism to make IEEE 802.15.4-based WBANs able to detect and mitigate the harmful effects of coexistence. We assess the effectiveness of this scheme using extensive OPNET simulations. Our results indicate that DCM improves the successful transmission rates of dynamically coexisting WBANs by 20%-25% for typical medical monitoring applications.	body dysmorphic disorders;coexist (image);dicom;interference (communication);patients;requirement;self-organized criticality;simulation	Mohammad Deylami;Emil Jovanov	2014	IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/JBHI.2013.2278217	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;remote patient monitoring;computer network	Visualization	10.9756655834233	85.61201364810337	82464
1c0e513dc3ddfad918e88375bfb2dc9bbd9dd134	adaptive hybrid compression for wireless sensor networks	spatiotemporal compression;data analysis;delay tolerant networks;model based clustering	Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are often deployed to sample the desired environmental attributes and deliver the acquired samples to a central station, termed as the sink, for processing as needed by the application. Many applications stipulate high granularity and data accuracy that results in high data volumes. However, sensor nodes are battery powered, and sending the requested large amounts of data rapidly depletes their energy. Fortunately, environmental attributes (e.g., temperature, pressure) often exhibit spatial and temporal correlations. Moreover, a large class of applications such as scientific analysis and simulations tolerate high latency for sensor data collection. Hence, we exploit the spatiotemporal correlation of sensor readings while benefiting from possible data delivery latency tolerance to minimize the amount of data to be transported to the sink. Accordingly, we develop a fully distributed adaptive hybrid compression scheme that exploits both spatial and temporal data redundancies and fuses both temporal and spatial compression for maximal data compression with accuracy guarantees. We present two main contributions: (i) an adaptive modeling technique that allows frugal and maximized temporal compression on resource-constraint sensor nodes by exploiting the data collection latency, and (ii) a novel model-based hierarchical clustering technique that allows for maximized spatial compression resulting into a hybrid compression scheme. Compared to the existing spatiotemporal compression approaches, our approach is fully decentralized and the proposed clustering scheme is based on sensor data models rather than instantaneous sensor data values, which allows merging nearby nodes with similar models into large clusters over a longer period of time rather than specific time instances. The analysis for computation and message overheads, the analysis for theoretical compressibility, and simulations using real-world data demonstrate that our proposed scheme can provide significant communication/energy savings without sacrificing the accuracy of collected data.	cluster analysis;computation;data compression;data model;hierarchical clustering;maximal set;sensor node;simulation	Azad Ali;Abdelmajid Khelil;Neeraj Suri;Mohammadreza Mahmudimanesh	2015	TOSN	10.1145/2754932	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;data analysis;statistics	Mobile	10.64419553589489	74.9701008145656	82489

Although the main objective in localization is primarily enhancing the positioning accuracy, the importance of energy consumption and localization accuracy poses new challenges. The localization is usually assisted with some self-known position sensors called anchor nodes. In this letter, optimal power allocation for the anchor nodes in a sense of minimizing the energy consumption considering estimation errors is investigated. To have a better estimation of the relative distance between the anchor and unknown nodes using received signal strength indicator (RSSI), average energy of the received beacon is introduced as a new decision metric. Based on this, a squared position error bound as an accuracy parameter is derived, and an optimization problem is proposed to maximize the localization performance. More specifically, the optimal power allocation policy is first derived for the case that the anchor nodes estimate their own locations with no error. Since there are unavoidable errors in the positions of the anchor nodes, the optimization problem is then modified by including uncertainty in the positions of the anchor nodes. The results show that a substantial reduction in power consumption can be achieved by optimal allocation of the transmission power.	mathematical optimization;optimization problem;sensor	Forough Yaghoubi;Aliazam Abbasfar;Behrouz Maham	2014	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2320939	mathematical optimization;estimation;wireless sensor network;internationalization and localization;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;resource management;mathematics;accuracy and precision;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;statistics	Mobile	15.072712101117524	79.71632864877145	82520

This exciting addition to current broadband options such as DSL, cable, and WiFi promises to rapidly provide broadband access to locations in the world's rural and developing areas where broadband is currently unavailable, as well as competing for urban market share. WiMax's competitiveness in the marketplace largely depends on the actual data rates and ranges that are achieved, but this has been difficult to judge due to the large number of possible options and competing marketing claims. This article first provides a tutorial overview of 802.16.

Classical robustness analysis has been focused on the evaluation of topological characteristics. In this paper we extend this analysis introducing two new robustness metrics that include traffic service requirements: QuaNtitative Robustness Metric (QNRM) and QuaLitative Robustness Metric (QLRM). A review of some well known graph robustness metrics is provided. In order to compare these metrics with the proposals, a set of six topologies (random, small-world and scale-free) is evaluated. Finally, it is shown that our two new metrics are able to evaluate the performance of a network under a given kind of impairment.	failure;flow network;quality of service;randomness;requirement;robustness (computer science);robustness of complex networks	Marc Manzano;Eusebi Calle;David Harle	2011	2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)		computer science;distributed computing;complex network;robustness	Vision	13.882135389621066	87.27889302024495	83324

This paper targets the need in certain scenarios for rapid deployment of these relays when little or nothing is known in advance about a given environment and its propagation characteristics. Applications include first responders entering a large building during an emergency, search and rescue robots maneuvering a disaster sight, and coal miners working underground. The common element motivatingthis work is the need to maintain communications in an environment where single-hop communication is typically inadequate. This paper investigates the feasibility of the automated deployment of a multihop network. A deployment procedure is proposed that employs real-time link measurements and takes into account the physical layer characteristics of a mobile multipath fading environment and the radio in use. A prototype system is implemented based on 900 MHz TinyOS motes supporting low-speed data applications including text messaging, sensor data and RFID-assisted localization.

In this context, an energy-efficient method for the joint estimation of an unknown analog source under a given distortion constraint is proposed. The approach is purely analog, in which each sensor simply amplifies and forwards the noise-corrupted analog observation to the fusion center for joint estimation. The total transmission power across all the sensor nodes is minimized while satisfying a distortion requirement on the joint estimate. The energy efficiency of this analog approach is compared with previously proposed digital approaches with and without coding. It is shown in our simulation that the analog approach is more energy-efficient than the digital system without coding, and in some cases outperforms the digital system with optimal coding.	digital electronics;distortion;simulation	Shuguang Cui;Jinjun Xiao;Zhi-Quan Luo;Andrea J.

In this survey, we discuss the opportunities, trends and challenges of this challenging topic. Two major contributions are presented namely 1) survey of proposed energy efficiency metrics; 2) survey of proposed energy efficient solutions. We provide a broad overview of the state of-the-art energy efficient methods covering base station (BS) hardware design, network planning and deployment, and network management and operation stages. In order to further understand how EE is assessed and improved through the heterogeneous network (HetNet), BS’s energy-awareness and several typical HetNet deployment scenarios such as macrocell-microcell and macrocell-picocell are presented. The analysis of different HetNet deployment scenarios gives insights towards a successful deployment of energy efficient cellular networks.

The proper selections of NC coefficients and measurement matrix are designed for this scheme. This design guarantees the reconstruction of clustered compression data successfully with an overwhelming probability and unifies the operations of NC and CS into real field successfully. Moreover, in contrast to other spatio-temporal schemes with the same computational complexity, the proposed scheme possesses lower reconstruction error by employing the independent encoding in each sensor node (including the cluster head nodes) and joint decoding in sink node. At the same time it has lower computational complexity as compared with JSM-based spatio-temporal scheme by exploiting the temporal and spatial correlations of original sensing data step by step. Finally, the simulation results verify that the clustered spatio-temporal compression scheme outperforms the other two compression schemes significantly in terms of recovery error and compression gain.	coefficient;compressed sensing;computational complexity theory;data compression;linear network coding;sensor node;simulation	Siguang Chen;Chuanxin Zhao;Meng Da Wu;Zhixin Sun;Jian Jin	2015	2015 24th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288383	linear network coding;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;compressed sensing;computer network	Mobile	15.978885335795391	80.35602126123689	83830

To minimize energy consumption and to consequently extend the lifetime of WSNs, we propose a local search technique for sink placement in WSNs. In addition, a proper sink placement plays a vital role in performance-sensitive WSN applications. Since it is not feasible for a sink to use global information, especially for large-scale WSNs, we introduce a self-organized sink placement (SOSP) strategy that combines the advantages of our previous works [7] and [8]. Besides, this paper is a substantial extension of [9]. The goal of this research is to provide a better sink placement strategy with a lower communication overhead. Avoiding the costly design of using the nodes' location information, each sink sets up its own group by communicating to its n-hop distance neighbors. While keeping the locally optimal placement, SOSP exhibits a better solution quality with respect to communication overhead and computational effort than previous solutions. To analyze performance issues, especially the worst-case delay of a given WSN, we use a methodology called sensor network calculus [10].	best, worst and average case;local optimum;local search (optimization);network calculus;overhead (computing);sql;self-organization;symposium on operating systems principles	Wint Yi Poe;Jens B.

Today, technologists are proposing a Fifth Generation (5G) for around 2020. Most consider this time to be when the infrastructure will need to be renewed. Together with this observation, it is usually argued that, the new generation technology should possess a number of features. There is no consensus on what these new features should be. Some argue that we are facing a new generation of devices that will have continuous Internet connectivity, and consequently there will be more machine to-machine or machine-type communications. It is argued that machine-type communication will require very low latency. Others argue that the demand for services will increase by about three orders of magnitude and the new technology should be designed to support this tremendous increase, perhaps handling each order of magnitude by means of a different approach. In this paper, we discuss the modulation techniques proposed for 5G and their justification.	fifth generation computer;internet access;machine to machine;modulation;programming paradigm	Ender Ayanoglu	2016	2016 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2016.7440624	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	21.834684483057757	86.51471411386	84805

To address this, we explore and evaluate a number of different techniques using realistic simulation models under the many-to-one communication paradigm known as convergecast. We first consider time scheduling on a single frequency channel with the aim of minimizing the number of time slots required (schedule length) to complete a convergecast. Next, we combine scheduling with transmission power control to mitigate the effects of interference, and show that while power control helps in reducing the schedule length under a single frequency, scheduling transmissions using multiple frequencies is more efficient. We give lower bounds on the schedule length when interference is completely eliminated, and propose algorithms that achieve these bounds. We also evaluate the performance of various channel assignment methods and find empirically that for moderate size networks of about 100 nodes, the use of multifrequency scheduling can suffice to eliminate most of the interference. Then, the data collection rate no longer remains limited by interference but by the topology of the routing tree. To this end, we construct degree-constrained spanning trees and capacitated minimal spanning trees, and show significant improvement in scheduling performance over different deployment densities. Lastly, we evaluate the impact of different interference and channel models on the schedule length.	algorithm;channel (communications);file spanning;interference (communication);one-to-many (data model);programming paradigm;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment	Özlem Durmaz Incel;Amitava Ghosh;Bhaskar Krishnamachari;Krishna Chintalapudi	2012	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2011.22	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	12.790140523383684	86.91219199778413	84853
d96a30c9b7cbeb12e7777426556664e9ecbfd298	adaptive beaconing for collision avoidance and tracking accuracy in vehicular networks		In vehicular networks, the exchange of beacons among neighboring vehicles is a promising solution to guarantee a vehicle’s safety. However, frequent beaconing under high vehicle density conditions will cause beacon collisions, which are harmful to a vehicle’s driving safety and the location tracking accuracy. We propose an ABIwRC (Adaptive Beaconing Interval with Resource Coordination) method for a highway scenario. Each vehicle broadcasts beacon interval requests, including the intervals needed for both the vehicle’s driving safety and location tracking accuracy. The RSU(Road Side Unit) allocates resources for a vehicle’s beaconing according to the requests from all vehicles and the interference relationship between the vehicles in adjacent RSUs. We formulate a resource allocation problem for maximizing the sum utility, which measures the satisfaction of vehicles’ requests. We then transform the optimization problem into a maximum weighted independent set problem, and propose an algorithm to solve this efficiently. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the benchmark in terms of beacon reception ratio, vehicle driving safety, and location tracking accuracy.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);benchmark (computing);independent set (graph theory);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation;web beacon	Long Sun;Aiping Huang;Hangguan Shan;Lin Cai	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1007/s41650-017-0019-5	real-time computing;simulation;computer security	Mobile	15.51804451894171	83.60521253116669	84877

In the proposed system, all necessary components, including the battery, energy-harvesting solar cells, and the RF antenna, are fully integrated within a millimeter-scale form factor. Designing an energy-optimized wireless communication system for such a miniaturized platform is challenging because of unique system constraints imposed by the ultra-small system dimension. The proposed system targets orders of magnitude improvement in wireless communication energy efficiency through a comprehensive system-level analysis that jointly optimizes various system parameters, such as node dimension, modulation scheme, synchronization protocol, RF/analog/digital circuit specifications, carrier frequency, and a miniaturized 3-D antenna. We propose a new protocol and modulation schemes that are specifically designed for energy-scarce ultra-small IoT nodes. These new schemes exploit abundant signal processing resources on gateway devices to simplify design for energy-scarce ultra-small sensor nodes. The proposed dynamic link adaptation guarantees that the ultra-small IoT node always operates in the most energy efficient mode for a given operating scenario. The outcome is a truly energy-optimized wireless communication system to enable various classes of new applications, such as implanted smart-dust devices.	autonomous robot;carrier frequency;data rate units;digital electronics;mathematical optimization;modulation;rf modulator;radio frequency;sensor node;signal processing;simulation;smart board;solar cell;synchronization (computer science);throughput	Yajing Chen;Nikolaos Chiotellis;Li-Xuan Chuo;Carl Pfeiffer;Yao Shi;Ronald G.

For the Global Positioning System (GPS), the variations can sum up to 1 m in the ionosphere-free linear combination and thus can significantly affect precise code applications. The contribution of the GPS transmitters can amount to 0.8 m peak-to-peak over the entire nadir angle range. To verify the assumption of their time-invariance, we determined daily individual satellite GDV for GPS transmitter antennas over a period of more than two years. Dual-frequency observations of globally distributed reference stations and their multipath combination form the basis for our analysis. The resulting GPS GDV are stable on the level of a few centimeters for C1, P2, and for the ionosphere-free linear combination. Our study reveals that the inconsistencies of the GDV of space vehicle number (SVN) 55 with respect to earlier studies are not caused by temporal instabilities, but are rather related to receiver properties.	dual;experiment;gps block iif;global positioning system;group delay and phase delay;infinite impulse response;large;multipath propagation;observable;revision procedure;root mean square;slub (software);satellite viruses;satellite navigation;slub (band);time-invariant system;transmitter device component;emotional dependency	Susanne Beer;Lambert Wanninger	2018		10.3390/s18061744	electronic engineering;transmitter;group delay and phase delay;engineering;global positioning system	Mobile	24.351706219037066	76.14638781718492	85202

We consider the problem,of tracking a mobile user moving,through a cellular network using node queries that provide information as to last time the user visited the node. Queries are executed in rounds, each round may involve queries to many nodes simultaneously, and the user may move at the same time that queries are performed. The cost measures considered are the number,of rounds required to find the user and the total number,of queries made,during the execution of the algorithm. We present a number,of algorithms for general networks, as well as upper and lower b ounds for specific network topologies.

We show that for thetas < pi, NET graphs are guaranteed to have an edge-connectivity of at least floor (2pi)/thetas, even with an irregular communication range. Our main contribution is to show how this family of graphs can achieve tunable topology control based on a single parameter thetas. Since the required condition is purely local and geometric, it allows for distributed topology control. For a static network scenario, a power control algorithm based on the NET condition is developed for obtaining k-connected topologies and shown to be significantly efficient compared to existing schemes. In controlled deployment of a mobile network, control over positions of nodes can be leveraged for constructing NET graphs with desired levels of network connectivity and sensing coverage. To establish this, we develop a potential fields based distributed controller and present simulation results for a large network of robots. Lastly, we extend NET graphs to 3D and provide an efficient algorithm to check for the NET condition at each node. This algorithm can be used for implementing generic topology control algorithms in 3D.	algorithm design;computation;computer simulation;control theory;delaunay triangulation;disk sector;k-edge-connected graph;performance evaluation;robot;software deployment;topology control;tree (data structure)	Sameera Poduri;Sundeep Pattem;Bhaskar Krishnamachari;Gaurav S.

An important performance measure of such applications is sensing coverage that characterizes how well a sensing field is monitored by a network. Although advanced collaborative signal processing algorithms have been adopted by many existing WSNs, most previous analytical studies on sensing coverage are conducted based on overly simplistic sensing models (e.g., the disc model) that do not capture the stochastic nature of sensing. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by exploring the fundamental limits of coverage based on stochastic data fusion models that fuse noisy measurements of multiple sensors. We derive the scaling laws between coverage, network density, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We show that data fusion can significantly improve sensing coverage by exploiting the collaboration among sensors. In particular, for signal path loss exponent of k (typically between 2.0 and 5.0), rho_f=O(rho_d^(1-1/k)), where rho_f and rho_d are the densities of uniformly deployed sensors that achieve full coverage under the fusion and disc models, respectively. Our results help understand the limitations of the previous analytical results based on the disc model and provide key insights into the design of WSNs that adopt data fusion algorithms. Our analyses are verified through extensive simulations based on both synthetic data sets and data traces collected in a real deployment for vehicle detection.	algorithm;image scaling;sensor;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software deployment;synthetic data;tracing (software)	Guoliang Xing;Rui Tan;Benyuan Liu;Jianping Wang;Xiaohua Jia;Chih-Wei Yi	2009		10.1145/1614320.1614338	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;path loss;data mining;sensor fusion;environmental monitoring;signal-to-noise ratio;computer security;synthetic data	Mobile	14.803336504171655	77.2601631304666	85381

Till date, in most of the proposed schemes, the raw or aggregated sensed data are periodically sent to a data consuming center. However, with those schemes, the occurrence of an emergency event such as a fire is hardly reported timely, which is a strict requirement for event warning applications. In wireless sensor networks, it is also highly desired to conserve energy so that network lifetime can be maximized. Furthermore, to ensure the quality of surveillance, some applications require that if an event occurs, it needs to be detected by at least k sensors, where k is a user-defined parameter. In this work, we examine the Timely Energy-efficient k-Watching Event Monitoring (TEKWEM) problem and propose a scheme, which involves an event detection model and a warning delivery model, for monitoring composite events and delivering warnings to users.

This paper proposes a new coverage control strategy in WSNs based on a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, which overcomes the difficulties in NP-complete problem. A new intelligent optimization algorithm, named multiobjective free search (MOFS) is designed for the characteristics of the WSNs. WSNs are real-time optimized to enhance coverage and extend the networks lifetime. The MOFS algorithm is used to determine the optimal set of active nodes. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is validated through simulation experiments. The results reveal the tradeoffs among coverage, operating energy, energy equilibrium, and network lifetime.	code coverage;control theory;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;mathematical optimization;np-completeness;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;simulation	Tian Liang;Chao Meng;Wei Heng;Hui Zhou	2014	2014 International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)	10.1109/WPMC.2014.7014893	lead;telecommunications;computer science;manganese;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Embedded	11.144867853018333	78.36217890961652	85565

However, it is challenging to secure such distributed sensing due mainly to the unique features of dynamic spectrum access networks-openness of low-layer protocol stacks in software-defined radio devices and the absence of interactions/coordination between primary and secondary devices. To meet this challenge, we propose an attack-tolerant distributed sensing protocol (ADSP) for DTV signal detection in IEEE 802.22 WRANs, under which sensors in close proximity are grouped as a cluster, and sensors within a cluster cooperate to safeguard the integrity of sensing. The heart of ADSP is a novel filter based on shadow-fading correlation, by which the fusion center cross-validates reports from the sensors to identify and penalize abnormal sensing reports. By realizing this correlation filter, ADSP significantly reduces the impact of an attack on the performance of distributed sensing, while incurring minimal processing and communication overheads. ADSP also guarantees the detectability requirements of 802.22 to be met even with the presence of sensing report manipulation attacks by scheduling sensing within the framework of sequential hypothesis testing. The efficacy of ADSP is validated on a realistic 2D shadow-fading field. Our extensive simulation-based study shows that ADSP reduces the false-alarm rate by 99.2 percent while achieving 97.4 percent of maximum achievable detection rate, and meets the detection requirements of IEEE 802.22 in various attack scenarios.	access network;author domain signing practices;detection theory;interaction;openness;requirement;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation	Alexander W.

Hence, the usage of this band increases the complexity of neighbor discovery since the knowledge of neighborsu0027 physical location becomes essential to proceed with communication. To face these challenges, multiband protocols have been proposed, which uses an omnidirectional control channel in a different band from millimeter waves data channel. Due to unstable characteristics of millimeter waves channel, the control channel is used to transmit information concerning neighbor discovery. The two protocols proposed in this work rely on this feature and aim to build a global knowledge about nodesu0027 location as well as to maintain it in the case of nodes mobility or if some obstacle arises. Both protocols are compared with another protocol found in the literature in terms of delay on the neighbor discovery.

The employed data were gathered in specific field-test campaigns. The focus is on the performance assessment of a pragmatic solution combining straightforward machine-learning tools along with a standard maximum-likelihood geo-location metric.

Compared to multi-antenna aided systems being built at the time of this writing, such as the long-term evolution (LTE) based fourth generation (4G) mobile communication system which allows for up to eight antenna elements at the base station (BS), the LS-MIMO system entails an unprecedented number of antennas, say 100 or more, at the BS. The huge leap in the number of BS antennas opens the door to a new research field in communication theory, propagation and electronics, where random matrix theory begins to play a dominant role. Interestingly, LS-MIMOs also constitute a perfect example of one of the key philosophical principles of the Hegelian Dialectics, namely, that “quantitative change leads to qualitative change.” In this treatise, we provide a recital on the historic heritages and novel challenges facing LS-MIMOs from a detection perspective. First, we highlight the fundamentals of MIMO detection, including the nature of co-channel interference (CCI), the generality of the MIMO detection problem, the received signal models of both linear memoryless MIMO channels and dispersive MIMO channels exhibiting memory, as well as the complex-valued versus real-valued MIMO system models. Then, an extensive review of the representative MIMO detection methods conceived during the past 50 years (1965-2015) is presented, and relevant insights as well as lessons are inferred for the sake of designing complexity-scalable MIMO detection algorithms that are potentially applicable to LS-MIMO systems. Furthermore, we divide the LS-MIMO systems into two types, and elaborate on the distinct detection strategies suitable for each of them. The type-I LS-MIMO corresponds to the case where the number of active users is much smaller than the number of BS antennas, which is currently the mainstream definition of LS-MIMO. The type-II LS-MIMO corresponds to the case where the number of active users is comparable to the number of BS antennas. Finally, we discuss the applicability of existing MIMO detection algorithms in LS-MIMO systems, and review some of the recent advances in LS-MIMO detection.	algorithm;compaq lte;convex optimization;dispersive partial differential equation;interference (communication);least squares;link-state routing protocol;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;message passing;metaheuristic;programming paradigm;scalability;sensor;signal processing;software propagation	Shaoshi Yang;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2015	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/COMST.2015.2475242	detector;3g mimo;multi-user mimo;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;interference;frequency-division multiplexing;frequency domain;spatial multiplexing;statistics;mimo	Security	21.8770087309354	84.8772395102498	85765

The spaces integrated with wireless sensors networks, actuators and context-aware services become part of our daily life. Smart spaces are equipped with a large number of wireless sensors that aim to collect large quantities of context information, during the process, there exists a large amount of collisions and energy consumption. Therefore, this paper provides a novel multi-rate based local framing pre-schedule scheme to further reduce collisions and improve energy efficiency in CSMA/TDMA hybrid MAC layer of wireless sensor network. This MAC combines CSMA and TDMA functionalities together while obviates their shortcomings. Having been assigned, slot 0 is preserved as the pre-schedule slot, to inform neighbor nodes the schedule of the senders. During the pre-schedule slot, each node knows exactly the schedule of other neighbor nodes. Multi-rate and power scaling are applied to achieve further energy saving by adpoting an acceptable rate rather than maximum rate. Data rate is dynamically adjusted according to the traffic load of sending nodes, in an energy efficient data rate, to save energy. Being compared with Z-MAC in terms of performances, local framing pre-schedule and multi-rate in this experiment achieved further energy efficiency.	context-aware network;data rate units;framing (world wide web);image scaling;performance;sensor;ubiquitous computing;uncompressed video	Wei Wei;Yong Qi;Saiyu Qi;Di Hou;Wei Wang;Min Xi;Qingsong Yao	2007	The 2nd IEEE Asia-Pacific Service Computing Conference (APSCC 2007)	10.1109/APSCC.2007.26	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;law;petri net;ubiquitous computing;computer network	Mobile	10.880585886543141	84.36617841318768	85942

The MAC protocol in CRN defines the spectrum usage by sharing the channels efficiently among users. In this paper we propose a novel TDMA based MAC protocol with dynamically allocated slots. Most of the MAC protocols proposed in the literature employ Common Control Channel (CCC) to manage the resources among Cognitive Radio (CR) users. Control channel saturation in case of large number of CR users is one of the main drawbacks of the CCC based MAC protocols. In contrast with CCC based MAC protcols, DSAT-MAC protocol is based on the TDMA mechanism, without using any CCC for control information exchange. The channels are divided into time slots and CR users send their control or data packets over their designated slot. The protocol ensures that no slot is left vacant. This guarantees full use of the available spectrum. The protocol includes the provision for Quality of Service, where real-time and safety critical data is transmitted with highest priority and least delay. The protocol also ensures a fair sharing of available spectrum among the CR users, with the mechanism to regulate the transmission of malicious nodes. Energy saving techniques are also presented for longer life of battery operated CR nodes. Theoretical analysis and simulations over ns-2 of the proposed protocol reveal that the protocol performs better in various CR adhoc network applications.	cognitive radio;communications protocol;fairness measure;information exchange;network packet;quality of service;real-time clock;sensor web;simulation	Rajeev K.

c69325f41b92b65b0f9af32a89e1a407e06cb01f	wireless sensor network node deployment based on multi-objective immune algorithm		Wireless sensor network (WSN) is made up of a large number of low-cost wireless sensor nodes, which can collect all types of data in its lifetime. Node deployment of WSN is a NP complete problem, and it can significantly influence the network coverage and energy consumption in WSN. In this paper, we try to exploit multi-objective immune algorithm to solve the node deployment problem in WSN. The proposed node deployment algorithm aims to maximise the degree of network coverage and minimise the energy consumption. In the proposed multi-objective immune algorithm, each antibody refers to a candidate solution in node deployment process, and the antibodies are randomly initialised with a specific range. In addition, we design a fitness function by two ranking modes. Finally, experiments are conducted to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. Particularly, we use some typical performance metric in this experiment, such as coverage degree, energy consumption, and maximum moved distance.

This leads to 'loss' of white space spectrum that is critical in urban areas with large spectrum demand. While alternatives are possible in terms of incorporating direct spectrum measurements, the measurement locations must be judiciously chosen so that measurement effort is not prohibitive. Fundamentally, this boils down to addressing the estimation accuracy vs measurement effort question. We present a rigorous data driven analysis to address this using measurement data collected in parts of New York City metro area. We show that it is possible to develop models that estimate whether the current database estimates are reliable in a given location. Following this, we provide a recipe for developing a `measurement-augmented' spectrum database that takes the help of measurements where needed and falls back on the current propagation model-based database technique in the rest of the areas. The final takeaway is that it is possible to improve database accuracy significantly with only modest amount of measurements.	database;software propagation;white spaces (radio)	Ayon Chakraborty;Samir Ranjan Das	2014		10.1145/2674005.2675001	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;data mining;computer security	Metrics	22.07673670066113	78.03042161303807	86014

Finding accurate data is difficult and leads to expensive sensor readings. Adaptive data collection and aggregation techniques provide opportunities for reducing the energy consumption of continuous sensor data collection. In this paper, we propose an adaptive data collection and aggregation scheme for periodic sensor networks. Our approach is two-fold: firstly, we present an efficient adaptive sampling approach based on the dependence of conditional variance on measurements varies over time. Then, over-sampling can be minimised and power efficiency can be improved. Furthermore, we propose a multiple levels activity model that uses behaviour functions modelled by modified Bezier curves to define application classes. Secondly, a new data aggregation method is applied on the set of data collected from all sensor nodes. We investigate the problem of finding all pairs of nodes generating similar datasets. Our proposed models are validated via simulation on real sensor data.	adaptive sampling;aggregate data;bézier curve;data aggregation;function model;oversampling;performance per watt;sampling (signal processing);sensor;simulation	Abdallah Makhoul;David Laiymani;Hassan Harb;Jacques M.

Medical and some other applications impose stringent constraints on battery powered BAN reliability, quality of service, and power consumption. However, lack of coordination among multiple colocated BANs in the current BAN standard may cause unacceptable deterioration of BAN reliability and quality of service due to high levels of inter-BAN interference. Assuming Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), this paper proposes inter-BAN interference mitigation with regret matching based transmission scheduling algorithm. This scheduling algorithm uses pattern of past interference for implicit coordination between different BAN transmissions. Simulation results demonstrate potential benefits of the proposed scheduling algorithm for inter-BAN interference mitigation.	adaptive filter;algorithm;colocation centre;interference (communication);quality of service;regret (decision theory);scheduling (computing);sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;wearable computer	Vladimir Marbukh;Kamran Sayrafian-Pour;Martina Barbi;Mehdi Alasti	2015	2015 8th IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)	10.1109/WMNC.2015.15	fair-share scheduling;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	12.374307403174024	83.58870532303281	86222

However, the phenomenon of non line of sight affects the accuracy of location estimating algorithms greatly. In order to improve the accuracy of location estimation of mobile targets, we proposed a game theory based location method algorithm in wireless sensor networks. In the proposed method, we first estimate the initial locations of mobile target with a support vector regression model, and then use game theory to smooth the already estimated locations. In the game model, game based filter and noise generator are two game rivals. The game filter aims to minimize the objective function of the game model, and the noise generator aims to maximize the same objective function. We propose a differential game theory based algorithm for solving the optimal resolution. The experiments show that, the proposed method is more powerful, and can be used to mobile target locating and tracking.

There are two fundamental but entangled aspects of cognitive radios in the green communications context: leveraging CRs for energy efficiency and operation of CRs with energy efficiency. In practice, these two objectives overlap since the improvement of energy efficiency with CRs require efficient CRs, whereas efficient wireless communications require cognitive abilities at different network components and protocols. However, there are intrinsic challenges such as hardware complexity, algorithmic problems, and design trade-offs. In this article we present and discuss these issues to highlight the case of CRs for green wireless communication systems. Additionally, some fundamental trade-offs that emerge from these challenges and their impact on greening communications via cognitive functions are outlined.	cognitive dimensions of notations	Gürkan Gür;Fatih Alagöz	2011	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2011.5730528	cognitive radio;cognition;telecommunications;computer science;adaptive system;wireless network;efficient energy use;computer network	Vision	18.989063940297807	88.24401058858886	86959
e15121649a02644a80486995ae2aa70ddf1cde0c	a multi‐cell multi‐objective self‐optimisation methodology based on genetic algorithms for wireless cellular networks	article	Self-Organising Networks (SON) are seen as one of the hottest topics in telecommunication network research and development, eagerly awaited by network operators to achieve a reduction in operational expenditures. However, there are still many challenges and difficulties when moving from the SON concept to practical implementation. In this context, this paper firstly provides a general formulation of the automated optimisation problem and a detailed description of the main challenges and difficulties ahead. Then, a generic multi-cell multi-objective self-optimisation methodology based on genetic algorithms is proposed. The proposed framework is formulated in detail for a joint coverage and overlap optimisation problem in a multi-cell scenario. A case study using real measurements of a UMTS network deployed in a medium-size European city is presented to illustrate the proposed methodology. In the presented case study, the pilot power, the antenna tilt and the antenna azimuth of the different cells are optimised according to certain cell coverage and cell overlap targets. Results reveal that the genetic-based approach is able to provide optimised solutions that efficiently achieve the desired targets accounting for inter-cell coupling effects.	genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;telecommunications network	Juan Sanchez-Gonzalez;Oriol Sallent;Jordi Pérez-Romero;Ramón Agustí	2013	Int.

However, with the increase of their computational capability, they can be used for in-network data processing, leading to a potential increase of the quality of the networked applications as well as the network lifetime. Visual analysis in sensor networks is a prominent example where the processing power of the network nodes needs to be leveraged to meet the frame rate and the processing delay requirements of common visual analysis applications. The modeling of the end-to-end performance for such networks is, however, challenging, because in-network processing violates the flow conservation law, which is the basis for most queuing analysis. In this work we propose to solve this methodological challenge through appropriately scaling the arrival and the service processes, and we develop probabilistic performance bounds using stochastic network calculus. We use the developed model to determine the main performance bottlenecks of networked visual processing. Our numerical results show that an end-to-end delay of 2-3 frame length is obtained with violation probability in the order of 10-6. Simulation shows that the obtained bounds overestimates the end-to-end delay by no more than 10%.	distributed computing;end-to-end principle;flow network;heart rate variability;image processing;image processor;image scaling;network calculus;network processor;norm (social);numerical analysis;operand forwarding;processing delay;quality of service;queueing theory;requirement;series and parallel circuits;simulation	Hussein Al-Zubaidy;György Dán;Viktoria Fodor	2015	2015 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking)	10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145292	stochastic geometry models of wireless networks;real-time computing;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	13.315762225545278	82.88750723899726	86979

However, the communication paradigms in WSNs differ from the ones associated to traditional wireless networks, triggering the need for efficient wireless communication technology. Several wireless technologies have emerged ranging from short and medium distance. Bluetooth, ZigBee and Impulse Radio Ultra Wide Band (IR-UWB) are three popular short range wireless communications. Due to its various features and advantages (especially low power consumption and low complexity), IR-UWB is a very promising wireless communication technology for WSN. In this paper, we evaluate the main features and advantages of this new technology (IR-UWB) for WSN in terms of transmission time, data coding and power consumption compared to Bluetooth and ZigBee.

We propose an energy-aware spanning tree construction scheme supporting a broadcast request, considering three different signal transmission schemes in the physical layer: (a) point-to-point, (b) point-to-multipoint, and (c) multipoint-to-point. First we present a centralized algorithm that requires global topology information. Next, we extend this to design an approximate distributed algorithm, assuming the availability of  k -hop neighborhood information at each node, with  k  as a parameter. We prove that the centralized scheme has time complexity polynomial in the number of nodes and the distributed scheme has a message complexity that is linear in the number of nodes. Results of numerical experiments demonstrate significant improvement in network lifetime following our centralized scheme compared to existing prominent non-cooperative broadcasting schemes proposed to solve the same lifetime maximization problem in wireless ad hoc networks. Due to lack of global topology information, the distributed solution does not produce as much advantage as the centralized solution. However, we demonstrate that with increasing value of  k , the performance of the distributed scheme also improves significantly.	centralized computing;cooperative mimo;hoc (programming language)	Tamaghna Acharya;Goutam Paul	2013	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2013.02.010	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;distributed algorithm;optimized link state routing protocol;broadcast radiation;atomic broadcast;spanning tree;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	13.616332537955337	80.82146980757567	86994

Coexisiting with the WiFi devices on the crowded unlicensed ISM band, such as hotspots and mobile phones, ZigBee will receive significant performance influence. The throughput and Packet Reception Rate (PRR) of ZigBee will decrease with the increasing number of WiFi devices. Because of the incompatible PHY/MAC layer, ZigBee devices will suffer near 50% packet loss when coexisting with WiFi devices. The existing mechanism such as CSMA/CA is surprisingly inadequate for solving this problem. As the WiFi traffic typically appears bursty, the channel will be free for more than 60% of the time. In this paper, we propose a new metric called channel idle indicator (CII) which can quantify the channel quality. Based on the CII and logistic regression, we build a channel idle state prediction model which can help ZigBee devices to use the white space of WiFi channel efficiently. Particularly, our approach is light-weight, which can be easily implemented on the ability-limited commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) ZigBee devices. Extensive experiments show that our scheme can achieve over 91% of the PRR, which is near 40% higher than the B-MAC protocol. When the WiFi throughput is 3Mbps, our scheme achieves near 1.5x throughput over B-MAC. Carrying on further, our scheme consumes less energy via degrading packet loss rate in the energy consumption part.	b-mac;experiment;home automation;hotspot (wi-fi);interference (communication);laptop;logistic regression;low-power broadcasting;mobile phone;network packet;phy (chip);production rule representation;sfiaplus;testbed;throughput;transmitter	Junyu Hu;Zhenquan Qin;Yingxiao Sun;Lei Shu;Bingxian Lu;Lei Wang	2016	2016 25th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2016.7568498	embedded system;neurfon;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	11.075668161031569	87.66450951664187	87022

This system, based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology, can be deployed in three operation modes - in-band within LTE carrier, in the guard-band of LTE carrier, and stand-alone. Guard-band deployment allows the operator to support NB-IoT without requiring new spectrum and with minimal impact to LTE. This paper provides an overview and presents a study of NB-IoT deployment in LTE guard band. An analysis of coexistence of NB-IoT with LTE is presented and demonstrates that while there is mutual interference between NB-IoT and LTE on the uplink, the impact on either system is small. A performance analysis of NB-IoT is also presented. The link budget analysis demonstrates how the coverage target can be achieved for the uplink and downlink data channels. Illustrative uplink and downlink link-level simulation results are provided.

The UOWC terminal includes an optical transmitter and a receiver positioned, for example, on high-rise buildings separated by several hundred meters. Light beams propagating through the atmosphere carry the information from the transmitter to the receiver. UOWC boasts many advantages over its rivals. Notably, UOWC facilitates rapidly deployable, lightweight, high-capacity communication without licensing fees and tariffs. However, UOWC still faces many challenges, including how to improve communication performance in adverse weather conditions or during building sway. We present and evaluate some of the exciting new research approaches that have been suggested to deal with these issues, including optimization of telescope gain, new technologies for pointing systems, and solutions at the network level.	mathematical optimization;optical wireless;telecommunications network;transmitter	Debbie Kedar;Shlomi Arnon	2004	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2004.1299334	optical transport network;passive optical network;free-space optical communication;multiwavelength optical networking;parallel optical interface;telecommunications;10g-pon;computer science;optical performance monitoring;fiber-optic communication;optical communication;computer network;optical communications repeater	Networks	22.993281493830434	81.8498784074986	87764
e42d609d3e8e4245ebb2173042ce0eaed3ba797c	fixed-mobile convergence: using unlicensed dect frequencies in umts femtocell services deployment		In this paper, we explore the possibility of using unlicensed DECT frequency bands to deploy UMTS Femtocells in the user homes. This solution gives the possibility for ISP providers to enter the mobile market without being forced to pay for the use of the frequencies licensed to the incumbent operators. This study starts from the analysis of the legislation on the use of the DECT and UMTS frequency bands for short-range voice communications and defines the changes required on the current UMTS handsets and Femtocells for the use of the DECT frequencies. Changes on both superheterodyne and homodyne transceivers have been investigated, as well as the modifications on the procedure the handset has to follow to select the DECT bands. The narrowness of the DECT bandwidth doesn’t allow for having a safe guard band between the Uplink and Downlink channels, as it is for the current UMTS system. We then conducted simulations to evaluate the impact of this feature on the system performance.	digital enhanced cordless telecommunications;software deployment	Virginia Pilloni;Luigi Atzori	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-35155-6_16	computer network	Robotics	23.362975348265994	84.51066088148798	87874
35dbe4db67e218e14a2c7ec6794bc100214b9510	analysis of sequence segment keying as a method of cdma transmission	cdma transmission;sequence segment keying	The aim of the research described in this paper is to eliminate self-interference during the transmission of simultaneous signals over a common channel. Code-division multiple-access (CDMA) communication systems, also termed spread-spectrum multiple access (SSMA) systems, make use of a transmission bandwidth greatly in excess of the information bandwidth. A synchronous CDMA technique known as Sequence Segment Keying (SSK) that provides zero co-channel interference has been proposed and described by Darnell [1]. Previous work in this area has concentrated on the system aspects of SSK describing the application within the design of a practical radio communication system [2]. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of this communication scheme by introducing a novel mathematical modet of an SSK system. This has been initially tested by computer simulation and verified for an unlimited number of simultaneous users. The conditions imposed on the pseudorandom (PR) bearer sequences for SSK limit those sequences which can be utilised. The lack of large sequence sets restricts the number of simultaneous users and to overcome this problem the use of independent varying chip periods for each PR bearer sequence is examined. This allows sequences that do notmeet specified period criteria to be adjusted so that they are locked into the required sequence length ratios, thus providing a larger sequence set than was previously possible and hence increasing the flexibility and viability of SSK systems.

0a05f1f96f468c608aba455e50a8e37f8f47f670	probabilistic mobility models for mobile and wireless networks	wireless network;mobility model	In this paper we present a probabilistic broadcast calculus for mobile and wireless networks whose connections are unreliable. In our calculus, broadcasted messages can be lost with a certain probability, and due to mobility the connection probabilities may change. If a network broadcasts a message from a location, it will evolve to a network distribution depending on whether nodes at other locations receive the message or not. Mobility of nodes is not arbitrary but guarded by a probabilistic mobility function (PMF), and we also define the notion of a weak bisimulation given a PMF. It is possible to have weak bisimular networks which have different probabilistic connectivity information. We furthermore examine the relation between our weak bisimulation and a minor variant of PCTL∗ [1]. Finally, we apply our calculus on a small example called the Zeroconf protocol [2].	backoff;bisimulation;probabilistic automaton;randomized algorithm;transition system;turing completeness;zero-configuration networking	Lei Song;Jens Chr.

488b9786dcc4e85720de96d093649668463be163	a method to assign spread codes based on passive rfid communication for energy harvesting wireless sensors using spread spectrum transmission	passive rfid communication;transmit only;spread spectrum transmission;energy harvesting wireless sensor	Considerable research has been conducted on systems that collect real-world information by using numerous energy harvesting wireless sensors. The sensors need to be tiny, cheap, and consume ultra-low energy. However, such sensors have some functional limits, including being restricted to wireless communication transmission. Therefore, when more than one sensor simultaneously transmits information in these systems, the receiver may not be able to demodulate if the sensors cannot accommodate multiple access. To solve this problem, a number of proposals have been made based on spread spectrum technologies for resistance to interference. In this paper, we point out some problems regarding the application of such sensors, and explain the assumption of spread codes assignment based on passive radio frequency identification (RFID) communication. During the spread codes assignment, the system cannot work. Hence, efficient assignment method is more appropriate. We consider two assignment methods and assessed them in terms of total assignment time through an experiment. The results show the total assignment time in case of Electronic Product Code (EPC) Global Class-1 Generation-2 which is an international standard for wireless protocols and the relationship between the ratio of the time taken by the read/write command and the ratio of total assignment time by the two methods. This implies that more efficient methods are obtained by considering the time ratio of read/write command.	electronic product code;interference (communication);radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;sensor	Ken Takahashi;Kenji Inoue;Yuusuke Kawakita;Jin Mitsugi;Haruhisa Ichikawa	2015	ICST Trans.

The quality of service (QoS) of services composition applications (SCAs) are confronted with severe challenges due to the open, dynamic, and complex natures of WSNs. Most previous research separated various QoS indices into different fields and studied them individually due to the computational complexity. This approach ignores the mutual influence between these QoS indices, and leads to a non-comprehensive and inaccurate analysis result. The universal generating function (UGF) shows the speediness and precision in QoS analysis. However, only one QoS index at a time can be analyzed by the classic UGF. In order to efficiently analyze the comprehensive QoS of SCAs, this paper proposes an improved UGF technique-vector universal generating function (VUGF)-which considers the relationship between multiple QoS indices, including security, and can simultaneously analyze multiple QoS indices. The numerical examples demonstrate that it can be used for the evaluation of the comprehensive QoS of SCAs subjected to the security constraint in WSNs. Therefore, it can be effectively applied to the optimal design of multi-service WSNs.	algorithm;boolean;cardiac arrest;computation;computational complexity theory;estimated;fits;foxes;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;numerous;optimal design;oxygen saturation sensor type:type:pt:oxygen saturation device:nom;parallel computing;quality of service;requirement;seizures;simulation;software development process;software system;state space	Naixue N.

These ranging techniques exploit the high time resolution of the UWB signals to estimate the TOA of the first signal path. Nevertheless, these techniques are facing the problem of proper multipath mitigation especially in harsh propagation environments in which the first path may not exist or it may not be the strongest. This paper presents a realistic comparison between the ranging performances of four threshold-based TOA estimation techniques using experimental data collected from an IR-UWB indoor propagation measurement campaign performed in an office building.

2f3c8bd025e94d056d5eab571f69981f504d7712	localization based on two-bound reflected signals in wireless sensor networks		In absence of line-of-sight (LOS) signal, localization is a real challenge since multi-path effect takes place due to reflections and/or scattering of signals. In this paper we have assumed that there are few anchor nodes present in the network which broadcast ultrasonic and electromagnetic signals with their known positions. Based on receiving those ultrasonic signals and using received signal strength of the electromagnetic signals, a localization technique has been proposed for finding position of other sensor nodes. On the assumption that a signal may be reflected at most twice before reaching a node, our technique provides on an average 67% reduction of the area of the zone in which the sensor node will be bound to reside.

In-network data is often routed in such a way that it can minimize overall energy consumption or it can maximize the network lifetime. However, these metrics do not take into account other costs such as queueing delay and congestion. We solve the problem by introducing a comprehensive cost function and formulating the problem as minimizing the overall cost with a lifetime guarantee. We demonstrate the convexity of the problem and introduce Lagrangian Duality method to decompose the problem. A gradient projection based algorithm is proposed to solve the problem in a fully distributed way. The convergence of the algorithm is verified theoretically. We show through extensive numerical results that our proposed algorithm converges quickly to the optimal solution, and that our algorithm has a better performance than existing algorithms.	augmented lagrangian method;convex optimization;distributed algorithm;duality (optimization);gradient;loss function;mathematical optimization;network congestion;numerical analysis;optimization problem;queuing delay;routing	Lihui Tu;Huanjie Hong;Gang Zhou	2010	2010 IEEE/ACM Int'l Conference on Green Computing and Communications & Int'l Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing	10.1109/GreenCom-CPSCom.2010.188	mathematical optimization;minimum-cost flow problem;mathematics;distributed computing;computer network	EDA	12.7229194541454	80.77481448900008	88654

The management network systems usually provide records of measurements of the transmitted and the received signals levels from the different microwave links for monitoring and analyzing the network performance. Many of them log only the minimum and the maximum levels of the transmitted and the received signals in pre-set intervals (usually 15-minute). Moreover, only quantized version of these measurements are logged. In the last decade it has been proposed to use these existing measurements for rainfall monitoring. In this paper we analyze the effects of the quantizer and the min/max operators on commercial microwave links signals levels measurements. We show that the quantization process, in combination with the min/max operators, adds bias to the measurements which can be significant. We then propose a method to calculate this bias, and demonstrate our findings using measurements from actual commercial microwave links.	backhaul (telecommunications);maxima and minima;microwave;network performance;quantization (signal processing)	Jonatan Ostrometzky;Adam Eshel;Pinhas Alpert;Hagit Messer	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952856	mathematical optimization;attenuation;microwave transmission;operator (computer programming);computer science;electronic engineering;quantization (signal processing);telecommunications;network performance;backhaul (telecommunications);microwave	Metrics	23.210522811684655	80.3109201362091	88751

In this way, the coexistence of 3G/4G standards is facilitated. This paper describes the advantages of using distributed base station architectures to provide multimode capabilities. In particular, it focuses on the radio unit, commonly known in industry as remote radio head. Multimode radio units capable of operating according to different wireless standards (WCDMA, LTE and WiMAX) can be proven extremely beneficial for operators especially in terms of operational and maintenance cost. Moreover, remote radio heads can enable effective spectrum management and allocation of radio resources. This is achieved through the advanced software configurability they provide and a flexible control and management plane. Switching between wireless standards becomes easily feasible through firmware upgrading. Finally, real-time configuration of radio functionalities, such as transmit power, receiver gain, carrier frequency, channel bandwidth and others result in a modular software defined radio platform.

The scenarios (e.g. home networks) call for an integration of a WSN into an existing IP-based infrastructure which is realized by 6LoW-PAN. To save resources and to ensure a long life time of the WSN resource consuming tasks such as transmissions must be reduced. Therefore, we present a Compressed IPFIX protocol. It optimizes the transmission by reducing the packet size and the transmission amount by separation between meta information and data. Additional tasks can be performed on top of IPFIX to optimize the efficient usage of the limited resources.	network packet;requirement	Corinna Schmitt;Lothar Braun;Thomas Kothmayr;Georg Carle	2010		10.1145/1791212.1791269	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer network;data transmission	Mobile	10.909413302737494	75.00782883961614	89346

In addition to constraints associated with distributed state estimation, wireless sensor networks have limitations on bandwidth, energy consumption, and transmission range. This paper introduces and empirically evaluates a dynamic sensor selection strategy. A discrete-time Kalman filter is used for state estimation. At each time step, a subset of sensors is selected to gather data on the following time step because of power and bandwidth constraints that prohibit using all of the sensors. A standard criterion for selecting this subset of sensors is to maximize the information to be gained by minimizing a function of the next-step error covariance matrix. We propose a relaxation of this non-convex combinatorial optimization problem and demonstrate its applicability to large-scale sensor networks. The proposed dynamic sensor selection strategy is compared empirically to other dynamic and static sensor selection strategies with respect to state estimation performance of a convection-dispersion field arising from the problem of surface-based monitoring of CO2 sequestration sites.	combinatorial optimization;internet access;kalman filter;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;relaxation (approximation);sensor	James E.

One of the typical application scenarios is data collection for large-scale and remote sensor devices in the Internet of things (IoT). However, due to the characteristics of massive connections, access collisions in the MAC layer lead to high power consumption for both sensor devices and UAVs, and low efficiency for the data collection. In this paper, a dynamic speed control algorithm for UAVs (DSC-UAV) is proposed to maximize the data collection efficiency, while alleviating the access congestion for the UAV-based base stations. With a cellular network considered for support of the communication between sensor devices and drones, the connection establishment process was analyzed and modeled in detail. In addition, the data collection efficiency is also defined and derived. Based on the analytical models, optimal speed under different sensor device densities is obtained and verified. UAVs can dynamically adjust the speed according to the sensor device density under their coverages to keep high data collection efficiency. Finally, simulation results are also conducted to verify the accuracy of the proposed analytical models and show that the DSC-UAV outperforms others with the highest data collection efficiency, while maintaining a high successful access probability, low average access delay, low block probability, and low collision probability.	data collection;drug vehicle;integrated circuit device component;natural science disciplines;plant components, aerial;algorithm;collision;density	Qi Pan;Xiangming Wen;Zhaoming Lu;Linpei Li;Wenpeng Jing	2018		10.3390/s18113951		Mobile	12.113509018978982	84.34955135116839	89498

However, any single technique encounters inextricable problems, such as high false alarm rate and line-of-sight-constraints. There lacks a coherent system that coordinates various technologies to improve the system accuracy. In this paper, the concept of BorderSense, a hybrid wireless sensor network architecture for border patrol systems, is introduced. BorderSense utilizes the most advanced sensor network technologies, including the wireless multimedia sensor networks and the wireless underground sensor networks. The framework to deploy and operate BorderSense is developed. Based on the framework, research challenges and open research issues are discussed. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

1391bd1ed0379925bc9ac1a1c950b33f2fc35e02	tweether future generation w-band backhaul and access network technology		Point to multipoint (PmP) distribution at millimeter wave is a frontier so far not yet crossed due to the formidable technological challenge that the high atmospheric attenuation poses. The transmission power at level of tens of Watts required at millimeter wave for a reference range of 1 km is not available by any commercial or laboratory solid state devices. However, the availability of PmP with multigigabit data rate is pivotal for the new high density small cell networks for 4G and 5G and to solve the digital divide in areas where fiber is not convenient or possible to be deployed. In this paper, the advancements of the novel approach proposed by the EU Horizon 2020 TWEETHER project to create the first and fastest outdoor W-band (92 – 95 GHz) PmP wireless network are described. For the first time a new generation W-band traveling wave tube high power amplifier is introduced in the transmission hub to provide the enabling power for a wide area distribution.	access network;audio power amplifier;backhaul (telecommunications);chipset;data rate units;fastest;multipoint ground;point-to-multipoint communication;point-to-point (telecommunications);solid-state electronics;total cost of ownership;usb hub;watts humphrey	Claudio Paoloni;Francois Magne;Frédéric André;Xavier Begaud;Viktor Krozer;Marc Marilier;Antonio Ramirez;Jose Raimundo Ruiz Carrasco;Ruth Vilar;Ralph Zimmerman	2017	2017 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)	10.1109/EuCNC.2017.7980684	point-to-multipoint communication;wireless network;attenuation;computer network;backhaul (telecommunications);small cell;amplifier;access network;extremely high frequency;computer science	Arch	23.277990841265083	83.78478684522945	89826

For the cases of only one new device and of one communication request with multiple devices with identical transmission  ranges, we provide polynomial-time algorithms. On the negative side, we show that even for a single communication request,  placing multiple new devices with different transmission ranges is NP-hard. For identical transmission ranges, the placement  of multiple new devices is NP-hard under multiple communication requests.

A drifting sensor network is a system to collect data observed in a waterway using sensor nodes that are drifting on a waterway and access points placed along the waterway. It needs a high cost to collect data in long waterways such as rivers and sewer pipes by human hands. In a drifting sensor network system, small sensor nodes thrown into a waterway measure data such as temperature and water level, and take pictures while drifting and transmit the collected data to fixed access points (APs). Such systems will be helpful to save labor cost and time to inspect waterways. The amount of data collected by a drifting sensor network is affected by the nodes' movement that depends on the water flow, the number of nodes, the probability of node crashes, etc. Therefore, it is important to know the suitable values of parameters such as the number of nodes and battery size. We modeled the behavior of a drifting sensor network including node mobility, communication between nodes and APs, energy consumption, and crash of nodes. We derived the expected value of the data collection ratio (the ratio of the amount of collected data against the distance of the observation area) analytically. The results give us a guideline to choose important parameters, the number of nodes and battery size, and are useful to design more sophisticated systems including communication between sensor nodes for sharing backup data to improve the reliability.	backup;fixed access;named pipe;sensor;wireless access point	Kazuma Mitake;Susumu Ishihara	2013	2013 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops	10.1109/WAINA.2013.179	sanitary engineering;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;statistics	Mobile	10.43490587140588	75.72163279927624	90458

In this paper, we address the stability issue of CRN routing, being motivated by the adaptive `Attractor-Selector' model. Our work includes designing a routing protocolnamed Bio-inspired Stable Routing (BioStaR) that increases route stability by maximizing the Spectrum Opportunity (SOP)and also minimizes the channel switching delay and signaling overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this is by far the first bio-inspired CRN routing that takes into account the above mentioned factors. Our simulation results show that this protocol accounts for both higher stability of route and less signaling overhead in spectrum-agile CRN environments.	agile software development;biological system;british informatics olympiad;cognitive radio;overhead (computing);routing;simulation	Mohammad Asadul Hoque;Xiaoyan Hong	2012	2012 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2012.6167453	wireless routing protocol;routing;electronic engineering;static routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;engineering;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Robotics	11.879083745991933	85.45776327681807	90800

When sensors have limited energy resources, network lifetime can be extended by reducing the power that the sensors use for communication with the aircraft. Complex vehicle and communication dynamics and imperfect knowledge of the environment make accurate system models difficult to acquire and maintain, so we present a reinforcement learning approach that allows the data-ferrying aircraft to optimize data collection trajectories and sensor power use in situ, obviating the need for system identification. By allowing the ferry aircraft to fly longer trajectories, we learn energy-conserving radio transmission policies that are significantly better than hand-coded heuristics. Furthermore, we introduce a meta-level reinforcement learner that makes energy policy learning faster and more robust, and that transfers knowledge acquired in earlier tasks to new data-ferrying tasks.	heuristic (computer science);reinforcement learning;sensor;stationary process;system identification;unmanned aerial vehicle	Ben Pearre;Timothy X.

We assume that the nodes are distributed according to a Poisson-Point-Process (PPP) and consider routing schemes that select the next relay based on geographical locations and local knowledge of the channel state (CSI). At the first stage we define the optimization problem and give an expression for the optimal routing metric in a network that achieves the ergodic rate density (ERD) in each link. We then use a recently published bound on the ERD, and present a low complexity, suboptimal routing metric. Numerical results demonstrate that the low complexity scheme performs nearly as good as the optimal scheme.	algorithm;entity–relationship model;ergodicity;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;metrics (networking);numerical linear algebra;optimization problem;relay;routing;simulation	Yiftach Richter;Itsik Bergel	2015	2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227026	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;geography;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	16.286670629757918	86.7786045317264	91689

Therefore, in this paper, a street-level landmark evaluation method based on nearest router is proposed. The location organization declared is regarded as an area not a point. Firstly, the declared location of preevaluated landmark is verified by IP location databases. Secondly, the preevaluated landmarks are grouped according to their nearest router. Then, the distance constraint is obtained using delay value between landmark and its nearest router by delay-distance correlation. And relation model is established among distance constraint, organization’s region radius, and distance between two landmarks. Finally, the reliability value of landmarks is calculated in each group based on relational model and binomial distribution. Landmarks evaluation experiment is taken based on 7082 preevaluated landmarks, and the results show that geolocation errors decrease obviously using evaluated landmarks. The mean error of 100 targets in Shanghai is reduced from 7.832km to 2.185km.

f795ad7d9bc2eb652ec8a5a7a7ae5e85281b0fc3	the extra-bit technique for reducing idle listening in data collection		Data collection is one of the predominant operations in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This paper focuses on the problem of efficient data collection in a setting where some nodes may not possess data each time data is collected. In that case, idle listening slots may occur, which lead to a waste of energy and an increase in latency. To alleviate these problems, successive-slot schedules were proposed by Zhao and Tang (Infocom 2011). In this paper, we introduce a so-called extra-bit technique to reduce idle listening further. Each packet includes an extra bit that informs the receiver whether further data packets will follow or not. The extra-bit technique leads to significantly reduced idle listening and improved latency in many cases. We prove that every successive-slot schedule is also an extra-bit schedule. We then consider the special case of linear networks and prove that the optimal length of a successive-slot schedule (or extra-bit schedule) is 4N - 6 time slots, where N ≥ 3 is the number of nod...

The inter-vehicle cooperation is made possible thanks to the revolution in the wireless mobile ad hoc network. This paper presents an application of the V2V communications. The car tracking using the GPS receivers is not always ideal in urban areas. To resolve this problem, our original approach is based on using data issued from vision systems when the GPS signal is not available or has a poor quality due to multi-tracks or bad satellite visibility. The method relies on the particle filter for the fusion of the GPS data and the vision data that will be collected from the loading system in the vehicles. Multiple results from different scenarios experimented on our fleet of communicating vehicles carried out in real conditions prove the feasibility of this approach.	architecture design and assessment system;centralized computing;gps signals;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);information system;nonlinear system;particle filter;vehicle tracking system;vehicle-to-vehicle	Georges Challita;Stéphane Mousset;Fawzi Nashashibi;Abdelaziz Bensrhair	2009	2009 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)	10.1109/VNC.2009.5416382	wireless ad hoc network;simulation;mobile ad hoc network;global positioning system;particle filter;machine vision;telecommunications;computer science;noise;trajectory;assisted gps;computer security;satellite;computer network	Robotics	22.710237768313565	77.02457806795759	92137

This algorithm can offer two kinds of information: the risk of a fire and, in case of an active fire, the propagation direction of the flames and their velocity. This information is useful for fire rangers in order to obtain escape ways and determine strategies for putting off the fire. The evaluation of the proposal algorithm is performed using an ad-hoc simulator. The preliminary results obtained show that the proposed algorithm is a promising method that can be used to solve the most common problems related to fire control and detection.	algorithm;computation;computational intelligence;fire-control system;hoc (programming language);mobile device;property (philosophy);prototype;software propagation;velocity (software development)	Virginia G.

By exploring the load balance concept, we propose a CentralSD algorithm to efficiently dispatch mobile sensors. Our algorithm is general in that the numbers of mobile sensors and events can be arbitrary. When mobile sensors are more than event locations, we transform the dispatch problem to a maximum-matching problem in a weighted bipartite graph. When there are fewer mobile sensors than event locations, we propose an efficient clustering scheme to group event locations so that the maximum-matching approach can still be applied. To reduce message cost, we also develop a distributed GridSD algorithm. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.	algorithm;cluster analysis;distributed algorithm;dynamic dispatch;load balancing (computing);moea framework;matching (graph theory);national supercomputer centre in sweden;semiconductor;sensor;simulation	You-Chiun Wang;Wen-Chih Peng;Min-Hsien Chang;Yu-Chee Tseng	2007	2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks	10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317894	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;data management;computer science;graph theory;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	10.510031900216548	77.67565907694389	92421

Distributed automatous faulty sensor detection is critical for self-managed and sustainable sensor networks. A number of detection methods have been proposed for specific fault types. In this paper, we propose a general approach for detecting arbitrary types of faults. The approach includes a new general measurement mutual divergence for evaluating detecting results in the absence of the ground truth, and a distributed collective detection method that produces probabilistic decision results. For comparison purposes, we also introduce two detection methods in both distributed and centralized manners. We show that mutual divergence correctly measures the average fault amount and the distributed collective method consistently outperforms the other methods with up to 50% higher detection accuracy.	centralized computing;fault tolerance;ground truth;malware;mutual exclusion;sensor web;usability	Peng Zhuang;Dan Wang;Yi Shang	2009	GLOBECOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425702	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing	Vision	15.287924137051688	77.8802672223862	92851

Our objectives include minimizing the total search time and the travel distance of MSNs while enabling fault tolerance to possible MSN failures. We propose a new rendezvous scheme, namely X synchronization (XS) to facilitate the exchange of both data and control signals among the MSNs during search. We also devise a way to calculate appropriate timeout periods used to detect an MSN failure at rendezvous points and describe how surviving MSNs subsequently carry out the search mission. Numerical analysis and simulations have been performed to evaluate the performance of XS. The results show that XS can outperform other rendezvous schemes in terms of the total search time and the average travel distance of MSNs.	autonomous robot;fault tolerance;numerical analysis;search algorithm;simulation;synchronization (computer science);xs (perl)	Seokhoon Yoon;Chunming Qiao	2007	IEEE INFOCOM 2007 - 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFCOM.2007.114	embedded system;fault tolerance;real-time computing;computer science;computer network	Robotics	12.810125969333324	76.18756144233097	92920

In order to solve the problem of pipeline inspection and oil leakage monitoring, a collaborative weighted mobile sensing scheme is proposed. By adopting a weighted mobile sensing scheme, the adaptive collaborative clustering protocol can realize an even distribution of energy load among the mobile sensor nodes in each round, and make the best use of battery energy. A detailed theoretical analysis and experimental results revealed that the proposed protocol is an energy efficient collaborative strategy such that the sensor nodes can communicate with a fusion center and produce high power gain.	cluster analysis;equilibrium;extravasation;power gain;sensor;spectral leakage;statistical cluster	Chengpei Tang;Sanesy Kumcr Shokla;George Modhawar;Qiang Wang	2016		10.3390/s16020261	real-time computing;engineering;distributed computing;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	10.153516182733338	79.69146038807156	92926
ae618895c98036dbf1fce113002246bd00eb2266	machine learning for reliable mmwave systems: blockage prediction and proactive handoff		The sensitivity of millimeter wave (mmWave) signals to blockages is a fundamental challenge for mobile mmWave communication systems. The sudden blockage of the line-of-sight (LOS) link between the base station and the mobile user normally leads to disconnecting the communication session, which highly impacts the system reliability. Further, reconnecting the user to another LOS base station incurs high beam training overhead and critical latency problems. In this paper, we leverage machine learning tools and propose a novel solution for these reliability and latency challenges in mmWave MIMO systems. In the developed solution, the base stations learn how to predict that a certain link will experience blockage in the next few time frames using their past observations of adopted beamforming vectors. This allows the serving base station to proactively hand-over the user to another base station with a highly probable LOS link. Simulation results show that the developed deep learning based strategy successfully predicts blockage/hand-off in close to 95% of the times. This reduces the probability of communication session disconnection, which ensures high reliability and low latency in mobile mmWave systems.	beamforming;deep learning;line-of-sight (missile);mimo;machine learning;multi-user;overhead (computing);session (computer science);simulation;the times;with high probability	Ahmed Alkhateeb;Iz Beltagy	2018	CoRR		communications system;mathematics;mimo;latency (engineering);hand-off;latency (engineering);handover;machine learning;base station;beamforming;artificial intelligence	Mobile	19.637852681819844	87.72292934130844	93305

The presented technology enables the design and implementation of antenna arrays with large numbers of elements, while obtaining significant front-end hardware savings as compared to the conventional solutions. This newly appearing design approach could be used in order to design either massive arrays with complexity that would be prohibitive with the current technology, or smaller arrays that offer high spatial degrees of freedom and are suitable for future small yet powerful cell nodes. RF hardware architectures with a single RF chain are reviewed, compared, and found superior to conventional MIMO implementations in terms of cost, dissipated heat, and physical size. The proposed improvements on the RF side allow the merging of the two dominant cellular technologies of virtual (distributed) and massive (centralized) MIMO into a hybrid approach of antenna arrays that is suitable for both large base stations and small (possibly cooperative) units such as remote radio heads.	centralized computing;mimo;modulation;radio frequency	Mohammad Ali Sedaghat;Vlasis Barousis;Ralf R.

e6f6a3bdc482a05e6a6d4bcd2d9e5b4fd42c34d2	predictive power management for wind powered wireless sensor node		A conventional Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) cannot have an infinite lifetime without a battery recharge or replacement. Energy Harvesting (EH), from environmental energy sources, is a promising technology to provide sustainable powering for a WSN. In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel predictive energy management framework that combines the Maximal Power Transferring Tracking (MPTT) algorithm, a predictive energy allocation strategy, and a high efficiency transmission power control mechanism: First, the MPTT optimal working point guarantees minimum power loss of the EH-WSN system; Then, by exactly predicting the upcoming available energy, the power allocation strategy regulates EH-nodes’ duty cycle accurately to minimize the power failure time; Ultimately, the transmission power control module further improves energy efficiency by dynamically selecting the optimum matching transmission power level with minimum energy consumption. A wind energy powered wireless sensor system has been equipped and tested to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Results indicate that compared with other predictive energy managers, the proposed mechanism incurs relatively low power failure time while maintaining a high-energy conversion rate.

It is of great interest to deploy mobile sensors to detect and monitor certain diffusion processes (e.g., chemical pollutants) that are harmful to aquatic en-vironments. In this paper, we propose an accuracy-aware diffusion process profiling approach using smart aquatic mobile sensors such as robotic fish. In our approach, the robotic sensors collaboratively profile the characteristics of a diffusion process including source location, discharged substance amount, and its evolution over time. In particular, the robotic sensors reposition themselves to progressively improve the profiling accuracy. We formulate a novel movement scheduling problem that aims to maximize the profiling accuracy subject to limited sensor mobility and energy budget. We develop an efficient greedy algorithm and a more complex near-optimal radial algorithm to solve the problem. We conduct extensive simulations based on real data traces of robotic fish movement and wireless communication. The results show that our approach can accurately profile dynamic diffusion processes under tight energy budgets. More-over, a preliminary evaluation based on the implementation on TelosB motes validates the feasibility of deploying our movement scheduling algorithms on mote-class robotic sensor platforms.	aquatic ecosystem;robot	Yu Wang;Rui Tan;Guoliang Xing;Jianxun Wang;Xiaobo Tan	2012		10.1109/IPSN.2012.6920943	job shop scheduling;greedy algorithm;real-time computing;simulation;wireless sensor network;computer science;diffusion process;aquatic ecosystem;climate change;energy budget;scheduling;wireless	Robotics	11.65186173160252	76.48523063962642	94904

Resent survey found that there are many areas of the radio spectrum that are occupied by authorized user/primary user (PU), which are not fully utilized. Cognitive radios (CR) prove to next generation wireless communication system that proposed as a way to reuse this under-utilised spectrum in an opportunistic and non-interfering basis. A CR is a self-directed entity in a wireless communications environment that senses its environment, tracks changes, and reacts upon its findings and frequently exchanges information with the networks for secondary user (SU). However, CR facing collision problem with tracks changes i.e. reallocating of other empty channels for SU while PU arrives. In this paper, channels reallocation technique based on DNA sequence alignment algorithm for CR networks has been proposed.	access control;algorithm;authorization;cognitive radio;collision problem;embedded system;frequency allocation;ibm systems network architecture;next-generation network;phy (chip);requirement;sequence alignment;simon haykin;simulation	Santosh Kumar Singh;Krishna Chandra Roy;Vibhakar Pathak	2010	CoRR	10.5121/ijngn.2010.2203	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;computer security;computer network	Mobile	21.59427700137832	88.20256114415052	95043

Thus, collecting such audio data, while maximizing the network lifetime, is a key challenge for WSNs. In this work, we propose a methodology that applies Compressive Sensing (CS) aiming at collecting as little data as possible to allow the signal reconstruction, so that the reconstructed signal is still representative. The key issue is to determine a sparse base that best represents the audio information used for identifying the target species. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on anuran (frogs and toads) calls, but the methodology can be applied for other animal families and species. The reason for that choice is that long-term anuran monitoring has been used by biologists as an early indicator for ecological stress. By using real wild anuran calls, we show that 98% classification rate can be achieved by using as little as 10% of the original data. We also use simulation to evaluate the impact of our solution on the network performance (energy consumption, delivery rate, and network delay).	compressed sensing;context-sensitive grammar;data compression;distributed algorithm;network performance;principle of good enough;redundancy (engineering);signal reconstruction;simulation;sparse matrix	Javier J.

Recently, device-free sensing has attracted great attention because these techniques do not require the user to carry any device and hence could enable many applications in smart homes and offices. In this paper, we present WiDir, the first system that leverages WiFi wireless signals to estimate a human's walking direction, in a device-free manner. Human motion changes the multipath distribution and thus WiFi Channel State Information at the receiver end. WiDir analyzes the phase change dynamics from multiple WiFi subcarriers based on Fresnel zone model and infers the walking direction. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype using commercial WiFi devices and evaluate it in both home and office environments. Experimental results show that WiDir can estimate human walking direction with a median error of less than 10 degrees.	channel state information;multipath propagation;prototype;subcarrier	Dan Wu;Daqing Zhang;Chenren Xu;Yasha Wang;Hao Wang	2016		10.1145/2971648.2971658	fresnel zone;embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system	HCI	21.27233875504911	75.07218057262034	95480

One major approach for energy conservation is to route a communication session along the routes which requires the lowest total energy consumption. This optimization problem is referred to as minimum-energy routing. While minimum-energy unicast routing can be solved in polynomial time by shortest-path algorithms, it remains open whether minimum-energy broadcast routing can be solved in polynomial time, despite of the NP-hardness of its general graph version. Recently three greedy heuristics were proposed in [8]: MST (minimum spanning tree), SPT (shortest-path tree), and BIP (broadcasting incremental power). They have been evaluated through simulations in [8], but little is known about their analytical performance. The main contribution of this paper is the quantitative characterization of their performances in terms of approximation ratios. By exploring geometric structures of Euclidean MSTs, we have been able to prove that the approximation ratio of MST is between 6 and 12, and the approximation ratio of BIP is between 13 3 and 12. On the other hand, the approximation ratio of SPT is shown to be at least n2 , where n is the number of receiving nodes. To our best knowledge, these are the first analytical results for minimum-energy broadcasting.	approximation algorithm;bip-8;computational complexity theory;connected dominating set;distributed algorithm;file spanning;greedy algorithm;hall-effect thruster;heuristic (computer science);hoc (programming language);linear programming;mathematical optimization;minimum spanning tree;np-hardness;optimization problem;performance;polynomial;routing;session (computer science);shortest path problem;simulation;time complexity;transceiver;unicast	Peng-Jun Wan;Gruia Calinescu;Xiang-Yang Li;Ophir Frieder	2001		10.1109/INFCOM.2001.916310	radio broadcasting;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;dijkstra's algorithm;energy conservation;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	12.903166964423685	85.00612950735682	95695

In TB localizations, the range estimates from at least $3$ different links to Base Stations (BSs) are required to solve the $2$ dimensional navigation equation.

Indoor positioning systems (IPSs) have been proposed using several technologies and efforts are honing down on mitigating the positioning error. The Received Signal Strength (RSS)-fingerprint based IPS has been recognized as one of the possible most promising techniques. In this paper, we propose a new technique which uses the general framework that is based on fingerprinting of multiple service set identifiers (SSIDs) configured on the same access point. A voting scenario is also proposed as a tool to enhance IPS performance. We implemented the system inside the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS) at Western Michigan University, and compared its performance with some of the conventional techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). The results also demonstrate the effect of redundancy when using a random selection technique of access points and its impact on IPS performance.	corporate emergency access system;fingerprint (computing);identifier;indoor positioning system;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;redundancy (engineering);support vector machine;wireless access point	Ahmed Abed;Hussein Al-Moukhles;Ikhlas Abdel-Qader	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology (EIT)	10.1109/EIT.2017.8053373	computer science;support vector machine;global positioning system;redundancy (engineering);indoor positioning system;computer network;data mining;service set;fingerprint recognition;identifier;hybrid positioning system	Visualization	19.53833371467046	74.5395415474257	95975

All-optical virtual private network (VPN) provides dedicated optical channels to connect VPN users, can not only achieve a high throughput and low latency, but also provide enhanced security at the physical layer for users. We report a novel architecture enabling both all-optical VPN and all-optical optical network units (ONU) communications simultaneously, which can be applied to integration of optical and wireless networks. In this scheme, we isolate the conventional traffic, the VPN traffic and the ONU traffic by OFDM sub-carrier bands allocation. Due to the dynamical allocation of sub-carriers, the VPN in OFDMA-PON has a great scalability. And the traffics are transmitted through the dedicated optical channel and routed to the destined ONU by optical distribution network (OND). We also consider the VPN and inter-ONU communications in two different situations: among different ONU in the same group and among different ONU in different groups. In the second situation, the system can cover a wider area and can support more users. Finally, we demonstrate the VPN and inter-ONU communication functions with 10 Gbit/s, 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) OFDMA-PON. The results verify that this scheme is feasible.	10g-pon;access network;fibre channel;frequency divider;gigabit;modulation;passive optical network;provisioning;routing;scalability;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;throughput;virtual private network	Chongfu Zhang;Jian Huang	2011	2011 6th International ICST Conference on Communications and Networking in China (CHINACOM)	10.1109/ChinaCom.2011.6158302	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Networks	23.465795601485514	86.18199171727231	96230

As a result, a node's airtime is “shared” by multiple flows that pass through the node. Although it is practically important, how to effectively allocate airtime among flows has not received sufficient research attention in the existing literature. In this paper, after showing the potential gain from adaptive airtime allocation in alleviating network congestions, we formulate a new congestion control problem using network utility maximization with respect to airtime fractions, transmission power and flow rate. We prove that the new congestion control is a concave problem and develop a local algorithm for adaptively tuning airtime fractions in parallel with power and rate.

9d18b0f591b251440f0dd8eed163c8daa4c2f3b8	pareto-based evolutionary computational approach for wireless sensor placement	wireless sensor;optimal node placement;wireless sensor node;wireless sensor network;optimization problem;multiple objectives;sensor placement;next generation;sensor nodes;multiobjective optimization;energy cost;coverage;connectivity;data acquisition;pareto optimality;evolutionary computing	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become increasingly appealing in recent years for the purpose of data acquisition, surveillance, event monitoring, etc. Optimal positioning of wireless sensor nodes is an important issue for small networks of relatively expensive sensing devices. For such networks, the placement problem requires that multiple objectives be met. These objectives are usually conflicting, e.g. achieving maximum coverage and maximum connectivity while minimizing the network energy cost. A flexible algorithm for sensor placement (FLEX) is presented that uses an evolutionary computational approach to solve this multiobjective sensor placement optimization problem when the number of sensor nodes is not fixed and the maximum number of nodes is not known a priori. FLEX starts with an initial population of simple WSNs and complexifies their topologies over generations. It keeps track of new genes through historical markings, which are used in later generations to assess two networks' compatibility and also to align genes during crossover. It uses Pareto-dominance to approach Pareto-optimal layouts with respect to the objectives. Speciation is employed to aid the survival of gene innovations and facilitate networks to compete with similar networks. Elitism ensures that the best solutions are carried over to the next generation. The flexibility of the algorithm is illustrated by solving the device/node placement problem for different applications like facility surveillance, coverage with and without obstacles, preferential surveillance, and forming a clustering hierarchy.	pareto efficiency	Shafaq Chaudhry;Victor C.

851f99571e70bd97b5c4296bc223647c32434f92	an indoor precise positioning algorithm using 60ghz millimeter-wave based on the optimal path search		Millimeter-wave (mmWave) is a key technology in 5G, and the unlicensed spectrum of 60 GHz band makes many data-intensive applications viable. There is a need for more accurate localization technique of target device in the wireless networks. The paper proposes a precise 60GHz pulse indoor positioning algorithm based on the optimal path search. The algorithm uses the layered strategy of the optimal path and selects the best node for each layer to constitute the optimal path by using the Dice coefficient matching criteria. The corresponding position of the bottom layer's leaf node in the optimal path is the positioning result of the target node (TN). What's more, in the algorithm, the positioning is operated repeatedly and the leaf node with the highest probability is selected as the positioning result ultimately. The theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm increases the indoor positioning accuracy in Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) environment and centimeter level positioning accuracy can be reached.	algorithm;data-intensive computing;simulation;sørensen–dice coefficient;time of arrival;tree (data structure);twisted nematic field effect	Xueyan Han;Jingjing Wang;Wei Shi;Qiuna Niu;Jianfeng Wang	2017	2017 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2017.8269057	sight;wireless network;spectrum management;centimeter;computer network;tree (data structure);extremely high frequency;non-line-of-sight propagation;algorithm;computer science;pulse (signal processing)	Mobile	20.175214490068104	76.7952103910542	96266

Being in the """"sleep"""" state entails minimal power consumption by a wireless device but it also increases the average packet delay that the device encounters. This paper proposes a simple, centralized, dynamic, scalable and adaptive algorithm to optimize the duration of sleep states of wireless nodes operating in the infrastructure mode in a WLAN, with the objective of minimizing their power consumption with respect to a QoS constraint namely average packet delay. The algorithm dynamically adjusts the sleep duration of a node to its average packet arrival rate and its average packet delay constraint. The performance of this algorithm is compared with a common power saving protocol implemented in WLANs like 802.11, namely, a static sleep mechanism where the sleep duration of a devise is set to be equal to the average delay constraint of the devise. Simulation results prove the power efficiency of the adaptive sleep algorithm over the static sleep scheme especially for non uniform traffic."""	av-test;adaptive algorithm;centralized computing;network packet;performance per watt;power management;queueing theory;rendering (computer graphics);scalability;sed;simulation	Mahasweta Sarkar;Rene L.

We model the nodes as Poisson Point Processes and calculate the spatial average of the delay over all potential geometrical patterns of the nodes. More specifically, first, under a simple automatic repeat request (ARQ) retransmission protocol, we derive the average end-to-end delay and show that the average delay scales super exponentially with the increase of routing distance. Then we apply the maximal ratio combining (MRC) technique in ARQ, and derive an upper bound of the average end-to-end delay. We show that a linear scaling law of the delay with respect to the routing distance can be obtained with the help of MRC. Our analysis is demonstrated through simulation examples.	ab initio quantum chemistry methods;automatic repeat request;cns;end-to-end principle;hop;image scaling;maximal set;randomness;relay;retransmission (data networks);routing;simulation;software deployment	Yuan Liang;Yu Zheng;Jian Ren;Tongtong Li	2018	2018 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2018.8390384	wireless network;hop (networking);stochastic geometry;automatic repeat request;point process;retransmission;computer network;end-to-end delay;mathematics;poisson distribution	Mobile	14.02266084698373	88.51184243816418	96343

Hou was with the Department of Computer Illinois at Urbana-Champaign at the time of this work We investigate the problem of maximizing Medium Access Control (MAC) throughput in Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) wireless networks. By explicitly incorporating the carrier sense threshold and the transmit power into our analysis, we derive an analytical relation between MAC throughput and system parameters. In homogeneous networks, we derive the optimal carrier sense range at a given node density as a function of the ratio between the transmit power and the carrier sense threshold. The obtained optimal carrier sense range is smaller than that for covering the entire interference range, which is in sharp contrast to what has been considered to be optimal in previous studies. Only when the node density goes to infinity, the optimal carrier sense range converges to that for exactly covering the interference range, thereby eliminating all the hidden nodes. For nonhomogeneous networks, any distributed algorithm for tuning the carrier sense threshold, in which each node tries to maximize its own throughput without coordination, may significantly degrade MAC throughput. In order to properly design a distributed algorithm, each node not only considers its own throughput, but also needs to take account of its adverse impact on others. Our analysis is verified by simulation studies under various network scenarios. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our algorithm is based on the multicost approach and selects the set of nodes that by transmitting implement broadcasting in an optimally energy-efficient way. The energy-related parameters taken into account are the node transmission power and the node residual energy. The algorithm’s complexity however is non-polynomial, and therefore, we propose a relaxation producing a nearoptimal solution in polynomial time. We also consider a distributed information exchange scheme that can be coupled with the proposed algorithms and examine the overhead introduced by this integration. Using simulations we show that the proposed algorithms outperform other solutions in the literature in terms of energy efficiency. Moreover, it is shown that the near-optimal algorithm obtains most of the performance benefits of the optimal algorithm at a smaller computational overhead.	algorithm;computation;information exchange;linear programming relaxation;overhead (computing);polynomial;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;time complexity;transmitter	Christos A.

The scenario contemplates uncoordinated communications using impulse radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB). Transmission power is controlled according to the statistical nature of the multiple access interference (MAI) produced by the nodes in the close vicinity of the communicating nodes. The statistical nature of the MAI is a function of the node population density within the area of coverage of the WSN.

However, a GSM positioning system based on current specifications faces many difficulties to yield accurate position estimate for ground target tracking. Data fusion solutions which integrate two or more types of measurements have been proposed to provide estimation with better accuracy, reliability and coverage. The performance of Mobile Station (MS) positioning has been broadly discussed, but the performance analysis of ground target tracking, i.e., dynamic position estimation, is rare. This paper focuses on the performance analysis for a data fusion approach of integrating two different types of measurements from GSM networks using posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB). The simulation results verify that the data fusion approach greatly improves the estimation accuracy and is more robust to noisy measurements as compared to the approaches using single kind of measurements.	kleene's recursion theorem;positioning system;profiling (computer programming);simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Miao Zhang;Stefan Knedlik;Otmar Loffeld	2009	2009 12th International Conference on Information Fusion		embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering	Robotics	22.652532052710992	74.83728107762867	96917

In particular, the paper identifies many situations in which WiFi is superior to Bluetooth, countering previous reports. The study also identifies a couple of scenarios that are better handled by Bluetooth. The conclusions from this study suggest preferred usage patterns, as well as operative suggestions for researchers and smartphone developers.

However, several significant research challenges remain to be addressed before its widespread deployment, including small-size full-duplex device design, channel modeling and estimation, cross-layer/joint resource management, interference management, security, etc. In this paper, we provide a brief survey on some of the works that have already been done for in-band FDR, and discuss the related research issues and challenges.

The transitional region is large in size and characterized by the existence of links with intermediate reception ratios. Our work leverages previous work on understanding the properties of wireless links in the space and time domains but differs in the sense that we seek opportunities to actively adjust the physical topologies of sensor networks to improve link quality. Based on an existing theoretical model supported by extensive experiments in a variety of environments, we propose an efficient mechanism to identify locations with high reception ratios in the transitional region. The proposed mechanism can be used to effectively construct long, yet high reception ratio links that are 100% longer than the size of the connected region, thereby reducing the number of relay nodes necessary to interconnect sparse sensor networks by 34%. Furthermore, this mechanism can help better position mobile sinks and guide the communication protocols for mobile sensor networks. Overall, this paper provides fresh insights into the implications of the log-normal path loss model on deploying and moving sensor motes.	experiment;relay;sparse matrix;theory	Yin Chen;Andreas Terzis	2011		10.1145/2070942.2070946	embedded system;communications protocol;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;time domain;computer science;path loss;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	11.523788614763621	81.99131006540563	97429

Since the data gathering process usually proceeds for many rounds, it is important to collect these data efficiently, that is, to reduce the energy cost of data transmission. Under such applications, a tree is usually adopted as the routing structure to save the computation costs for maintaining the routing tables of sensors. In this paper, we work on the problem of constructing a data aggregation tree that minimizes the total energy cost of data transmission in a wireless sensor network.

7d9bc41b57dd6ff9ce2786022a904cffc5902e37	fundamental tradeoffs in communication and trajectory design for uav-enabled wireless network		The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial communication platforms is of high practical value for future wireless systems such as 5G, especially for swift and on-demand deployment in temporary events and emergency situations. Compared to traditional terrestrial base stations (BSs) in cellular network, UAV-mounted aerial BSs possess stronger line-of-sight (LoS) links with the ground users due to their high altitude as well as high and flexible mobility in three-dimensional (3D) space, which can be exploited to enhance the communication performance. On the other hand, unlike terrestrial BSs that have reliable power supply, aerial BSs in practice have limited on-board energy, but require significant propulsion energy to stay airborne and support high mobility. Motivated by the above new considerations, this article aims to revisit some fundamental tradeoffs in UAV-enabled communication and trajectory design. Specifically, it is shown that communication throughput, delay, and (propulsion) energy consumption can be traded off among each other by adopting different UAV trajectory designs, which sheds new light on their traditional tradeoffs in terrestrial communication.

Nodes of a GRN are deployed in the Euclidean plane (R) and each of them can transmit within some range r assigned to it. We adopt model in which ranges of nodes are nonuniform and they are drawn from the predefined interval 0 ≤ rmin ≤ rmax. All our results are in the conflict-embodied model where a receiving node must be in the range of exactly one transmitting node in order to receive the message. We derive several lower and upper bounds on the time of deterministic broadcasting in GRNs in terms of the number of nodes n, a distribution of nodes ranges, and the eccentricity D of the source node (i.e., the maximum length of a shortest directed path from the source node to another node in the network).

Each sensor makes a binary decision based on its own measurement, and the local decision of each sensor is sent to a fusion center using a random access protocol. The fusion center decides whether the event has occurred under a global size constraint in the Neyman-Pearson formulation. Assuming homogeneous Poisson distributed sensors, we show that the distribution of """"alarmed"""" sensors satisfies the local asymptotic normality (LAN). We then derive an asymptotically locally most powerful (ALMP) detector optimized jointly over the fusion form and the local sensor threshold under the Poisson regime. We establish conditions on the spatial signal shape that ensure the existence of the ALMP detector. We show that the ALMP test statistic is a weighted sum of local decisions, the optimal weights being the shape of the spatial signal; the exact value of the signal strength is not required. We also derive the optimal threshold for each sensor. For the case of independent, identically distributed (iid) sensor observations, we show that the counting-based detector is also ALMP under the Poisson regime. The performance of the proposed detector is evaluated through analytic results and Monte Carlo simulations and compared with that of the counting-based detector.

The basic operation in sensor networks is the systematic gathering and transmission of sensed data to a sink for further processing. The lifetime of the network is defined as the time until the first node depletes its energy. A key challenge in data gathering without aggregation is to conserve the energy consumption among nodes so as to maximize the network lifetime. We formalize the problem of tackling the challenge as to construct a min-max-weight spanning tree, in which the bottleneck nodes have the least number of descendants according to their energy. However, the problem is NP-complete. A O(\log n/\log\log n)-approximation algorithm MITT is proposed to solve the problem without location information. Simulation results show that MITT can achieve longer network lifetime than existing algorithms.	algorithm;file spanning;maxima and minima;np-completeness;sensor web;simulation;spanning tree	Junbin Liang;Jianxing Wang;Jiannong Cao;Jianer Chen;Mingming Lu	2010	2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462181	wireless sensor network;information science;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	11.53594577791406	79.79266543106927	98049

For each metric, we identify and study topology factors and architectural features which strongly influence mesh performance via an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations capturing realistic physical layer behavior. Our findings include: (i) A random topology is unsuitable for a large-scale mesh deployment due to doubled node density requirements, yet a moderate level of perturbations from ideal grid placement has a minor impact on performance. (ii) Multiple backhaul radios per mesh node is a cost-effective deployment strategy as it leads to mesh deployments costing 50% less than with a single-radio architecture, (iii) Dividing access and backhaul connections onto two separate radios does not use the second radio efficiently as it only improves fair mesh capacity 40% to 80% for most users. This is in contrast to using the second radio to move half the user population to a new network operated on the second radio. This work adds to the understanding of mesh deployment factors and their general impact on performance, providing further insight into practical mesh deployments.	backhaul (telecommunications);marginal model;mesh networking;monte carlo method;multitier architecture;network planning and design;randomness;regular grid;requirement;simulation;software deployment;square tiling;wireless mesh network	Joshua Robinson;Edward W.

Since wireless sensor nodes typically have limited energy and power, power efficiency is a main concern in designing protocols for wireless sensor networks. Data aggregation is one of the strategies that can reduce the power consumption in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a cross layer algorithm with data aggregation to minimize the power consumption. Most importantly, our proposed algorithm is distributed and therefore, it is suitable for wireless sensor networks. From numerical results, we conclude that not all data packets should be aggregated before they arrive the destination nodes.	algorithm;data aggregation;network packet;numerical analysis;performance per watt;routing;scheduling (computing);throughput	Chun-Chia Chen;Ness B.

3acca32d50619e40f1af3d5e99e0c254f0ba0e5d	navigation with cellular cdma signals—part ii: performance analysis and experimental results		A framework for navigation using cellular code division multiple access (CDMA) signals is studied in this paper. Theoretical lower bounds on the navigation performance using pseudorange measurements drawn from the cellular CDMA base transceiver stations (BTSs) are derived. Moreover, the navigation performance for a mapper/navigator framework is studied in the presence of timing discrepancies between the mapper and navigator. In this framework, a mapping receiver (mapper) estimates the stochastic dynamic clock biases of the BTSs and shares these estimates with a navigating receiver (navigator). The optimal navigation performance of the mapper/navigator framework in the presence of timing discrepancies is analyzed, and a practical upper bound on the resulting position error is derived. Experimental results for a ground vehicle and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are presented. The ground vehicle results show a mean distance difference of 5.51 m between the cellular CDMA-only navigation solution and a GPS navigation solution in the absence of clock bias discrepancies. The UAV results show an improvement of 10.57 m in the root-mean-square error of the cellular CDMA navigation solution, when the sector clock bias discrepancies are accounted for utilizing the statistical model relating observed clock biases from different sectors of the same BTS cell.	aerial photography;broadcast television systems inc.;gps navigation device;global positioning system;profiling (computer programming);pseudorange;statistical model;transceiver;unmanned aerial vehicle	Joe Khalife;Zaher Zak M.

In particular, the two-step multi-polling (TSMP) scheme utilizes the acquired buffer status and channel condition to derive exact required time of each wireless station. Consequently, it seems to be easy to incorporate an energy saving schedule to prolong the operating time of the portable devices. However, even though it adopted the concept of rate adaptation, the TSMP scheme did not take into account frame retransmissions caused by transmission errors due to, say, fading of the wireless channel. The uncertain time spent on retransmission of former stations in the schedule may introduce energy-consuming overhearing for later ones. In this paper, we propose wake-up time schedules and an adaptive updating algorithm to save more energy for the later stations under the error-prone wireless environment. The proposed scheme is simple and thus quite feasible. Besides, from extensive simulation results, we found that the proposed solution is effective.	algorithm;cognitive dimensions of notations;mobile device;overhead (computing);retransmission (data networks);simulation;uptime	Jing-Rong Hsieh;Tsern-Huei Lee	2008	VTC Spring 2008 - IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2008.475	communications protocol;throughput;tsmp;real-time computing;energy;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;scheduling;saving;fading;computer network;energy management	Embedded	11.966709082631045	83.65063704070333	98318

It improves over past work by optimizing the transmitted power control, the back-off delay and minimum back-off exponential, depending on the sensed channel conditions. Retransmission is faster when the channel is good, and slower when it is either noisy or overloaded. The algorithm has been first modeled using Mathworks StateFlow, and functionally debugged at a high level of abstraction using the Mathworks simulation environment. Then we used automated code generation techniques to download an executable onto a power-aware simulator of a ZigBee-compatible node platform, and we analyzed separately the impact of each improvement we made over past work. We also compare the simulation results with the prediction of an abstract model of the PE-MAC algorithm, created using Markov chains.	algorithm;automatic programming;backoff;byte;code generation (compiler);debugging;download;executable;function overloading;high-level programming language;joule;markov chain;mathematical optimization;performance;random-access memory;read-only memory;retransmission (data networks);sensor;simulation;stateflow;throughput;time complexity	Anwar Al-Khateeb;Luciano Lavagno	2010	2010 7th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP 2010)		markov chain;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;model-based design;statistics;computer network	Arch	12.286064593295155	86.04908468353284	98328
d90daa252d6d48f12b4dad81f8f1e7c956ea17d2	a localization based cooperative routing protocol for underwater wireless sensor networks		Localization is one of the major aspects in underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). Therefore, it is important to know the accurate position of the sensor node in large scale applications like disaster prevention, tactical surveillance, and monitoring. Due to the inefficiency of the global positioning system (GPS) in UWSN, it is very difficult to localize a node in underwater environment compared to terrestrial networks. To minimize the localization error and enhance the localization coverage of the network, two routing protocols are proposed; the first one is mobile autonomous underwater vehicle (MobiL-AUV) and the second one is cooperative MobiL (CO-MobiL). In MobiL-AUV, AUVs are deployed and equipped with GPS and act as reference nodes. These reference nodes are used to localize all the nonlocalized ordinary sensor nodes in order to reduce the localization error and maximize the network coverage. CO-MobiL is presented in order to improve the network throughput by using the maximal ratio combining (MRC) as diversity technique which combines both signals, received from the source and received from the relay at the destination. It uses amplify-and-forward (AF) mechanism to improve the signal between the source and the destination. To support our claims, extensive simulations are performed.	ace;anisotropic filtering;autonomous robot;global positioning system;internationalization and localization;maximal set;relay;routing;sensor node;simulation;speedpass;terrestrial television;throughput	Nadeem Javaid;Hammad Maqsood;Wadood Abdul;Iftikhar Azim Niaz;Ahmad Almogren;Atif Alamri;Manzoor Ilahi	2017	Mobile Information Systems	10.1155/2017/7954175	telecommunications;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	18.922009223395595	77.13950737843308	98370

This paper presents two approaches to WLAN design that allows the designer to describe where the WLAN is to be deployed and define the design requirements based on signal coverage and usage. Both methods automatically optimise and suggest a WLAN design that satisfies the user requirements.

fd25a4d28b2a894571d7fd9f353d2f73d94d8a00	unmanned aerial vehicles in wireless sensor networks: automated sensor deployment and mobile sink nodes		This paper describes the design and implementation of a heterogeneous multi-agent system consisting of a wireless sensor network and a mobile agent (UAV) for automatic network deployment and data collection beyond the communication range of individual sensors in the network. A UAV is able to transport and release sensors at specific locations that might be dangerous or inaccessible to humans. The network can be deployed fast when manual placement is a risk. The measured data is likewise automatically collected by a UAV following an optimal route obtained by solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) that covers all sensor locations. Since the route of the UAV is pre-planned, sensor nodes are able to turn on the radio interface exactly when the UAV is close by and thus save energy. More precisely, the power consumption of the sensor node is improved in two ways: (i) multihop routing is not required, which saves battery life in sensors, and (ii) the transmission power can be reduced because the UAV is able to go near the sensor. The whole system was tested in an outdoor experiment showing promising results.

Firstly, we present results from graph-theory which can be used to understand the fundamental properties of ad-hoc networks and wireless sensor networks. Graph-theory is a well studied branch of discrete mathematics, and it has been applied in many knowledge fields, e.g. social network, Internet tomography and epidemiology. We review literature results from the point of view of the designer of an ad-hoc network, who must set simulation parameters in order to predict the behaviour of the real network. Secondly, we study the impact of the asymmetries of radio links on the connectivity properties of an ad-hoc network. To the best knowledge of the author, this further hypothesys has been addressed in the case of geometric random graph only, but not for radio models with randomnesses. As expected, we found that randomness in the radio model directly affects the distribution of the asymmetries and the connectivity properties. This result can be very useful in the understanding of more complicated aspects of ad-hoc nets, like routing and coordinated wake-up in power saving techniques.	graph theory;hoc (programming language)	Giuseppe De Marco;Leonard Barolli	2007	J.

The number of vehicles equipped with GPS devices continues to grow, but the accuracy of GPS devices are not always satisfactory. This paper looks at ways of using VANETs to improve the accuracy of the location estimates provided by GPS devices. The algorithm Location Improvement with Cluster Analysis (LICA) presented in this paper achieves this and can also be implemented in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) where some, if not all, nodes are equipped with GPS devices. Each node measures the distance to their neighbouring nodes. The combination of distance and the other nodes' estimated positions is used to calculate a position for a node. The initial estimated position and measured distances are all assumed to be inaccurate. It is shown that LICA can improve the accuracy of location estimates with certain levels of noise and corrupt data present in the system.	algorithm;cluster analysis;global positioning system	Farhan Ahammed;Javid Taheri;Albert Y.

Due to the large computational requirements necessary for simulating wireless sensor networks with high fidelity, many wireless sensor network simulators, especially the cycle accurate ones, employ distributed simulation techniques to leverage the combined resources of multiple processors or computers. However, the large overheads in synchronizing sensor nodes during distributed simulations of sensor networks result in a significant increase in simulation time. In this paper, we present a novel technique that could significantly reduce such overheads by minimizing the number of sensor node synchronizations during simulations. We implement this technique in Avrora, a widely used parallel sensor network simulator, and achieve a speedup of up to 11 times in terms of average simulation speed in our test cases. For applications that have lower duty cycles, the speedups are even greater since the performance gains are proportional to the sleep times of the sensor nodes.	branching (version control);central processing unit;computer;experiment;mathematical optimization;requirement;scalability;sensor node;simulation;speedup;test case;tinyos;transmitter	Zhong-Yi Jin;Rajesh Gupta	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-69170-9_14	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;sensor node;soft sensor;computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	11.25733965113732	83.17326822556298	99062

Thus, in the second state a node can only relay traffic among its neighbours without generating its own data. We define the reliability of a WSN as the probability that the sink node can collect data from a number of nodes whose total weight exceeds a specified threshold limit, given that each node can be in any one of the three possible states with a given probability. Existing results in the literature show that a restricted 2-state version of the problem is #P-hard even when the network is a rectangular grid. Nevertheless, for a rectangular WxL grid on n nodes where the sink node lies in one of the corners, the restricted 2-state reliability problem can be solved in O(nL2^W) time. Thus, the algorithm runs in polynomial time for any fixed W. Our work here derives an exact algorithm for the generalized 3-state reliability model on a generalized class of grids, called diagonalized grids, while maintaining the same O(nL2^W) running time. We obtain numerical results that illustrate the use of the devised algorithm as a WSN topological design tool.	aggregate data;best, worst and average case;complex network;design tool;exact algorithm;network planning and design;numerical analysis;p (complexity);regular grid;relay;sharp-p-complete;three-state logic;time complexity	Mohamed H.

The latter are properly chosen following a new reliable anchor selection strategy that ensures an accurate distance estimation making thereby our localization algorithm more precise. Indeed, simulations suggest that it outperforms the best representative range- free localization algorithms currently available in the literature in terms of accuracy.	algorithm;sensor;simulation	Ahmad El Assaf;Slim Zaidi;Sofiène Affes;Nahi Kandil	2014	2014 IEEE 80th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2014-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2014.6966149	wireless ad hoc network;stochastic geometry models of wireless networks;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Embedded	16.374599462602887	75.2181411388965	99105
248d09b6d9ab3374c42ae05cd1f6c959adcc7bdc	estimation of relative offset and drift between local clocks in wireless sensor networks		In wireless sensor networks, each wireless sensor node records events occurred in its observation area with their observation time. Each wireless sensor node possesses its own local clock whose drift and offset are generally different from the others. In addition, it is difficult for the wireless sensor nodes to adjust drifts and offsets of their local clocks since transmission delay of messages between neighbor wireless sensor nodes are difficult to estimate due to CSMA/CA and RTS/CTS control for collision avoidance. Thus, it is difficult to achieve orders and intervals among events observed by different wireless sensor nodes. Moreover, even if multiple wireless sensor nodes observe the same event, their recorded observation times might be different and two observation records for the same event by multiple wireless sensor nodes are not always recognized as the records for the same event. Based on an assumption that obser- vation areas of neighbor wireless sensor nodes are overlapped, by using observation records of the commonly observed events by neighbor wireless sensor nodes, this paper proposes a novel method to estimate the relative drift and offset between local clocks of the neighbor wireless sensor nodes. Here, each sensor node only detects the occurrences of events and cannot achieve the locations where the events occur. Hence, commonly observed events between neighbor wireless sensor nodes are required to be detected. Our proposed method applies a heuristic that multiple observation records in neighbor wireless sensor nodes whose intervals are the same are estimated to be commonly observed events.	algorithm;carpal tunnel syndrome;clock synchronization;heuristic;rs-232;sensor node;sensor web	Ayako Arao;Hiroaki Higaki	2017	2017 Global Wireless Summit (GWS)	10.1109/FGCT.2017.8103722	collision;wireless sensor network;computer network;wireless;transmission delay;offset (computer science);sensor node;computer science;electronic engineering;wireless ad hoc network	Mobile	10.234450947822884	83.43793601941194	99285
73311ab86b5a286c2ae4432e25f91e8a014a1c5a	low-complexity, distributed characterization of interferers in wireless networks		We consider a large-scale wireless network that uses sensors along its edge to estimate the characteristics of interference from neighboring networks or devices. Each sensor makes a noisy measurement of the received signal strength (RSS) from an interferer, compares its measurement to a threshold, and then transmits the resulting bit to a cluster head (CH) over a noisy communication channel. The CH computes the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the distance to the interferer using these noise-corrupted bits. We propose and justify a low-complexity threshold design technique in which the sensors#R##N#use nonidentical thresholds to generate their bits. This produces a dithering effect that provides better performance than previous techniques that use different non-identical thresholds or the case in which all the sensor motes use an identical non-optimal threshold. Our proposed technique is also shown (a) to be of low complexity compared to previous non-identical threshold approaches and (b) to provide performance that is very close to that obtained when all sensors use the identical, but unknown, optimal threshold. We derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) and also show that the MLE using our dithered thresholds is asymptotically both efficient and consistent. Simulations are used to verify these theoretical results.		Vibhav Kapnadak;Murat Senel;Edward J.

e0059fd2efdb01ec90599a4829c668320b871a1e	reducing recovery error in compressive sensing with limited number of base stations		We aim to decrease a communication cost of a network that uses compressive sensing, a technique that allows us to recover global information of sparse data by using only a small set of samples. Despite efficiency of the technique, collecting information from all samples is usually costly. Because the samples from previous works usually spread around the network, setting up a number of base stations does not help reducing the cost. In this paper, we propose a method that can utilize the base stations, while aiming to minimize the recovery error of compressive sensing. Based on theorem by Xu et al., which is for cost-aware compressive sensing, we derive a mathematical program that aims to maximize the preciseness in the setting. Then, we approximate the program by a convex quadratic program and prove that the approximation ratio is 0.63. Our simulation results show that, by using the coverage, the sampling error is decreased by at most thirty times.	approximation algorithm;compressed sensing;computation;greedy algorithm;heuristic;quadratic programming;sampling (signal processing);simulation;sparse matrix;time complexity	Prompong Pakawanwong;Vorapong Suppakitpaisarn;Liwen Xu;Naonori Kakimura	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8253930	wireless sensor network;sampling error;real-time computing;compressed sensing;quadratic programming;approximation algorithm;sparse matrix;computer science;base station	Mobile	13.44226659348096	79.35013686441734	99490

In this paper, we investigate an alternative communication-theoretic approach for determining the minimum transmit power required for achieving connectivity. Our results show that, if there is significant multipath fading and/or multiple access interference in the network, then graph-theoretic approaches can substantially underestimate the minimum transmit power required for connectivity. This is due to the fact that graph-theoretic approaches do not take the route quality into consideration. Therefore, while in scenarios with line-of-sight (LOS) communications a graph-theoretic approach could be adequate for determining the minimum transmit power required for connectivity, in scenarios with strong multipath fading and/or multiple access interference a communication-theoretic approach could yield much more accurate results and, therefore, be preferable.	a mathematical theory of communication;graph theory;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);multipath propagation	Sooksan Panichpapiboon;Gianluigi Ferrari;Ozan K.

It has been understood, that the extreme energy demands can only be met by optimizing all layers and even more important, across all layers. In this paper we do thorough analysis of the impact of physical layer parameters, namely detection, modulation and channel on the energy consumption of a node.

This increasing demand for data in next-generation mobile broadband networks will lead to many challenges for system engineers and service providers. To address these issues and meet the stringent demands in coming years, innovative and practical solutions should be identified that are able to provide higher spectral efficiency, better performance, and broader coverage. Next generations of wireless cellular networks, which are known as fifth generation (5G) or beyond fourth generation (B4G) wireless networks, are expected to produce higher data rates for mobile subscribers in the order of tens of gigabits per second (Gbit/s) and support a wide range of services. Despite the absence of official standards for the 5G, the data rate of 1 Gbit/s per user anywhere for 5G mobile networks is expected to be deployed beyond 2020.	beamforming;fifth generation computer;gigabit;spectral efficiency	S.

Multitude of Internet connected devices and things in combination with the cloud based data analytics and knowledge based technologies are major components for the future IoT concept. This results in big data demands that need to be transmitted in over mobile network and requires new intelligent approaches to the network design. In this paper, a new deterministic approach for analysis of multi-tier heterogeneous network is proposed based on the fractal geometry. Proposed solution is well tractable and suitable for every possible topology of heterogeneous network, providing exact information about network capacity and co-channel interference. Two fractal models were developed based on triangular and rectangular pattern and basic geometric equations were derived for multi-tier network topology. Frequency reuse problem was addressed based on the proposed fractal model for cellular and wireless backhaul spectrum and optimal tradeoff between cellular and backhaul capacity was found. Performance simulations show that proposed fractal modeling provides more accurate network analysis in terms of capacity and interference influence in multi-tier heterogeneous networks.	fractal;multitier architecture	Taras Maksymyuk;Mykola Brych;Ihor Strykhalyuk;Minho Jo	2015	Smart CR	10.6029/smartcr.2015.04.011	simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;computer network	ML	21.493929456668077	86.33762627784014	100406

Compared with conventional network infrastructures, WMIs have the low cost and flexible network deployment. The applications of WMI include smart cities, emergency responses and Internet of things. In emergency situations, WMI networks may have energy constraint. Furthermore, user mobility may be restricted to a limited area. In this paper, we study the network sustainability performance in WMI networks that have energy constraint and limited scope of user mobility. The sustainability of the WMI depends on network energy, connectivity, as well as user distributions. The collective sharing of network tasks among infrastructure nodes highly affects the network sustainability. However, few studies to date addressed the sustainability performance of network with the decreasing of both node energy and network connectivity. This paper specially examines the impact of decreasing energy and connectivity depletion in WMIs that have biased scope of user mobility. Performance evaluation is conducted based on packetlevel simulations. The evaluation show spatio-temporal features of energy-and-connectivity in WMI networks. With the investigation of various routing metrics, evaluation results show that energyaware metric leads to the collective sharing of packet forwarding with 16-30 percent improvement at the BSs out of the user mobility scope. The results also show that limited scope of user mobility leads to a decrease of network lifetime.	airtime;depletion region;internet of things;network packet;performance evaluation;routing;simulation;smart city;software deployment	Rui Teng;Huan-Bang Li;Ryu Miura	2015	2015 9th International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies	10.1109/NGMAST.2015.58	routing;the internet;wireless wan;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;spread spectrum;computer security;wireless;computer network	Mobile	10.57237850242361	86.41297495550187	100598

The goal is to have mobile autonomous robots navigate from any point within the WSN-covered region to an identified target through interaction with the WSN. Reaching the target is achieved in two ways, by: (i) producing gradients in the WSN region that give the maximum peak closest to the target, (ii) having the sensors guide the robot to the target efficiently. This scheme uses the topology of the network to create a navigation path. The robot follows the pseudo-gradient in the WSN to reach the global maximum. In this method, there is no global coordinate reference available for the region i.e., the WSN and robots only make use of the relative neighborhood information to attain their goal. The performance of the scheme is analyzed in simulation using a variety of node-densities.	algorithm;autonomous robot;experiment;global positioning system;gradient;maxima and minima;mobile robot;network convergence;robotic mapping;sensor;simulation;technological convergence	Nikhil Deshpande;Edward Grant;Thomas C.

This paper refers to mobile phone based acoustic localization technique for wireless sensor networks, which can be used along with physical topology map or logical topology map. In our proposed method, deployer searches the sensor node by using Doppler effect of acoustic wave, which is generated by his mobility. The proposed method helps in quick localizing of the sensor nodes without consuming much time and it has been implemented, tested by using mobile phone and IITH motes, the in-house developed sensor nodes.	acoustic cryptanalysis;doppler effect;internationalization and localization;logical topology;map;mobile app;mobile phone;network topology;sensor node	M.

However, the limited communication capabilities of these sensors, which are placed underground, and their limited number, due to their high cost, pose significant challenges in the deployment and the reliable monitoring. This paper presents a preliminary study concerning the problem of the static optimal sensor placement of a wireless biosensor network in a water distribution network for real-time detection of bacterial contamination. An optimal sensor placement strategy is proposed, which maximizes the probability of detection considering a limited number of sensors while ensuring a connected communication topology. A lightweight algorithm that solves the optimal placement problem is developed. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through simulations, considering different network topologies using a water pipelines emulator. The results indicate that the proposed optimization outperforms more traditional approaches in terms of detection probability. It is concluded that the availability of a dynamic model of the bacterial propagation along with a spatio-temporal correlation of the process could lead to a more advanced real-time control of the water distribution networks.	algorithm;british informatics olympiad;emulator;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;network topology;pipeline (computing);real-time clock;real-time locating system;sensor;simulation;software deployment;software propagation	Antonio Bertoldi;George Athanasiou;Carlo Fischione	2014	2014 6th International Symposium on Communications, Control and Signal Processing (ISCCSP)	10.1109/ISCCSP.2014.6877861	control engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Embedded	11.544572990925872	76.44191051460798	101967

Energy is the scarcest resource in WBANs. Power control mechanisms to achieve a certain level of utility while using as little power for transmission as possible can play an important role in reducing energy consumption in such very energy-constrained networks. In this paper, we propose a novel power controller to mitigate internetwork interference in WBANs and increase the maximum achievable throughput with the minimum energy consumption. The proposed power controller employs reinforcement learning with approximation to learn from the environment and improve its performance. We compare the performance of the proposed controller to two other power controllers, one based on game theory and the other one based on fuzzy logic. Simulation results show that compared to the other two approaches, RLPC provides a substantial saving in energy consumption per bit, with a substantial increase in network lifetime.	a* search algorithm;approximation;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;game theory;genetic fuzzy systems;interference (communication);internetworking;reinforcement learning;sensor;simulation;star network;testbed;throughput;time complexity;transceiver;utility	Ramtin Kazemi Beidokhti;Rein Vesilo;Eryk Dutkiewicz;Ren Ping Liu	2011	2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6139908	game theory;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;reinforcement learning;computer network	Mobile	14.317559742652714	82.64385385116634	102305

Nowadays, many experts and scholars in this field are focusing on the relationship between channel modeling and system performances of mmWave cellular networks. In this paper, we first present a brief review on the state-of-the-art mmWave cellular networks. Then, after summarizing the elements of mmWave channel modeling and methods of system performance analysis, we suggest a mapping mechanism between the physical layer and the mmWave propagation environment. The mapping is a function, whose inputs are the propagation environment parameters and the outputs are the key performance metrics of mmWave cellular networks, such as the signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR), data rate, etc. By utilizing the proposed mapping method, we are able to extract the key system design parameters, which are closely connected to the underlay propagation environment. Furthermore, parameterized by the mapping method, we can optimize the network layout (e.g., reposition base stations) to improve the quality of experience (QoE) of users. Finally, thanks to the open structure of the proposed mapping method, we plan to further apply the mechanism to enable multi-layer (e.g., data link layer and network layer) or cross-layer optimization in the future research.	interference (communication);key;layer (electronics);mathematical optimization;performance;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;systems design;uncompressed video	Bohan Li;Hui Gao;Xiaojun Jing	2016	2016 16th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751723	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	22.22300056399195	85.3941312735458	102492

But there are other metrics that are of significance, namely the latency of the network and the quality of the overall information sensed by the network. In this paper, we have show three ways to measure the quality of information obtained in a sensor network. Our first method an information loss metric that we have formulated is a statistical method to estimate the quality of information. Our second metric, the entropy ratio metric based on Shannon's information theory gives us a ratio that indicates the quality of information obtained. Our third method is based on variance. This deterministic method essentially calculates the mean square error between the true and the estimated signal over all the nodes. This simple method provides an effective way to measure the amount of information lost.	cluster analysis;information theory;mean squared error;shannon (unit)	Pubali Banerjee	2007			computer network	Mobile	15.860122002433096	78.97516854165728	102512

In contrast to most work on cooperative diversity relaying where the relay node positions or average channel characteristics are given as parameters, we formulate the problem recognizing that node positions, as well as channel fading states of the channels among the nodes, are random. We propose a simple protocol which requires minimal a priori knowledge of node positions and channel fading states. Our protocol assumes that each node in the vicinity of the source knows its average link gain to the destination. The source transmits a packet, and then chooses relays from the nodes that received the packet correctly. We also assume that the maximum number of relays that can be used for each packet is limited by M, which represents bandwidth and delay constraints. Assuming that the relay nodes are distributed according to 2-dimensional Poisson point process, we analytically study the performance of the protocol as a function of node density, fading parameters and node transmit powers. We consider both maximal ratio combining and selection combining at the destination.	channel state information;communications protocol;downtime;maximal set;network packet;numerical analysis;numerical integration;point process;relay;simulation	Furuzan Atay Onat;Dan Avidor;Sayandev Mukherjee	2007	2007 4th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks	10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292869	ring network;exposed node problem;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;statistics;computer network	Mobile	15.23454365573456	88.50934753062805	102555

We consider the following question: what is the maximum achievable data rate that such a network can support for communication from an arbitrary radio node to its destination under transmission power and network-topology constraints, as the network size goes to infinity? In other words, we study the data-rate guarantee for an arbitrarily chosen source-destination pair assuming all other nodes act as relays. We consider two types of network deployments: 1)a regular deployment with unreliable nodes; and 2)a random deployment. We provide upper and lower bounds on the asymptotic achievable data rate for both linear and planar topologies under the two deployment models.	asymptote;binary logarithm;coherence (physics);data rate units;downstream (software development);existential quantification;image scaling;information theory;interference (communication);lieb-robinson bounds;like button;maxima and minima;network topology;randomness;relay;relay channel;routing;scalability;social inequality;software deployment;uncompressed video;with high probability	Xin Liu;R.

12b89ae3ee68772bd02cd0c87dad9102819b5e1c	artificial bee colony algorithm for probabilistic target q-coverage in wireless sensor networks		The lifetime of a wireless sensor network is dependent on the type of sensor deployment. If the application permits deterministic deployment of nodes and if the sensor nodes are limited, quality of sensing and energy conservation can be enhanced by restricting the sensing range requirement. This paper addresses deterministic deployment of nodes for probabilistic target Q-coverage. A probabilistic coverage model considers the effect of distance and medium on the sensing ability of a node. We use Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm to compute the optimal deployment of sensor nodes such that the required sensing range is minimum for probabilistic target Q-coverage.	artificial bee colony algorithm;sensor web;software deployment	S.

We employ a two-antenna anchor that can emit two linear chirp waves simultaneously, and propose to estimate the angle of departure (AOD) of the emitted waves at each receiving node via frequency measurement of the local received signal strength indication (RSSI) signal. An improved estimation method is further proposed where multiple parallel arrays are adopted to provide the space diversity. The proposed methods rely only on radio transceivers and do not require frequency synchronization or precise time synchronization between the transceivers. More importantly, the angle is estimated at each sensor in a completely distributed manner. The performance analysis is derived and simulations are presented to corroborate the proposed studies.	chirp;interference (communication);multipath propagation;parallel computing;profiling (computer programming);simulation;software propagation;testbed;transceiver	Weile Zhang;Qinye Yin;Hongyang Chen;Feifei Gao;Nirwan Ansari	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2012.121412.111346	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	21.990487362640323	75.14963842844685	102855

Significant variations in temperature can double the deterioration rate of paper and other canvases. Fluctuating levels of RH cause materials to corrode, shrink, swell, or warp. Monitoring and control of indoor climate conditions is thus crucial in ensuring the preservation of art collections. This study addresses the need for monitoring by designing and implementing a wireless sensor network composed of several specialized sensor nodes dumping temperature and RH readings to a base station computer. Each sensor node is equipped with an ASK transmitter and no ASK receiver. This design allows for lower power consumption and highly simplifies communication between the sensor node and base station. The MAC protocol used for the wireless sensor network is ALOHA without retransmissions. The wireless sensor network is evaluated in terms of cost, range, power consumption and packet error rate.	amplitude-shift keying;bit error rate;network packet;sensor node;sensor web;shrink wrap contract;transmitter	Agnes Meiling C.

In particular, we consider the class of networks in which nodes are distributed according to a doubly stochastic shot-noise Cox process, which allows to model a wide variety of inhomogeneous topologies. For this class of networks, we derive information theoretic upper-bounds to the capacity, identifying six operational regions. We also provide constructive lower bounds by devising, for each region, an optimal communication strategy to achieve the maximum network throughput. The performance of our communication schemes match, in terms of scaling exponent, the theoretical upper-bounds.	flow network;theory	Michele Garetto;Alessandro Nordio;Carla-Fabiana Chiasserini;Emilio Leonardi	2011	IEEE Trans.

f25aa821fbfaaf798994e60fe3af0545ab33fad3	downlink traffic scheduling with contact durations awareness for vehicular infrastructures		The vehicular infrastructures or roadside units (RSUs) in vehicular delay tolerant networks (VDTNs) can be used as the gateways of the distributed sensor networks. The different classes of service (CoS) support are desired when more than one type of the sensed data are collected by the RSUs. In this paper, the CoS support traffic scheduling problem for the RSU in VDTNs is considered. By exploring the contact information between the vehicles and the RSU, the CoS traffic scheduling problem is formulated as a maximum weighted triple matching problem, where the traffic scheduling strategy is a timeslot-vehicle-traffic matched pair. A flow network based method is proposed to optimally solve the maximum weighted triple matching problem. Both the offline version and the online version of the traffic scheduling algorithm are developed. Extensive simulations are conducted and the simulation results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed flow network based algorithms.	telecommunications link	Zhongjiang Yan;Bo Li	2014	IJDSN	10.1155/2014/451372	embedded system;real-time computing;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	15.344364759108272	83.60336140225097	103128

Current decision fusion schemes are based on binary valued decision and do not consider bursty contextcapture. However, bursty context and multi-valued data are important characteristics of WSNs. One on hand, the local decisions from sensors usually have bursty and contextual characteristics. Fusion center must capture the bursty context information from the sensors. On the other hand, in practice, many applications need to process multi-valued data, such as temperature and reflection level used for lightening prediction. To address these challenges, the Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP) and multi-valued logic are introduced into WSNs to perform context-capture multi-valued decision fusion. The overall decision fusion is decomposed into two parts. The first part is the context-capture model for WSNs using superposition MMPP. Through this procedure, the fusion center has a higher probability to get useful local decisions from sensors. The second one is focused on multi-valued decision fusion. Fault detection can also be performed based on MVL. Once the fusion center detects the faulty nodes, all their local decisions are removed from the computation of the likelihood ratios. Finally, we evaluate the capability of context-capture and fault tolerant. The result supports the usefulness of our scheme.	computation;fault tolerance;markov chain;modulation;quantum superposition;sensor;simulation	Jun Wu;Shigeru Shimamoto	2011	CoRR	10.5121/ijwmn.2011.3310	embedded system;fault tolerance;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;likelihood-ratio test;computer cluster;computer science;machine learning;data mining;fault detection and isolation;computer network	Mobile	15.721375677332313	78.44532383847915	103131

In particular, ZigBee networks are susceptible to the interferences from other wireless technologies; For example, strong Wi-Fi signals trigger false alarms to ZigBee device that is performing low power idle listening and cause appreciable energy waste. In this paper, we propose a novel ZigBee signal detection scheme, called CoSense that accurately identifies ZigBee signals in the presence of the cross-technology interferences. CoSense, which is a highly reliable signal correlation technique, enjoys the following three advantages: First, CoSense reduces false wake-ups, which typically consume energy unnecessarily. Secondly, CoSense is robust against heterogeneous interference scenarios because its signal correlation feature has been shown to work well in bad channel conditions. Third, CoSense is backward-compatible and does not require to change the traditional ZigBee networks. We have implemented CoSense on the USRP/GNURadio platform in order to prove its feasibility. The results show that, under typical setting, CoSense indeed reduces the false alarm rate and its overhead is tolerable. We can conclude that CoSense saves energy by up to 63% in heterogeneous network environments where weak ZigBee signals are overwhelmed by strong signals such as Wi-Fi.	backward compatibility;bluetooth;caffeine;detection theory;energy level;experiment;gnu radio;implicit shape model;interference (communication);network packet;overhead (computing);software deployment;universal software radio peripheral;wake (cipher);wake-on-lan	Sangsoon Lim;Daehyun Ban;Woojin Park;Chong-kwon Kim	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7510599	embedded system;neurfon;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;interference;correlation;wireless;computer network	Mobile	18.754643538940222	80.64604902890703	103185

Most existing or proposed MAC protocols enable nodes to specify a duty cycle, so that they can sleep much of the time to save energy. However, only very few models exist to determine the appropriate time and duration of a sleep phase. Existing approaches rely on pre-calculated sleep durations or are difficult to implement on real platforms. We propose a runtime and adaptive model to estimate the sleep time and duration of wireless sensor nodes. Our model takes the statistics of incoming and outgoing packets at a relay node which is then supplied to a general queueing model. The model is lightweight and can be fitted into any existing MAC protocol. We have implemented our model for TelosB platform and TinyOS environment. We integrated our model with two existing protocols (TinyOS LPL MAC and XMAC) and compared the performance of these protocols with and without our model. The performance evaluation results show that the energy consumption of a relay node reduced by 11.4 - 64.8%. The overall throughput of the network increased by up to 24%. Moreover, our model readily responded to changes in packet traffic rate while at the same time increasing the packet transmission reliability by 64.5 - 67.4% for different traffic scenarios.	control theory;duty cycle;epoch (reference date);mac address;network packet;performance evaluation;queueing theory;relay;scalability;sensor web;throughput;tinyos	Eyuel Debebe Ayele;Jianjun Wen;Zeeshan Ansar;Waltenegus Dargie	2015	2015 24th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288372	traffic generation model;real-time computing;telecommunications;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	10.279106214958977	85.55162147723988	103652

We study the properties of the model in relation to other parameters such as the packet size and/or the transport layer protocol, and we evaluate its accuracy under a variety of scenarios which have not been considered in previous studies. Our study shows that the model works well in a number of scenarios but its accuracy drops with high throughput values or when tested on different hardware. We further show that a non-linear model can greatly improve the accuracy in these two cases.	download;energy modeling;linear model;mobile app;network packet;nonlinear system;smartphone;throughput	Li Sun;Ramanujan K.

In both cases, the goals are: (i) to achieve adequate coverage; and (ii) to extend network life. In dynamic environments, nodes may use reactive algorithms so that each node locally decides when and where to move. This paper presents a behavior-based deployment and self-healing algorithm based on the social potential fields algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, nodes are attached to low cost robots to autonomously navigate in the coverage area. The proposed algorithm has been tested in environments with and without obstacles. Our study also analyzes the differences between non-hierarchical and hierarchical routing configurations in terms of network life and coverage.	algorithm;deploy;mobile phone;node - plant part;robot (device);routing	Eva González-Parada;José Manuel Cano-García;Francisco Aguilera;Francisco Sandoval Hernández;Cristina Urdiales	2017		10.3390/s17010120	robot;routing;hierarchical routing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	12.362836712029228	76.17360165062212	103735
f5d63a9bdaccf14333c943cb8cad253d2644e9c2	age of information minimization for an energy harvesting source with updating erasures: with and without feedback		Consider an energy harvesting (EH) sensor that continuously monitors a system and sends timestamped status update to a destination. The sensor harvests energy from nature and uses it to power its updating operations. The destination keeps track of the system status through the successfully received updates. With the recently introduced information freshness metric “Age of Information” (AoI), our objective is to design optimal online status updating policy to minimize the long-term average AoI at the destination, subject to the energy causality constraint at the sensor. Due to the noisy channel between the sensor and the destination, each transmitted update may be erased with a fixed probability, and the AoI at the destination will be reset to zero only when an update is successfully received. We first consider status updating without feedback available to the sensor and show that the Best-effort Uniform updating (BU) policy is optimal. We then investigate status updating with perfect feedback to the sensor and prove the optimality of the Best-effort Uniform updating with Retransmission (BUR) policy. In order to prove the optimality of the proposed policies, for each case, we first identify a lower bound on the long-term average AoI among a broad class of online policies, and then construct a sequence of virtual policies to approach the lower bound asymptotically. Since those virtual policies are sub-optimal to the original policy, the original policy is thus optimal.

Our goal is to maximize the lifetime of the network, given the energy constraint on each sensor node. Using linear programming (LP) formulation, we model this problem as a multicommodity flow problem, where a commodity represents the data generated from a sensor node and delivered to a base station. A fast approximate algorithm is presented, which is able to compute (1− )-approximation to the optimal lifetime for any > 0. Then along this baseline, we further study several advanced topics. First, we design an algorithm, which utilizes the unique characteristic of data aggregation, and is proved to reduce the running time of the fastest existing algorithm by a factor of K, K being the number of commodities. Second, we extend our algorithm to accommodate the same problem in the setting of multiple base stations, and study its impact on network lifetime improvement. All algorithms are evaluated through both solid theoretical analysis and extensive simulation results.	approximation algorithm;baseline (configuration management);data aggregation;fast fourier transform;fastest;flow network;linear programming;routing;sensor node;simulation;time complexity	Yuan Xue;Yi Cui;Klara Nahrstedt	2005	MONET	10.1007/s11036-005-4443-7	mathematical optimization;wireless sensor network;computer science;linear programming;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	12.05293992198628	79.5727485454414	104022

Based on past residual energy information reported by the sensor nodes, the sink node or another central node dynamically optimizes the communication activity levels of the sensor nodes to save energy without sacrificing the data throughput. The activity levels are defined to represent portions of time or time-frequency slots in a frame, during which the sensor nodes are scheduled to communicate with the sink node to report sensory measurements. Besides node mobility, it is considered that sensors' batteries may be recharged via a wireless power transmission or equivalent energy harvesting scheme, bringing to the optimization problem an even more dynamic character. We report large increased lifetimes over the non-optimized network and comparable or even larger lifetime improvements with respect to an idealized greedy algorithm that uses both the real-time channel state and the residual energy information.	anatomic node;greedy algorithm;large;mathematical optimization;mobile phone;node - plant part;optimization problem;real-time clock;schedule (document type);sensor node;throughput;sensor (device)	Dayan A.

ca433e4e0caa9b0c48feec5d18225655e23f436f	coverage and robustness of mm-wave urban cellular networks: multi-frequency hetnets are the 5g future		Cellular deployments in the spectrum-rich mm-wave bands are anticipated to provide multi-Gbps connectivity in future 5G networks. Although measurements have demonstrated the feasibility of outdoor mm-wave links, the network-level opportunities and challenges of mm-wave cellular deployments are yet to be fully understood. In this paper we present a study of mm-wave urban network coverage and robustness - i.e. handover and beamsteering opportunities for supporting user mobility and resolving blockage of directional mm-wave links by moving obstacles. We use real 3D building data with ray tracing and investigate the impact of base station placement and density, building materials, and antenna directivity. Our results show that mm-wave networks can provide multi-Gbps connectivity locally, but that over 25% of the network area remains in outage even with dense pico-cellular deployments and that supporting mobility is very challenging. Moreover, primary link blockage can be resolved via handover or beamsteering to a secondary link at only up to 40% and 25% of high-throughput locations, respectively. Given these networking challenges, we argue that multi-frequency heterogeneous networks are the key to exploiting the great promise of mm-wave for future 5G deployments, i.e. mm-wave as a hotspot capacity booster, rather than a solution for comprehensive cellular coverage.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;booster (electric power);code coverage;data access;data rate units;downtime;high-throughput computing;java hotspot virtual machine;mathematical optimization;microwave;multitier architecture;network performance;ray tracing (graphics);secure digital;spectral density;sun outage;throughput	Ljiljana Simic;Soumendra Panda;Janne Riihijärvi;Petri Mähönen	2017	2017 14th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)	10.1109/SAHCN.2017.7964912	computer science;robustness (computer science);directivity;computer network;heterogeneous network;handover;distributed computing;hotspot (wi-fi);ray tracing (graphics);base station;cellular network	Mobile	23.783808306029034	84.2296248968042	104183
15ad0dd5cf2d06168ac137646ce00246e454b516	improving energy efficiency in qos-constrained wireless sensor networks		Energy saving is often achieved via “squeezing” other application-sensitive Quality of Service (QoS) parameters such as delay and throughput. Accordingly, energy-saving methods must consider those QoS parameters. In this paper, we survey the most recent work on energy efficiency in WSNs and we discuss the impacts of these methods on the QoS provided. Moreover, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer procedure to deal with the trade-off between energy consumption and other QoS parameters. The idea is to tackle a certain source of energy consumption to minimize the drawn energy. Subsequently, this energy-saving method is refined to consider other service qualities. To support the correctness of our claim, three energy-saving methods, taking the QoS issues into consideration, are given as examples. The first method exploits a so-called Fuzzy transform for shrinking the wireless traffic with highly precise lossy data compression. In the second method, the sensing module is targeted by employing reliable virtual sensors. Such sensors compensate the unavailability of main energy-hungry sensors during sleep periods. The third method exploits a self-adaptive mechanism to improve the QoS parameters via deliberately reducing the lifetime below the maximum time and exploiting design-time knowledge.	quality of service	Mohamed Abdelaal;Oliver E.

However, new challenges arise when selecting the most appropriate participants when considering their different incentive requirements, associated sensing capabilities, and uncontrollable mobility, to best satisfy the quality-of-information (QoI) requirements of multiple concurrent tasks with different budget constraints. This paper proposes a multitask-oriented participant selection strategy called “DPS,” which is used to tackle the aforementioned challenges, where three key design elements are proposed. First is the QoI satisfaction metric, where the required QoI metrics of the collected data are quantified in terms of data granularity and quantity. Second is the multitask-orientated QoI optimization problem for participant selection, where task budgets are treated as the constraint, and the goal is to select a minimum subset of participants to best provide the QoI satisfaction metrics for all tasks. The optimization problem is then converted to a nonlinear knapsack problem and is solved by our proposed dynamic participant selection (DPS) strategy. Third is how to compute the expected amount of collected data by all (candidate) participants, where a probability-based movement model is proposed to facilitate such computation. Real and extensive trace-based simulations show that, given the same budget, the proposed participant selection strategy can achieve far better QoI satisfactions for all tasks than selecting participants randomly or through the reversed-auction-based approaches.	computation;computer multitasking;knapsack problem;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;participatory sensing;pictbridge;randomness;requirement;simulation;smartphone	Zheng Song;Chi Harold Liu;Jie Wu;Jian Ma;Wendong Wang	2014	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2317701	real-time computing;engineering;data mining;computer security;computer network	Mobile	14.047542179723022	81.45632513838345	104369

Implementing sharing regimes on a non-opportunistic basis means that sharing agreements must be implemented. To have meaning, those agreements must be enforceable. We make this discussion more concrete by reasoning about enforcement in a particular spectrum band (1695-1710 MHz) that is currently being proposed for sharing between commercial services (LTE) and an incumbent spectrum user in the US. We examine three enforcement approaches, exclusion zones, protection zones and pure ex post and consider their implications in terms of cost elements, opportunity cost, and their adaptability.	compaq lte	Martin B.

We propose a distributed end- to-end algorithm which operates over given multicast trees, and a back-pressure algorithm which optimizes routing and coding over the whole network. Unlike other existing algorithms, the source rates need not be centrally coordinated; the sinks control transmission rates across the sources. With random network coding, the proposed approach yields completely distributed and optimal algorithms for intra-session network coding. We prove the convergence of our proposed algorithms.

The Coverage Control Technology is one of the basic technologies of wireless sensor network, and is mainly concerned about how to prolong the network lifetime on the basis of meeting users’ perception demand. To optimize wireless sensor networks coverage, an algorithm which is based on particle swarm optimization with dynamic clonal selection is proposed. This algorithm controls the clonal quantity and variation range of particle which represents the locations of all mobile sensor nodes, by coverage rate and similarity among the swarm to avoiding being trapped in local optimum. By comparison of the simulation results with other algorithms, this optimization algorithm could improve the performance of network coverage more effectively.	algorithm;chaos theory;iteration;local optimum;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;premature convergence;self-propelled particles;simulation	Bing Cheng	2014	JNW	10.4304/jnw.9.01.56-62	multi-swarm optimization;simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;particle swarm optimization;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	10.908500001962148	78.28307860518672	105318

While it is important to ensure the desired level of coverage, it is also necessary to do so with a minimum number of sensors from a network cost perspective. In this paper, we assume that the sensors are deployed at random uniformly in a three-dimensional FoI and all the sensors may not have the same sensing range and/or probability of being alive. In such a 3D heterogeneous WSN, we derive the critical condition for the desired level of coverage of the FoI using a probabilistic model. We validate our analysis and demonstrate its benefits. We also demonstrate an application of the analysis to the design of a minimum-cost 3D heterogeneous WSN.	fault tolerance;liveness;numerical analysis;quality of service;sensor;simulation;statistical model	Hari Prabhat Gupta;Seela Veerabhadreswara Rao;Venkatesh Tamarapalli	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)	10.1109/ANTS.2013.6802860	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Robotics	12.648783724030373	77.30796197917844	105494

The nature of ad hoc networks is accounted for by letting nodes join and leave. Given the values of all cuts that can be formed in the original network and assuming information about the nodes that join or leave, expressions for the expected value and variance of any particular cut that may arise are derived. However, it is not possible to obtain a closed form expression for the minimum expected cut value in our framework. Nevertheless, we give a simple and reasonable upper bound for the minimum expected cut value which is also extendable to multicast transmissions.	binary erasure channel;extensibility;geometric graph theory;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);linear network coding;minimum cut;multicast;network model;network topology;random geometric graph;unicast	Lennart Gerdes;Mohit Thakur;Ralf Koetter	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5501876	wireless ad hoc network;maximum cut;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	14.705824608007049	87.62155217977117	105749

The characteristic of these DSC applications provides significant potential opportunities in the associated sensor network to utilize multirate transmissions for enhancing network performance. In this paper, we study a methodology for interplay optimization between routing and DSC in WSN, and propose a novel multirate based routing scheme for mission-driven DSC applications that considerably extends network lifetime. The proposed scheme adopts the rate assignment based on the residual energy, and employs a joint rate and energy scheduling mechanism to meet the end-to-end transmission rate constraint, information precision requirement, and the energy constraints in the network for DSC. Simulation results show that this multirate based routing scheme achieves significantly longer network lifetime compared to other existing research in WSN for DSC applications.	data compression;distributed source coding;end-to-end principle;mathematical optimization;network performance;routing;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation	Honggang Wang;Dongming Peng;Wei Wang;Hamid Sharif;Hsiao-Hwa Chen	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.622	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;computer network	Mobile	15.980486585283817	80.86441064036269	105817

Despite of approved advantages for collecting sensed information by the mobile sink(s), itinerary planning may effect on other techniques, hence, it should be designed with considering impressible techniques such as network coding. This paper proposes an optimal itinerary plan for mobile sinks in the network-coding-based WSNs. Although this optimization can not be solved in polynomial time, but the mathematical formulation can help us estimate the problem characteristic and figure out the firmness of it. This optimization leads to less energy consumption and increases the lifetime of network-coding-based WSNs. Since, there exist restricted processing resources in WSNs, the optimal solving of this problem is impractical in large-scale WSNs and so, a genetic algorithm is proposed. Results illustrate that proposed genetic algorithm converges to the optimal solution with an appropriate accuracy in less execution time. Moreover, the simulation results demonstrate that proposed approaches have significantly lower energy consumption and consequently more lifetime in comparison with conventional ones where are not considered network coding. ∗Corresponding author Email addresses: md.khalili@gmail.com (M.

Recently, there has been significant interest in the LoRa waveform and the LoRaWAN protocol for IoT. Using a Chirp-Spread-Spectrum (CSS) modulation technique, LoRa provides robust long range and low power consumption while trading off on bandwidth. These properties make LoRa a waveform of particular interest for military applications, but there is a need to better understand the protocol from a cyber perspective. In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept software radio architecture to intercept and inject LoRa packets using two inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) SDR platforms. The primary contributions of this paper are on exploring the challenge of interception and injection of LoRa packets via SDRs as well as conducting basic experiments to evaluate the performance of interception using COTS devices.

We address the problem of jointly optimizing data aggregation and routing so that the network lifetime can be maximized. A recursive smoothing method is adopted to overcome the non-differentiability of the objective function. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving the optimality of the optimization problem and design a distributed gradient algorithm accordingly. Extensive simulations are carried out to show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the data traffic and improve the network lifetime. The convergence property of the algorithm is studied under various network configurations. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We provide accurate power consumption measurements for different Bluetooth operating modes. Such information could be used to drive technical decisions on battery type and design of Bluetooth-based end systems. Finally, we examine the trade-off between power consumption and performance for a commercial off-the-shelf Bluetooth device. We find that the use of the sniff mode could be quite compatible with the use of multi-slot data packets. However, when the channel conditions require selecting single slot data packets, the sniff mode highly impact performance, and so the power/delay trade-off must be taken into consideration.	bluetooth;low-power broadcasting;maximum throughput scheduling;network packet	Juan-Carlos Cano;José-Manuel Cano;Eva González;Carlos Miguel Tavares Calafate;Pietro Manzoni	2007	SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review	10.1145/1328690.1328694	embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications	Mobile	11.712043810191282	85.27952600366996	106958

However, having such a high density of trackers over themonitored area is not always possible. This paper presents Ghost, a new tracking method based on Voronoi tessellations able to track a target by using less than three tracker nodes in wireless networks. In Ghost, different locations of the target create different Voronoi diagrams of the monitored area by placing virtual nodes around tracker nodes. These diagrams are used to estimate the current location of the target by intersecting the previous and current Voronoi diagrams. The target’s route is constructed by systematically searching the most likely estimated target’s locations over time. Simulation results validate that the proposed method has better tracking accuracy compared with existing proposals.

When two end devices are communicating, they commonly require intermediate devices to cooperate for maintaining the network connectivity. Although the communication is for only two devices, the other devices have to consume their battery power on relaying messages. As a result, the network-wide energy consumption is much higher than the energy consumed by only two end devices. To reduce the network-wide energy consumption, one potential way is to tradeoff between throughput and energy consumption on the intermediate devices. For example, when the throughput is not too high, i.e., less than 1Mbps, the intermediate devices can turn off the high-speed wireless network interface and switch to a low energy consumption one, called an energy-efficient vertical handover. Since there is no centralized control or infrastructure networks, the devices must perform a vertical handover based only on its own recorded information, i.e., local measurements executed by itself. To this end, an extended SDN controller, which has been proposed in a previous work, is considered. In addition, a new energy efficient vertical handover algorithm has been proposed. By utilizing the extended SDN controllers to exchange information among devices, the intermediate devices can perform the vertical handover by themselves and save energy. The effectiveness of the proposal has been confirmed by directly measured results.	algorithm;bluetooth;centralized computing;network interface controller;software-defined networking;throughput;windows mobile	Toan Nguyen-Duc;Eiji Kamioka	2016	2016 22nd Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2016.7581510	real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;body area network;computer network	Mobile	12.156482036226238	85.58869143746047	107162
d5a79942b0471fae5f296abb931690b317059565	a ga-sso based intelligent channel assignment approach for mr-mc wireless sensors networks		In this paper, based on the simplified swarm optimization (SSO) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA), a novel GA-SSO hybrid optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the NP-hard channel assignment problem of multi-radio multi-channel (MR-MC) wireless sensors networks (WSN) which is promising for data intensive application. The aim of channel assignment is to minimize total network interference so as to maximize network throughput. In the GA-SSO based channel assignment, an improved channel merging method is proposed to satisfy the interface constraint condition. Matlab based simulation results show that the proposed GA-SSO features better global search capacity and can reduce the total network interference more effectively, compared to the SSO and DPSO-CA algorithms.	accounts & sso;sensor;software release life cycle	Zhiping Xu;Zhicong Chen;Lijun Wu;Peijie Lin;Shuying Cheng	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-49397-8_27	wi-fi array;computer network	Mobile	13.55616085548216	84.54767725409113	107198

It is expected that LPWA connections will reach 2 billion in 2020, exceeding the number of traditional cellular users. Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), a new radio access technology, has been released by the Third Generation Partnership Project for such demands. NB-IoT supports super coverage extension, massive number of connections and long user lifetime with low power cost and low device complexity. With such prominent features, NB-IoT has become one of the dominating technologies in LPWA networks, applicable to a large range of IoT application scenarios such as smart meter, smart parking, smart home, smart tracking, e-health, etc. However, NB-loT is still in its infancy, needing deep theoretical investigation of modeling and optimizing system performance. Also, emerging applications that can be enabled by NB-loT and implementation challenges therein need further exploration.	naive bayes classifier	Jiming Chen;Kaoru Ota;Lu Wang;Preetha Thulasiraman;Zhiguo Shi	2018	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2018.2838938	computer network;narrowband;3rd generation partnership project 2;computer science;home automation;smart meter;radio access technology;internet of things	Visualization	21.826455410406883	87.48469008839258	107356
afbc1ba078afee5588dd2b0ae90153eeb0733692	toward an efficient c-ran optical fronthaul for the future networks: a tutorial on technologies, requirements, challenges, and solutions		The exponential traffic growth, demand for high speed wireless data communications, as well as incessant deployment of innovative wireless technologies, services, and applications, have put considerable pressure on the mobile network operators (MNOs). Consequently, cellular access network performance in terms of capacity, quality of service, and network coverage needs further considerations. In order to address the challenges, MNOs, as well as equipment vendors, have given significant attention to the small-cell schemes based on cloud radio access network (C-RAN). This is due to its beneficial features in terms of performance optimization, cost-effectiveness, easier infrastructure deployment, and network management. Nevertheless, the C-RAN architecture imposes stringent requirements on the fronthaul link for seamless connectivity. Digital radio over fiber-based common public radio interface (CPRI) is the fundamental means of distributing baseband samples in the C-RAN fronthaul. However, optical links which are based on CPRI have bandwidth and flexibility limitations. Therefore, these limitations might constrain or make them impractical for the next generation mobile systems which are envisaged not only to support carrier aggregation and multi-band but also envisioned to integrate technologies like millimeter-wave (mm-wave) and massive multiple-input multiple-output antennas into the base stations. In this paper, we present comprehensive tutorial on technologies, requirements, architectures, challenges, and proffer potential solutions on means of achieving an efficient C-RAN optical fronthaul for the next-generation network such as the fifth generation network and beyond. A number of viable fronthauling technologies such as mm-wave and wireless fidelity are considered and this paper mainly focuses on optical technologies such as optical fiber and free-space optical. We also present feasible means of reducing the system complexity, cost, bandwidth requirement, and latency in the fronthaul. Furthermore, means of achieving the goal of green communication networks through reduction in the power consumption by the system are considered.	baseband;c-ran;common public radio interface;fifth generation computer;mimo;mathematical optimization;network performance;next-generation network;optical fiber;performance tuning;quality of service;radio access network;radio over fiber;requirement;seamless3d;software deployment;telecommunications network;time complexity	Isiaka Ajewale Alimi;Anto&#x0301;nio Teixeira;Paulo P.

However, in order to support receivers with a poor visual channel, e.g. low-resolution cameras, most visual codes are designed for low data capacity and short reading distances. We present our work on Focus, a visual code that avoids earlier work's explicit trade-off between code capacity and channel quality. Rather than encoding the payload directly into individual pixels, Focus encodes the payload over a range of spatial frequencies. As a result, even a receiver with a very poor visual channel (e.g., a low-resolution camera, or a camera experiencing motion blur) can still partly decode a Focus code, because the code's low-frequency components are robust to common channel impairments. A receiver with a good channel can decode all data from the same code.  In our demo, we will present a prototype of Focus for smartphones and showcase how it deals with common impairments of the visual channel.	digital data;embedded system;focus;pixel;prototype;qr code;radio frequency;smartphone	Frederik Hermans;Liam McNamara;Thiemo Voigt	2015		10.1145/2809695.2817852	embedded system;computer vision;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;code;information and computer science	HCI	20.145350059726127	81.8669743672433	107911
95e7f6f45aa99eb5ba6a8435b5b9e8666d4f5452	a communication model based offloading decision for flying ad-hoc networks		Flying ad-hoc networks is composed of many connected drones with wireless communication. A drone sends its task to the cloud to reduce task completion time and energy consumption. However, flying ad-hoc networks, where several drones are connected to each other, can divide a task into small tasks and assign each small task to drones to improve responsibility. In this paper, we propose an offloading decision scheme that considers task completion time and energy consumption under the typical wireless communication model. The proposed scheme compares the cost of executing small tasks on the drones with the cost of committing a task to the cloud and decides offloading a task only if the cost of offloading is definitely smaller than the cost of using multiple drones.

This infrastructure is useful for designing low cost and fast deployed access networks in rural and suburban areas. It may also be used for providing access to sensor networks or for efficient facility placement in wireless networks. In these networks some nodes are chosen as access points and function as gateways to access a wired backbone. Each access point serves a cluster of its nearby user and a spanning tree rooted at the access point is used for message delivery. The work addresses both the design optimization and the operation aspects of the system. From the design perspective, we seek for a partition of the network nodes into minimal number of disjoint clusters that satisfy multiple constraints; Each cluster is required to be a connected graph with an upper bound on its radius. We assume that each node has a weight (representing its bandwidth requirement) and the total weight of all cluster nodes is also bounded. We show that these clustering requirements can be formulated as an instance of the Capacitated Facility Location problem (CFLP) with additional constraints. By breaking the problem into two sub-problems and solving each one separately, we propose polynomial time approximation algorithms that calculate solutions within a constant factor of the optimal ones. From the operation viewpoint, we introduce an adaptive delivery mechanism that maximizes the throughput of each cluster without violating the QoS constraints.	access network;approximation algorithm;cluster analysis;connectivity (graph theory);facility location problem;file spanning;internet backbone;mathematical optimization;polynomial;quality of service;requirement;spanning tree;throughput;time complexity;wireless access point	Yigal Bejerano	2002	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1145/570645.570672	mathematical optimization;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;approximation algorithm;computer network	Mobile	12.913234717171392	79.45032654316344	108243

However, the conventional measurement scheme conducted at the base station can not provide the demanded teletraffic in a sufficient small area, and the alternative modelling scheme only provides approximated results. Taking the advantage of the emerging technologies including the intelligent mobile terminal, the location navigation technology and the location-based services, we propose a new teletraffic measurement scheme, which employs mobile terminals to collect their own information and then constructs a database recording every mobile terminal's mobility pattern and communication pattern. We exemplify the proposed scheme using simulations, which employs such a database to derive the demanded teletraffic so as to optimize the relay nodes' locations with the purpose of minimizing the total required bandwidth.	approximation algorithm;database;exemplification;location-based service;mathematical optimization;mobile phone;relay;simulation;smartphone;wireless access point	Du Yang;Shahid Mumtaz;Joaquim Bastos;Jonathan Rodriguez	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)	10.1109/WCNCW.2012.6215513	teletraffic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;location-based service;computer network	Mobile	19.202372108254053	85.07657473724508	108599

We propose an offline path planning algorithm that ensures that the UAVs can always reach the base station to replace their batteries and that each UAV is always connected with the base station via a single or multi-hop link. We focus on heterogeneous UAVs with different flight times. The single base station scenario is compared with several extensions for multiple base stations based on the maximum time a sensing location has not been visited.	aerial photography;algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;blocking (computing);deadlock;motion planning;online and offline;persistence (computer science);spanning tree protocol;unmanned aerial vehicle	Jürgen Scherer;Bernhard Rinner	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)	10.1109/COASE.2016.7743546	embedded system;simulation;engineering;computer security	Robotics	13.06233258494295	78.11423936636459	108606

In this paper, we consider designing target detection systems in WSNs on the basis of the Neyman-Pearson Detector (NPD), a statistical decision making method of which accuracy depends on the amount of data collected within a limited time period. We propose the Optimal Multipath Planning Algorithm (OMPA) based on the maximum flow minimum cost algorithm for WSNs to set up paths to reliably deliver as many as possible data packets from data sources to the sink node. OMPA is optimal in the sense that it sets up the maximum number of node-disjoint paths composed of the links with the minimized expected transmission time (ETT). We also evaluate OMPAÂ¶V decision quality with the help of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and compare OMPA with the Minimum Cost Path Planning Algorithm (MCPPA) in terms of the detection decision quality and the number of available paths at the presence of node failures.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;decision quality;edmonds' algorithm;edmonds–karp algorithm;kadir–brady saliency detector;maximum flow problem;minimum-cost flow problem;motion planning;multipath propagation;network packet;new product development;receiver operating characteristic;sensor;volcano plot (statistics)	Yung-Liang Lai;Jehn-Ruey Jiang	2011	2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops	10.1109/ICPPW.2011.63	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;receiver operating characteristic;computer network	Robotics	14.191195728156593	77.77507936838158	109168

It has a wide range of applications in many scientific and engineering areas, such as spectrum sensing or environment monitoring. In this paper, we study the energy-efficient LSE of a time-varying random field under a total power constraint. The fusion center of a wireless sensing system performs LSE by using discrete-time samples collected by a sensor. An accurate LSE usually requires a large number of samples to be collected and transmitted. However, most wireless sensing systems operate with a stringent power constraint that may not be able to meet the high energy demands imposed by the large amount of data. The gap between energy demands and supplies is a direct result of the so-called big data problem. It is critical to develop energy-efficient sampling schemes that can bridge this gap by reducing the amount of data required by LSE. Two sampling schemes are considered in this paper: 1) a dynamic active sampling scheme that sequentially and adaptively selects the next sampling instant in a myopic manner with knowledge learned from previous samples and 2) a uniform sampling scheme that employs a fixed sampling rate to minimize the LSE error probability in the long term. The exact analytical cost functions and their respective upper bounds of both sampling schemes are developed by using an optimum thresholding-based LSE algorithm. The design parameters of both sampling schemes are optimized by minimizing their respective cost functions. The analytical and simulation results demonstrate that both sampling schemes can significantly reduce the amount of data collected by the system while obtain accurate LSE under a stringent power constraint. In addition, the uniform sampling scheme slightly outperforms the dynamic active sampling scheme.	algorithm;big data;sampling (signal processing);simulation;thresholding (image processing)	Zuoen Wang;Jingxian Wu;Jing Yang;Hai Lin	2015	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2470243	mathematical optimization;estimation;big data;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;noise measurement;mathematics;efficient energy use;wireless;statistics	Mobile	16.707148750465	80.11808547166409	109253

This paper develops a novel TDMA schedule that is capable of efficiently collecting sensor data for any network traffic pattern and is thus well suited to continuous data collection with dynamic traffic patterns. Following this schedule, the energy consumed by sensor nodes for any traffic pattern is very close to the minimum required by their workloads given in the traffic pattern. The schedule also allows the base station to conclude data collection as early as possible according to the traffic load, thereby reducing the latency of data collection. Experimental results using real-world data traces show that, compared with existing schedules that are targeted on a fixed traffic pattern, our proposed schedule significantly improves the energy efficiency and time efficiency of sensor data collection with dynamic traffic patterns.	network congestion;network traffic control;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);sensor;tracing (software)	Wenbo Zhao;Xueyan Tang	2011	2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935125	traffic generation model;embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;floating car data;computer science;base station;operating system;particle detector;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	10.15669793677114	75.64219800556106	109259

In this paper, we propose a novel localization approach called Loc-Knock that remotely locates miners through acoustic signals, i.e., knocking sounds. By applying an implicit synchronization method to the acoustic signals of indeterminate phases, frequencies and speeds, Loc-Knock can collaboratively reconstruct remote signals from unsynchronized sensors and locate the miners through a synchronization-free TDoA (Time Difference of Arrival) based localization method. To evaluate our approach, we conduct extensive experimental study in an operating coal mine. The results in the given 1 km field-test tunnel proved that Loc-Knock can precisely locate the miner over the tunnel.	acoustic cryptanalysis	Jiaxi Zhou;Zhonghu Xu;Shuo Zhang;Jing Xu	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-94268-1_76	real-time computing;multilateration;coal mining;synchronization;computer science;distributed computing	HCI	18.124267400821683	76.8478102588542	109294

However, up to now the diameter has been received much more emphasis than the average diameter. A method to calculate the diameter as well as the average diameter is proposed. It is found out that, (a) for some fixed there may exist several tight-optimal undirected double-loop networks, but their average diameters may not reach the same minimum value, (b) for some fixed N the average diameters of their tight-optimal undirected double-loop networks are not smaller than those of their 1-tight even 2-tight optimal undirected double-loop networks. These findings tell us that an undirected double-loop network may have an optimal diameter but has not an optimal average diameter, so not only the diameter but also the average diameter should be taken into account in designing an optimal double-loop network. An undirected double-loop network with an optimal diameter and an optimal average diameter is defined as a dual-optimal double-loop network.	diameter (protocol);emoticon;graph (discrete mathematics)	Qiong-Fang Bian;Ting-ting Hang;Hui Liu;Mu-yun Fang	2010	2010 Ninth International Conference on Grid and Cloud Computing	10.1109/GCC.2010.95	algorithm design;distributed algorithm;mathematical optimization;computer science;diameter;distributed computing;network topology	Theory	14.69733260676354	86.459120330744	109371

(October 2009) Armin Banaei, M.S., Texas A&M University Over the past decade we have witnessed a rapid growth and development in wireless communication systems, to the point that conventional spectrum allocation policies may not be able to fulfill them all. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licenses certain frequency segments to a particular user in a particular geographic area. Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) radio bands have also been envisioned for all other unlicensed user to share, as long as they follow certain power regulations. But with the recent boom in the wireless technologies, these open channels have become overcrowded with everything from wireless networks to wireless controllers. Therefore, the regulatory and standardization agencies have been working on new spectrum regulation policies for wireless communication systems. The underlying idea is to let unlicensed users to use the licensed band as long as they can guarantee low interference to the licensed users. Though seemingly simple, sophisticated interference management protocols are needed to meet the expected level of transparency accepted by licensed users. In this thesis we adopt the dynamic spectrum access approach to limit the interference to primary users and analyze the performance of the cognitive MAC protocols based on randomized sensing and access schemes. We assume that the secondary users are equipped with spectrum sensors. We consider two main settings; In the first setting we assume that the secondary users deploy the ALOHA protocol to resolve the contentions among each other and can only sense and access a single frequency band at a time.

In this regard, it is beneficial to acquire profound knowledge of cellular networks from the view of topology so that prominent network performances can be achieved by means of appropriate placements of base stations (BSs). In our researches, practical location data of BSs in eight representative cities are processed with classical algebraic geometric instruments, including α-Shapes, Betti numbers, and Euler characteristics. At first, the fractal nature is revealed in the BS topology from both perspectives of the Betti numbers and the Hurst coefficients. Furthermore, lognormal distribution is affirmed to provide the optimal fitness to the Euler characteristics of real BS deployments.	betti number;coefficient;euler;fractal;hurst exponent;linear algebra;network topology;performance	Ying Chen;Rongpeng Li;Zhifeng Zhao;Honggang Zhang	2018	CoRR		euler's formula;mathematical optimization;algebraic number;algebraic topology;mathematics;betti number;fractal;log-normal distribution;base station;topology;cellular network	ML	21.00320578362502	86.32550039150532	110029

In this PhD thesis, sensor networks are used to detect available radio resources in order to form a global view of the radio resource map, based on locally sensed and measured data. Data fusion and harvesting techniques are employed for the generation and maintenance of this “radio resource map.” In order to guarantee the flexibility and fault tolerance goals of disaster scenarios, a gossip protocol is used to exchange information. The radio propagation field knowledge is closely coupled to harvesting and fusion protocols in order to achieve efficient fusing of radio measurement data. For the evaluation, simulations will be used to measure the efficiency and robustness in relation to time critical applications and various deployment densities. Actual radio data measurements within the Ilmenau area are being collected for further analysis of the map quality and in order to verify simulation results.	brute-force search;fault tolerance;gossip protocol;map (higher-order function);sensor;simulation;software deployment;software propagation;tree structure	Jin Yang	2010	2010 Eleventh International Conference on Mobile Data Management	10.1109/MDM.2010.35	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;computer security;computer network	Mobile	12.19139022881618	75.53939553410474	110250

Unlike most previous works that rely on the design metric of network capacity with an error-free communication assumption, this paper performs analysis under a distortion-tolerant communication framework, where controlled distortion in the recovered information is allowed as long as the information can be recovered beyond a certain fidelity. The impacts of node density and spatial data correlation on the information distortion are investigated asymptotically by considering a large network with infinite area, infinite node numbers, but finite node density. Under fixed energy per unit area, it is discovered that: 1) for applications that only need to recover data at discrete locations, placing exact one sensor at the desired measurement locations will generate the optimum performance; 2) for applications that need to recover data at arbitrary locations in the measurement field, the optimum node density is a function of the spatial data correlation.	coefficient;discrete mathematics;distortion;sensor node	Jingxian Wu;Ning Sun	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683531	wireless sensor network;computer science;theoretical computer science;statistics;computer network	Mobile	16.05215710551023	80.2194007434656	110273

Little attention has been paid to the optimal power consumption by software execution on these mobile devices. Cellular systems are usually powered by battery, and therefore power conservation is a major concern in such networks. Energy-efficient algorithms serve better to save power in such environments. Optimal uses of the network resources may lead to power conservation in such systems. In this paper, an energy-efficient resources management algorithm to profile power consumption is proposed. Power consumption of the system is described with respect to certain workload. The proposed power management solution uses mobile agent technology for energy-efficient channel allocation in cellular networks.

The results related to the impact of the geometric distribution, addressed for GNSS location systems, cannot be used directly to other wireless location systems, since the trilateration algorithms used and the characteristics of range estimates can be rather different. In this paper we develop an exhaustive study on the impact of the geometric distribution of anchors for the two most usual algorithms used in non-GNSS wireless location systems, taking into account the non ideal characteristics of the range noises in those location systems. From this study we present two parameters, particular to these two algorithms, which quantify the suitability of the geometric distribution taking values between 0 and 1, depending only on the geometric distributions. We show that armed with these new parameters, it is possible to design the wireless location system in an optimum way. Moreover, we present more optimum geometric distributions than the ones known in the literature.	algorithm;satellite navigation	Santiago Mazuelas;Alfonso Bahillo;Javier Prieto;Rubén M.

4ff125175df330fbb2a5ecc714904f3493320e53	optimal probabilistic encryption for distributed detection in wireless sensor networks based on immune differential evolution algorithm		The problem of binary hypothesis testing is considered in a bandwidth-constrained low-power wireless sensor network operating over insecure links. To prevent passive eavesdropping from enemy fusion center (EFC), the sensor observations are randomly flipped according to pre-deployed flipping rates before transmission. Accordingly, a constrained optimization problem is formulated to minimize the fusion error of ally fusion center (AFC) while maintain EFC’s error at high level. We demonstrated that the fusion error is a non-convex function of the flipping rates, thus an immune based differential evolution algorithm is designed to search the optimal flipping rates, such that the EFC always gets high error probability at the cost of a small degeneration of the AFC’s fusion performance. Furthermore, the optimal thresholds of the fusion rules are calculated based on the statistics of the sensor data, which further degenerates the detection performance of the EFC, since it is not aware of the statistics of the sensor observations after data flipping, resulting in its threshold does not match the observations. Simulation results demonstrated that the AFC can appropriately acquire the original nature state, while the EFC is prevent to detect the target regardless of the signal-to-noise and sensor numbers.	algorithm;differential evolution;probabilistic encryption	Wen Chen;Hui Zhao;Tao Li;Yuling Liu	2018	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-017-1484-3	wireless sensor network;differential evolution;fusion center;computer science;fusion rules;statistical hypothesis testing;constrained optimization;algorithm;probabilistic encryption;eavesdropping	Mobile	16.47252538631558	79.56593970625728	110823
fb5287fcba062b4ee5a5ecf04101a9df0fe7d4a4	a comparative study of cognitive radio platforms	software defined radio;gnu radio;platform;presentation;testbed;usrp;cognitive radio	Cognitive radio (CR) technology has become one of the buzzwords within the wireless communications community over the past 12 years. Its ability to learn, decide and adapt to the external environment made CR attractive to regulators, researchers, academia, politicians and the industry. CR promises to bring a paradigm shift in spectrum management policies from command-and-control regime to dynamic and opportunistic spectrum access. Despite more than a decade of research in the CR area, there are too little CR systems ready for the market. This lack of ready CR systems may reflect an overemphasis in the CR literature on theory and simulations with less work done in experimental-based-research and publications. In order to fast-track the real-life deployments of CR systems, the research community is now focusing on the development of CR platforms. With different software defined radio (SDR) packages and hardware available, it is confusing to decide which one to build or use. The objective of this paper is to study the design of CR platforms making use available SDR software packages and hardware. Our conclusion is that CR research should now focus on experimental-based results using real-life CR platforms in order to realize market-ready CR systems.	cognitive radio;etsi satellite digital radio;programming paradigm;real life;simulation	Moshe T.

42499d45f1e1ea7a8cbfd3b86efed8d2d303a7db	low-cost interferer detection and classification using telosb sensor motes	to describe most mobility models	Inter-protocol interference is one of the most critical issues in wireless communication. For example, this becomes extremely problematic in environments where robustness and realtime communication need to be considered, e.g., in industrial automation or health care applications. Recently, possible approaches for interference mitigation have been described in the literature assuming that the interferer is known in advance. We contribute to this line of research with a framework for interferer detection and classification. Essentially, we use a simple IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver as for example used on the TelosB sensor motes to scan the 2.4 GHz ISM band. This band is used by different technologies including Bluetooth, WiFi, and cordless phones. The key challenge is the accurate timing of the scanning of the frequency band. The presented framework supports flexible descriptions of such scan jobs allowing to adapt to the detectors requirements, depending on the interfering protocols.	automation;bluetooth;frequency band;implicit shape model;interference (communication);requirement;sensor;transceiver	Bastian Bloessl;Stefan Joerer;Fabian Mauroner;Falko Dressler	2012	Mobile Computing and Communications Review	10.1145/2436196.2436215	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	20.07615134135605	79.88499206974478	111164
9b3da30d4907e6ef19ff8f9edc6b7c7cf13b8d5a	channel modeling of mi underwater communication using tri-directional coil antenna		While underwater wireless communications have been investigated and implemented for decades, existing solutions still have difficulties in establishing reliable and low-delay wireless underwater links among small-size devices. The Magnetic Induction (MI) communication technique is among the promising solutions due to its advantages in low propagation delay and less susceptibility to the transmission environments. To date, existing MI models cannot accurately characterize the complex underwater MI channels, especially in the shallow water with omnidirectional antennas. In this paper, an analytical channel model is developed for underwater MI communication system with Tri-directional coil (TD coil), which is derived based on the rigorous electromagnetic field analysis. The MIMO channel between the tri-directional coil antennas are characterized under the complex influences from the water absorption as well as the surface reflection and lateral waves. To validate the channel model, we compare the theoretical results with simulations derived by the COMSOL Multiphysics simulation tool. The developed channel model confirms the feasibility and lays the foundation of reliable MI underwater communications.	channel (communications);fractal antenna;lateral thinking;mimo;multiphysics;propagation delay;simulation;software propagation;triangular function	Hongzhi Guo;Zhi Sun;Pu Wang	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417399	underwater acoustic communication;wireless sensor network;magnetic susceptibility;telecommunications;surface wave;computer science;antenna;wireless	Mobile	22.36208730382713	78.87708016831156	111204
4c2573fa8732bdf02d17c0634ecc1d72a6193b98	linear time approximation algorithms for the relay node placement problem in wireless sensor networks with hexagon tessellation	journal of sensors;issn 1687 725x	The relay node placement problem in wireless sensor network (WSN) aims at deploying the minimum number of relay nodes over the network so that each sensor can communicate with at least one relay node. When the deployed relay nodes are homogeneous and their communication ranges are circular, one way to solve the WSN relay node placement problem is to solve the minimum geometric disk cover (MGDC) problem first and place the relay nodes at the centers of the covering disks and then, if necessary, deploy additional relay nodes to meet the connection requirement of relay nodes. It is known that the MGDC problem is NPcomplete. A novel linear time approximation algorithm for the MGDC problem is proposed, which identifies covering disks using the regular hexagon tessellation of the plane with bounded area.The approximation ratio of the proposed algorithm is (5+ε), where 0 < ε ≤ 15. Experimental results show that the worst case is rare, and on average the proposed algorithm uses less than 1.7 times the optimal disks of the MGDC problem. In cases where quick deployment is necessary, this study provides a fast 7-approximation algorithm which uses on average less than twice the optimal number of relay nodes in the simulation.

In MLM, nodes equipped with ultra-wideband (UWB) radio first move randomly for collecting time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements and then apply a modified biased Kalman filter (MBKF) designed for mitigating NLOS errors. NLOS bias in the measurements is further mitigated by using the shortest path distance (SPD) selection. Node positions are initialized by using multidimensional scaling (MDS) and then estimated by using iterative trilateration accompanied by an error accumulation management. Our simulation results demonstrate that the positioning accuracy of MLM outperforms previous methods in obstructed building environments with a limited anchor heard (AH).	hoc (programming language);hop;image scaling;iterative method;kalman filter;line-of-sight (missile);multidimensional scaling;particle filter;rss;randomness;shortest path problem;simulation;time of arrival;tree accumulation;ultra-wideband	Tomoya Takenaka;Zafer Sahinoglu;Ghulam Bhatti;Jinyun Zhang;Hiroshi Mineno;Tadanori Mizuno	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683695	kalman filter;telecommunications;computer science;non-line-of-sight propagation;statistics;computer network	Robotics	17.317794911274397	74.75329426188486	111436

This necessitates the need to accurately estimate the energy consumption during mote operations prior to deployment, thereby avoiding unexpected decreased network coverage as a result of untimely mote “deaths.” Motivated by this need, the overriding purpose of this research is to profile the energy consumption during typical mote operations using an simple, novel analytical model, and validate it using measurements from a testbed. The mote operation life for a set of PHY layer functions estimated using our analytical model was within 14-20% of the value obtained from the testbed. In addition, the energy consumption during the basic modes of a practical medium access control (MAC) protocol has been modeled, and was observed to be within 15-21% of the values obtained from the testbed.	access control;baseband;block cipher mode of operation;embedded system;microcontroller;modulation;network partition;on-board data handling;phy (chip);sensor node;software deployment;testbed;transmitter	Sankarkumar Thandapani;Aravind Kailas	2012	The 15th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications		embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	12.470051683693955	84.06791948694989	111567

Target tracking is an important application of wireless sensor networks. Good tracking quality and energy efficiency are the key requirements for any protocol designed for target tracking sensor networks. In this paper, we present a novel protocol, Adaptive Dynamic Cluster-based Tracking (ADCT), for tracking a mobile target. This protocol uses the optimal choice mechanism and dynamic cluster-based approach to achieve a good tracking quality and energy efficiency by optimally choosing the nodes that participate in tracking and minimizing the communication overhead, thus prolongs the lifetime of the whole sensor network. Simulation results show that our protocol can accurately track a target with random moving speeds and cost much less energy than other protocols for target tracking.

229b6e84b9a33fcbd6636ef93c6dd08be2d2b3ae	phycon: discovering physical connectivity for indoor wlan using mobility	rssi;mobility;indoors;wlan;connectivity	The concept of connectivity in wireless networks is a well-established term referring to the ability of nodes to communicate with other nodes directly or through other nodes working as relays. In this paper, a different aspect of connectivity is presented named physical connectivity, which we defined as the ability of nodes to physically reach other nodes, not only through open spaces, but also through corridors, doors, rooms, etc. For indoor wireless local area networks (WLANs), we believe that awareness of physical connectivity is a key factor for developing emerging applications such as guiding, localization, tracking, physical routing, etc. Related studies only consider the problem of direct connectivity or line-of-sight (LOS), however, we consider physical connectivity should span beyond LOS conditions enabling nodes to reach other nodes through any path available. In this paper a novel method to discover physical connectivity named PhyCon is presented. PhyCon combines node mobility and the inverse-square relationship between received signal strength and distance to discover physical connectivity paths among wireless users. Results from simulations and testbed experiments show PhyCon can discover a high percentage of physical connectivity paths using normal mobility behavior of users found in indoor WLAN.	direct tpms;experiment;internationalization and localization;line-of-sight (missile);mathematical optimization;ps (unix);relay;routing;semantic network;sensor;simulation;testbed	Marco A.

In addition, nodes in these networks employ directional antennas to improve spatial throughput. In such networks, we consider the problem of finding a broadcast tree from a given root with channel assignment such that all the links in the broadcast tree can be active simultaneously without interfering with each other. We prove that finding such a tree is an NP-hard problem. Hence, we first formulate the problem as an integer linear program (ILP) and then develop heuristics to find the desired broadcast tree. We analyze the performance of developed heuristics by comparing it with the optimal solution obtained from ILP.	computation;genetic algorithm;heuristic (computer science);linear programming;np-hardness;prim's algorithm;simulation;throughput	Syed Ali Ahuja;Srinivasan Ramasubramanian	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5502344	integer programming;computer science;directional antenna;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	16.877776799147302	86.288085277721	112232

The system of such device should be highly flexible to dynamically and autonomously adjust its radio operating parameters. Moreover, the reduction of interference among radio communication systems is needed to allow the coexistence of different standards in the same device. In this paper, a new concept and system architecture to reach our goal are proposed and discussed. Our ultimate goal aims to ensure the coexistence of different standards in a CR mobile terminal.	bandwidth (signal processing);coexist (image);cognitive radio;interference (communication);mobile phone;radio frequency;systems architecture;white spaces (radio)	Raafat Lababidi;Frédéric Le Roy;Ali Mansour;Bernard Jarry;Ali Louzir	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2014.6865430	cognitive radio;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;band-stop filter;computer network	Embedded	22.60606731283828	85.88845741776065	112392

Thus, precision agriculture in rural areas may largely benefit from low-cost and easy-to-deploy vehicles able to exchange data with ground sensors for monitoring and controlling automated cultivations. In this letter, we describe, both analytically and empirically, a real testbed implementing IEEE 802.15.4-based communications between an UAV and fixed ground sensors. In our scenario, we found that aerial mobility limits the actual IEEE 802.15.4 transmission range among the UAV and the ground nodes to approximately 1/3 of the nominal one. We also provide considerations to design the deployment of sensors in precision agriculture scenarios.	aerial photography;approximation algorithm;autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);gilbert cell;line-of-sight (missile);network packet;sensor;software deployment;testbed;unmanned aerial vehicle	Manlio Bacco;Andrea Berton;Alberto Gotta;Luca Caviglione	2018	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2855211	computer network;computer science;agriculture;precision agriculture;software deployment;packet loss;testbed;ieee 802.15;transmission (mechanics)	Mobile	19.50313198119141	77.57106851467908	113059
2743d2b14cc0cf9304d644d302e269eede8a3e74	indoor localization by detecting 80 key bits with downlink interleave division multiple access		In this paper, a wireless cellular network based indoor localization approach is presented. After receiving the positioning request, initialized from a mobile device during the training stage, the surrounding Base Stations (BSs), which are typically equipped with massive antenna array elements, can measure the Angle of Arrival (AoA) of the positioning request signal. Being unsimilar to the conventional AoA localization approaches, the BSs will not communicate with each other and localize the mobile device cooperatively. Instead, each BS simply encodes its own longitude, latitude and AoA information within a 80-bit small packet. Further, before delivering the data to the mobile device, downlink Interleave Division Multiple Access (IDMA) is exploited. Hence, during the measurement stage, the mobile device receives the superposition of the data packet from multiple BSs. Downlink IDMA manages to detect the superimposed data robustly even under the asynchronous environment. Numerical results exhibit that 90% of the realizations can yield a positioning error smaller than one meter, under very low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).	angle of arrival;mobile device;network packet;quantum superposition;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link	Yejian Chen	2018	2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377001	computer network;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;antenna array;asynchronous communication;telecommunications link;network packet;angle of arrival;base station;cellular network;computer science	Mobile	21.756946779986087	75.72959746673409	113333

However, these data-heavy applications require lots of battery power on the user equipment. To extend the user equipment battery lifetime, plus further support various services and large amount of data transmissions, the 3GPP standards for LTE/LTE-Advanced has adopted discontinuous reception (DRX). In this paper, we take an overview of various static/fixed DRX cycles of the LTE/LTE-Advanced power saving mechanisms, by modelling the system with bursty packet data traffic using a semi-Markov process. Based on the analytical model, we will show the trade-off relationship between the power saving and wake-up delay performance. This work will help to select the best parameters when LTE/LTE-Advanced DRX is implemented depending on the protocols and desired outcome of the traffic.	compaq lte;discontinuous reception;network packet;semiconductor industry;wake-on-lan	Ranjeet S.

c68c58d8aa786b2bdb1fe9637e2bae18a4fd0e65	residual energy-aware collaborative transmission beamforming in wireless sensor networks		Energy-Efficient transmission techniques are very important for extending the lifetime of a wireless sensor network (WSN) given that recharging batteries of a large number of WSN nodes is a very difficult and expensive operation. Collaborative transmission beamforming (CTB) saves energy consumed by each node by distributing between different WSN nodes the required total power transmission to get a desired bit error rate (BER) at the receiver. Moreover, by coherently combining the different signals transmitted by the WSN nodes, CTB increases the signal strength in the direction of the receiver, therefore decreases the total power transmission of the WSN. In this paper, we propose a new CTB technique that minimizes the total power transmission of the WSN while balancing the residual energy in different nodes. By solving this multi-objective optimization problem, we show that the WSN lifetime can be improved up to 30 % compared to the basic CTB algorithm, which aims at minimizing the total power transmission without taking into account the residual energy.	algorithm;beamforming;bit error rate;coding tree unit;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem;rechargeable battery;x.690	Jimmy Nsenga;S.

We proposed an appearance probability matrix for secondary IoT sensor devices in order to maximize the supportable number of sensor devices based on the optimal deployment case and probability.

Beneath this simple observation lies a complex design space that encompasses all layers of the radio through application. Broad design principles include the desire to exploit resources external to the network, such as beacons and (perhaps mobile) access points that do not have strong energy constraints. We consider synchronization, scheduled communications rendezvous, and packet acquisition. Synchronization accuracy worsens with prediction interval, saves energy by enabling scheduling, but costs energy to maintain. Acquisition is probabilistic due to noise, fading, and synchronization error, with operating points defining energy-performance tradeoffs.	network packet;requirement;scheduling (computing);synchronization (computer science);wireless access point	Brian M.

The WSN operates under the sub-1GHz IEEE 802.11ah MAC/PHY standard and it also includes a relay node that may be used for forwarding the data to the FC. The FC collects the data from the sensors and the relay and estimates the random signal of each sensor with the linear weighted least squares (WLS) algorithm. The objective of the FC is to minimize the power consumption of the sensors subject to an MSE distortion constraint by selecting the use of the relay for the sensors that need it. We cast the power minimization problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). Our detailed simulation results indicate the efficacy of our scheme under a path loss channel model and randomly deployed sensor populations, while the performance gains are increased even more for denser sensor population. Since the IEEE 802.11ah standard leaves open aspects related to the relay selection process for IEEE 802.11ah-based WSNs, our system can be readily implemented in this emerging class of WSNs.	algorithm;channel (communications);distortion;least squares;linear programming;mathematical optimization;phy (chip);population;randomness;relay;sensor node;sensor web;simulation;stochastic process;wireless access point	Antonios Argyriou	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7249402	ieee 802.11s;neurfon;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;ieee 802.11b-1999;computer science;ieee 802.11h-2003;smart grid;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;estimation theory;mobile wireless sensor network;internet of things;statistics;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Embedded	14.986249675078502	80.75151140984863	113943

Because of cost and implementation difficulty, Minimization of Drive Tests (MDT) was proposed in LTE Release 10. It utilizes the LTE user equipment to feedback the measurement report of reference signal receiving power (RSRP) for the network optimization, which makes the LTE fingerprint-based positioning system possible. However, due to the mobile diversity, user habit and complicated channel, the user equipment (UE) RSRP difference is a non-ignorable problem that affects the positioning accuracy both in the online phase and offline phase. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an UE RSRP difference elimination method based on Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm. By using the relative RSRP difference between each two mobile terminals, we eliminate the RSRP difference both in the offline phase and online phase. We implemented the proposed method in a dense urban area and evaluated its performance. The experiment results indicated that the proposed method could effectively eliminate the UE RSRP difference and improve the positioning accuracy for LTE fingerprint-based positioning system.	algorithm;compaq lte;fingerprint;image scaling;mathematical optimization;multidimensional scaling;online and offline;positioning system;satellite navigation	Lin Ma;Ningdi Jin;Yang Cui;Yubin Xu	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7997470	positioning system;computer network;real-time computing;user equipment;navigation system;computer science;gnss applications;multidimensional scaling;wireless ad hoc network;communication channel	Mobile	21.14398874562508	74.59638510591985	114463

While enjoying the wide variety of applications, the sensors in WSN have constrained resources, affecting their living lives, working times, assigned tasks, etc. Though a large number of efforts have been devoted into designing protocols that save energy as much as possible, they are still a passive solution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called policy-based assistance system (PAS) that addresses the issue of resource limitation in a proactive manner. Complementary to existing works which focus on saving energy in individual nodes, our proposed approach further allows sensors with limited resources to make requests to other sensors to help complete the tasks. In this way, the resources in the whole WSN are better utilized and more tasks can be completed with little communication overhead.	overhead (computing);sensor;simulation	Jingwei Li;Adam Bowers;Dan Lin;Peng Jiang;Wei Jiang	2016	Computing	10.1007/s00607-016-0531-8	real-time computing;simulation;computer security	Mobile	10.092110612881413	78.4670782081166	114641

Due to the innovative move of migrating the baseband processing functionalities to the centralized cloud baseband unit pool, C-RAN is anticipated to reduce energy consumption significantly to be a green RAN. Moreover, with the cloud-based architecture, lots of new functionalities and RAN designs are ready to be incorporated, which redefines the RAN as a flexible RAN. In this article, we review the recent advances of exploiting cloud computing to form a green and flexible C-RAN from two cloud-based properties: centralized processing and the software-defined environment. For the centralized processing property, we include coordinated multipoint and limited fronthaul capacity, multicasting, and CSI issues in C-RAN. For the software-defined environment property, we summarize elastic service scaling, functionality splitting, and functionality extension. We also include some of our recent research results and discuss several open challenges.	baseband;c-ran;camera serial interface;centralized computing;cloud computing;definition;image scaling;multicast;multipoint ground;prospective search;systems architecture	Jianhua Tang;Ruihan Wen;Tony Q.

In mostly localization algorithms, one of the main methods to improve localization accuracy is to increase the number of anchor nodes. But the number of anchor nodes is always limited because of the hardware restrict, such as cost, energy consumption and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm with small extra logical overhead, which uses the shortest-hop path scheme to upgrade virtual anchor nodes, while the real number of physical anchors is the same as before. This algorithm firstly chooses out some special nodes from all the unknown ones to figure out more accurate positions of them, and then makes these ones as new virtual anchor nodes assist other unknowns in localizing together with the real anchors. The simulation results illustrate our algorithm has improved the accuracy of localization greatly.	distributed algorithm;internationalization and localization;overhead (computing);simulation	Pengxi Liu;Xinming Zhang;Shuang Tian;Zhiwei Zhao;Peter P Sun	2007	Sixth International Conference on Networking (ICN'07)	10.1109/ICN.2007.8	embedded system;distributed algorithm;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	15.970871752693473	75.0457572334007	115470
1adbfcedbd9c48ad0275a44dc83e2b97642c2bbc	audio-wifi: audio channel assisted wifi network for smart phones	audio channel;smart phone;wifi network	Wi-Fi is becoming widely popular network interface for data communication in smart phones because of it’s high throughput, power efficiency and relatively larger range. However, the Wi-Fi network still has some perturbation such as high consumption of energy and bandwidth for detecting the contention and collision, energy consumption in idle state for continuous scanning of new networks and poor utilization of wireless channel for not detecting packet loss or collision while a transmitter is transmitting. In addition, Wi-Fi needs to transmit low rate of control packets (RTS/CTS) in order to access the channels. Researchers have proposed to use other existing wireless network interface (Bluetooth , ZigBee etc.) as a parallel communication for enhancing the performance of Wi-Fi network by addressing above issues [1], [2]. Although the solution of using bluetooth, ZigBee in parallel with WiFi improves the performance, it creates severe interference with Wi-Fi for communicating in the same frequency band (2.4GHz). In our project, we like to enhance the performance of data communication over the Wi-Fi network by integrating the mic/speaker of the smart phones as a parallel communication channel. Our idea is to propose a novel framework of communication using mic/speaker in order to develop a more efficient Wi-Fi network communication. The non-interferential nature with Wi-Fi network is the biggest advantage of using audio communication channel for this purpose. For audio communication we like to exploit frequency band beyond normal human ear perception. At our knowledge, most of the smart phones are both capable of generating and discerning audio frequency beyond human ear perception.	bluetooth;carpal tunnel syndrome;channel (communications);frequency band;interference (communication);network interface;network packet;performance per watt;rs-232;sensor;smartphone;throughput;transmitter	Mostafa Uddin;Tamer Nadeem	2012	Mobile Computing and Communications Review	10.1145/2436196.2436204	computer science;computer network;wireless network;transmitter;throughput;packet loss;bluetooth;network interface;network packet;parallel communication	Mobile	10.960351439522668	86.96798904550913	115857

The nature of GNSS signal propagation in typical signal impeding wireless channels such as indoors and urban environments is studied. The signal power distribution, delay spread, and Doppler spread characteristics of real GNSS signals in such environments are investigated. Based on the observations obtained from this characterization, a closed-loop tracking architecture based on spatial diversity reception is proposed. The proposed algorithm is tested on real data collected using two antennas in indoor static and urban kinematic scenarios. The carrier loop tracking, code loop tracking, and pseudorange errors are compared between single antenna reception and dual antenna spatial diversity reception for different scenarios. Results show that the proposed tracking method improves the Doppler measurement by more than 50% and pseudorange measurements by 2-5 m compared to a single antenna receiver.	algorithm;multipath propagation;pseudorange;satellite navigation;software propagation	Ranjeeth Kumar Siddakatte;Ali Broumandan;Gérard Lachapelle	2014	2014 Ubiquitous Positioning Indoor Navigation and Location Based Service (UPINLBS)	10.1109/UPINLBS.2014.7033704	electronic engineering;geography;telecommunications;fading;remote sensing	Mobile	24.290862141709784	76.46383944919675	116083

For a collection of simultaneously transmitting stations in the plane, it is possible to identify a reception zone for each station, consisting of the points where its transmission is received correctly. The resulting SINR diagram partitions the plane into a reception zone per station and the remaining plane where no station can be heard.  SINR diagrams appear to be fundamental to understanding the behavior of wireless networks, and may play a key role in the development of suitable algorithms for such networks, analogous perhaps to the role played by Voronoi diagrams in the study of proximity queries and related issues in computational geometry. So far, however, the properties of SINR diagrams have not been studied systematically, and most algorithmic studies in wireless networking rely on simplified graph-based models such as the unit disk graph (UDG) model, which conveniently abstract away interference-related complications, and make it easier to handle algorithmic issues, but consequently fail to capture accurately some important aspects of wireless networks.  This article focuses on obtaining some basic understanding of SINR diagrams, their properties and their usability in algorithmic applications. Specifically, we have shown that assuming uniform power transmissions, the reception zones are convex and relatively well-rounded. These results are then used to develop an efficient approximation algorithm for a fundamental point location problem in wireless networks.	approximation algorithm;computation;computational geometry;convex function;interference (communication);point location;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;state diagram;transmitter;unit disk graph;usability;voronoi diagram	Chen Avin;Yuval Emek;Erez Kantor;Zvi Lotker;David Peleg;Liam Roditty	2012	J.

The proposed framework consists of two layers, where the goal is to minimize the total energy consumption of transmitting the data sensed by nodes. The lower layer is the compressed sampling layer, where nodes are divided into clusters. Nodes are randomly selected to conduct sampling, and then send the data to the cluster heads through random access channels. The upper layer is the data aggregation layer, where full sampling is adopted. We also develop methods to determine the number of clusters and the probability that a node participates in data sampling. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can effectively reduce the amount of sampling nodes, so as to reduce the total energy consumption of the UASNs.	acoustic cryptanalysis;compressed sensing;data aggregation;data compression;layers (digital image editing);nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;random access;randomness;sampling (signal processing);simulation;transmitter	Hongzhi Lin;Wei Wei;Ping Zhao;Xiaoqiang Ma;Rui Zhang;Wenping Liu;Tianping Deng;Kai Peng	2016	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-015-1076-z	data aggregator;telecommunications;efficient energy use;computer security;computer network	Mobile	10.36982364703288	79.77186970409623	116615

Because of limited and dynamic energy supply, EPWSNs are duty-cycled to achieve energy-neutrality, a condition where the energy demand does not exceed the energy supply. Duty cycling entails nodes to sleep and wakeup according to a wakeup scheduling scheme. In this paper, we survey the various wakeup scheduling schemes, with focus on their suitability for EPWSNs. A classification scheme is proposed to characterize existing wakeup scheduling schemes, with three main categories, namely, asynchronous, synchronous, and hybrid. Each wakeup scheduling scheme is presented and discussed under the appropriate category. The paper concludes with open research issues. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

b3ec4a9ec6a099ee4a4af79d97569520fe80bcf8	a proportional time allocation algorithm to transmit binary sensor decisions for target tracking in a wireless sensor network		In this paper, we study the target tracking problem in a wireless sensor network. A sensor receives a measurement from an energy emitting target and employs binary quantization to the received measurement to generate its decision. A sinusoidal waveform with a certain duration is then used to transmit the sensor decision to the fusion center (FC). All sensor decisions are transmitted to the FC over erroneous wireless channels based on a time division multiple access scheme. We introduce the proportional time allocation (PTA) algorithm where at each time step of tracking, PTA jointly determines the sensors binary quantization thresholds and their time allocations devoted for the transmissions of binary sensor decisions. Simulation results show that, PTA optimally and dynamically distributes the available transmission time among the sensors near the target so that the decisions of such sensors become less subject to channel errors, and turns off the non-informative sensors located far away from the target. Hence, PTA both saves from the number of sensors transmitting to the FC and provides better estimation performance as compared to ad hoc equal time allocation approaches.	algorithm;hoc (programming language);information;program test authority;quantization (signal processing);sensor;simulation;transmitter	Engin Masazade;Abdulkadir Kose	2018	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2017.2759080	control theory;transmission time;fusion center;mathematics;wireless sensor network;real-time computing;brooks–iyengar algorithm;algorithm;time division multiple access;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wireless;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	16.37823022753045	79.32670592280249	117141

Unlike recent work which was carried out under the assumption of full visibility, here we assume a (simplified) communication model where unreliable wireless links are represented as on/off channels. We present conditions on how to scale the model parameters so that the network: 1) has no secure node which is isolated and 2) is securely connected, both with high probability when the number of sensor nodes becomes large. The results are given in the form of full zero-one laws, and constitute the first complete analysis of the EG scheme under non-full visibility. Through simulations, these zero-one laws are shown to be valid also under a more realistic communication model (i.e., the disk model). The relations to the Gupta and Kumar's conjecture on the connectivity of geometric random graphs with randomly deleted edges are also discussed.	eurographics;key distribution;random geometric graph;random graph;randomness;simulation;with high probability	Osman Yagan	2012	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2012.2189353	random graph;wireless sensor network;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;computer network	Theory	15.317776204404597	87.18169374595816	117182

The problem is formulated according to the recently proposed framework of Matrix Completion (MC), which asserts that a low rank matrix can be recovered from a small number of randomly sampled entries. The application of MC in WSN data is motivated by the assumption that sensory data exhibit intra-sensor correlations and that these data can be represented using known examples. We formulate the problem as that of recovering the low rank measurement matrix by encoding the contributions of known examples, the dictionary elements, for reconstructing and classifying the data. Experimental results using artificial data suggest that the proposed scheme is able to accurately reconstruct and classify the sensory data from a small number of measurements.	data recovery;dictionary;randomness;sampling (signal processing)	Grigorios Tsagkatakis;Panagiotis Tsakalides	2012	2012 IEEE 7th Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop (SAM)	10.1109/SAM.2012.6250443	signal reconstruction;linear network coding;wireless sensor network;computer science;noise measurement;noise;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining;mathematics;accuracy and precision;correlation;encoding;statistics	ML	16.068689710902362	80.1142894048815	117216

In this experimental study, we compare two types of model-based localization methods: transceiver-based localization, which locates objects using RSS from transmitters to receivers at known locations; and transceiver-free localization, which estimates location by using RSS changes on known-location nodes caused by objects. We evaluate their performance using three sets of experiments with different environmental conditions. Our performance analysis shows that transceiver-free localization methods are generally more accurate than transceiver-based localization methods for a wireless sensor network with high node density.	experiment;rss;transceiver;transmitter	Yang Zhao;Neal Patwari	2016	J.

One possible solution is to exploit data reported by nodes because they are in most cases correlated in time and space. In this paper, we define a novel binary integer linear program to resolve the problem of energy minimisation under data precision constraints (EMDP). This program helps us determine the most appropriate nodes and give each one of them a specific role in data collection based on data correlation. Given the complexity of EMDP, we propose a heuristic solution (CORAD) to structure the network topology into multi-hop reconfigurable clusters. Supported by numerical simulations, CORAD is shown to be an acceptable solution to the EMDP problem.

ada550f0d6effc8b7f7d6acf0efa022856f6b370	stochastic geometry analysis of ultra dense network and trsc green communication strategy		In recent years, with the rapid development of wireless communication, the traditional cellular with isomorphic and regular structure has been unable to meet the increasing number of users and business needs involving data of big volume. The trend is evolving into Ultra Dense Network (UDN) architecture which is covered by cellular of irregular complex structure. In UDN, the spatial distribution of the base station plays an important role in the interference and performance evaluation of the whole cellular network, and the concept of green communication has also been put on agenda. In this paper, stochastic geometry theory is used to model UDN and to analyze the key performance of interference and wireless network. Moreover, a green communication strategy called TRSC is proposed, which is aimed at saving energy and reducing the signal interference among cells to a certain extent.	business requirements;interference (communication);performance evaluation	Guoqiang Wang;Bai Sun	2017	ICST Trans.

In the range between 41 MHz and 910 MHz CR overlay-systems can be installed besides licensed radio services such as radio and TV broadcasting. In order to fulfill the regulative guidelines for interference limitations, adequate spectral sensing and user detection has to be supported by the CR terminals. The wide frequency range specified in IEEE 802.22 and the high dynamic range of signals in this band lead to high demands on the CR receiver's front-end. Especially the performance requirements on analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) increase significantly compared to current wireless systems. Based on measurements taken in the frequency range between 41 MHz and 910 MHz requirements to CR's ADCs are figured out. Furthermore, the measurement results are analyzed regarding expectable allocation scenarios and their impacts on spectral sensing. Derived from these results and a comparison of general spectral sensing mechanisms, an approach for a CR receiver enabling wide-band sensing is presented. By combining a-priori information resulting from scenario analysis with adapted information processing in the CR terminal, the ADC's performance requirements can be reduced.	analog-to-digital converter;cognitive radio;frequency band;high dynamic range;information processing;interference (communication);requirement;scenario analysis	Volker Blaschke;Tobias Renk;Friedrich Jondral	2008	ICC Workshops - 2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops	10.4236/wsn.2009.13018	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;radio receiver design;computer network	Visualization	22.1239854978963	80.43348562949306	117649

347d6ad90cf035328c00ab7acc334cc4a395e911	opp-relay: managing directionality and mobility issues of millimeter-wave via d2d communication		The directionality of millimeter-Wave (mm-Wave) communication results in challenging network dynamics and thus complex system design. A key problem with such networks is human blockage, which is highly detrimental since absorption at mm-Wave frequencies is extremely high. This poses a significant challenge for the state-of-the-art technologies in 5G networks such as Device-to-Device (D2D) communication. Essentially, the aforementioned dynamics hinder direct communication between devices. Existing protocols in the mm-Wave band such as IEEE 802.11ad address this problem using relays. However, the complexity relay discovery in these protocols grows linearly with the number of users, Hence, these approaches are infeasible for crowded areas such as malls or busy pedestrian streets. In this paper, we present a lightweight relaying mechanism called Opp-Relay that builds on the existing D2D features of the 3GPP standard to opportunistically discover an mm-Wave enabled relay. Specifically, we provide an algorithm to compute the optimal beamwidth for opportunistic discovery of a relay in dense and dynamic network environments. We validate our approach in practice using our experimental testbed operating in the 60 GHz band. Our experiments demonstrate that choosing a suitable beamwidth to discover and communicate with a relay node is crucial. Moreover, we show that our relaying mechanism significantly reduces the complexity of relay discovery.	algorithm;complex system;cross industry standard process for data mining;experiment;interference (communication);internet relay chat;mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);systems design;testbed	Gek Hong Sim;Arash Asadi;Adrian Loch;Matthias Hollick;Joerg Widmer	2017	2017 9th International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)	10.1109/COMSNETS.2017.7945370	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;communication	Mobile	20.642135005970232	80.78341599790046	117710
32a0ba68bcdfe00c91cb49861149f1dac41d7f74	tight complexity analysis of population protocols with cover times - the zebranet example	mobile agent networks;zebranet;worst case time complexity analysis;population protocols;cover times	Population protocols are a communication model for large sensor networks with resourcelimited anonymous mobile agents. The agents move asynchronously and communicate via pairwise interactions. The original fairness assumption of this model involves a high level of asynchrony and prevents evaluation of the convergence time of a protocol (via deterministic means). The introduction of some ‘‘partial synchrony’’ in the model, under the form of cover times, is an extension that allows evaluating the time complexities. In this paper, we take advantage of this extension and study a data collection protocol used in the ZebraNet project for thewild-life tracking of zebras in a reserve in central Kenya. In ZebraNet, sensors are attached to zebras. The sensed data can be exchanged between the sensors and is collected regularly by a mobile base station crossing the area. The data collection protocol of ZebraNet has been analyzed through simulations. Here, we present a purely analytical study using the model of population protocols with cover times. Our first result states that, in the original protocol, some data may never be delivered to the base station. Motivated by this drawback, we propose two modified and correct protocols which are then used as the paper case studies. We prove their correctness andwe compute their tight worst-case time complexities. This analysis introduces several techniques that may prove useful in future studies of time in population protocols. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To date there is not a single method concerning the calculation of the co-ordination area around the FSRs, which takes into account the mobility of the interfering stations. This paper addresses an in-depth analysis of the interference produced to the FSRs by the ESVs and proposes a new method for the development of the co-ordination area around the FSRs, taking into account parameters such as the velocity of the ESVs and their frequencies of passage from specific locations.

c7e9159daa94b5c31da2209fc85a5ecf3c010029	toward designing a li-fi-based hierarchical iot architecture		Current wireless communication technologies, such as wireless-fidelity (Wi-Fi) and Bluetooth, use radio waves as the basic medium in transferring information. Even though these technologies are widely spread, the need of exploring alternatives to transmit data wirelessly and more efficiently is a must. The reason behind that relies on the current limitations of the radio frequency (RF) band, which include overcrowding and interference with other RF applications. To explore alternatives, much research has been conducted to prove the possibility of using visible light as a wireless medium for transferring data. As a result, a new technology was presented by a German physicist Harald Haas, called light-fidelity (Li-Fi), which is a wireless technology that utilizes visible light as a communication medium instead of using the basic radio wave. Recently, Li-Fi technology has attracted the research community. Various studies have been conducted to improve the technology. However, there is still a noticeable need to support the research field due to the modernity of the technology. Hence, this paper presents an extensive survey of the previous studies and projects conducted on the technology, besides multiple leading companies working on the manufacture of Li-Fi-compatible products. In addition, a Li-Fi-based IoT architecture is proposed in this paper, which relies on the collection of data from multiple environments, where Li-Fi is installed.

19d1fccfe3cd47b0126ec96383fb83cd55243a01	mobile sink based fault diagnosis scheme for wireless sensor networks	endnotes;pubications	Network diagnosis in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is a difficult task due to their improvisational nature, invisibility of internal running status, and particularly since the network structure can frequently change due to link failure. To solve this problem, we propose a Mobile Sink (MS) based distributed fault diagnosis algorithm for WSNs. An MS, or mobile fault detector is usually a mobile robot or vehicle equipped with a wireless transceiver that performs the task of a mobile base station while also diagnosing the hardware and software status of deployed network sensors. Our MS mobile fault detector moves through the network area polling each static sensor node to diagnose the hardware and software status of nearby sensor nodes using only single hop communication. Therefore, the fault detection accuracy and functionality of the network is significantly increased. In order to maintain an excellent Quality of Service (QoS), we employ an optimal fault diagnosis tour planning algorithm. In addition to saving energy and time, the tour planning algorithm excludes faulty sensor nodes from the next diagnosis tour. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through simulation and real life experimental results.	automated planning and scheduling;fault detection and isolation;home automation;medical algorithm;mobile robot;quality of service;real life;scalability;self-organization;sensor node;simulation;testbed;transceiver;upload	Prasenjit Chanak;Indrajit Banerjee;Robert Simon Sherratt	2016	Journal of Systems and Software	10.1016/j.jss.2016.05.041	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;brooks–iyengar algorithm;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Robotics	11.154759111235894	77.21988779851645	118118

The lifetime is even more nondeterministic when sensors are also deployed randomly. The lifetime of such a network is influenced by node deployment, initial energy of sensors, packet generation model and the number of sensors. This work quantifies the effect of these parameters on the lifetime of randomly deployed event-driven networks. First, the lifetime of individual sensors are studied. Then, an analytical expression is obtained for the complementary cumulative density function of the network lifetime. Such an analysis can be used for choosing the network parameter and efficiently optimizing the network lifetime. The results of this work are obtained for both multi- hop and single-hop wireless sensor networks and are verified with computer simulation. The approaches of this paper are shown to be applicable to more general cases.	computer simulation;event-driven architecture;event-driven programming;network packet;nondeterministic algorithm;randomness;sensor;software deployment	Moslem Noori;Masoud Ardakani	2008	2008 5th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks	10.1109/SAHCN.2008.41	computer simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;statistics;computer network	Mobile	13.971579003973062	85.55730147434124	118120

290d3e2903f5d70874ab458247b75a40c2301308	statistical assessment of plc networking for front-hauling in small radio cells.		The employment of power lines for communications (PLC) has b een theorized almost a century ago; although the physical medium is not meant for data transmission, recent technical developments pushed the capacity boundary much higher than expected, allowing to consider PLC for new applications as t he one considered in this contribution, i.e., as a solution f or small cell back/front-hauling. In principle, back-hauling for c ellular networks via PLC is very attractive given how pervas i e the power line infrastructure is. Telecom operators are lookin g for solutions that can handle the traffic increase which is d oublying every year. This calls for improvements of both cellular sys tems and front-hauling technologies that have to bridge the radio network with the core network. Small cells are currently adv ocated as the solution to spatially fragment the network and offer high capacity in densely populated areas; this is also due to the availability of spectrum at high frequency (mmWave link s) which inherently offers large bandwidth but forces the cell s to become smaller due to the short distance coverage. There fore, it appears that mobile operators may eventually have to depl oy an order of magnitude more (small) cells compared to exist ing networks having macro cells. This translates in a high densi ty cellular network that poses more challenges for the backhaul.	backhaul (telecommunications);population;power-line communication;theory	Andrea M.

A constraint set, including both positive and negative constraints, is constructed to bound sensor position. By projecting the feasible region of this constraint set onto a 2D plane, the feasible scope of sensor position is computed to evaluate node position uncertainty. The projection result, called feasible geographic region (FGR), is approximated by its inner and outer polygon. The polygon approximation will converge to the actual FGR if we incrementally add more polygon vertices. A distributed algorithm is proposed to compute FGR. Finally, we study the impact of node position uncertainty upon a typical network application, target event detection. The feasible scope of target event position is computed even though the sensor position is not certain.	approximation algorithm;converge;distributed algorithm;feasible region;sensor	Zhen Feng;Wei Liu;Kanru Xu;Wenqing Cheng	2007	2007 IEEE Internatonal Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428648	embedded system;distributed algorithm;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;mathematics;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	15.06837460697873	75.17614073332804	118328

While several approaches have been proposed for localization, that is, position awareness without using GPS, most techniques are either centralized or rely on anchor nodes. In this paper, a decentralized localization method is developed, based upon self-organizing maps. The algorithm is implemented for different size networks and the simulation results show the algorithm is efficient when compared to single processor or centralized localization methods; further the approach does not require anchor nodes. An error analysis shows that the proposed approach is a feasible method for computing the localization of sensor networks using a distributed architecture.	algorithm;centralized computing;distributed computing;error analysis (mathematics);global positioning system;internationalization and localization;organizing (structure);self-organization;self-organizing map;simulation	Jie Hu;Gordon Lee	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems	10.1109/MFI.2008.4648079	computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Robotics	14.824813722489438	74.73807619236507	118489

Given a set Q of periodic aggregation queries, each query Qi ε Q has its own period pi and the subset of source nodes Sicontaining the data. We first propose a family of efficient and effective real-time scheduling protocols that can answer every job of each query task Qi ε Q within a relative delay O(pi) under resource constraints by addressing the following tightly coupled tasks: routing, transmission plan constructions, node activity scheduling, and packet scheduling. Based on our protocol design, we further propose schedulability test schemes to efficiently and effectively test whether, for a set of queries, each query job can be finished within a finite delay. Our theoretical analysis shows that our methods achieve at least a constant fraction of the maximum possible total utilization for query tasks, where the constant depends on wireless interference models. We also conduct extensive simulations to validate the proposed protocol and evaluate its practical performance. The simulations corroborate our theoretical analysis.	catastrophic interference;communications protocol;data aggregation;interference (communication);network packet;real-time clock;real-time operating system;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation	XiaoHua Xu;Xiang-Yang Li;Peng-Jun Wan;Shaojie Tang	2012	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2011.2166165	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	11.011367041172125	82.68816315939398	118575

Within the next decade applications will be developed demanding for data rates of several 10 s of Gbit/s. These data rates can be only achieved by either significantly improving spectral efficiencies or by extending the available spectrum to several 10 s of GHz. Such an amount of spectrum is available only beyond 300 GHz, which is called the Terahertz frequency range. In order to develop a system operating beyond 300 GHz at data rates with several 10 s of Gbit/s is a challenging task requiring an interdisciplinary approach incorporating areas like, propagation and channel modeling, antennas, RF transceiver design, appropriate baseband technologies, MAC protocols, etc. A couple of years ago activities in research, standardization and regulation have emerged.

cd4235fe314179bb2035af3aff81d29b9150b898	a survey of enabling technologies of low power and long range machine-to-machine communications		Low power and long range machine-to-machine (M2M) communication techniques are expected to provide ubiquitous connections for the wireless devices. In this paper, three major low power and long range M2M solutions are surveyed. The first type of solutions is referred to as the low power wide area (LPWA) network. The design of the LPWA techniques features low cost, low data rate, long communication range, and low power consumption. The second type of solutions is the IEEE 802.11ah which features higher data rates using a wider bandwidth than the LPWA-based solutions. The third type of solutions is operated under the cellular network infrastructure. Based on the analysis of the pros and cons of the enabling technologies of the surveyed M2M solutions, as well as the corresponding deployment strategies, the gaps in knowledge are identified. The paper also presents a summary of the research directions for improving the performance of the surveyed low power and long range M2M communication technologies.	compaq lte;data rate units;holism;machine to machine;modulation;next-generation network;semantic network;software deployment;uncompressed video;wireless access point	Hai Wang;Abraham O.

UWB technology has many benefits, including high-data rate, availability of low-cost transceivers, low-transmit power, and low interference. It operates with emission levels that are commensurate with common digital devices such as laptops, palm pilots, and pocket calculators. The approval of UWB technology made by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of the United States in 2002 reserves the unlicensed frequency band between 3.1 to 10.6 GHz (7.5 GHz) for indoor UWB wireless communication systems. Industrial standards such as IEEE 802.15.3a (high-data rate) and IEEE 802.15.4a (very low-data rate) have been introduced based on UWB technology. On the other hand, the Department of Defense (DoD) UWB systems are different from commercial systems in that jamming is a significant concern. Although R&D efforts in recent years have demonstrated that UWB radio is a promising solution for high-rate short-range, and moderate-range wireless communications and ranging, further extensive investigation, experimentation, and development are necessary towards developing effective and efficient UWB communication systems. In particular, UWB technology has found a new application for lower-data rate moderate-range wireless communications, illustrated by IEEE 802.15.4a and DoD systems with joint communication and ranging capabilities unique to UWB technology. Unlike the indoor environment in 802.15.3a (WPAN), the new environments for sensors, IEEE 802.15.4a, and DoD systems will be very different , ranging from dense foliage to dense urban obstructions. The application of UWB radio to low-cost, low-power sensors has promise. The centimeter accuracy in ranging and communications provides unique solutions to applications, including logistics, security applications, medical applications, control of home appliances, search-and-rescue, family communications and supervision of children, and military applications. Fundamental techniques and concepts of UWB radio have been included in many books. Some special issues in technical journals also collect scattered research papers. There seems to be a gap between the basic books and advanced special issues. In particular, with the rapid growth of UWB technology, we need a special session that systematically reviews the state-of-the-art and reports the latest development in some areas unique to UWB radio. We are fortunate to have eleven experts to realize our vision. This special session will be very timely and valuable for future development of UWB. It will thus be unique from the vehicular technology point of view, emphasizing both short-range and moderate-range applications such as WPAN and sensors and ad …	book;data rate units;frequency band;interference (communication);laptop;logistics;low-power broadcasting;point of view (computer hardware company);radio jamming;sensor;transceiver;ultra-wideband;uncompressed video	Robert Caiming Qiu;Robert A.

In this paper, a dual band Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) system embedded with glucose meter was developed by integrating a 920 MHz passive interrogator into the 2.45 GHz active tag to enable automatic patient detection, wireless data recording and monitoring in dense hospital environment with frequent usage. The real-time experimental results indicate that the developed embedded RFID system in the multihop wireless sensor network is able to maintain the integrity of the glucose data according to the identification of the patient until the data are successfully recorded to the remote host system. Design of Experiment method is performed to determine the factors that influenced the throughput performance of the system. Comparisons made between existing non-embedded RFID system and the proposed embedded RFID system. The three factors investigated were the packet length, number of hops and type of RFID. The statistical analysis showed that the packet length as the main factor influencing the throughput performance. The results showed that the larger packets increase the throughput, while the number of hops contributes more to the decreasing effect of the throughput compared to the implementation of embedded RFID system.

In particular, sensor nodes surrounding a fixed sink node have routinely suffered from concentrated network traffic so that their battery energy is rapidly exhausted. The lifetime of wireless sensor networks decreases due to the rapid power consumption of these sensor nodes. To address the problem, a mobile sink model has recently been chosen for traffic load distribution among sensor nodes. However, since a mobile sink continuously changes its location in sensor networks, it has a time limitation to communicate with each sensor node and unstable signal strength from each sensor node. Therefore, fair and stable data collection policy between a mobile sink and sensor nodes is necessary in this circumstance. In this paper, we propose a new scheduling policy to support fair and stable data collection for a mobile sink in wireless sensor networks. The proposed policy performs data collection scheduling based on the communication availability of data transmission between sensor nodes and a mobile sink.	scheduling (computing)	Youngtae Jo	2015	IJDSN	10.1155/2015/287935	embedded system;real-time computing;sensor node;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	10.12871266101216	81.01119493653945	119495

We formulate sensor selection as an optimization problem that aims to strike a balance between estimation accuracy and the number of selected sensors. To cope with sensor selection problems in large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs), we propose a fast centralized optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We further develop a low-complexity distributed version of the ADMM where each sensor makes a local sensor selection decision. The simulation results show that the proposed centralized and distributed algorithms activate the most informative sensors and yield very good tradeoff between the estimation performance and the cost of sensing and communication. For large scale sensor networks, the distributed ADMM algorithm is more efficient and has lower computational load per sensor node.	augmented lagrangian method;centralized computing;distributed algorithm;information;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;penalty method;selection algorithm;sensor node;simulation;sparse matrix	Xiaojun Yang;Ruixin Niu	2017	2017 20th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)	10.23919/ICIF.2017.8009755	wireless sensor network;distributed algorithm;computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;sensor node;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mathematical optimization;mobile wireless sensor network;soft sensor;optimization problem	Mobile	13.576231291151016	77.93119743163156	119501
3911a6492b5657913b95f1a3c7920521d03be7d1	tradeoff between sensing quality and network lifetime for heterogeneous target coverage using directional sensor nodes		Conventional researches on target coverage in directional sensor networks (DSNs) mainly focus to increase the network lifetime, overlooking the coverage quality of targets, especially they don’t consider the targets that have heterogeneous coverage requirements. Increasing sensing quality is of the utmost importance to ensure comfort living in smart cities. In this paper, we have designed a generalized framework, namely maximizing coverage quality with minimum number of sensors in DSN (MQMS-DSN) that has the ability to maximize the target coverage quality, or the network lifetime, or to make an efficient tradeoff in between the two following application demand. Using a probabilistic model for measuring the sensing coverage quality, we have developed optimal, suboptimal, and greedy solutions for MQMS problem. Empirical evaluations of the proposed MQMS systems have been carried out in network simulator version 3 (ns-3). The results show the effectiveness of the proposed systems compared with the state-of-the-art-works in terms of sensing quality and network lifetime.	cluster analysis;experiment;greedy algorithm;international conference on dependable systems and networks;network performance;precomputation;requirement;sensor;simulation;smart city;statistical model	Selina Sharmin;Fernaz Narin Nur;Md.

CR networks inevitably lead to complex and sophisticated interference scenarios. This has inspired our investigation on applying IC techniques to CR networks with a special focus on mitigating the internetwork interference. We have found that a CR receiver assisted by proper IC techniques can effectively combat interference from primary networks, given that the secondary signals have dissimilar characteristics to those of primary signals. In addition, various IC techniques have been found to be useful for CR transmitters to rigidly control their emission patterns and thereby mitigate the interference caused to primary systems.

Sensors in such systems are typically disposable and expected to last until their energy drains. Therefore, energy is a very scarce resource for such sensor systems and has to be managed wisely in order to extend the life of the sensors for the duration of a particular mission. In this paper, we present a novel approach for energy-aware management of sensor networks that maximizes the lifetime of the sensors while achieving acceptable performance for sensed data delivery. The approach is to dynamically set routes and arbitrate medium access in order to minimize energy consumption and maximize sensor life. The approach calls for network clustering and assigns a less-energy-constrained gateway node that acts as a cluster manager. Based on energy usage at every sensor node and changes in the mission and the environment, the gateway sets routes for sensor data, monitors latency throughout the cluster, and arbitrates medium access among sensors. We also describe a time-based Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol and discuss algorithms for assigning time slots for the communicating sensor nodes. Simulation results show an order of magnitude enhancement in the time to network partitioning, 11% enhancement in network lifetime predictability, and 14% enhancement in average energy consumed per packet.	access control;algorithm;approximation;buffer overflow;centralized computing;cluster analysis;cluster manager;computation;computer cluster;digital signal processor;end-to-end principle;network packet;network partition;operational amplifier;sensor node;signal processing;simulation;spectral leakage;throughput;transmitter	Mohamed F.

c7d9a0ba5fb20b4dc62bc4168225414ba00602fc	on exploiting spatial correlation for energy harvesting wireless sensor networks		Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a set of inexpensive densely deployed sensor nodes with limited functionalities and scarcity in energies. The observations of sensors are forwarded directly to the Base Station (BS). In densely deployed sensors, sensing data are likely to be highly correlated in space domain, which produces unfavorable redundant readings and wasting in energy. In this paper, we propose an Event Distortion-Based Node Selection (EDNS) algorithm which exploits spatial correlation for reducing inessential sensor nodes that have correlated readings for improving Energy-Efficiency (EE) with acceptable distortion level. Furthermore, we derive a theoretical framework of distortion function for single-hop communication model to observe the advantages from energy harvesting to the accuracy level. Furthermore, the trade-off between energy consumption and distortion level is investigated.	algorithm;die (integrated circuit);distortion;sensor;software deployment;vector quantization;vii	Ali Al-Qamaji;Baris Atakan	2017	2017 25th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2017.7960620	computer science;spatial correlation;wireless sensor network;energy harvesting;energy consumption;distortion;efficient energy use;real-time computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;base station	Mobile	10.943380052530728	79.43102676203043	119674
58be9a436faa1fdd21f604e184afa5469c18727e	unii-mac protocol: design and evaluation for 5g ultra-dense small cell networks operating in 5 ghz unlicensed spectrum		Abstract Ultra-densification and efficient spectrum utilization are key features for the next 5G wireless networks to address the well-known challenges of high capacity demands and mobile data traffic explosion. In this article, a physical layer and a medium access control (MAC) sublayer are presented for small cells to operate in the 5 GHz unlicensed national information infrastructure (UNII) band. The physical layer is based on filter bank multi-carrier modulation able to achieve better spectral efficiency and access flexibility. The MAC protocol is based on beacon-enabled superframe consisting of scheduled and contention access schemes. The proposed UNII-MAC design relies on a listen-before-talk procedure in order to comply with ETSI regulations and to fairly coexist with neighboring systems sharing the same band. The performance of the UNII-MAC is then evaluated in dense indoor/outdoor deployment scenarios under various parameters and traffic patterns. Moreover, the coexistence between UNII-MAC and WiFi systems is reported. Based on the obtained results, we provide recommendations for 5G small cell deployment in dense environments.

We provide a localization algorithm based on such edges and a necessary and sufficient localizability condition. We also investigate the relation between the proposed approach and trilateration, showing from both a theoretical and empirical perspective that shadow edge localization succeeds also when trilateration fails.	algorithm;internationalization and localization	Gabriele Oliva;Stefano Panzieri;Federica Pascucci;Roberto Setola	2015	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2015.2404253	database index;wireless sensor network;topology;trilateration;global positioning system;knowledge engineering;mathematics;distributed computing;geometry	Vision	14.840677830731341	74.9931206904541	119691

These algorithms are often called """"communication-efficient"""", """"geometric-monitoring"""", or """"local"""" algorithms. We jointly call them distributed convex thresholding algorithms, for reasons which will be explained in this work. Distributed convex thresholding algorithms have found their applications in domains in which bandwidth is a scarce resource, such as wireless sensor networks and peer-to-peer systems, or in scenarios in which data rapidly streams to the different processors but outcome of the predicate rarely changes. Common to all of these algorithms is the use of a data dependent criteria to determine when further messaging is required.  This work presents two very simple yet exceedingly general theorems from which the correctness of all distributed convex thresholding algorithms can be elicited, and demonstrates that for key examples. Because the theorems are general, they extend the range of predicates which can be computed in a communication efficient manner beyond what is currently known. Unlike the previous correction proofs given to these algorithms, the proofs of the theorems presented here do not depend on the communication infrastructure. So the correctness of any distributed convex thresholding algorithm is immediately extended from broadcast enabled networks or from cycle free networks to general networks. Inspecting existing algorithms in light of the new theorems reveals that they contain redundant requirements, which cause them to send messages when indeed none are needed."""	algorithm;central processing unit;correctness (computer science);peer-to-peer;predicate (mathematical logic);requirement;thresholding (image processing)	Ran Wolff	2015		10.1145/2767386.2767387	mathematical optimization;wireless sensor network;computer science;theoretical computer science;analysis of parallel algorithms;distributed computing;algorithm	Theory	11.762312628211937	76.5182197531518	120062

However, the detection performance of ESMSNs will decrease rapidly when the faults occur to the monitoring sensor nodes, which result from the node device itself and the harsh or hostile environment where they are deployed. The distributed Bayesian algorithm was proposed to correct some errors resulted from the sensor faults. But new errors were introduced while correcting errors. Therefore, it is necessary to do some further research on the distributed fault-tolerant detection for ESMSNs. We propose an improved distributed Bayesian algorithm for fault-tolerant detection in ESMSNs and investigate the performance of detecting and correcting such faults. Analysis and Simulation results show the proposed algorithm can perform better than the distributed Bayesian algorithm and the proposed algorithm can still obtain higher reduction in the average number of errors when the probability of the monitoring sensor node fault is high.	algorithm;fault tolerance	Yu Zhang;Hangsheng Zhao;Qiongli Liu	2011		10.1109/WCSP.2011.6096702	electronic engineering;real-time computing;engineering;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network	Robotics	15.236659970334733	78.00865649303559	120138

Our problem consists of maximizing the logarithm of sensing range of each sensor node as an approximation to the number of covered targets subject to energy constraint and reduction in the number of common covered targets. We assume the placement of sensors is known and the sensing range of each node is a continuous parameter. We used the dual decomposition technique to derive a distributed price-based algorithm, DDACOV, for each node to adjust its sensing range during iterations in which the targets are static. Simulation results show the convergence of sensing ranges and utility function towards optimal values in few iterations with near optimal energy consumption of nodes.

c343d694ffa7ec0a68a502c116b8c2bed679c97d	towards ubiquitous e-health: modeling of smartban hybrid mac under periodic and emergency traffic		The Smart Body Area Network (SmartBAN) is a recently proposed system for wireless body area networks (WBANs). Unlike widely-used WBANs that employ contention-based medium access control (MAC) protocols, the SmartBAN MAC specifies a joint time division multiple access (TDMA) and slotted ALOHA access framework. To date, a criterion for determining the time duration of different channel access phases remains unaddressed in current WBAN MAC designs. There is also a lack of understanding of how the duration of these timing periods impacts the SmartBAN's performance. In this paper, we derive closed-form analytical models for the uplink transmission delay, which is defined as the duration a data packet generated by a sensor has to wait prior to its uplink transmission. We adopt a flexible channel access mechanism considering the characteristics of two major traffic patterns in medical applications: periodic monitoring traffic and Poisson-distributed emergency traffic. Then, based on both analytical models and simulation of the MAC timing parameters, and in conjunction with the behavior of a typical SmartBAN in terms of delay and energy consumption with aggregated traffic load, we present our solution to determine different access periods of the SmartBAN MAC. With extensive simulations, the accuracy of the delay model is validated and a blocking state of the SmartBAN is discussed, where the delay and energy performance is degraded significantly due to the queuing at each sensor. The results obtained in this paper provide a first in understanding how timing parameters and the traffic features impact SmartBANs' delay and energy performance.	access control;blocking (computing);network packet;simulation;telecommunications link	Lihua Ruan;Maluge Pubuduni Imali Dias;Elaine Wong	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925818	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	10.433423224468928	85.74981098992795	120328

It is assumed that the total number of nodes to be deployed are fixed and the objective is to arrange the nodes in the form of clusters to obtain maximum coverage such that the end-to-end probability of making successful hops is greater than a threshold. The transmissions that originate from one cluster to another are modeled as discrete-time Markov chain and the transition probability matrix of the chain is derived. By invoking the Perron-Frobenius Theorem and studying its properties, it is shown that a smaller sized cluster of nodes provides the maximum coverage of the network if the path loss exponent is large and vice versa.	end-to-end principle;markov chain;quality of service;software deployment;stochastic matrix	Syed Ali Hassan	2013	2013 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium	10.1109/RWS.2013.6486742	telecommunications;markov blanket;mathematics;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	15.359686499359713	88.24278181609057	120361

Existing approaches either appeal to physical layer information or rely on extra wireless signals for high accuracy. In this paper, we revisit the received signal strength (RSS) fingerprint-based localization scheme and reveal crucial observations that act as the root causes of localization errors, yet are surprisingly overlooked or not adequately addressed in previous works. Specifically, we recognize access points’ (APs) diverse discrimination for fingerprinting a specific location, observe the RSS inconsistency caused by signal fluctuations and human body blockages, and uncover the transitional fingerprint problem on commodity smartphones. Inspired by these insights, we devise a discrimination factor to quantify different APs’ discrimination, incorporate robust regression to tolerate outlier measurements, and reassemble different normal fingerprints to cope with transitional fingerprints. Integrating these techniques in a unified system, we propose DorFin, i.e., a novel scheme of fingerprint generation, representation, and matching, which yields remarkable accuracy without incurring extra cost. Extensive experiments in three campus buildings demonstrate that DorFin  achieves a mean error of 2.5 m and, more importantly, decreases the 95th percentile error under 6.2 m, both significantly outperforming existing approaches.	experiment;fingerprint (computing);rss;smartphone;software deployment	Chenshu Wu;Zheng Yang;Zimu Zhou;Yunhao Liu;Mingyan Liu	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2630713	robustness (computer science);computer network;signal strength;robust regression;outlier;computer science	Mobile	20.487576646071766	76.2898919888695	120495

This has sparked an investigation of new and transformative wireless communication paradigms, including massive MIMO, full duplex and millimeter-wave wireless. These new wireless paradigms place requirements on the radio circuitry that are orders of magnitude more challenging than traditional systems, forcing us to rethink conventional radio design. Conventional analog and radio frequency circuit design has relied on linear, time-invariant (LTI) components and circuits. However, LTI components and circuits are restricted in the signal processing functionalities that can be implemented. Recently, there has been significant interest in linear, periodically time varying (LPTV) circuits that can enable new functionalities and components, such as highly-tunable, high quality integrated filters, front-ends with spatio-spectral filtering capability and integrated non-magnetic non-reciprocal components such as circulators and isolators.

Indeed, solutions such as tracking of goods in large areas or sensing in smart cities are now made possible. However, such solutions encounter two main issues, first is inherent to the technology itself which is readers collisions, the second one being the gathering of read data up to a base station, potentially in a multihop fashion. While the first one has been a main research subject in the late years, the next one has not been investigated for the sole purpose of RFID, but rather for wireless adhoc networks. This multihop tag information collection must be done in regards of the application requirements but it should also care for the deployment strategy of readers to take advantage of their relative positions, coverage, reading activity and deployment density to avoid interfering between tag reading and data forwarding. To the best of our knowledge, the issue for a joint scheduling between tag reading and forwarding has never been investigated so far in the literature, although important. In this paper, we propose two new distributed, crosslayer solutions meant for the reduction of collisions and better efficiency of the RFID system but also serve as a routing solution towards a base station. Simulations show high levels of throughput while not lowering on the fairness on medium access staying above 85% in the highest deployment density with up to 500 readers, also providing a 90% data rate.	best practice;design review (u.s. government);distributed algorithm;fairness measure;operand forwarding;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;requirement;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;smart city;software deployment;testbed;throughput;uncompressed video	Abdoul Aziz Mbacké;Nathalie Mitton;Hervé Rivano	2017	2017 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computed, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)	10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397537	wireless sensor network;scheduling (computing);throughput;computer science;distributed computing;data collection;computer network;software deployment;radio-frequency identification;resource allocation;base station	Mobile	10.279003914112197	83.34208052250688	120940

31ffbe945d30827e3d5b5d27c31c387b429b0ba0	enhancing wireless performance using reflectors		Signal decay is the fundamental problem of wireless communications, especially in an indoor environment where line-of-sight (LOS) paths for signal propagation are often blocked and various indoor objects exacerbate signal fading. There are three reasons for signal decay: long transmission distance, signal penetration, and reflection. In this paper, we propose OptRe which optimally places metallic reflectors — providing a highly reflective surface that can reflect impinging signals almost 100% — in indoor environments to reduce the reflection loss and enhance wireless transmissions. It enhances both WiFi signal and low-power IoT devices without changing their configurations or network protocols. To enable OptRe, we first develop an empirical signal propagation model that can accurately estimate the signal strength and adapt itself to the reflectors' location. Using micro-benchmarks, our empirical signal propagation model is shown to be more accurate than the other existing path loss models. We also optimally place reflectors to maximize the worst-case signal coverage within the target indoor areas. Our extensive experimental evaluation results have shown OptRe to enhance signal strength for different types of wireless signals by almost 2x.	best, worst and average case;communications protocol;ibm notes;line-of-sight (missile);low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;simulation;software propagation;throughput	Sihui Han;Kang G.

35c5a96d6dd345b216b3ab75835c7556efddaf90	unified fingerprinting/ranging localization in harsh environments		Context-awareness in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) relies mainly on the position of objects and humans. The provision of this positional information becomes challenging in the harsh environmental conditions where WSNs are commonly deployed. With an antagonistic philosophy of design, fingerprinting and ranging have emerged as the key technologies underpinning wireless localization in harsh environments. Fingerprinting primarily focuses on accurate estimation at the expense of exhaustive calibration. Ranging mainly pursues an easy-to-deploy solution at the expense of moderate performance. In this paper, we present a resilient framework for sustained localization based on accurate fingerprinting in critical areas and light ranging in noncritical spaces. Such framework is conceived from the Bayesian perspective that facilitates the specification of recursive algorithms for real-time operation. In comparison to conventional implementations, we assessed the proposed framework in an indoor scenario with measurements gathered by commercial devices.

In the current 5G research area, non-orthogonal multiple access has been proposed as a paradigm shift of physical layer technologies. Among all the existing non-orthogonal technologies, the recently proposed sparse code multiple access (SCMA) scheme is shown to achieve a better link level performance. In this paper, we extend the study by proposing an unified framework to analyze the energy efficiency of SCMA scheme and a low complexity decoding algorithm which is critical for prototyping. We show through simulation and prototype measurement results that SCMA scheme provides extra multiple access capability with reasonable complexity and energy consumption, and hence, can be regarded as an energy efficient approach for 5G wireless communication systems.	algorithm;neural coding;next-generation network;programming paradigm;prototype;requirement;simulation;sparse matrix;telecommunications link;telecommunications network;unified framework	Shunqing Zhang;Xiuqiang Xu;Lei Lu;Yiqun Wu;Gaoning He;Yan Chen	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037563	channel access method;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;multi-frequency time division multiple access;distributed computing;prototype;artificial neural network;wireless;computer network	Mobile	22.596442279797785	85.60346283786757	122571
5e501ac4645261e961988a0b8f5358f40ff88d65	approximate message passing based cooperative localization in wsn with aoa measurements		Cooperative localization (CL) based on the angle-of-arrival (AOA) measurements is a promising positioning technique for the wireless sensor network (WSN). This is because CL reaches high localization precision and robustness by exploiting the relative ranging measurements among the agents. In addition, the AOA interpretation involves no propagation parameters, and its acquisition does not require strict time-synchronization among the WSN nodes. In this paper, we firstly categorize the AOA-CL problem as a generalized linear-mixing problem under the phase-only measurements, and then resolve it by our developed phase-only generalized approximate message passing (POG-AMP) algorithm. The POG-AMP localizer is warm-started by developing an incremental localizer assisting by anchor-connectivity and region-boundary constraints. It calls for sparse matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) as its most complex operations, and can be implemented in a distributed manner. Therefore, it has low computational complexity, and is suitable for WSN hardware implementation. Simulation results validate the state-of-the-art performance and cooperation gains of the POG-AMP localizer.	angle of arrival;message passing	Yi Gong;Shengchu Wang;Lin Zhang	2018		10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377230	message passing;real-time computing;robustness (computer science);wireless sensor network;computational complexity theory;ranging;computer science	Robotics	16.89384551086616	75.62250153071666	122589

54305335312417f1635934e3b0d926910858c1f0	current challenges for visible light communications usage in vehicle applications: a survey		In the context of an increasing interest toward reducing the number of traffic accidents and of associated victims, communication-based vehicle safety applications have emerged as one of the best solutions to enhance road safety. In this area, visible light communications (VLC) have a great potential for applications due to their relatively simple design for basic functioning, efficiency, and large geographical distribution. This paper addresses the issues related to the VLC usage in vehicular communication applications, being the first extensive survey dedicated to this topic. Although VLC has been the focus of an intensive research during the last few years, the technology is still in its infancy and requires continuous efforts to overcome the current challenges, especially in outdoor applications, such as the automotive communications. This paper is aimed at providing an overview of several research directions that could transform VLC into a reliable component of the transportation infrastructure. The main challenges are identified and the status of the accomplishments in each direction is presented, helping one to understand what has been done, where the technology stands and what is still missing. The challenges for VLC usage in vehicle applications addressed by this survey are: 1) increasing the robustness to noise; 2) increasing the communication range; 3) enhancing mobility; 4) performing distance measurements and visible light positioning; 5) increasing data rate; 6) developing parallel VLC; and 7) developing heterogeneous dedicated short range communications and VLC networks. Addressing and solving these challenges lead to the perspective of fully demonstrating the high potential of VLC, and therefore, to enable the VLC usage in road safety applications. This paper also proposes several future research directions for the automotive VLC applications and offers a brief review on the associated standardization activities.	automatic gain control;bit error rate;consortium;design review (u.s. government);digital monetary trust;digital signal processing;diode;experiment;field-programmable gate array;frequency band;hoc (programming language);mimo;microwave;modulation;multilateration;multiplexing;oled;on-off keying;performance;rss;radio frequency;reconfigurable computing;requirement;run-length encoding;self-awareness;sensor;sentience;signal-to-noise ratio;solid-state lighting;telematics;uncompressed video;vlc media player;vehicle-to-vehicle;x.690	Alin-Mihai C&#x0103;ilean;Mihai Dimian	2017	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/COMST.2017.2706940	telecommunications	Mobile	21.67954060037949	84.11542242397837	122796

In this paper, we propose a joint energy supply and routing path selection algorithm to extend the network lifetime based on an initiative power supply. We develop a two-stage energy replenishment strategy to supplement the energy consumption of nodes as much as possible. Furthermore, the influence of charging factors on the selection of next-hop nodes in data routing is considered. The simulation results show that our algorithm effectively prolong the network lifetime, and different demands of network delay and energy consumption can be obtained by dynamically adjusting parameters.	coefficient;conceptualization (information science);conflict (psychology);data curation;digital curation;genetic selection;natural science disciplines;node - plant part;power (psychology);power supply;rechargeable battery;routing;selection algorithm;sensor;simulation	Liangrui Tang;Jinqi Cai;Jiangyu Yan;Zhenyu Zhou	2018		10.3390/s18061962	energy supply;wireless sensor network;engineering;electronic engineering;computer network	Mobile	10.227540982067548	80.67855579921782	122927
df4620e7b7bf96cf8fe0ed874a1bd9986630979d	performance of wireless-powered sensor transmission considering energy cost of sensing		Realistic modeling of energy consumption is crucial for accurate performance analysis of wireless-powered sensor nodes. In this paper, we analyze the performance of wireless-powered sensor transmissions taking into account both the energy cost of sensing and transmission. We consider a sensor that is harvesting energy from an ambient radio-frequency (RF) signal and using this energy to perform sensing and transmission. Since energy harvesting is time-varying in nature, it introduces a delay in the sensor transmissions. We study two delay-related metrics, one measuring how frequent the sensed information is updated at the sink and the other measuring the time taken from the sensing operation to successful transmission of sensed information. We analytically characterize the statistical behavior of both metrics and find an important tradeoff between them. In particular, our results illustrate that more frequent update of sensed information at the sink increases the time taken from the sensing operation to successful transmission of sensed information.

If several sensors transmit at the same time their transmissions collide at the receiver resulting in garbled messages and the need for re-transmission. This is highly undesirable since the sensor nodes are energy-constrained and the radio interface is known to be the most significant source of energy expenditure. Consequently, it is of paramount importance to design arbitration protocols that are highly efficient in stamping out collisions and are, at the same time, as lightweight as possible. The main contribution of this paper is to present a distributed probabilistic mechanism that aims to arbitrate between several competing requests by sensor nodes for the radio channel. Our mechanism is simple, energy-efficient and does not rely on the existence of unique sensor identifiers (IDs).	identifier;randomized algorithm;sensor	Shazirawati Mohd Puzi;Shaharuddin Salleh;Stephan Olariu	2010		10.1145/1971519.1971564	embedded system;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;wireless;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	11.808024072074849	82.96266706153436	123108

To conserve energy, a coverage maintenance protocol achieves desired coverage by activating only a subset of nodes, while allowing the others to sleep. Existing coverage maintenance protocols are often designed based on simplistic sensing models that do not capture the stochastic nature of distributed sensing. We propose a new sensing coverage model based on the distributed detection theory, which captures two important characteristics of sensor networks, i.e., probabilistic detection by individual sensors and data fusion among sensors. We then present three coverage maintenance protocols that can meet the specified event detection probability and false alarm rate. The centralized protocol only activates a small number of sensors, but introduces extremely long coverage configuration delay. The Se-Grid protocol reduces the configuration time by dividing the network into separate fusion groups, but increases the number of active sensors due to the lack of collaboration among sensors in different groups. In contrast, by coordinating overlapping fusion groups, the Co-Grid protocol can effectively reduce the number of active sensors and the coverage configuration time. The advantages of Co-Grid have been validated through simulations and benchmark results on Mica2 motes.	benchmark (computing);centralized computing;detection theory;grid computing;sensor;simulation	Guoliang Xing;Xiangmao Chang;Chenyang Lu;Jianping Wang;Ke Shen;Robert Pless;Joseph A.

The coverage problem is a fundamental issue in WSN, which mainly concerns with a fundamental question: How well a sensor field is observed by the deployed sensors? Mobility is exploited to improve area coverage in a kind of hybrid sensor networks. The main objective for using mobile sensor nodes is to heal coverage holes after the initial network deployment, when designing a hole healing algorithm, the following issues need to be addressed. First, how to decide the existence of a coverage hole and how to estimate the size of a hole. Second, what are the best target locations to relocate mobile nodes to repair coverage holes?

To improve the energy transfer efficiency in a large WPT system, this paper proposes an adaptively directional WPT (AD-WPT) scheme, where the power beacons (PBs) adapt the energy beamforming strategy to SNs' locations by concentrating the transmit power on the nearby SNs within the efficient charging radius. With the aid of stochastic geometry, we derive the closed-form expressions of the distribution metrics of the aggregate received power at a typical SN. We analyze the optimal charging radius that maximizes the average received power. It is shown that both the optimal charging radius and maximized average received power decrease with the increased density of the SNs and the energy beamwidth. Finally, we show that the optimal AD-WPT can significantly improve the energy transfer efficiency compared to the traditional omnidirectional WPT.	aggregate data;beamforming;omnidirectional treadmill;power supply;sensor	Lingjie Duan;Rui Zhang	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417795	transmitter power output;computer network;wireless sensor network;computer science;energy transfer;omnidirectional antenna;beamwidth;wireless power transfer;beamforming;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Mobile	11.441885766574678	80.44872906070486	123405

To this end, n sensors are deployed at random locations within the area. These sensors detect for the presence of a transmitter within their radio range rs using a binary sensing model, and their individual decisions are combined to estimate the available whitespace. The limiting behavior of the recovered whitespace as a function of n and rs is analyzed. It is shown that both the fraction of the available whitespace that the nodes fail to recover as well as their radio range optimally scale as log(n)/n as n gets large. The problem of minimizing the sum absolute error in transmitter localization is also analyzed, and the corresponding optimal scaling of the radio range and the necessary minimum transmitter separation is determined.	approximation error;geographic coordinate system;image scaling;multipath propagation;randomness;sensor;transmitter;with high probability	Rahul Vaze;Chandra Ramabhadra Murthy	2014	2014 Sixth International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)	10.1109/COMSNETS.2014.6734866	transmitter;telecommunications;sensor;electrical engineering	Mobile	18.310337609384515	75.5336567516672	123602

The nodes in a wireless network generally communicate with each other along the same wireless channel. Unfortunately, sharing among wireless channels decreases network performance due to radio interference, and also raises energy consumption due to packet retransmission when interference occurs. Many topology control algorithms have been proposed to solve these problems. One widely used strategy is the backbone method. Backbone algorithms aim to reduce the backbone size. However, poor performance may be explored if only few backbone nodes are selected. Therefore, several heuristic algorithms such as SBC have been proposed. However, these algorithms cannot efficiently eliminate redundant nodes, and dramatically decrease performance, especially in relatively sparse networks. This study proposes a novel heuristic-based backbone algorithm called SmartBone to choose proper backbone nodes from a network. SmartBone includes two major mechanisms. Flow-bottleneck preprocessing is adopted to find critical nodes, which act as backbone nodes to improve connectivity. Dynamic density cutback is adopted to reduce the number of redundant nodes depending on local area node density of network. SmartBone simultaneously considers the balance of network performance and energy savings. Significantly, the proposed algorithm has a 50% smaller backbone size than SBC, and improves the energy saving ratio from 25% using SBC to 40% using SmartBone. Moreover, SmartBone improves the packet delivery ratio from 40% to 90% when the density of sensor networks becomes relatively sparser.	algorithm;connected dominating set;design review (u.s. government);heuristic;interference (communication);internet backbone;network packet;network performance;network topology;preprocessor;retransmission (data networks);sparse matrix;topology control	Shun-Yu Chuang;Chien Chen	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.624	distributed algorithm;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;backbone network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	10.740410090509299	79.94559288333208	123768

The measured parameters are then used to estimate the transmitter location. These methods are sub-optimal since they are indirect and involve two separate estimation steps. We propose a technique that uses exactly the same data as the common methods but the estimation of location is based on maximum-likelihood and the location determination is direct. Although there are many stray parameters, including the attenuation coefficients and the signal waveform, the method requires only a two-dimensional search. Monte-Carlo simulations indicate that the accuracy is superior to angle-of-arrival, time-of arrival and their combination.	angle of arrival;coefficient;simulation;transmitter;waveform	Anthony J.

431d0601d2fc435d90d83f5d224d1b31bb0ff80f	energy-efficient anti-flocking control for mobile sensor networks on uneven terrains		Anti-flocking controlled mobile sensor networks (MSNs) have demonstrated impressive dynamic area coverage performances. Even though MSNs are often utilized in outdoor environments that consist of uneven terrains, existing anti-flocking control protocols are designed for flat terrain navigation. Thus, they tend to maneuver mobile sensory units along shortest paths between navigation goals in an area of interest. Even though navigating along shortest paths can be both time- and energy-efficient on flat terrains, such motions can often result in excessive energy consumptions on uneven terrains. This brief proposes an energy-efficient anti-flocking control protocol for MSNs based on a terrain adaptation force and a navigation goal selection method. The proposed control protocol encourages mobile sensory units to follow terrain contours whenever feasible. Test results show that the proposed control protocol is a promising energy-efficient solution for MSNs operating on uneven terrains.	acclimatization;flocking (behavior);mobile phone;motion;navigation;performance;protocols documentation;rest;short;shortest path problem;simulation;terrain rendering;unit	Nuwan Ganganath;Wanmai Yuan;Tyrone Lucius Fernando;Herbert Ho-Ching Iu;Chi-Tsun Cheng	2018	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2018.2822324	flocking (texture);wireless sensor network;electronic engineering;energy consumption;efficient energy use;terrain;mathematics;distributed computing;excessive energy	Robotics	12.493673017722429	75.93119217460566	123876

All those constraints would become stricter in applying to Body Sensor Network (BSN), which motivates scholars to develop more compact sensors with reasonable maintenance fees so as to carry by users or even embed into users' bodies. Under the constraints of size and cost, the battery size is strictly restricted accordingly. Thereupon power consumption becomes more and more essential to make BSN realistic. Therefore, we propose a novel architecture of BSN in this paper, which reduces the regular power consumption of BSN so that the device lifetime and network reliability can be significantly improved. The proposed architecture has following advantages: (1) it reduces redundant data transmissions without influencing the accuracy of the system. (2) By reducing unnecessary data transmissions and optimizing routing path, it simultaneously reduces the power consumption and prolongs the network lifetime. (3) It is feasible and highly applicable to many applications.	cluster analysis;constraint logic programming;event-driven programming;isoelastic utility;performance per watt;routing;sensor;tree (data structure)	Wei Kuang Lai;Mei-Tso Lin;Kai-Ting Yang	2013	2013 9th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing	10.1109/ICICS.2013.6782901	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	11.149752378059668	80.8917485486049	124617

An important question in such networks is to estimate the number of sensors required to achieve complete coverage of the desired region. The number of sensors required would depend upon the physical characteristics of the individual sensors as well as the nature of the target. In this paper, we address the problem of finding the critical density of sensors for complete coverage. We use an exposure-based model to find the number of sensors required to cover an area for given sensor and target characteristics. The accuracy of the results is established via simulations.

In these enclosures, walls, roofs and floors can generate reflections and refractions which conduce to constructive and destructive interferences due to the multipath effect. In this paper, we perform an analytical study based on the signal strength generated by an access point (AP) inside a building. When we analyze the evolution of the signal strength depending on the distance from the AP, we can see that two flat areas are generated. These areas allow us to move away the sensors from the AP, without reducing the signal level and the quality of the link. In addition, we analyze the interference level that two devices can generate. We have studied the four variants of the IEEE 802.11 technology. These results are compared with the theoretical distribution channels in order to know what should be followed to avoid interferences. Finally, taking as a starting point the measures provided in this paper and others performed in a previous study, we develop a method for estimating indoor signal strength that will help us determine the best position for indoor wireless sensors. Our method will allow saving 15% of sensors. This reduction in the number of sensors can provide us economic savings and energy savings, allowing us to prolong the network lifetime.	interference (communication);multipath propagation;reflection (computer graphics);sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless access point	Sandra Sendra;Jaime Lloret Mauri;Carlos Turro;Javier M.

Because the PS-LTE transceiver consumes power whenever it is active, it is the most efficient to leave the receiver off, and wake it up asynchronously only when needed. As an alternative to protocol-based duty-cycle control, an asynchronous wake-up scheme is designed for battery saving of PS-LTE devices. This type of PS-LTE phones with power saving protocol has an adaptive cycle control during u0027EMERGENCY-CALLu0027. This dedicated wake-up u0027EMERGENCY PS-LTE Phoneu0027 can continuously monitor the channel, listening for a wake-up signal from other nodes and activating the main receiver upon the detection of asynchronous wake-up protocol.

For that purpose, a method to build up a map of an unknown environment without a priori knowledge is necessary. However, as a map must be explored by multiple autonomous robots under the poor wireless communication environment such as inside a damaged building, it is not easy to design an efficient exploration algorithm. In this paper, we propose exploration algorithms by multiple robots based on the store-carry-forward scheme which is one of information sharing methods for the challenged communication environment. The numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms efficiently explore a map.	algorithm;autonomous robot;experiment;iterative deepening depth-first search;map;numerical analysis	Yuta Nakazono;Hiroyoshi Miwa	2010	2010 International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems	10.1109/INCOS.2010.31	robot;mobile robot;algorithm design;a priori and a posteriori;simulation;wireless sensor network;computer science;artificial intelligence;base station;distributed computing;motion planning;computer security;wireless;computer network	Robotics	13.337828571066774	75.41470535576053	125445

808b995dcdc5ae0e586943be358aa8cef307b0f8	a coverage monitoring algorithm based on learning automata for wireless sensor networks		To cover a set of targets with known locations within an area with limited or prohibited ground access using a wireless sensor network, one approach is to deploy the sensors remotely, from an aircraft. In this approach, the lack of precise sensor placement is compensated by redundant de-ployment of sensor nodes. This redundancy can also be used for extending the lifetime of the network, if a proper scheduling mechanism is available for scheduling the active and sleep times of sensor nodes in such a way that each node is in active mode only if it is required to. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheduling method based on learning automata and we called it LAML, in which each node is equipped with a learning automaton, which helps the node to select its proper state (active or sleep), at any given time. To study the performance of the proposed method, computer simulations are conducted. Results of these simulations show that the proposed scheduling method can better prolong the lifetime of the network in comparison to similar existing method.	algorithm;automaton;computer simulation;learning automata;scheduling (computing);scheme;sensor;set cover problem	Habib Mostafaei;Mehdi Esnaashari;Mohammad Reza Meybodi	2014	CoRR		embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	11.257172286897607	77.64857147873367	125767

Many approaches to maximize network lifetime have been proposed and each approach provides different levels of energy savings and are efficient in their own aspects. However, these proposed algorithms are not suitable for use in a hard network lifetime environment where participating sensors should be working till the strict network lifetime requirement. The predictability of the network lifetime plays an important role in supporting guaranteed network lifetime services. This can be provided through the schedulability test that complements the online operations of safe and critical sensor network systems. In this paper, we focus on the study of the predictability of the network lifetime to enable the High Energy First clustering algorithm (HEF) to work in a hard lifetime environment and present a schedulability test to verify whether HEF can make the set of sensors schedulable in terms of N-of-N and K-of-N alive nodes.

6428da356162f7d11f80c601cde73a37ff899774	robust detection of rogue signals in cooperative spectrum sensing		Cognitive radio networks can sense, detect, and monitor their surrounding radio frequency conditions including the interference and availability of a broad range of channels, followed by choosing the best possible channel for a given task. This is called Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and it is a key characteristic of cognitive radios that enable them to operate on unused licensed channels. However, increased flexibility and convenience often leads to greater security attack vectors. Since cognitive radio networks perceive their surrounding environment through the physical layer in order to make decisions, they become vulnerable to rogue signals. Depending on how rogue signals are used, they can achieve Primary User Emulation, Sensory Manipulation, or Rogue Signal Framing (RSF) attacks. Our work focuses on accurately detecting rogue signals to mitigate the damage of RSF attacks on trust-based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) protocols. We devised a community-detection clustering algorithm to distinguish between malicious/malfunctioning sensors and well-behaved sensors affected by rogue signals. Our rogue signal detection improves upon previous work through the use of dynamic clustering methods on a group of sensors based on the network’s size and density over a particular region. This gives the advantage of a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to handling networks that are sparse, dense, and disproportionate. Additionally, we ran extensive tests that demonstrated an upward of 6% to 40% improvement, depending on the scenario parameters, in detecting rogue signals.	algorithm;cascading style sheets;cluster analysis;cognitive radio;detection theory;fits;framing (social sciences);interference (communication);radio frequency;reasonable server faces;rogue;scalability;sensor;sparse matrix	David S.

With communication and mobility energy costs modeled, the problem is formulated into a nonlinear non-convex optimization problem, then reformulated into a convex optimization problem. The separable property of the system is then exploited by Lagrangian duality, and the solution is obtained by distributed saddle-point computations. Computer simulations showed that the proposed distributed algorithm can quickly converge to the optimal solution, and it also justifies the use of mobility for energy efficiency by showing its significant improvement to the network lifetime and relatively low cost in mobility. Furthermore, the proposed energy optimization framework can accommodate different mobile sensor network models.	augmented lagrangian method;computation;computer simulation;converge;convex optimization;distributed algorithm;distributed computing;duality (optimization);expectation–maximization algorithm;iterative method;mathematical optimization;mobile robot;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;routing;simulation	Shengwei Yu;C.

In this paper, we study the problem of collaborative charging decisions in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs). In these networks, multiple Wireless Charging Vehicles (WCVs) need to decide which of the requesting sensors to charge and in what order. Our approach is to convert the decision makers, i.e., WCVs, into game players for higher profit. With the use of Nash Equilibrium, our newly designed scheme, named Game Theoretical Collaborative Charging Scheduling (GTCCS), enables WCVs to make optimal charging decisions. Besides, the result of the game is Pareto-optimal by carefully designing the rules of this game. We introduce the game theory model in this paper and explain how it is played by WCVs, with the goal of increasing overall energy usage efficiency. Extensive simulations and lab/field experiments show that GTCCS is able to achieve a much higher energy usage efficiency and lower the number of dead nodes. The dynamic characteristics of the GTCCS scheme also allow us to introduce the two unique features to further improve system performance, i.e., dynamic warning threshold for WCVs and sacrifice-charge.

Many of these tasks are based on basic distributed operators such as consensus, which are carried out by sensor devices under limited energy supply. To cope with the energy constraints, this paper focuses on designing the network topology in order to maximize the network lifetime and reduce the energy consumption when applying graph filters. The problem is a complex combinatorial problem and in this work, we propose two efficient heuristic algorithms for solving it. We show by simulations that they provide good performance in terms of the network lifetime and the total energy consumption of the filtering process.	consensus (computer science);genetic algorithm;heuristic;network topology;polynomial;power supply;signal processing;simulation;software release life cycle;time complexity	Leila Ben Saad;Thilina Weerasinghe;Baltasar Beferull-Lozano	2017	2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081227	wireless sensor network;signal processing;filter (signal processing);energy supply;theoretical computer science;algorithm design;energy consumption;network topology;distributed computing;logical topology;computer science	Embedded	10.481766900099673	79.14677623638939	127266

We describe a low-complexity smart LED light bulb prototype that is based on existing consumer light bulbs and hence can be replicated with minimal effort. The protocol software employed for these smart light bulbs is consistent with earlier VLC protocols originally developed for communication between single LEDs. Using VLC with consumer light bulbs leads to improvements in communication range, field of view, and throughput compared to existing VLC communication systems based on single LEDs.

One of the key issues is to reliably find unused radio channels also in the situations when there is no a priori information about possible other users. In this paper, we propose using the two-dimensional localization algorithm based on double-thresholding with adjacent cluster combining (2-D LAD ACC) method for detecting free channels. It is low-complex, blind and able to operate in any frequency area. This paper applies the 2-D LAD ACC method for real-world channel measurement data for the first time. The indoor measurements at WLAN bands verify that the 2-D LAD ACC method is able to operate in the real-life situation.	acc (programming language);algorithm;cognitive radio;detection theory;least absolute deviations;multi-function printer;real life;sensor;thresholding (image processing)	Johanna Vartiainen;Janne J.

We propose a novel intelligent localization algorithm that uses variable range beacon signals generated by varying the transmission power of beacon nodes. The algorithm does not use any additional hardware resources for ranging and estimates position using only radio connectivity by passively listening to the beacon signals. The algorithm is distributed, so each sensor node determines its own position and communication overhead is avoided. As the beacon nodes do not always transmit at maximum power and no transmission power is used by unknown sensor nodes for localization, the proposed algorithm is energy efficient. It also provides control over localization granularity. Simulation results show that the algorithm provides good accuracy under varying radio conditions.	algorithm;internationalization and localization;maximum power transfer theorem;overhead (computing);sensor node;simulation	Muhammad Farooq-i-Azam;Qiang Ni;Ejaz A.

Therefore the study of geometrical relationship between nodes in wireless ad hoc networks is of fundamental importance in the network architecture design and performance evaluation. However, most previous works concentrated on the networks deployed in the two-dimensional region or in the infinite three-dimensional space, while in many cases wireless ad hoc networks are deployed in the finite three-dimensional space. In this paper, we analyze the geometrical characteristics of the three-dimensional wireless ad hoc network in a finite space in the framework of random graph and deduce an expression to calculate the distance probability distribution between network nodes that are independently and uniformly distributed in a finite cuboid space. Based on the theoretical result, we present somemeaningful results on the finite three-dimensional network performance, including the node degree and the max-flow capacity. Furthermore, we investigate some approximation properties of the distance probability distribution function derived in the paper.		Guansheng Li;Pingyi Fan;Kai Cai	2006	EURASIP J.

The position of an object can be obtained from range measurements based on wireless transmissions. Transmitting power allocation not only affects network lifetime and throughput, but also determines localization accuracy. The number of active transmitting nodes is also crucial since it is related to communication load and computation complexity. In this paper, we formulate the power optimization problem that provides the best localization accuracy under power constraints. We first prove the sparsity of the optimal power allocation, i.e., the optimal localization accuracy can be achieved by activating no more than (J) transmitting nodes in d-dimensional networks. Inspired by such sparsity, we derive the expressions of the optimal power allocation in 2-D networks. We also put forth a near-optimal algorithm for the power allocation problem with individual power constraints. Our results provide a theoretical basis for designing transmitting node selection and power allocation algorithms for network localization.	algorithm;computation;location-based service;mathematical optimization;memory management;optimization problem;sparse matrix;throughput;transmitter	Wenhan Dai;Yuan Shen;Moe Z.

It aims at selecting a minimum number of sensor nodes to cover the whole sensing region and maximizing the lifetime of the network. In this paper, we discuss the energy-efficient area coverage problem considering boundary effects in a new perspective, that is, transforming the area coverage problem to the target coverage problem and then achieving full area coverage by covering all the targets in the converted target coverage problem. Thus, the coverage of every point in the sensing region is transformed to the coverage of a fraction of targets. Two schemes for the converted target coverage are proposed, which can generate cover sets covering all the targets. The network constructed by sensor nodes in the cover set is proved to be connected. Compared with the previous algorithms, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can prolong the lifetime of the network.

It describes the adaptation of an existing analytical battery model to fit the constraints of the wireless sensors in terms of available resources, the algorithm complexity being reduced to O(n) in case of constant loads. The analytical battery model obtained is used together with another existing battery model to provide real time information about the remaining capacity of the battery, based on the electric current draw and elapsed time. The current consumption is estimated using application specific power profiles, thus the monitoring solution proposed does not imply additional hardware on a mote and can be used on each node of a WSN during network employment as a real time decision support.	algorithm;decision support system;sensor node	Anania Aron;Gabriel Girban;Mircea Popa	2012			key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Embedded	12.044933805962255	80.57261382557641	129012

In this paper, we first characterize the energy consumption of wireless sensor networks with adjustable transmission ranges through theoretical analysis. Based on this result, we propose a deployment strategy with T as the required minimum network lifetime. We come up with three interventions: (A) in order to achieve an evenly balanced energy consumption among all nodes, the node density in different areas of the network should be a continuous varying function of the distance from the sink; (B) if there are insufficient nodes to achieve a balanced energy consumption over the whole network, our proposed node deployment strategy can be used to achieve the required lifetime threshold T with minimum number of nodes; and (C) when there are sufficient nodes to ensure the network connectivity and coverage with the node density of @t, we design an algorithm to identify the optimal transmission radius r and the corresponding achievable maximum network lifetime. Our conclusions are verified by extensive simulation results.	software deployment	Anfeng Liu;Xin Jin;Guohua Cui;Zhigang Chen	2013	Inf.

However, this kind of multicast routing that only addresses the transmission radius coverage might not be able to meet the bandwidth requirement of the users. As a result, additional transmissions are required to incur more energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions that make existing algorithms not applicable to bandwidth constrained applications. In this paper, for the first time, we address the bandwidth aware minimum power multicast routing problem in wireless networks where the objective function is to minimize the total power consumption subject to the users’ bandwidth requirements. This problem is a challenging cross-layer design problem that requires seamless and sophisticated integrated design in the network layer (multicast routing) and physical layer (bandwidth-aware wireless transmission and power control). We first formulate this problem as a mixed integer linear programming problem and then propose a Lagrangian relaxation based algorithm to solve this problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach is a sound green networking algorithm that outperforms the existing power efficient multicast routing approaches under all tested cases, especially in large bandwidth request, fine radius granularity, large group size and sparse network.	algorithm;computation;dijkstra's algorithm;experiment;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;lagrange multiplier;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;loss function;mathematical optimization;mobile phone;multicast;numerical method;optimization problem;population;quality of service;randomness;requirement;routing;seamless3d;shortest path problem;sparse matrix	Hong-Hsu Yen;Steven S.

6e9b31d546ede1aea634c832e389b630a10d84ad	analytical approach to base station sleep mode power consumption and sleep depth		In this paper, we present an analytical framework to model the sleep mode power consumption of a base station (BS) as a function of its sleep depth. The sleep depth is made up of the BS deactivation latency, actual sleep period and activation latency. Numerical results demonstrate a close match between our proposed approach and the actual sleep mode power consumption for selected BS types. As an application of our proposed approach, we analyze the optimal sleep depth of a BS, taking into consideration the increased power consumption during BS activation, which exceeds its no-load power consumption. We also consider the power consumed during BS deactivation, which also exceeds the power consumed when the actual sleep level is attained. From the results, we can observe that the average total power consumption of a BS monotonically decreases with the sleep depth as long as the ratio between the actual sleep period and the transition latency (deactivation plus reactivation latency) exceeds a certain threshold.	bs 7799;curve fitting;expectation propagation;sleep mode;uptime	Oluwakayode Onireti;Abdelrahim Mohamed;Haris Pervaiz;Muhammad Imran	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292518	real-time computing;latency (engineering);computer network;computer science;sleep mode;base station	Embedded	14.182037976041144	84.50247736078822	129509

Motivated by the fact that optimisation problems in WSNs can often be formulated as Markov random field (MRF) energy minimisation, a general MRF-based framework for the design of distributed WSN algorithms was proposed recently. Building upon this framework and the theory of dual decomposition, we develop a novel WSN optimisation algorithm that is applicable to a wide variety of network problems such as routing and power control. Our algorithm is completely distributed and is characterised by simple, deterministic and identical per-node processing. Routing of control information through the network is avoided as nodes exclusively process information from their local neighbourhoods. We apply our algorithm to a multiple access resource allocation problem and demonstrate rapid convergence to the global optimum.	algorithm;complexity;distributed algorithm;global optimization;lagrangian relaxation;markov chain;markov random field;mathematical optimization;reference frame (video);routing;tree decomposition	André Pollok;Sylvie Perreau	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5963078	distributed algorithm;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	13.638865924864827	80.82934105963957	129573

However, some coverage holes still remain after the execution of the schemes.

We prove that the proposed topology is planar, which guarantees packet delivery if a certain localized routing method is used; it is power efficient for unicast-- the energy needed to connect any pair of nodes is within a small constant factor of the minimum under a common power attenuation model; it is efficient for broadcast: the energy consumption for broadcasting data on top of it is asymptotically the best compared with structures constructed locally; it has a constant bounded logical degree, which will potentially reduce interference and signal contention. We further prove that the average physical degree of all nodes is bounded by a small constant. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first communication-efficient distributed algorithm to achieve all these properties. Previously, only a centralized algorithm was reported in [3]. Moreover, by assuming that the ID and position of every node can be represented in O(log n) bits for a wireless network of n nodes, our method uses at most 13n messages, where each message is of O(log n) bits. We also show that this structure can be efficiently updated for dynamical network environment. Our theoretical results are corroborated in the simulations.	centralized computing;distributed algorithm;dynamical system;interference (communication);network packet;routing;simulation;topology control;unicast	Xiang-Yang Li;Wen-Zhan Song;Weizhao Wang	2005		10.1145/1080829.1080831	wireless ad hoc network;distributed algorithm;broadcast communication network;electrical efficiency;telecommunications;computer science;graph theory;wireless network;distributed computing;interference;efficient energy use;computer network;unicast	Mobile	13.700543380668663	86.18815195450213	129650

For MQAM and MPSK, pulse shaping is considered. Both trans- mitted signal power and circuit power are taken into account where the former is modeled using the relationship between cutoff rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the latter is modeled considering the power consumption of typical hardware used in wireless sensor nodes. For each modulation type, the optimum parameters for minimizing the energy per information bit are derived. Moreover, a comparison among the three modulation types is presented. I.

We focus on a medical context, where the existing works generally provide large environments to monitor patients using sensors as simple transducers. Those devices forward sensed health parameters to a main base station. This station collects received data and may perform some computations. In this paper, we perform some distributed tasks on the sensors. We propose a distributed algorithm, which allows to raise alarms under some initial rules to alert efficiently medical staff in case of critical situations without needless warnings. Each mote monitors a parameter. When this parameter reaches an abnormal value, the mote communicates with other motes in order to check if it is a ‘local’ anomaly or if the patient is in an abnormal situation. In such cases an alarm is raised. We implemented our algorithm over a network of micaZ sensors running under TinyOS. The obtained results show promising perspectives.

19774e9a57cd928386c01e67237b67d645b1daf5	mitigating lateral interference: adaptive beam switching for robust millimeter-wave networks		"""Putting into practice """"pseudo-wire"""" links in wireless millimeter-wave (mm-wave) networks is challenging due to the significant side lobes of consumer-grade phased antenna arrays. Nodes should steer their beams such that they maximize the signal gain but also minimize interference from lateral directions via both their main lobe and their side lobes. Most importantly, interference can be caused by parallel operation of incompatible standards such as WiGig and IEEE 802.11ad and may change very fast. This timing requirement, prevents the use of existing beam switching solutions to mitigate interference. In this paper, we present an adaptive beam switching (ABS) mechanism that can deal with the above timescale issue in rapidly changing interference scenarios. Instead of performing a full beam sweep, the key idea is to only probe beampatterns at the receiver which are likely to avoid interference. In contrast to earlier work, our mechanism does not require any location information nor a detailed shape of the beampatterns. We exploit similarities among side lobes of beampatterns to estimate the performance of all beampatterns without sending extensive probes.

The data is useful for end-users, researchers, and Mobile Network Operators, but unfortunately the applications' accuracy are rarely verified. In this paper we verify the crowdsourcing Android application NetMap's ability to measure LTE Reference Signal Received Power by analyzing the Root Mean Squared Error, being 2-3 dB, and cross-correlation coefficient, being above 0.8, with measurements obtained by use of a professional radio network scanner and measurement phones. In addition, the application is applicable, but less accurate, for 3G Received Signal Code Power measurements. The studies are made for various device speeds and in different scenarios including indoor, urban, and highway, where the NetMap application is showed to perform well.	android;application programming interface;coefficient;compaq lte;cross-correlation;crowdsourcing;mean squared error;modulation;smartphone;throughput;tracing (software)	Mads Lauridsen;Ignacio Rodriguez;Lars Moller Mikkelsen;Lucas Chavarria;Preben E.

This issue becomes even more significant in heterogeneous networks where lower power nodes (such as pico-cell and/or femto-cell) are deployed within a macro-cell’s coverage. In this paper, we investigate interference coordination techniques in different scenarios. For homogeneous networks, we study single-cell multiuser MIMO for the purpose of intra-cell interference coordination and coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission for the purpose of inter-cell interference mitigation. For multi-userMIMO systems, we will discuss multi-userMIMO proportional-fair scheduling as well as multi-user precoding schemes. For CoMP transmission, we will focus on CoMP joint transmission and discuss the situations where CoMP could provide performance gains over single-cell operations. For heterogeneous networks, we investigate two specific inter-cell interference coordination techniques: time-domain solutions and power setting schemes. Furthermore, the potential extension of various CoMP schemes to heterogeneous networks will also be discussed.

However, the role of mobile nodes in a network has not been fully explored. This paper shows that introducing mobility increases the rate of convergence in partially connected and disconnected WSN. It also shows that selection of mobile nodes influences the rate of convergence. The mobile node selection scheme presented here takes advantage of the fact that some nodes are more “central” and “critical” than others and selecting them as mobile nodes can help reach consensus faster. By representing WSN as an undirected graph and analyzing various properties of the nodes, including centrality and position, a simple and effective strategy to select mobile nodes has been presented. Simulation results verify that introducing mobility coupled with an appropriate selection of mobile nodes leads to faster convergence.	centrality;graph (discrete mathematics);rate of convergence;simulation	Roya Norouzi Kandalan;Ramanpreet Singh;Kamesh Namuduri;Murali R.

Based on the model, two cooperative wireless sensor network schemes, namely, MIMO approach and SISO (single-in-single-out) approach are compared. It is shown that the overall energy consumption in the systems is related to not only the transmission range but also the correlation among the raw sensor data, and can be solved as a nonlinear programming problem. Furthermore, a critical value above which MIMO approach outperforms SISO approach is analyzed. Simulation results show that jointly considering both data aggregation and cooperative MIMO techniques further reduce the total energy consumption and thus prolong the network lifetime.	cooperative mimo;data aggregation;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;optimization problem;point-to-point protocol;simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder	Yi Gai;Lin Zhang;Xiuming Shan	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.151	3g mimo;multi-user mimo;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;nonlinear programming;computer science;spatial multiplexing;computer network	Mobile	13.035457858089094	81.45467447033796	131230

The optimal number of aggregators with generalized compression and power-consumption models was derived, and fully distributed algorithms for aggregator selection were presented.

In such a system, it is not uncommon that multiple concurrent radio communications among RFID readers and tags cause serious inference (called collision in the RFID field). One important kind of method to achieve collision-free communication is to activate RFID readers in different time slots. Existing activation approaches for solving this problem are mainly centralized, which is impractical due to the lack of central server, one-point failure risk, and performance bottleneck. Some distributed algorithms are proposed recently, but failed to consider the adaptiveness of the identification, where all of the RFID readers need to participate in the coordination control even if they do not have communication requirements any more. As a result, the optimal identification performance cannot be achieved. In this paper, we propose an adaptive distributed reader activation approach called ADRA for large-scale RFID systems. We build a fine-grained conflict graph for different kinds of collisions. And then a shared permission based distributed approach is adopted to eliminate those collisions. We guarantee that the RFID readers that do not need to communicate any more are suspended and excluded from the execution of coordination eventually. Extensive simulation results show that our approach outperforms existing approaches in terms of execution time and message overhead.	centralized computing;distributed algorithm;graph (discrete mathematics);overhead (computing);radio-frequency identification;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);serializability;server (computing);simulation	Weiping Zhu;Yi Hong;Vaskar Raychoudhury;Run Zhao	2015	2015 IEEE 12th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MASS.2015.11	radio-frequency identification;embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;adaptive system;operating system;distributed computing;interference;world wide web;server;computer network	Mobile	11.866474484931063	83.68864049437326	131865

This algorithm followed the two-dimensional position distribution, designed the minimum communication radius, and formed a reasonable network connectivity firstly. Then, the algorithm corrected the distance between the beacon node and its neighbour node to form a more accurate jump distance so that the shortest path can be optimized. Finally, we theorized the proposed localization algorithm and verified it in simulation experiments, including same communication radius, different communication radii, and different node densities in same communication radius, and have compared the localization error and localization accuracy, respectively, between the proposed algorithm and the DV-Hop localization algorithm. The experiment’s result shows that the proposed localization algorithm have reduced the localization’s average error and improved the localization’s accuracy.

The extreme energy, processing power and memory capacity limitation of nano-scale devices and the peculiarities of high operating frequency introduce the requirement to design novel communication paradigm and light MAC protocols for WNSNs. In this paper, we present a new Energy Efficient Wireless Nano Sensor Network MAC protocol (EEWNSN-MAC) for mobile multi-hop wireless nanonetworks. The proposed protocol takes advantage of the clustering mechanism and TDMA scheduling scheme to alleviate the mobility effects and transmission collisions. We evaluate performance of the EEWNSN-MAC protocol compared with a similar previously proposed nano-MAC protocol called “Smart-MAC”. For this purpose, we utilize a new NS-3 simulator module named nano-sim. This evaluation is done for three critical metrics in WNSN, namely, the total energy that is consumed per sent/received packet on the network, the packet loss ratio (PLR) and scalability. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the EEWNSN-MAC protocol improves the network performance in terms of energy consumption and PLR and it is more scalable compared to the “Smart-MAC” algorithm.	list of wireless mice with nano receivers	Negar Rikhtegar;Manijeh Keshtgari;Zahra Ronaghi	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-017-4517-4	wireless sensor network;computer science;computer network;scalability;packet loss;wireless;network performance;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;network packet;time division multiple access	Mobile	10.135617451639025	87.2356852636692	132241

Unlike conventional harvesting methods that rely on ambient variables, EFEH provides more reliable and durable operation as it is operable with any voltage-applied conductive material. Therefore, it is better suited for advanced throughput and applications requiring a certain QoS. In this article, we introduce this newly emerging WSN paradigm, and focus on enabling EFEH technology for smart grid architectures, such as home, building, and near area networks, where the field intensity is relatively low. To this end, a practical methodology and a general use implementation framework have been developed for low-voltage applications by regarding compelling design issues and challenging source scarcity. The proposed double-layer harvester model is experimentally evaluated. Its performance in terms of implementation flexibility, sensor lifetime, and communication throughput is investigated. In addition, current challenges, open issues, and future research directions are discussed for the design of more enhanced EFEH wireless networks.	energy level;experiment;operability;programming paradigm;throughput	Oktay Cetinkaya;Özgür B.

Due to hardware limitations, wireless sniffers typically can only collect information on one channel at a time. Thus, it is important to determine the optimal channel allocation of sniffer nodes to maximize the information collected. In this paper, we propose a Gibbs sampler approach for optimal distributed monitoring of multi-channel wireless networks with provable convergence.

We are interested in scenarios where nodes generate messages (which are related to the sensor measurements) that can be graded with some importance value. Less important messages can be censored in order to save energy for later communications. The problem is modeled using a joint Markov Decision Process of the whole network dynamics, and a theoretically optimal censoring policy, which maximizes a long-term reward, is found. Though the optimal censoring rules are computationally prohibitive, our analysis suggests that, under some conditions, they can be approximated by a finite collection of constant-threshold rules. A centralized algorithm for the computation of these thresholds is proposed. The experimental simulations show that cooperative censoring policies are energy-efficient, and outperform other non-cooperative schemes.	censoring (statistics)	Jesus Fernandez-Bes;Rocio Arroyo-Valles;Jesús Cid-Sueiro	2015	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2015.02.003	embedded system;wireless sensor network;computer science;data mining;censoring	Mobile	14.519240561686575	81.66130902255189	132854
9d1ad4a6f6bacb72bd82151349f2ad81eb4a44eb	evolutionary task allocation in internet of things-based application domains		Internet of Things (IoT) is an environment that contains different embedded devices interacting with each other to perform tasks related to information collection, communications and processing. Successful applications of IoT aim to interconnect objects with various capabilities within the same heterogeneous network. The goal is to allow network entities to cooperate and make their resources available in order to perform the demanded task. However, assigning tasks to group of heterogeneous objects that are equipped with limited resources poses a challenging task. The most limited and valuable resource for variety of IoT objects is battery power. Therefore, minimizing the energy consumption in task allocation process is one of the primary objectives. Currently, almost all existing studies employ heuristic optimizations to cope with different aspects of task allocation problems without considering different energy levels of network entities. In this paper, we address the problem of task allocation in IoT applications. We model the problem as a single objective optimization problem with the main goal to minimize the energy consumption. First, we propose two protocols with different objective models to minimize the energy expenditures. Then, considering the different energy levels of network entities, we inject heterogeneity-aware heuristics into these protocols to maintain well balanced energy consumption. Thus, we develop two more protocols to maximize the stability periods, viz., to prolong the time interval before the death of the first virtual object in each task group. We extensively evaluate the proposed protocols using different measurements and benchmarking parameters and compare them with the most relevant algorithm in the literature.

e8925a3cb16f71017ca0a805e9cd7d5349dad15a	effective network area for efficient simulation of finite area wireless networks		A wide-spread approach for modeling and for the performance evaluation of wireless networks is employing Poisson point processes (PPPs). There, the general assumption is that an infinite number of nodes is distributed in the network environment. This is not problematic in a purely analytic framework, but is unfeasible when Monte-Carlo system level simulations are employed for network evaluation. In order to obtain results in a finite simulation-duration, the simulation area also has to be finite, which leads to a deviation of performance results when compared to analytical approach with infinitely many base stations. This deviation however is only small when the simulation area is sufficiently large. In this paper we discuss which part of the simulation area yields results whose deviation from the analytical results does not exceed a predefined threshold. We present an approximation that is based on the base station geometry and depends on the base station density. Additionally, we discuss the relationship of the minimal simulation area (the smallest area that allows to obtain reliable coverage results) and the reduced simulation overhead by increasing the simulation area.	approximation;bone structure of radius;depth perception;distance;kasparov's gambit;monte carlo method;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;simulation	Mehdi Fereydooni;Martin Klaus M&#x00DC;ller;Markus Rupp	2018	2018 26th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.23919/EUSIPCO.2018.8553111		EDA	14.71921840919151	87.23506929390783	133242

This includes energy estimation and information compilation so that energy consumption values provide information to the designer to identify energy leakages or to compare different architectures and algorithms. To achieve that, every consuming energy process is considered from different points of view simultaneously: the ordinary hardware perspective, in which energy is associated with the hardware component that consumed it, the transaction perspective, where all consumed energy concerning one whole end-to-end transaction are compiled together, and the activity perspective, in which all the energy consumed in the same kind of activity is grouped. As a result, the programmer gets information not only about where and when energy is consumed, but also the reason and the real purpose of energy consumption. 1		Javier Moreno Molina;Jan Haase;Christoph Grimm	2010			electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Mobile	11.68228538043329	83.72937914347533	133611

Focused research and standardization work have been addressing the corresponding challenges from the radio perspective while employing advanced features, such as network densification, massive multiple-input-multiple-output antennae, coordinated multi-point processing, inter-cell interference mitigation techniques, carrier aggregation, and new spectrum exploration. Nevertheless, a new bottleneck has emerged: the backhaul. The ultra-dense and heavy traffic cells should be connected to the core network through the backhaul, often with extreme requirements in terms of capacity, latency, availability, energy, and cost efficiency. This pioneering survey explains the 5G backhaul paradigm, presents a critical analysis of legacy, cutting-edge solutions, and new trends in backhauling, and proposes a novel consolidated 5G backhaul framework. A new joint radio access and backhaul perspective is proposed for the evaluation of backhaul technologies which reinforces the belief that no single solution can solve the holistic 5G backhaul problem. This paper also reveals hidden advantages and shortcomings of backhaul solutions, which are not evident when backhaul technologies are inspected as an independent part of the 5G network. This survey is key in identifying essential catalysts that are believed to jointly pave the way to solving the beyond-2020 backhauling challenge. Lessons learned, unsolved challenges, and a new consolidated 5G backhaul vision are thus presented.	backhaul (telecommunications);cost efficiency;holism;interference (communication);internet of things;programming paradigm;requirement	Mona Jaber;Muhammad Ali Imran;Rahim Tafazolli;Anvar Tukmanov	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2556011	market research;cellular network;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;software-defined radio;computer security;internet of things;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	22.276389020081613	86.84037260461044	133658
b620efe577a89e987a25b865122a4a78149d4c01	a novel ultra-wideband-based localization and tracking scheme with channel classification		Ultra-wideband (UWB) has been widely used in accurate indoor localization in recent years due to its high-resolution ranging and strong through-wall propagation. However, typical localization and tracking schemes based on UWB are challenged by ranging error caused by non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, which can result in large localization error. With the purpose of reducing the localization error, in this paper, we propose a novel UWB-based localization and tracking scheme with channel classification which utilizes the multipath information. Simulation results indicate that compared with typical classification methods, the proposed channel classification method can reduce the probability of misclassification efficiently. In addition, in contrast to conventional localization and tracking algorithms, the presented algorithm lowers the localization error caused by NLOS propagation effectively.	algorithm;image resolution;line-of-sight (missile);multipath propagation;simulation;software propagation;ultra-wideband;virtual appliance	Zhongling Liu;Ming Yang;Chaojie Xu;Huiye Qiu	2017	2017 IEEE 85th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108341	multipath propagation;support vector machine;electronic engineering;computer science;ultra-wideband;non-line-of-sight propagation;ranging;server;communication channel	Mobile	20.357015836385727	75.34609223224156	133879
695b96dc64f8babc79619c60d6b118b8a447a7b1	positioning of uavs for throughput maximization in software-defined disaster area uav communication networks		The throughput of a communication system depends on the data traffic load and the available capacity to support that load. In an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based communication system, the UAV position is one of the major factor affecting the capacity available to the flows (data sessions) being served. This paper proposes a centralized algorithm for positioning UAVs to maximize the throughput of a software-defined disaster area UAV communication network. The software-defined networking controller maintains upto date information about the network topology as well as the data rate demands and paths of the flows. The proposed algorithm utilizes this information to determine the positions for the UAVs such that the total throughput is maximized. The algorithm was simulated using MATLAB. The results showed that an average throughput improvement of 26% can be achieved by optimally positioning the UAVs.	aerial photography;centralized computing;data rate units;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;iteration;matlab;maximum throughput scheduling;network topology;software deployment;software-defined networking;tabu search;telecommunications network;throughput;unmanned aerial vehicle	Shams ur Rahman;Geon-Hwan Kim;You-Ze Cho;Ajmal Khan	2018	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2018.000070	real-time computing;computer science;throughput;computer network;control theory;telecommunications network;communications system;software;network topology;signal-to-noise ratio;maximization	Mobile	18.241585728836583	86.86865879364335	134162

We consider two very different schemes of estimation: progressive estimation and consensus estimation. Progressive estimation is designed for networks about which a central planner knows a routing tree and all channel state information. Consensus estimation is commonly known for more dynamic networks. In this paper, we develop energy planning algorithms to minimize the transmission energy cost for both schemes, and compare their energy costs. This study shows that the total energy cost for consensus estimation can be much higher than that for progressive estimation, but the peak energy for the former is less than that for the latter.	algorithm;channel state information;kernel density estimation;motion estimation;routing	Yi Huang;Yingbo Hua	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5496280	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	15.280400229162904	76.33988298876827	134409

However, in strongly constrained environments such as city centers, the definition of quality metrics and the assessment of positioning performances are challenges to be addressed. Due to the variability of different urban scenarios, the modeling of the dynamics as well as the architecture of the positioning platform, which might embed other sensors and aiding means to the GNSS unit, make it hard to define unambiguous positioning metrics. Performance assessment through analytical models and simulators can be ineffective in terms of cost, complexity, and general validity and scalability of the results. This paper shows how a record and replay approach can be an efficient solution to grant fidelity to a realistic scenario. This work discusses advantages and disadvantages with emphasis on the case study of harsh scenarios. Such an approach requires proper data collections that allow the replay phase to test the GNSS-based positioning terminals. This paper presents the results obtained on a set of field tests related to different scenarios, selected as representative for the key performance indicators assessment.	black box;collections (publication);embedding;experiment;exploit (computer security);fda quality metrics terminology;performance;satellite navigation;scalability;simulators;software development;software quality assurance;spatial variability;benefit;sensor (device)	Calogero Cristodaro;Laura Ruotsalainen;Fabio Dovis	2018		10.3390/s18072189	electronic engineering;rf front end;engineering;gnss applications	SE	21.948069246541866	78.95422171072481	134675

0aab1724c13de8bf76addd603d2e1bb16207a4cd	target localization in wireless sensor networks based on received signal strength		We consider the problem of localizing a target taking the help of a set of anchor beacon nodes. A small number of beacon nodes are deployed at known locations in the area. The target can detect a beacon provided it happens to lie within the beacon’s transmission range. Thus, the target obtains a measurement vector containing the readings of the beacons: ‘1’ corresponding to a beacon if it is able to detect the target, and ‘0’ if the beacon is not able to detect the target. The goal is twofold: to determine the location of the target based on the binary measurement vector at the target; and to study the behaviour of the localization uncertainty as a function of the beacon transmission range (sensing radius) and the number of beacons deployed. Beacon transmission range means signal strength of the beacon to transmit and receive the signals which is called as Received Signal Strength (RSS). To localize the target, we propose a gridmapping based approach, where the readings corresponding to locations on a grid overlaid on the region of interest are used to localize the target. To study the behaviour of the localization uncertainty as a function of the sensing radius and number of beacons, extensive simulations and numerical experiments are carried out. The results provide insights into the importance of optimally setting the sensing radius and the improvement obtainable with increasing number of beacons.	experiment;numerical analysis;rss;region of interest;signal processing;simulation	S.

In this abstract, we will demonstrate a new time synchronization approach for WSNs, which exploits the Radio Data System (RDS) [1] of FM radios. RDS is a communication protocol for embedding digital information in traditional FM radio broadcasting. When decoding data stream broadcast by FM stations, an FM receiver generates an periodic interrupt, one per 21,894 us, referred to as RDS clock. We have conducted a measurement study of the RDS clock that includes a six-day indoor experiment and an outdoor experiment using a vehicle driving through a metropolitan area of about 40 km2 [2]. Our results showed that the RDS clock is highly stable and accurate, providing a viable means to calibrate the clocks of sensor nodes distributed in a large geographic region over a long period of time.	communications protocol;digital data;radio data system;radio broadcasting	Liqun Li;Guoliang Xing;Limin Sun;Wei Huangfu;Ruogu Zhou;Hongsong Zhu	2011		10.1145/1999995.2000038	embedded system;cognitive radio;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;remote radio head;computer network;umts terrestrial radio access network	Mobile	19.201890775371787	79.5115184452498	135029

Random set P of points on all 2D planes inside a given hypothetical indoor space are chosen. Each pi ∈ P is considered to be a point from which the transmitted signal reflects just before reaching the receiver. A vector sum of the signals that arrives at the receiver from each point pi provides the resultant signal at the receiver. The received signal strength (RSS) is then computed as the signal envelope of this signal. This technique provides RSS statistics that are similar to those developed after extensive measurements in multi-path environments. In addition, this technique captures the spatial correlation of signal impairment. For example, path loss computed with this technique shows that co-moving receivers experience correlated signal fades while those moving in different spaces see un-correlated fading. The goal of this work is to implement this, low cost, ray-tracing approach in network simulators for experiments that require a spatial contexts such as path diversity in a mmWave system or for leader selection for data forwarding in a dense Internet of Things deployment and proof-of-concept evaluation of inference algorithms for indoor localization. This technique does not compete with or replace other, more accurate and deterministic ray-tracing techniques that use either brute force or geometric optics combined to obtain site-specific signal-to-space mapping.	algorithm;brute-force attack;brute-force search;experiment;internet of things;operand forwarding;rss;ray tracing (graphics);resultant;simulation;software deployment;space mapping;statistical model	Shweta Jain;Christian Barona;Nicholas Madamopolous	2015	2015 36th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium	10.1109/SARNOF.2015.7324648	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Embedded	24.589678919016414	76.22705504578568	135156

The data collected by each sensor is communicated through the network to a single processing center that uses all reported data to determine characteristics of the environment or detect an event. The communication or message passing process must be designed to conserve the limited energy resources of the sensors. Clustering sensors into groups, so that sensors communicate information only to clusterheads and then the clusterheads communicate the aggregated information to the processing center, may save energy. In this paper, we propose a distributed, randomized clustering algorithm to organize the sensors in a wireless sensor network into clusters. We then extend this algorithm to generate a hierarchy of clusterheads and observe that the energy savings increase with the number of levels in the hierarchy. Results in stochastic geometry are used to derive solutions for the values of parameters of our algorithm that minimize the total energy spent in the network when all sensors report data through the clusterheads to the processing center.

6be8209ef4f05041ad5270e74d6b39a05c401b95	towards extended bit tracking for scalable and robust rfid tag identification systems		The surge in demand for Internet of Things (IoT) systems and applications has motivated a paradigm shift in the development of viable radio frequency identification technology (RFID)-based solutions for ubiquitous real-time monitoring and tracking. Bit tracking-based anti-collision algorithms have attracted considerable attention, recently, due to its positive impact on decreasing the identification time. We aim to extend bit tracking to work effectively over erroneous channels and scalable multi RFID readers systems. Towards this objective, we extend the bit tracking technique along two dimensions. First, we introduce and evaluate a type of bit errors that appears only in bit tracking-based anti-collision algorithms called false collided bit error in single reader RFID systems. A false collided bit error occurs when a reader perceives a bit sent by tag as an erroneous bit due to channel imperfection and not because of a physical collision. This phenomenon results in a significant increase in the identification delay. We introduce a novel, zero overhead algorithm called false collided bit error selective recovery tackling the error. There is a repetition gain in bit tracking-based anti-collision algorithms due to their nature, which can be utilized to detect and correct false collided bit errors without adding extra coding bits. Second, we extend bit tracking to “error-free” scalable mutli-reader systems, while leaving the study of multi-readers tag identification over imperfect channels for future work. We propose the multi-reader RFID tag identification using bit tracking (MRTI-BT) algorithm which allows concurrent tag identification, by neighboring RFID readers, as opposed to time-consuming scheduling. MRTI-BT identifies tags exclusive to different RFIDs, concurrently. The concept of bit tracking and the proposed parallel identification property are leveraged to reduce the identification time compared to the state-of-the-art.	algorithm;bit error rate;internet of things;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;real-time clock;scalability;scheduling (computing);topbt	Abdulrahman Fahim;Tamer A.

Consequently, the number of sensors and medical devices being implanted to accurately monitor and diagnose a disease is increasing. By measuring the symptoms and controlling a medical device as close as possible to the source, these implantable devices are able to save lives. A wireless link between medical sensors and implantable medical devices is essential in the case of closed-loop medical devices, in which symptoms of the diseases are monitored by sensors that are not placed in close proximity of the therapeutic device. Medium Access Control (MAC) is crucial to make it possible for several medical devices to communicate using a shared wireless medium in such a way that minimum delay, maximum throughput, and increased network life-time are guaranteed. To guarantee this Quality of Service (QoS), the MAC protocols control the main sources of limited resource wastage, namely the idle-listening, packet collisions, over-hearing, and packet loss. Traditional MAC protocols designed for body sensor networks are not directly applicable to Implantable Body Sensor Networks (IBSN) because of the dynamic nature of the radio channel within the human body and the strict QoS requirements of IBSN applications. Although numerous MAC protocols are available in the literature, the majority of them are designed for Body Sensor Network (BSN) and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). To the best of our knowledge, there is so far no research paper that explores the impact of these MAC protocols specifically for IBSN. MAC protocols designed for implantable devices are still in their infancy and one of their most challenging objectives is to be ultra-low-power. One of the technological solutions to achieve this objective so is to integrate the concept of Wake-up radio (WuR) into the MAC design. In this survey, we present a taxonomy of MAC protocols based on their use of WuR technology and identify their bottlenecks to be used in IBSN applications. Furthermore, we present a number of open research challenges and requirements for designing an energy-efficient and reliable wireless communication protocol for IBSN.	access control;auditory perception;bachelor of science in nursing;body dysmorphic disorders;communications protocol;enterprise architecture framework;gnu nano;hearing loss, high-frequency;implants;international standard book number;lewy body disease;low-power broadcasting;mac address;maximum throughput scheduling;medical devices;network packet;open research;overhead (computing);protocols documentation;quality of service;requirement;sleep wake disorders;solutions;taxonomy;collision;sensor (device)	Vignesh Raja Karuppiah Ramachandran;Eyuel D.

Also if several radio signal features have been exploited in order to estimate the position, the Received Signal Strength (RSS) is probably the most used. RSS depends, in addition to the distance, also on multipath transmission, barriers and non-idealities of antenna. Differences between ideal and real omnidirectional transmission patterns or polarization angle misalignment can strongly affect the RSS value impairing the following localization algorithm. In this paper, an algorithm to compensate the dependence of the RSS on the angle among the antennas is proposed and tested. The experimental results prove the goodness of the approach and the possibility of using this algorithm to minimize the dependence of RSS from the tilting angle among the nodes of a localization sensor network.	algorithm;brewster's angle;multipath propagation;polarization (waves);rss;radio wave;sensor web	Davide Polese;Luca Pazzini;A.

Localization of nodes in UWSNs depends on collaborative work of nodes in the network since GPS signals fade quickly underwater. Using the concept of probabilistic graphs to capture node location information, we formalize a problem called the Probabilistic Localization Problem (P-LOC) that calls for computing the probability that a given target node in a given probabilistic graph can localize itself during some interval of time. We then devise an iterative algorithm that gives exact solution to the problem if allowed to execute a sufficient number of iterations, otherwise, the algorithm provides a lower bound on the solution.

It integrates the ideas of centralized processing, collaborative radio and real-time cloud infrastructure. CoMP (Coordinated Multiple Points) is a key technique in LTE-Advanced. But it is really a challenge to implement real-time CoMP transmission on GPP platform because many factors can affect the performance of soft CoMP base stations. In this paper, We implemented a real-time CoMP architecture on GPP platform by optimizing soft base stations design and data exchange categories. This architecture is fully compatible with TD-LTE R8/R9. The test results show that it can ensure real-time processing and provide stable downlink CoMP transmission for TD-LTE R8/R9 users.	centralized computing;cloud computing;compaq lte;graph partition;programming paradigm;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;telecommunications link	Bobo Cheng;Xiang Mi;Xibin Xu;Zhan Xu;Xiangxiang Xu;Ming Zhao	2014	2014 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906497	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	23.151570176828912	88.28622059260015	135859

Sensed data can only be interpreted meaningfully when referenced to the location of the sensor, making localization an important problem. In terrestrial WSNs, this can be achieved through a series of message exchanges (via RF communications) between each sensor and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. However, this is infeasible in UWSNs as GPS signals do not propagate through water. Acoustic communications is currently the most viable mode of wireless communications underwater. However, underwater acoustic channels are characterized by harsh physical layer conditions with low bandwidth, high propagation delay and high bit error rate. Moreover, the variable speed of sound, due to variations in temperature, pressure and salinity, and the nonnegligible node mobility due to water currents pose a unique set of challenges for localization in UWSNs. In this paper, we present a multi-stage AUV-aided localization scheme for UWSNs. The proposed method combines the flexibility and localization accuracy of an AUV-aided localization, the energy efficiency of """"silent localization"""" and improved localization coverage with k-stage localization based on sensor nodes. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of the localization coverage, accuracy and communication costs using simulations. We show that while improved performance with multiple stages is traded off with higher communication costs in general, the latter can be minimized while maintaining good performance with an appropriate choice of the acoustic communication range."""	acoustic cryptanalysis;bit error rate;gps signals;global positioning system;internationalization and localization;propagation delay;radio frequency;sensor;simulation;software propagation;terrestrial television	Marc Waldmeyer;Hwee Pink Tan;Winston Khoon Guan Seah	2011	2011 IEEE Workshops of International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/WAINA.2011.90	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	18.905614127358998	76.07168248216696	136385
f5ba4ace42b781144e2dc5e6ca0fa37d30a6a7a4	fast phase synchronization with clustering and one-bit feedback for distributed beamforming in a wireless sensor network		In this paper, we propose a fast phase synchronization method with clustering and one bit feedback for distributed beamforming in a wireless sensor network where multiple single-antenna nodes transfer their sensing data to a data collector. To transmit the data effectively, the distributed nodes should adjust their transmit signals' phase properly so that their signals are constructively added up at the data collector with a same phase, resulting in an increasing received signal strength (RSS). Accordingly, in conventional phase synchronization methods, the data collector broadcasts a common message with a single-bit feedback and, depending the feedback message, each node updates its transmit signal phase. Because, in such conventional methods, the phase are updated based on the random perturbation in a distributed way, the phases are slowly converged and the time required for the synchronization becomes large and it is more serious in a massively distributed sensor network. To overcome the problem, in the proposed method, we separate the distributed sensors into several clusters. Then, in the first stage, the phases in each cluster are synchronized with one-bit feedback and in the second stage, the inter-cluster phases are synchronized based on the grid-search with a one-bit feedback. Through the simulation, we verify that our proposed scheme has a shorter convergence time than the conventional scheme without any feedback overhead.	beamforming;cluster analysis;feedback;overhead (computing);rss;sensor;simulation	JongHyeok Lee;Sungbok Lee;Jaehyun Park	2018	2018 IEEE 87th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2018.8417563	computer science;signal strength;wireless sensor network;computer network;distributed database;distributed computing;cluster analysis;convergence (routing);synchronization;beamforming;phase synchronization	Mobile	15.806995462455829	76.96952942470067	136443

We validate the efficacy of our expressions through simulations of the SMS mobility model. Our results reveal that the node degree distribution follows a binomial distribution regardless of the initial distribution of nodes’ location. The results presented in this paper are useful in studying the connectivity of mobile nodes, in estimating the capacity of mobile ad hoc networks, and provide a good understanding of the impact of fundamental network parameters in the presence of mobility.	degree distribution;hoc (programming language);simulation	Lifang Guo;Khaled Harfoush;Huimin Xu	2010	2010 Fourth International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies	10.1109/NGMAST.2010.41	mobile ad hoc network;degree distribution;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;mobility model;mobile computing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	13.950790557056589	87.92741809296054	136464

First, an analysis is performed on the energy efficiency of coding schemes in wireless microsensor networks. Based on this analysis, we devise a power aware coding scheme, called EESPIHT which exploits the spatio-temporal correlation of multiple sensor readings. It is also made resilient to channel errors: it selects an error correcting code based on source coding information and transmission power so that energy dissipation is minimized. Experimental results on a LINUX implementation and simulation results based on OPNET using field data sets show that the proposed scheme can reduce energy on communication by more than 60% and maintain a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 24 dB or better compared to the non-coded case.	automatic repeat request;data compression;forward error correction;linux;neural coding;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Caimu Tang;Cauligi S.

Instead, the network should use aggregated information from groups of sensor nodes [2,3,7]. The topic of this work is the efficient computation of aggregate functions in the highly constrained Sensor Network setting, where node restrictions are modeled as in [4], the random node-deployment is modeled as a geometric graph, and the resulting topology, node identifiers assignment and the assignment of input-values to be aggregated is adversarial.	aggregate function;early stopping	Antonio Fernández;Miguel A.

The proposed method does not require any form of node synchronisation nor measurement (or control) of the transmission times, which is difficult or anyway costly to achieve in practice. It relies exclusively on reception timestamps collected by the anchor nodes, according to their local clocks, that overhear packets transmitted by the blind node and by (at least one) other transmitting node(s) in known position, e.g., other anchors. The clock differences between the nodes are not eliminated ex ante through clock synchronisation, as in traditional ToA and TDoA methods. Instead, they are counteracted ex post, during the data processing stage, leveraging the data redundancy that is intrinsic to the multiple reception of the same packet by different (anchor) nodes. We validate the proposed method in two experimental setting, indoor and outdoor, using exclusively low-cost Commercial-Off-The-Shelf WiFi devices, and obtain sub-meter accuracy in Line-of-Sight conditions. The proposed method does not require that the blind node participate actively to the localisation procedure and can use “opportunistically” any legacy signal or packet available over-the-air for communication purposes. Considering the very minimal requirement on the system — basically, only that anchors in known positions are able to collect and share reception timestamps — the proposed approach can enable practical adoption of opportunistic and/or cooperative localisation on top of existing radio communication systems.	clock synchronization;compaq lte;cooperative mimo;ddos mitigation;dvb-s;data redundancy;digital video broadcasting;emitter-coupled logic;global positioning system;indoor positioning system;internationalization and localization;language localisation;network packet;requirement;satellite navigation;sensor;time of arrival;transmitter;trusted timestamping	Nicolò Facchi;Francesco Gringoli;Fabio Ricciato;Andrea Toma	2015	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2015.06.003	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	19.52120084398104	76.58247842532843	137841

Now, the main idea in most existing localization algorithms has been that a mobile anchor node (e.g., global positioning system-equipped nodes) broadcasts its coordinates to help other unknown nodes to localize themselves while moving according to a specified trajectory. This method not only reduces the cost of WSNs but also gets high localization accuracy. In this case, a basic problem is that the path planning of the mobile anchor node should move along the trajectory to minimize the localization error and to localize the unknown nodes. In this paper, we propose a Localization algorithm with a Mobile Anchor node based on Trilateration (LMAT) in WSNs. LMAT algorithm uses a mobile anchor node to move according to trilateration trajectory in deployment area and broadcasts its current position periodically. Simulation results show that the performance of our LMAT algorithm is better than that of other similar algorithms.

The resultant BDIIM consists of six sub-processes reflecting the infection-immunity mechanism: occurrence probabilities of direct-infection (DI) and cross-infection (CI), immunity/immune-deficiency of DI and CI, pathogen amount of DI and CI, immune cell production, immune memory, and pathogen accumulation under immunity state. Furthermore, a corresponding relationship between the BDIIM and sensor wake-up control is established to form the collaborative wake-up method. Finally, joint surveillance and target tracking are formulated in the simulation, in which we show that the energy cost and position tracking error are reduced to 50.8% and 78.9%, respectively. Effectiveness of the proposed BDIIM algorithm is shown, and this model is expected to have a significant role in guiding the performance improvement of multi-sensor networks.	algorithm;angular defect;biomimetics;control theory;inspiration function;numerous;pathogenic organism;probability;resultant;simulation;tree accumulation	Jie Zhou;Yan Liang;Qiang Shen;Xiaoxue Feng;Quan Pan	2018		10.3390/s18041255	electronic engineering;engineering;immune system;control theory;sensor fusion;tracking error	Robotics	13.563206618225964	81.37903812224434	138490

The optimal solution of the network lifetime model is gotten. Then the lifetimes of the heterogeneous surveillance sensor network in different distribution intensities are obtained through the simulations. The authors compare these lifetimes and conclude that the network can get an optimal performance if the intensity of normal nodes is fivefold of the cluster nodes.	computer performance;network architecture;network topology;precondition;random graph;simulation	Xue Li;Yuyao He;Shiyan Xu	2009	2009 10th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligences, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing	10.1109/SNPD.2009.19	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer security;computer network	Mobile	12.538289530856293	77.54703466520688	138509

Recent breakthroughs in wireless energy transfer-based rechargeable batteries provide a promising application of mobile vehicles in WSNs. These mobile vehicles act as mobile chargers to transfer energy wirelessly to static sensors in an efficient way. In this paper, we study the mobile charger coverage problem of sensor nodes distributed on a 1-dimensional line and ring. Each sensor needs to be recharged at a given frequency. A mobile charger can charge a sensor after it moves to the location of the sensor. We assume that the mobile charger has an unlimited charging capability, moves at a speed subject to a given limit, and that the charging time is negligible. An optimization problem is then presented on a time-space coverage of sensors so that none of them will run out of energy: (1) What is the minimum number of mobile chargers needed? (2) Given the minimum number of mobile chargers, how should these mobile chargers be scheduled in terms of trajectory planning? Given homogeneous sensors with the same recharging frequency, we provide an optimal solution with a linear complexity in finding the minimum number of charges, as well as the actual schedule. We then examine an extension to heterogeneous sensors and provide a greedy approach that has a constant ratio of 2 to the optimal solutions for a line and ring. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the competitive performance of the proposed scheme.	battery charger;greedy algorithm;mathematical optimization;mobile phone;optimization problem;rechargeable battery;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation	Richard Beigel;Jie Wu;Huanyang Zheng	2014		10.1145/2633675.2633676	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	12.54918139898322	79.46542270832259	138539

We investigate the probability that the size of the giant component is at least a given threshold p with 0.5 < p ≤ 1. For d = 1, we derive a closed-form analytical formula for this probability. For d = 2, we propose an empirical formula for this probability using simulations. In addition, we compare the transmission range required for having a connected network with the transmission range required for having a certain size giant component for d = 2. The comparison shows that a significant energy saving can be achieved if we only require most nodes (e.g. 95%) to be connected to the giant component rather than require all nodes to be connected. The results of this paper are of practical value in the design and analysis of wireless ad hoc networks and sensor networks.	apollonian network;euclidean distance;giant component;hoc (programming language);hop;randomness;simulation;windows 95	Xiaoyuan Ta;Guoqiang Mao;Brian D.

WSNs are important commercially because of their many applications, both on the military and on the civilian domains , for example, intruder detection, the structural monitoring of large constructions such as skyscrapers and bridges, the monitoring of wildlife, the tracking of contaminants in the soil and the atmosphere, and so many others that have already been well documented in numerous survey papers. Some of these applications have already proved to be commercially viable and indeed financially very successful. WSNs are also very important from a scientific point of view, because of their unique features with respect to other types of wireless networks: nodes are typically immobile and are required to carry a specific type of traffic (which is advantageous), have extreme restrictions on the energy they consume , the processing power they have, and the antennas they can use (which is disadvantageous), and the data created at different sensors may be strongly correlated (which is useful, but only if we work hard to devise good algorithms that take advantage of it). Therefore, in the last few years we have experienced an important shift in research activities, from research on general purpose wireless networks, to more focused research specifically on WSNs, taking into account their specific advantages and peculiarities. An important recurring theme in research in this field is the need for cross-layer design, which arises firstly because of the nature of the wireless channel, and secondly because, in contrast to almost all other types of wireless and wired networks, WSNs are built for a specific application in mind, and so all layers must be cognizant of the features of this application and coordinate in executing it. Therefore, algorithms must be designed to either span multiple layers or focus on one layer, but be cognizant of what happens in other layers. Furthermore, a meaningful analysis of the operation of the network cannot be performed exclusively on one layer, but must encompass more than one, in many multiple cases. The papers that appear in this issue have been carefully selected after a rigorous review process, and represent the state of the art on cross-layer design for WSNs.

Distributed protocols are designed to achieve a global task over a network of devices connected via wireless links for different applications in wireless networks such as statistical inference and decision making, optimization in radio access and interference management, fault-tolerant networking. Channel variability and fading, dynamic routing and battery-aware policy, are only few of the specific challenges that the design of any distributed algorithm over wireless links need to account for.

45176930f5ad3e9474ca50d574e808a4f3758930	practical compressed sensing and network coding for intelligent distributed communication networks		Based on the impressive features that network coding and compressed sensing paradigms have separately brought, the idea of bringing them together in practice will result in major improvements and influence in the upcoming 5G networks. In this context, this paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of these key techniques in a cluster-based wireless sensor network, in the presence of temporal and spatial correlations. Our goal is to achieve better compression gains by scaling down the total payload carried by applying temporal compression as well as reducing the total number of transmissions in the network using spatial compression and real field network coding. Furthermore, we compare our approach with benchmark schemes. As expected, our numerical results run on NS3 simulator show that overall our scheme dramatically drops the number of transmitted packets in the considered cluster topology by almost 94 % with a very high reconstruction SNR.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);bernoulli polynomials;coefficient;compressed sensing;data compression;emoticon;error detection and correction;image scaling;linear network coding;modifier key;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;source data;telecommunications network	Maroua Taghouti;Anil Kumar Chorppath;Tobias Waurick;Frank H.

We give a closed-form equation for computing this probability for k = 2; and also give a recursive equation for evaluating this probability for k > 2 by using some approximations. The accuracy of the approximate analytical solution is validated by simulations. Furthermore, we present an empirical method to correct the discrepancies between the analytical results and the simulation results caused by the approximation. The result of this paper can be useful in a number of sensor network problems, e.g., estimating the transmission delay between two sensors and energy consumed in the transmission, and WSN routing problems.	approximation algorithm;hop;kleene's recursion theorem;randomness;routing;sensor;simulation	Xiaoyuan Ta;Guoqiang Mao;Brian D.

c6ce41e499eaa7f01d85ea0e10d3199115b77633	free - fine-grained scheduling for reliable and energy efficient data collection in lorawan.		Collecting data from remote sensor devices with limited infrastructure is still considered a challenging task. Here, LoRa radios and LoRaWAN networks represent an appealing option due to their inexpensively, high link budgets, low energy consumption, and one-hop system architecture. However, LoRaWAN suffers from a scalability issue due to its Alohalike MAC layer. Additionally, the duty cycle restriction at the gateway limits the acknowledgment handling even in mediumsize networks. Therefore, we propose FREE as a fine-grained scheduling scheme for reliable and energy-efficient data collection in LoRaWAN. FREE schedules spreading factors, transmission powers, frequency channels, timeslots, and slot numbers in frames for LoRa end-devices. As a result, FREE overcomes the scalability issue of LoRaWAN by eliminating collisions and grouping acknowledgments. We propose two objective functions for FREE to either optimize the energy consumption or the data collection time. Their choice depends on gateway availability. We evaluate the performance of FREE for different LoRaWAN configurations. The numerical results show that FREE scales well for unconfirmable and confirmable transmissions. Furthermore, FREE achieves almost 100% data delivery and the estimated device lifetime is likely over 10 years regardless of the running application and the network size.		Khaled Q.

Main challenges in this area include the development of efficient coding and modulation signal processing techniques for improving the quality and spectral efficiency of wireless systems. The recently emerged space-time coding and signal processing techniques for wireless communication systems employing multiple transmit and receive antennas offer a powerful paradigm for meeting these challenges. This paper provides an overview on the recent development in space-time coding and signal processing techniques for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. We first review the information theoretic results on the capacities of wireless systems employing multiple transmit and receive antennas. We then describe two representative categories of space-time systems, namely, the BLAST system and the space-time block coding system, both of which have been proposed for next-generation high-speed wireless system. Signal processing techniques for channel estimation and decoding in space-time systems are also discussed. Finally, some other coding and signal processing techniques for wireless systems employing multiple transmit and receive antennas that are currently under intensive research are also briefly touched upon.	blast;channel state information;huffman coding;information theory;mimo;mobile computing;modulation;programming paradigm;signal processing;spectral efficiency	Inaki Berenguer;Xiaodong Wang	2003	Journal of Computer Science and Technology	10.1007/BF02945457	real-time computing;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;signal processing;wi-fi array;space–time code;wireless;statistics	Mobile	22.657671756017944	85.1636941982114	140138

The major challenge to accurate location estimation is in creating techniques that yield acceptable performance when the direct path from the transmitter to the receiver is intermittently blocked. This is the Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) problem, and it is known to be a major source of error in mobile location since it systematically causes the mobile to appear farther away from the base station than it actually is, thereby increasing the positioning error. In this paper, we present a simple yet robust method for distinguishing between LOS and NLOS range measurements in a mixed measurement set and we validate its performance using simulations in several multipath channel environments.	line-of-sight (missile);multipath propagation;simulation;transmitter	Marilynn P.

Therefore common and proven systems can be used for the infrastructure. For indoor environments the distance-pending path loss is affected by strong variations, especially appearing as frequency specific signal dropouts. A diversity concept with redundant data transmission in different frequency bands can reduce the dropout probability. When also space diversity and plausibility filtering are used, the Location Estimation Error can be reduced significantly. The investigations show that a good performance for precision and availability can also be reached with low infrastructural costs.	algorithm;dropout (neural networks);frequency band;least squares;microsoft outlook for mac;mobile device;plausibility structure;texture filtering	Andreas Fink;Helmut Beikirch	2009	2009 6th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication	10.1109/WPNC.2009.4907821	electronic engineering;antenna diversity;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;statistics;computer network	HCI	20.844120383745608	74.55641095335339	140319

In WANETs, achieving a secure connectivity is more challenging since all the communications should operate on secure links. In this paper, we investigate the characterization of the critical density c λ for Poisson random geometric graphs which is the central problem of secure connectivity. By combining the continuum percolation theory with the clustering coefficient method, we derive a tighter lower bound on c λ which provides fundamental understanding on the secure connectivity of WANETs.	hoc (programming language)	Dianjie Lu;Guijuan Zhang;Hong Liu	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-09265-2_42	wireless ad hoc network;computer science;information security;connectivity;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	14.028617276794943	87.53940725089173	140461

A power law relationship of the form r = αN −β  is hypothesised to hold for the communication range (r) and the number of nodes (N), with α and β being functions of the connectivity probability of the network. Unlike the different forms of log relationships derived for different network settings, this power law relationship will be shown to hold for both static and mobile ad hoc network of various settings using extensive simulation data. The comparison between the commonly known log law and our power law will be made using the published simulation data for stationary network and network with random waypoint model mobility. We further hypothesise that the power law relationship between the communication range and the number of nodes holds across different network models. We propose to simplify and unify the research of this connectivity probability problem by focusing on the effect of different network models on the parameters (α and β) of the power law model.	hoc (programming language);transmitter	Mun-Loong Kam;Gerard Leng	2010	IJSNet	10.1504/IJSNET.2010.033206	wireless ad hoc network;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;scale-free network;wireless network;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	13.792825997265467	87.97636530583996	140700

Termed radio tomographic imaging, the technique has shown potential for object tracking, imaging static obstacles, and even through-wall imaging. Our approach addresses substantial issues for the practical implementation of such a system, namely, the mitigation of multipath signal effects and the characterization of a large number of uncalibrated network links. We propose a system that utilizes ultrawideband direct path signal strength measurements as a means of reducing the effects of the multipath fading. Furthermore, we address the estimation of unknown path loss and link bias parameters online through the framework of a linear mixed effects model. This permits the estimation of a static area map without a prohibitive calibration of these parameters prior to deployment, which is crucial in a network that may contain hundreds of links. Our model is posed as a convex optimization problem using the elastic net for regularization. Bayesian performance bounds are derived and our method shows positive results in simulation. We then demonstrate the efficacy of our solution on real tomographic data gathered from our cognitive spectrum operations testbed.	algorithm;convex optimization;cooperative mimo;elastic net regularization;global positioning system;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;mixed model;multipath propagation;optimization problem;radar;radio frequency;random effects model;sensor;signal processing;simulation;simultaneous localization and mapping;software deployment;software propagation;testbed;tomography;ultra-wideband	Brian Beck;Xiaoli Ma;Robert J.

We propose the use of autonomous robots that move inside a disaster area and establish a network for two-way communication between trapped civilians with uncertain locations and an operation centre. Our aim is to maximise the number of civilians connected to the network. We present a distributed algorithm which involves clustering possible locations of civilians according to their expected shortfall; clustering facilitates both connectivity within groups of civilians and exploration that is based on the uncertainty of these locations. To achieve efficient allocation in terms of time and energy, we also develop a modified algorithm according to which the robots consider the graph that the cluster centres form and follow its minimum spanning tree. We conduct simulations and discuss the efficiency and appropriateness of the two algorithms in different situations.	autonomous robot;cluster analysis;distributed algorithm;expected shortfall;file spanning;hoc (programming language);minimum spanning tree;norm (social);simulation	Stelios Timotheou;Georgios Loukas	2009		10.1145/1529282.1529542	wireless ad hoc network;simulation;uncertainty;expected shortfall;computer science;artificial intelligence;minimum spanning tree;distributed computing;computer security;emergency management;wireless;statistics	Robotics	12.777169696120785	75.55307622281552	141213

Many applications, such as location-based services and Enhanced 911 (E911), require that the locations of users in a cellular system are available. The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is the most accessible positioning systems which are widely used in cellphones. However, poor operation in indoor and dense environments leads us to use cellular localization as a backup solution. In cellular localization, the locations of users are determined via measurements obtained within the network without aid of any external sources (e.g., GNSS). Observed time difference of arrival (OTDOA) is a positioning technique introduced in Release 9 of the 3GPP LTE specification. In OTDOA technique, the User Equipment (UE) measures the time difference of signals between several eNodeBs (base stations in LTE) and uses a trilateration algorithm to find its location. In the current 3GPP LTE specification, the UE can only collect measurements from eNodeBs. Therefore, in many situations, the UE is not able to communicate to a sufficient number of eNodeBs and cannot find its location without ambiguity. In this paper, we propose a cooperative localization technique for LTE systems in which the UE communicates not only with eNodeBs but also with other UEs. It will be shown that cooperative localization can significantly improve the localizability in the network, meaning that more UEs can be localized. Cooperative localization also enhances the accuracy which is highly beneficial for some applications, especially E911. A series of computer simulations are conducted to show the benefits of cooperative localization where the 3GPP simulation parameters are assumed.	algorithm;backup;compaq lte;computer simulation;cooperative mimo;internationalization and localization;location-based service;mobile phone;multilateration;satellite navigation;unreal development kit	Reza Monir Vaghefi;R.

Most of the existing DFP localization systems are based on the measurement of received signal strength (RSS) only. However, the localization accuracy is easily affected by the spatial and temporal variance of RSS due to multipath fading and noise, even in a static environment. In this paper, we propose a novel localization system for DFP localization using an array sensor, which uses an antenna array at a receiver and is mainly based on the signal eigenvector. We use a fingerprinting technique with multiclass support vector machines (SVMs) based on a combination of array signal features with spatial and temporal averaging. We evaluate the localization performance of our proposed system in different propagation environments, i.e., line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS). In addition, we analyze two types of receive antenna placement, i.e., centralized and distributed antennas. The experimental results show that the localization accuracy can be improved by the proposed system, particularly in the centralized antenna case. Moreover, they show that the proposed system can improve localization accuracy compared with the conventional RSS-only-based system.	centralized computing;fingerprint (computing);internationalization and localization;line-of-sight (missile);location-based service;multipath propagation;rss;software propagation;support vector machine	Jihoon Hong;Tomoaki Ohtsuki	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2397436	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;engineering;sensor;noise;antenna;accuracy and precision;location;antenna array	Mobile	21.177329311713432	75.58720303752395	141299

Many practical applications of this type of networks may require the association of a nonnegligible number of nodes with strong power constraints. In that case, the most efficient way (especially in terms of battery consumption) of organising 802.15.4/Zigbee networks is by means of hierarchical cluster-trees. However, the standard does not impose any particular algorithm to organize, dimension or synchronize a cluster-tree network. This paper addresses this issue by proposing and comparing three simple strategies to parametrize the timing of superframes in static Zigbee clustertrees.	algorithm;computer cluster;low-power broadcasting;scalability;software deployment;tree network	Eduardo Casilari-Pérez;A.

It is shown that, by the combination of both radio techniques and microprocessor data capabilities, improved means are available for controlling the specific multiple propagation and interference influences within the mobile radio environment. The aim of the system structure is to achieve the best possible frequency channel utilization, system availability, and cost benefits for deployment and users if traffic demand grows. The paper shows the different types of switching functions in public land mobile networks. Problems, as caused purely by radio conditions, are controlled within a defined radio exchange function, allowing the optimization of individual cell parameters. It is shown that distance measurement is the most reliable means of detecting cell boundaries. New approaches for system control channels lead to synchronous operation of base stations. The system operates with off-air call setup and queueing to improve channel utilization. Full national and international roaming capabilities are provided. During all calls, continuous digital link control is maintained to allow the radio exchange function in call condition. This new approach leads to different types of handoff to suit specific situations.

In this paper we consider the problem of power-efficient topology control with switched beam directional antennas taking into account their non-uniform radiation pattern within the beamwidth. Previous work in the area have all assumed a uniform gain model with these antennas which renders antenna orientation insignificant as a parameter in topology control algorithms. We present algorithms that take into account a model of non-uniform gain with the objectives of minimizing the total power and maximum power to keep the network connected. We consider two cases: one where the antenna orientation is assumed given and another where the antenna orientation needs to be derived as well. For the first case, we present optimal and approximation algorithms for constructing power-efficient topologies. For the second case, we prove the problem to be NP-complete and present heuristic solutions along with approximation bounds. Through comparison of the two cases by simulation, significant reductions are shown in the maximum as well as total power required to keep the network connected for the second case, thus demonstrating the benefits of using antenna orientation as parameter in topology construction.	approximation algorithm;heuristic;maximum power transfer theorem;np-completeness;radiation pattern;rendering (computer graphics);simulation;topological graph theory;topology control	Vinod Namboodiri;Lixin Gao;Ramakrishna Janaswamy	2008	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2007.01.003	topology;mathematical optimization;computer science;directional antenna;distributed computing;extension topology;network topology;computer network;logical topology	Mobile	15.669234037893226	85.71359125806576	141472

In particular, statistical dependence between local decisions (at binary sensors) is assumed, and two complementary methods to save energy have been considered: censoring, to avoid some transmissions from sensors to fusion center, and a sleep and wake up random schedule at local sensors. The effect of possible failures in transmission has been also included, considering the probability of having a successful transmission from a sensor to the fusion center. In this scenario, the necessary statistical information has been identified, the optimal decision rule at the fusion center has been obtained, and some examples have been used to analyze the effect of statistical dependence in a simple network with two sensors.

8ede3c7a18ad68d5a37cf7ebb64449821fe49546	wireless distance estimation with low-power standard components in wireless sensor nodes		In the context of increasing use of moving wireless sensor nodes the interest in localizing these nodes in their application environment is strongly rising. For many applications, it is necessary to know the exact position of the nodes in twoor three-dimensional space. Commonly used nodes use state-of-the-art transceivers like the CC430 from Texas Instruments with integrated signal strength measurement for this purpose. This has the disadvantage, that the signal strength measurement is strongly dependent on the orientation of the node through the antennas inhomogeneous radiation pattern as well as it has a small accuracy on long ranges. Also, the nodes overall attenuation and output power has to be calibrated and interference and multipath effects appear in closed environments. Another possibility to trilaterate the position of a sensor node is the time of flight measurement. This has the advantage, that the position can also be estimated on long ranges, where signal strength methods give only poor accuracy. In this paper we present an investigation of the suitability of the state-of-the-art transceiver CC430 for a system based on time of flight methods and give an overview of the optimal settings under various circumstances for the in-field application. For this investigation, the systematic and statistical errors in the time of flight measurements with the CC430 have been investigated under a multitude of parameters. Our basic system does not use any additional components but only the given standard hardware, which can be found on the Texas Instruments evaluation board for a CC430. Thus, it can be implemented on already existent sensor node networks by a simple software upgrade.	interference (communication);low-power broadcasting;microprocessor development board;multipath propagation;radiation pattern;sensor node;ti msp430;transceiver	Thorbjörn Jörger;Fabian Höflinger;Gerd Ulrich Gamm;Leonhard M.

Finally, the defined coverage area can be derived through the density functions in one-dimensional case.

Since devices operating in the optical spectrum do not interfere with those using the RF spectrum, wireless networks based on the optical spectrum can be added to existing RF networks to fulfill this demand. Hence, optical wireless communication (OWC) technology can be an excellent complement to RF-based technology to provide improved service. Promising OWC systems include light fidelity (LiFi), visible light communication, optical camera communication (OCC), and free-space optical communication (FSOC). OWC and RF systems have differing limitations, and the integration of RF and optical wireless networks can overcome the limitations of both systems. This paper describes an LiFi/femtocell hybrid network system for indoor environments. Low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios and the shortage bandwidth problems of existing RF femtocell networks can be overcome with the proposed hybrid model. Moreover, we describe an integrated RF/optical wireless system that can be employed for users inside a vehicle, remote monitoring of ambulance patients, vehicle tracking, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications. We consider LiFi, OCC, and FSOC as the optical wireless technologies to be used for communication support in transportation, and assume macrocells, femtocells, and wireless fidelity to be the corresponding RF technologies. We describe handover management— including detailed call flow, interference management, link reliability improvement, and group handover provisioning—for integrated networks. Performance analyses demonstrate the significance of the proposed integrated RF/optical wireless systems.

c8f8434ac6c345bf758bbaf8a723204ffb4314c5	embracing spatial awareness for reliable wifi-based indoor location systems		Indoor localization gains increasingly attentions in the era of Internet of Things. Among various technologies, WiFi-based systems that leverage Received Signal Strengths (RSSs) as location fingerprints become the mainstream solutions. However, RSS fingerprints suffer from critical drawbacks of spatial ambiguity and temporal instability that root in multipath effects and environmental dynamics, which degrade the performance of these systems and therefore impede their wide deployment in real world. Pioneering works overcome these limitations at the costs of ubiquity as they mostly resort to additional information or extra user constraints. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of MatLoc, an indoor localization system purely based on WiFi fingerprints, which jointly mitigates spatial ambiguity and temporal instability and derives reliable performance without impairing the ubiquity. The key idea is to embrace the spatial awareness of RSS values in a novel form of RSS Spatial Gradient (RSG) matrix for enhanced WiFi fingerprints. We devise techniques for the representation, construction, and comparison of the proposed fingerprint form, and integrate them all in a practical system, which follows the classical fingerprinting framework and requires no more inputs than any previous RSS fingerprint based systems. Extensive experiments in different environments demonstrate that MatLoc significantly improves the accuracy in both localization and tracking scenarios by about 30% to 50% compared with five state-of-the-art approaches.

An important feature of wireless sensor networks is the low power consumption requirement, since these sensor nodes carry generally irreplaceable power sources or batteries. We consider the problem of assigning a power to each node in the network such that the induced connectivity graph is strongly connected with only bidirectional links, and the sum total of powers assigned to all sensor nodes is minimized. This will allow the nodes to communicate with each other, while conserving battery power as much as possible. This problem has been shown to be strongly NP-complete and heuristic approaches for solving this problem have been reported in the literature. In this paper, we establish a lower bound on the optimal power value, and provide a sufficient condition for a minimal spanning tree (MST) based approach to be an optimal solution to the problem. Based on this condition, we propose a novel heuristic approach which computationally outperforms previously reported heuristics.	algorithm;bidirectional search;file spanning;fractal dimension;heuristic (computer science);microcontroller;minimum spanning tree;network topology;polynomial;sensor;strong np-completeness;strongly connected component;transceiver	Yash P.

The inter-distance distributions between any two nodes within these networks are obtained. The network connectivity is considered and the minimum transmission range is derived. The bit error rate performance is then analytically evaluated in the connected regions of the networks taking into account the effect of path loss and Nakagami-m or Rician fading. It is shown that increasing the number of users increases the network connectivity, decreases the minimum transmission range, and improves the performance. It is also shown that node mobility enhances the network connectivity and performance.	bit error rate;hoc (programming language);waypoint	Golnaz Farhadi;Norman C.

In this paper, we propose and investigate a cost-effective and distributed algorithm to accurately estimate nodal positions for wireless sensor networks. In our algorithm, a node only needs to identify and exchange information with a certain number of neighbors (around 30) in its proximity in order to estimate its relative nodal position accurately. For location-identification, only a small number of nodes (around 10) are needed to have additional GPS capabilities to accurately estimate the absolute position of every node in the network.

With PTZ capability, a sensor's visual coverage can be extended to reduce the number of visual sensors that need to be deployed. The coverage zone of a visual sensor in PTZ WVSN is composed of two regions, a Direct Coverage Region (DCR) and a PTZ Coverage Region (PTZCR). In the PTZCR, a visual sensor needs a mechanical pan-tilt-zoom operation to cover an object. This mechanical operation can take seconds, so the sensor might not be able to adjust the camera in time to capture the visual data. In this paper, for the first time, we study this PTZ time-aware PTZ WVSN deployment problem. We formulate this PTZ time-aware PTZ WVSN deployment problem as an optimization problem where the objective is to minimize the total visual sensor deployment cost so that each area is either covered in the DCR or in the PTZCR while considering the PTZ time constraint. The proposed Time Aware Coverage Zone (TACZ) model successfully captures the PTZ visual sensor coverage in terms of camera focal range, angle span zone coverage and camera PTZ time. Then a novel heuristic, called Time Aware Deployment with PTZ camera (TADPTZ) algorithm, is proposed to solve the problem. From our computational experiments, we found out that TACZ model outperforms the existing M coverage model under all network scenarios. In addition, as compared to the optimal solutions, the TACZ model is scalable and adaptable to the different PTZ time requirements when deploying large PTZ WVSNs.	algorithm;area striata structure;computation;coverage data;dvd region code;dental intrusion;deploy;experiment;focal (programming language);heuristic (computer science);intrusion detection system;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;pan–tilt–zoom camera;puromycin aminonucleoside;requirement;scalability;solutions;span distance;visual sensor network;sensor (device)	Florence G.

In WSAN, the performance of event detection and tracking highly depends on the exact location information of the events that must be reported along with the event features. Having precise location information of the sensor nodes, actors are able to execute actions more effectively in the region of detected events. In this context, the accurate localization of sensor nodes is essential with respect to the actors. Particularly, the problem becomes much more complicated when the sensor nodes as well as the anchor nodes (actors) are mobile. In order to localize the mobile sensor nodes relative to the actors, a novel Timing-based Mobile Sensor Localization (TMSL) algorithm is introduced. In TMSL, sensor nodes determine their distance from actors by using propagation time and speed of RF signal. In order to determine distance from the actors, actors actively broadcast reference beacons in a pattern of intervals adaptively defined according to the mobilThis work was supported in part by the Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Council Career Award under grant #104E043 and by the Turkish National Academy of Sciences Distinguished Young Scientist Award Program (TUBA-GEBIP).

These reference beacons carry the interval numbers in which they were transmitted. The interval numbers are then used by the sensor nodes to calculate the start time of the beacons locally which is then used to determine the propagation time. TMSL does neither require nor assume any time synchronization among the sensor nodes or with the actors. Performance evaluations clearly show that TMSL is adaptive to velocity of mobile sensor and actor nodes and can be configured according to the required localization accuracy in order to avoid overhead raised due to high velocity.	academy;actor model;algorithm;broadcast domain;computer engineering;email;overhead (computing);propagation time;sensor;simulation;software propagation;velocity (software development)	Ghalib A.

This paper presents a comparative performance analysis of three RSS-based geolocation algorithms for non-cooperative wireless intruders in terms of their root mean square errors in wireless campus networks. A comparison study is established in a RF sensor grid and circular sensor geometries to fit general campus topology. Geolocation algorithm accuracy is examined for these particular geometric configurations of RF sensors with respect to various wireless intruder locations in and around a campus area. The results show that certain geolocation algorithms perform much better than others when wireless intruders are inside a campus wireless network, whereas the performance of the same geolocation algorithms is turned around when wireless intruders are outside a campus wireless network. As a result, a high accuracy solution to wireless intruder geolocation in campus wireless networks is discovered and proposed. MATLAB-based numerical simulations were used to evaluate the performance of these algorithms for various scenarios and parameters.	algorithm;geographic coordinate system;geolocation;hotspot (wi-fi);matlab;mean squared error;network security;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;rss;radio frequency;sensor;simulation;software propagation	Shanzeng Guo	2012	MILCOM 2012 - 2012 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415758	wireless wan;wireless site survey;telecommunications;engineering;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;computer security;computer network	Mobile	20.807026403726017	75.45671425429995	143467

The vital-sign information collected by these sensors can then be used by care-givers to assess the health of a patient. Therefore, it is necessary to provide reliable communication services to prioritized WBASN data streams with quality of service (QoS) guarantees. However, existing research has not devoted enough attention to this issue. This paper proposes a QoS provisioning framework for WBASN traffic employing the IEEE 802.15.4 super-frame structure in the beacon-enabled mode. A method of prioritizing WBASN traffic is proposed, along with algorithms for admission control and scheduling. Computer simulations reveal that our scheme is able to guarantee a 100% time constraint compliance ratio for traffic in contention access periods, and a 99.2% to 99.9% constraint compliance ratio for traffic in contention-free periods, while still admitting and accommodating tens of WBASN traffic streams.	algorithm;design rationale;performance per watt;provisioning;quality of service;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;speaker wire	Huasong Cao;Sergio González-Valenzuela;Victor C.

9630f0d70f503a2fcb0a74664207343bbd67ed62	distributed synchronization for massive iot deployments		Internet of things (IoT) is the paradigm to interconnect a large number of heterogeneous devices (sensors, smart phones, actuators, etc.), offering a solution for a massive connected network characterized by low-power and low data-rate. In communication architecture with heterogeneous requirements, there are challenges to be traded for such as connectivity, communication protocol, energy efficiency, proper modulation and coding. Timing and carrier frequency synchronization is a critical aspect to be considered in massive IoT development. In this paper, we propose a novel solution based on distributed synchronization that enables the connectivity of massive devices without any external reference timing agent. A common beacon with the same chirp-like signature is broadcasted by every device and the superimposition (collision) with the others represents a compound signature that embeds the reference of the network for synchronization, making thus the algorithm less complex. Beacon's collision is exploited here to drive the IoT network to global time and carrier frequency synchronization. Namely, each node estimates and compensates locally its synchronization state with respect to the ensemble signal from colliding beacons used as synchronization reference. Numerical analysis evaluates the proposed distributed synchronization performance for OFDM system as relevant for practical IoT settings in perspective of 5G systems.	algorithm;ambiguity function;carrier frequency;chirp;communications protocol;coupling (computer programming);fits;internet of things;linear network coding;low-power broadcasting;modulation;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;requirement;scalability;sensor;smartphone;synchronization (computer science)	Maria Antonieta Alvarez;Umberto Spagnolini	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)	10.1109/WCNCW.2017.7919085	embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;operating system;distributed computing;data synchronization;synchronization;computer network	Embedded	19.303200495170714	82.50584384108278	143565

Base-station-initiated optical wireless communication with nodes equipped with a passive optical transmitter in the form of a corner cube retroreflector (CCR) provides sensor acquisition with no energy expenditure on the part of the sensor node itself and is therefore an attractive option for WSN. However, the return signal from an illuminated sensor node is a stochastic variable dependant on fabrication parameters, ambient conditions and receiver noise so that the sensor acquisition process is inherently error-prone. In this paper we propose an energy-aware, base station-initiated interrogation scheme based on exponentially increasing beam scan areas, that takes into consideration the error-prone trait of CCR-outfitted sensor nodes. We analyse the scheme performance subject to different values of signal variance and various cost functions. We extend the analysis to address the circumstance of a spatially-limited sensorfailure event, such as may be caused by deliberate tampering or by environmental factors. We show that agile beam-steering on the basis of accrued knowledge of contaminated sensor distributions promotes energy-conserving acquisition. The validity of a Poisson spatial distribution model for the sensor dispersion is discussed and the impact of this initial assumption on acquisition error is demonstrated.	agile software development;autonomous robot;cognitive dimensions of notations;loss function;optical wireless;passive optical network;sensor node;spatial variability;tiling window manager;transmitter	Debbie Kedar;Shlomi Dolev;Shlomi Arnon	2011	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-011-0379-y	wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	13.974051671714191	77.73814309584714	143579

Downlink communication from access points to mobile stations shares the radio channel with uplink communication from mobile stations to the access points. This protocol is due to the contention-based design that targets the operation in unlicensed spectrum. In the future, because of the growing demand for wireless communication services, WLANs might not only operate in unlicensed but also in licensed spectrum. However, licensed spectrum favors the use of separate (paired) radio channels for downlink and uplink communication - a setup that requires frequency-division-duplex communication. This paper describes and evaluates the feasibility of a WLAN system operating in paired spectrum with a proof of concept implementation. Our testbed employs off-the-shelf WLAN chips (two per device) and driver modifications that enable the system to operate with downlink-uplink separation while still maintaining the ability to function in unlicensed (single-channel) spectrum. We provide insights based on our testbed and evaluate the performance of our solution.	duplex (telecommunications);linux;mathematical optimization;requirement;scalability;telecommunications link;testbed;white spaces (radio);whole earth 'lectronic link;wireless access point	Stefan Schmid;Stefan Mangold;Thomas R.

On the one hand, based on the multi-dimensional connected graph, the density continuous jitter problem of the sensor network is solved effectively. Sensor density prediction method improves the efficiency of random deployment of sensor nodes. Based on the above schemes, the sensor deployment density sensing model is proposed. On the other hand, according to the regional geometry, diversity of the sensor network channel and density can detect the time domain channel impulse response signal successfully. Finally, the network signal is detected by the signal detection of the mobile crowd network. The signal holes can be detected and repaired based on coverage density and crowd. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has outstanding performance in terms of signal strength and signal void ratio compared with the energy-aware repair algorithm.	algorithm;connectivity (graph theory);detection theory;sensor;software deployment	Yong-qiang He	2017	EURASIP J.

We aim to optimize the Sensor Placement from two complementary directions. One is to improve the original greedy algorithm and its extensions [13] to reduce sensor selection time, and the other is to propose a new Quickest Path heuristic that can shorten the detection time. We test and compare our algorithms with previous algorithms on four real data sets. Experimental results show that 1) the new greedy algorithm is more efficient than existing greedy algorithms in terms of selection time, 2) the quickest path heuristic obtains less detection time than centrality-based heuristics, and is as effective as the greedy algorithms, and 3) the new heuristic has the potential to scale well to large networks, having low detection time and selection time.	centrality;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);mobile social network;sensor	Chuan Zhou;Ruisheng Shi;Wenyu Zang;Li Guo	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Services	10.1109/MobServ.2015.45	greedy algorithm;simulation;computer science;machine learning;distributed computing	Robotics	14.03479765550918	78.00055597702054	143931

Each sensor applies a phase shift to the observation and the sensors simultaneously transmit the result to a multi-antenna fusion center (FC). Based on its knowledge of the wireless channel to the sensors, the FC calculates values for the phase factors that minimize the variance of the parameter estimate, and feeds this information back to the sensors. The use of a phase-shift-only transmission scheme provides a simplified analog implementation at the sensor, and also leads to a simpler algorithm design and performance analysis. We propose two algorithms for this problem, a numerical solution based on a relaxed semidefinite programming problem, and a closed-form solution based on the analytic constant modulus algorithm. Both approaches are shown to provide performance close to the theoretical bound. We derive asymptotic performance analyses for cases involving large numbers of sensors or large numbers of FC antennas, and we also study the impact of phase errors at the sensor transmitters. Finally, we consider the sensor selection problem, in which only a subset of the sensors is chosen to send their observations to the FC.	algorithm design;modulus of continuity;numerical partial differential equations;selection algorithm;semidefinite programming;sensor;transmitter	Feng Jiang;Jie Chen;A.

As an approach of green networking, some energy-aware routing algorithms have already been proposed in the literature. However, most on them are based on artificial power models and cannot reach the optimal performance because of the NP-Hardness of the problem. In this paper, by analyzing a realistic power model, we propose a two-phase routing algorithm to minimize network power consumption while satisfying a set of given traffic demands. The second contribution is the near-optimal performance of the algorithm. Simulation results in a real network topology and practical power consumption parameter settings, show that the algorithm achieves 40% energy saving in comparison with OSPF-TE and 18% in comparison with OSPF-EC. Comparing the result with the optimal solution which is obtained by an Integer Linear Programming model shows that the proposed algorithm gives near optimal solution.	algorithm;delay-tolerant networking;integer programming;linear programming;np-hardness;network topology;preprocessor;programming model;routing;simulation;test engineer;two-phase commit protocol	Ehsan Mohammadpour;Bahador Bakhshi	2016	2016 24th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)	10.1109/SOFTCOM.2016.7772177	mathematical optimization;routing;static routing;simulation;engineering;operations management;destination-sequenced distance vector routing	EDA	11.586466517925897	79.26438852584	144125

Motivated by this, we study the advantage of network coding for minimizing the total power needed for multicast in wireless networks. We show that there is an absolute constant, depending only on the power gradient and the dimension of the underlying Euclidean space, that bounds the maximum advantage of network coding. An interesting aspect of our result is that it shows that the advantage of coding remains bounded by a constant even when compared to a multicast scheme without coding that is restricted to do only point-to-point transmissions.	gradient;linear network coding;multicast;point-to-point protocol;sensor	Ashish Goel;Sanjeev Khanna	2008	2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (ipsn 2008)	10.1109/IPSN.2008.29	embedded system;linear network coding;multicast;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;radio resource management;wireless network;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;source-specific multicast;fixed wireless;mobile wireless sensor network;ant;xcast;computer network;multicast address	DB	15.03026897920562	81.09568766456293	144585
3c524ac1b107855c9e29824b20ecafb86fd52c8f	minimum separation distance calculations for incumbent protection in lsa		In this paper, we consider minimum separation distance calculations from the perspective of a real-life Licensed Shared Access (LSA) system in the 2.3 GHz band in Europe. In the LSA system, an LTE network shares spectrum resources with incumbent users, such as programme making and special events (PMSE) users, which need to be protected from harmful interference. Plenty of potential resources are available, in case the incumbent activity is occasional or localized. The sharing scenario requires realistic separation distances to be calculated to protect the incumbents. The minimum separation distances were calculated using methods presented in the ECC report on compatibility studies on 2.3 GHz band, but by using the parameters from the real-life LSA test network. With this work, we bridge the gap between theoretical research for incumbent protection and practical LSA deployment. In the process of defining new separation distances, discrepancies were found in the original example calculations.

However, the position errors of mobile sensors can deteriorate the estimation accuracy of the physical fields. Thus, to optimize the estimation performance, it calls for a trade-off between the resource allocated to localization and communication. In this paper, we first derive the minimum estimation error for the single-sensor case and show how the estimation error is related to localization accuracy and communication rate. Based on the relationship, we then formulate the resource allocation problems and demonstrate that they can be solved by convex optimization. Finally, we extend the single-sensor case into general sensing networks. Numerical results show that the estimation errors can be effectively reduced through optimal resource allocation between localization and communication.	convex optimization;internationalization and localization;mathematical optimization;numerical method;sensor	Hong Hu;Yuan Shen	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842219	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;resource management;distributed computing;wireless	Mobile	14.751667268887992	79.74844337031975	144749

For omnidirectional wireless broadcast to a node, all nodes closer will also be reached. An algorithm for constructing the minimum power tree in wireless networks was first proposed by Wieselthier et al. The broadcast incremental power (BIP) algorithm suggested by them is a “node-based” minimum-cost tree algorithm for wireless networks. We propose an alternate search based paradigm wherein minimum-cost trees in wireless networks are found through a search process. Two computationally efficient procedures for checking the feasibility (viability) of a solution in the search space are presented. A straightforward procedure for initializing the search using stochastically generated trees is also proposed.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;linear programming;list of algorithms;multicast;programming paradigm;search algorithm	Robert J.

We first propose efficient distributed algorithms for data collection problem with approximately the minimum delay, or the minimum number of messages to be sent by all wireless nodes, or the minimum total energy consumption by all wireless nodes respectively. For example, given an algorithm A for data collection, let ϱT, ϱM, and ϱE be the approximation ratio of A in terms of time complexity, message complexity, and energy complexity respectively. We then show that, for data collection, there are networks of n nodes and maximum degree Δ, such that ϱMϱE = Ω(Δ) for any algorithm. In addition, we analytically proved that all our proposed methods are either optimum or within constants factor of the optimum. We further present the message, energy, time complexity and studied the complexity tradeoffs for data aggregation problem.

Hence, a good amount of energy is needed to be transmitted by the transceiver circuit to provide energy to the transponder. Hence, circuit-level energy consumption cannot be ignored in the total energy consumption evaluation of passive RFID systems. Previously, energy consumption evaluation for passive tag anti collision algorithm has been done ignoring circuit-level energy consumption values. This may provide inaccurate results. Here in this paper, an energy consumption evaluation framework for EPC class 1 Gen 2 (passive) based tag anti-collision algorithm has been proposed.

In this paper, the radio irregularity is regarded as a benefit of wireless networks. The proposed novel method for human presence detection, applied to the monitoring system for residential energy management, utilizes radio irregularity for an efficient human presence detection which increases user awareness and automates the power control. The method monitors 2.4GHz wireless (Zigbee) smart outlets and the communication signals between them to detect changes of the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and its variations compared to the expected mean values. The signal strength variation is significantly increased due to human presence within the signal propagation path. By applying the algorithm for principal components analysis to the set of RSSI samples obtained from radio communication links within the detection area, it is possible to recognize a human presence. There is no need for additional presence sensors installation, because the proposed method applied to the smart outlets network is quite satisfactory to extend the entire system with the detection capability. Compared to the conventional sensor networks, the presented solution preserves the pervasiveness of smart energy and smart home systems, high level of sensorial intelligence, simplicity and low installation costs.	algorithm;fuzzy concept;high-level programming language;home automation;image noise;principal component analysis;sensor;software propagation;speedup	Bojan Mrazovac;Milan Z.

Proper designs of various network functions are important not only to prolong the life of a node but also to enable the network to deliver the necessary services with some assurance. In this paper, we use game theory to propose an efficient routing scheme in a WSN that consider the signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) to determine the most optimal paths. The game is modeled as a dynamic, non-cooperative, and incomplete information game with the static sensor nodes as the players in the network. We define a utility function that strikes a balance between energy consumption and delay. We show that Nash equilibrium is obtained for the net utility under certain conditions. Moreover, we show that the Nash equilibrium is self-imposed when the nodes play their best response strategy. Through simulation experiments, we study the performance of the network based on the utility functions. Results reveal that the proposed routing scheme performs better than traditional ones.	bit error rate;experiment;game theory;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;nash equilibrium;network model;programming paradigm;routing;secure communication;sensor;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;utility	Benazir Salma Jamin;Mainak Chatterjee;Tuhina Samanta	2015	2015 IEEE Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing (ISSNIP)	10.1109/ISSNIP.2015.7106920	routing;static routing;simulation;lag;computer science;dynamic source routing;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	11.643014232498114	81.93588648678026	146661

Lots of research is improving QoS factors in sensor networks. However, QoS requirements vary from application to application, WBAN applications are very sensitive, and QoS issues in WBAN need major concern and focus. This paper outlines the WBANs QoS requirements and factors and reviews with emphasis on their strengths some medium access mechanisms that response to some QoS challenges. Moreover, the authors have defined and specified a QWBAN MAC protocol that can allow the integration of QoS architecture over WBAN. A set of QoS modules such as admission control (CAC), bandwidth allocation and scheduling are discussed. Besides that, an integrated QoS architecture is suggested for WBAN to support healthcare applications.

Leveraging antenna arrays at the access point, narrow beams can be steered to different users simultaneously, enhancing spectral efficiency through spatial multiplexing. By employing a number of array elements, M, much larger than the number of users, K, (i.e. massive MIMO), simple linear beamforming algorithms can achieve nearly optimal operation [1]. Operating massive MIMO systems at mm-waves results in compact antenna arrays and wide channel bandwidths. Within the available spectrum, the E-Band communication bandwidth (71 to 76GHz, 81 to 86GHz, and 92 to 95GHz) has recently gained attention for both access and wireless backhaul, due to low oxygen attenuation.	algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);beamforming;cmos;multi-user mimo;spatial multiplexing;spectral efficiency;wireless access point	Lorenzo Lotti;Greg LaCaille;Ali M.

Although various localization algorithms have been recently proposed, most of them require nodes to be equipped with range-determining hardware to obtain distance information. In this paper, we propose a concentric anchor beacon (CAB) localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks. CAB is a range-free approach and uses a small number of anchor nodes. Each anchor emits beacons at different power levels. From the information received by each beacon heard, nodes can determine in which annular ring they are located within each anchor. Each node uses the approximated center of intersection of the rings as its position estimate. We also propose two heuristics, namely CAB with equal area and CAB with equal width, to determine the transmitting power levels of the beacons. Simulation results show that the estimation error is reduced by half when anchors transmit beacons at two different power levels instead of at a single power level. CAB also gives a lower estimation error than some other range-free localization schemes (e.g., centroid and approximated point-in-triangulation) when the anchor-to-node range ratio is less than 4.	anchor text;approximation algorithm;heuristic (computer science);simulation;transmitter	Vijayanth Vivekanandan;Vincent W.

Each lighting device is powered by a lithium battery charged by a solar cell during the day. Timing synchronization packets of application layer are periodically sent from the master node to the slaves. When the master node is failure to work, a new master is elected from slave nodes by a free contention rule. The lighting devices still can flash synchronously visually even in the no-master mode or the multi-master mode. Experimental results show the feasibility of our work.	sync;software deployment;solar cell;synchronization (computer science)	Jinn-Kwei Guo;Churng-Jou Tsai;Chun-Lin Lu;Chung-Fan Liu	2010	2010 International Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks	10.1109/CASoN.2010.45	clock synchronization;embedded system;synchronization;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;lighting;particle detector;light-emitting diode	Robotics	10.086439880373316	83.51774852876886	147903

In such systems, co-existence policies or dynamic spectrum access protocols may also introduce temporal variability in the availability of frequencies for neighbor discovery thus making it challenging to discover neighbors in a short period of time and with low energy consumption. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a baseline scheme (representative of current techniques) where nodes perform discovery by transmitting and receiving beacons randomly across a large frequency range. We also propose and analyze a family of fast, energy-efficient neighbor discovery techniques that use pseudo-random frequency hopping sequences for beacon transmission and reception. For the cases considered, these techniques provide substantial improvements in discovery time and energy consumption relative to the baseline	baseline (configuration management);frequency band;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;heart rate variability;pseudorandomness;randomness;transmitter	Krishna Balachandran;Joseph H.

eac75bcd7e74a82856553e822208027fb096446e	opportunities in vehicular opportunistic networking	bit rate;wireless communication;servers;mobile communication;production;delays;throughput	Following the explosion of Internet-enabled mobile devices and mobile services, users tend to expect network connectivity everywhere they go and at any time. In anticipation of these higher connectivity expectations and requirements especially for vehicular communication, several technologies like WiMAX, cellular networks (i.e., 3G/4G) and wireless mesh networks have been developed. While cellular network communication is either costly or slow, WiMAX which provides data rates comparable to regular WiFi networks, suffers from capacity issues as there are limited channels and hence a limited number of users able to transmit to a single base station. This paper investigates the connectivity challenges in WiFi vehicular opportunistic communications and discusses the utility of such networks at various speeds. We perform a set of simulations to compare state-of-the-art solutions that aim at enhancing the access point entry, production, and exit phases of such communication. We also emulate a best-case solution that enhances most state-of-the-art communication features in order to quantify the potential improvement that can be achieved in vehicular opportunistic networks. The ultimate goal is to provide insights into the true promise and potential of vehicular opportunistic networking.	delay-tolerant networking;interconnection;mesh networking;mobile device;requirement;simulation;single-access key;wireless access point;wireless mesh network	Yomna Sabry;Abderrahmen Mtibaa;Khaled A.

However, the heterogeneity in receivers (e.g., mobile phone cameras) presents a challenge because the receivers differ widely in resolution, distance to the transmitter (LCD), and other factors, and therefore they differ in channel quality. We are researching a communication scheme in which each receiver can decode as much data from an LCD's transmission as the receiver's channel supports. The core idea is to encode the payload into an image's frequency representation rather than directly into pixels. We have successfully transmitted data using a prototype implementation and are currently investigating appropriate channel models.	download;encode;liquid-crystal display;mobile phone;pixel;prototype;radio frequency;transmitter	Frederik Hermans;Liam McNamara;Thiemo Voigt;Christian Rohner;Edith C.-H.

1f25a76e8c03779e12f957be8bea5ac6b912546b	health aspects of wireless communication: health and safety associated with exposure to wireless radiation from personal telecommunication base stations	wireless communication;product cycle;base station;health and safety;public relations;wireless systems	While there are new next-generation network roll-outs due this year, projected cellular mobile phone shipments from major makers continue to show a slowdown in growth. The personal wireless communication business probably will not soon pick up from where its growth left off. When they do, more wireless systems are likely to come on line, each with its own network of base stations. This would extend the trends for the future that look much the same as before the stall in the current product cycle, except that economic, public relations, and regulatory interests would likely lead to co-location of towers and antennas (i.e., locate base stations from different services on the same site or structure.) The geographic region served by a base station is called a cell. A cellular base station or cell site refers to the antennas and their associated electronic equipment. Each base station is the equivalent of a radio station. Co-location of a greater number of base stations would undoubtedly result in increased levels of public exposure to microwave energy over time, Cellular mobile communication systems make use of many base stations (or cells) located throughout a service area. When a user places a call, the handset communicates with a nearby base station. The base station then relays the call to a switching office and then to another cell phone handset, or to the conventional wired telephone network. As the user moves about, from one cell to another, the system automatically hands-off the call, seamlessly, to the next base station. Base stations and antennas are essential for cellular telephone and other wireless communications services. Microwave radiation is used to carry telephone messages and data between the mobile unit and base-station antenna at a fixed cellular site. Together, they make mobile telephony and wireless communication a reality, so that user can communicate, and access data and information, while on the go. While the message or data handling processes and computational capability are all necessary aspects of a wireless communication system, the form and intensity of the transmitted microwave energy is of the greatest interest to biological responses. There are considerable public concerns regarding the biological effects and safety of microwave exposure from wireless base stations. There have been repeated calls for measures and tools that would reduce the exposure to microwave radiation from cellular mobile telephone operations. In fact, at any given time, there are always one or two or maybe a dozen communities trying to stop a proposed base-station site. The radiated power from a base station antenna can vary from less than a watt to as high as 500 watts per channel (or transmitter), depending on the location and type of the antenna used for a cellular communication system. A typical base station antenna is mounted on a tower, on the roof, or on the sides of a building, or on another structure that provides the required height. It may also be mounted indoors, on the ceilings of offices, homes, or airport terminals. These antennas provide tether-less access, with short distances between the transmitter and receiver to enhance and supplant existing wired networks. Higher power antennas are used at rural base stations to relay calls between the user and the wireless telephone system base stations, which are spaced far apart. The distribution of base stations and antenna powers are determined by two related factors of the wireless communication system: Coverage and capacity. An adequate signal strength is necessary to cover the entire service area, and a sufficient capacity is needed to provide enough free channels to accommodate any user within the cell who might wish to use the system. As the number of users grows, more base stations are installed closer together to increase capacity. However, they are operated at lower power levels to provide comparable signal strength and to prevent interference among neighboring base stations. Thus, in urban areas, base stations (or cells) are closer together, but are operated at lower power levels than in rural areas, where the cells tend to be larger. The amount of microwave power radiated from a base station is limited by national and international regulations. For example, in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permits an effective radiated power (ERP) of up to 500 W per channel. A cellular base station may transmit using as many as 21 channels per sector in a sectorial arrangement, typically with three sets of directional transmitting and receiving antennas to cover 360 degrees. Thus, the total ERP can be as high as 10.5 kW per sector. An ERP of 500 watts corresponds to an actual radiated power of 25-50 watts, depending on the type of antenna used. The ERP is higher than the power that is radiated because it takes the directional characteristics of the antenna into account. In rural or less-populated areas, a cellular base station may use several omnidirectional antennas, 3 to 5 m (10 to 15 ft) in length. The antennas may be from 30 to 100 m (100 to 300 ft) above ground. When omnidirectional antennas are used, up to 96 channels could be implemented at a cell site with a maximum radiated power of 48 kW.

These applications often impose stringent QoS requirements including high detection probability, low false alarm rate and bounded detection delay. Although a dense all-static network may initially meet these QoS requirements, it does not adapt to unpredictable dynamics in network conditions (e.g., coverage holes caused by death of nodes) or physical environments (e.g., changed spatial distribution of events). This paper exploits reactive mobility to improve the target detection performance of wireless sensor networks. In our approach, mobile sensors collaborate with static sensors and move reactively to achieve the required detection performance. Specifically, mobile sensors initially remain stationary and are directed to move toward a possible target only when a detection consensus is reached by a group of sensors. The accuracy of final detection result is then improved as the measurements of mobile sensors have higher signal-to-noise ratios after the movement. We develop a sensor movement scheduling algorithm that achieves near-optimal system detection performance within a given detection delay bound. The effectiveness of our approach is validated by extensive simulations using the real data traces collected by 23 sensor nodes.	algorithm;collision detection;digital footprint;mission critical;object detection;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;stationary process;tracing (software);two-phase commit protocol	Rui Tan;Guoliang Xing;Jianping Wang;Hing-Cheung So	2008	2008 16th Interntional Workshop on Quality of Service	10.1109/IWQOS.2008.23	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;operating system;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	13.068517252141383	77.56560550056726	148790

The timing information available in PCMD records allows for maximum-likelihood estimation of subscriber locations using experimental geo-location analysis software suite (GLASS) tools developed at Alcatel-Lucent.

The performance optimization in WVSN is a nonlinear high-dimension constrained optimization problem. In this work, we consider the unique characteristics of WVSN and develop an evolutionary optimization scheme using a swarm intelligence principle to solve the WVSN performance optimization problem. We transform the solution space defined by flow balance and energy constraints into a convex region in a low-dimensional space. We then merge the convex condition with the swarm intelligence principle to guide the movement of each particle during the evolutionary optimization process. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed performance optimization scheme is very efficient.	computational complexity theory;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);convex set;feasible region;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;program optimization;swarm intelligence;video sensor technology;visual sensor network	Bo Wang;Zhihai He	2006	2006 International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2006.312555	mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;wireless sensor network;swarm intelligence;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;metaheuristic;evolutionary computation	Robotics	13.127451905199267	80.64930462020935	149036

In real-time applications of WSN, it is required to deliver data to the sink within a delay constraint. It is significant to design a scheme that maximizes the lifetime of WSN and satisfies delay constraint. To meet this requirement, in this paper, we present the Maximizing Lifetime and Delay Aware Scheme (MLDAS) that uses genetic algorithm, in which stochastic ranking (SR) method is applied, to find an Energy and Delay Aware Tree (EDAT) used to gather data in the WSN. Simulation results show that the MLDAS outperforms some existing schemes in terms of network lifetime and data accuracy.

One key aspect in HetNets is the role of the backhaul. More specifically, it is crucial for a mobile operator to understand the impact of specific technological and architectural upgrades in the mobile backhaul network on the capital and operational expenditure (i.e., CAPEX and OPEX). This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology that can be used to analyze the total cost of ownership of a number of backhaul options based on fiber, microwave, and copper technologies. The study considers both a Greenfield and a Brownfield scenario and takes into account the mobile broadband capacity requirements for the time period between years 2015 and 2025. From the results presented in the paper it can be concluded that even though microwave and fiber will be predominately used in the future, the possible migration paths leading to such fiber- and microwave-based backhaul scenarios might be different, depending upon factors such as spectrum and license costs, time to deployment, availability of equipment, and required quality of service levels.	backhaul (telecommunications);cost efficiency;dark fibre;fiber to the x;microwave;quality of service;reduced cost;requirement;software deployment;telephone exchange;total cost of ownership	Fabricio S.

957136710b8b3538875a4b56ea9dfd2f1abf3dc4	auto-localization algorithm for local positioning systems	robotica e informatica industrial	This paper studies the problem of determining the position of beacon nodes in Local Positioning Systems (LPSs), for which there are no inter-beacon distance measurements available and neither the mobile node nor any of the stationary nodes have positioning or odometry information. The common solution is implemented using a mobile node capable of measuring its distance to the stationary beacon nodes within a sensing radius. Many authors have implemented heuristic methods based on optimization algorithms to solve the problem. However, such methods require a good initial estimation of the node positions in order to find the correct solution. In this paper we present a new method to calculate the inter-beacon distances, and hence the beacons positions, based in the linearization of the trilateration equations into a closed-form solution which does not require any approximate initial estimation. The simulations and field evaluations show a good estimation of the beacon node positions.	approximation algorithm;global positioning system;heuristic;mathematical optimization;odometry;simulation;stationary process	Jorge I.

This          includes the demand for wavelength tunable single frequency laser diodes as well as          the need for optoelectronic integration.

The impact of recent progresses in the material technology on the device          performance is particularly investigated. It is further shown that the availability          of low‐cost, highly complex integrated optoelectronic components represents a prerequisite          for the introduction of optical communication systems in the subscriber area.

To tackle this issue we propose a method for measuring and quantifying radio interference using higher-order statistics. Unlike traditional energy detectors that suffer from several shortcomings in noisy environments, higher-order statistics are robust and do not suffer from threshold uncertainties. We present results of experimental measurements as well as simulations for detecting mutual interference using a normalized fourth-order moment named the kurtosis. The proposed method is independent of the received power and is efficient for detecting low-level interference compared to energy detectors. Results show that not only the presence of interference could be detected but also its strength. As a use case, the proposed method has been applied to Bluetooth mutual interference in this work. In can however be extended to other standards and scenarios.	algorithm;automation;bluetooth;catastrophic interference;high- and low-level;implicit shape model;interference (communication);network packet;requirement;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Ahmad Saad;Barbara Staehle;Yun Chen	2015	2015 IEEE 13th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)	10.1109/INDIN.2015.7281862	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;zero-forcing precoding	Visualization	20.079525978354596	80.00878842421002	149720

In this paper, we propose an improved TDoA-based tracking algorithm for mobile-WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) systems. The position of a MS (Mobile Station) is estimated by the network-based TDoA location scheme when the MS is located in the GPS (Global Positioning System) shadow area. The proposed algorithm compares the estimated position of a current state to the previous states, for achieving high reliability. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the detection probability about 10 % points, compared to the conventional TDoA-only positioning algorithm in the ITU-R (International Telecommunication Union-Radiocommunication sector) micro-cell environment, using the Pedestrian-B channel model which has a large delay spread profile. The proposed scheme's improvement helps to satisfy the E-911 standard when utilizing information from three RASs (Radio Access Stations).	algorithm;channel (communications);global positioning system;interoperability;microwave;multilateration;simulation	Sanhae Kim;Jungwoo Lee;Myungsik Yoo;Yoan Shin	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5450340	global positioning system;telecommunications;computer science;multilateration;fdoa;statistics;computer network	Mobile	22.417960551723283	75.11933852260756	149974

Therefore, we seek to design a localization algorithm based on statistical framework that can combine the localization methodology of both autonomous robotics and sensor networks, such that a two-way cooperative localization can be accomplished instead of the usual one-way only cooperation. To achieve this, we need to integrate three important research areas: wireless sensor networks, robotics and statistical filtering. In this paper, we will present the key elements of our approach and simulation results to validate the scheme. We prove that mobile robots and static sensor nodes can cooperatively help each other in their localization by first localizing the mobile robots with the static nodes, after which the mobile robots will provide feedback to the static nodes so that the static nodes can then refine their own location estimates.	avt statistical filtering algorithm;autonomous robot;internationalization and localization;mobile robot;one-way function;robotics;simulation	Chee Keong Seovv;Winston Khoon Guan Seah;Zheng Liu	2007	2007 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Intelligent Control	10.1109/ISIC.2007.4450856	control engineering;embedded system;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Robotics	14.221394208581895	75.17360864540343	149987

The schemes are designed to be lightweight, so that even computationally-constrained devices can support them. We identify the main propagation properties of MMW signals that have an impact on localization and design three algorithms that exploit these, namely a triangulation-validation procedure, an angle difference-of-arrival approach, and a scheme based on location fingerprinting. We evaluate the algorithms by means of simulations, and draw conclusions on their robustness. We then validate our results via measurements involving commercial pre- standard 60- GHz MMW hardware. Our experiments confirm that, by relying only on a single anchor and without requiring complex signal processing at the receiver, the algorithms can localize a node with high probability, and in many cases with sub-meter accuracy. We conclude by discussing how these algorithms complement each other in terms of robustness and localization success probability.	algorithm;experiment;failure;fingerprint (computing);internationalization and localization;phased array;signal processing;simulation;software propagation;with high probability	Alain Olivier;Guillermo Bielsa;Irene Tejado;Michele Zorzi;Joerg Widmer;Paolo Casari	2016	2016 13th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)	10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7732999	simulation;telecommunications	Embedded	20.439552443240668	75.57663525631935	150003

Power conservation is a primary research concern for these networks. Often, the single most important savings can be obtained by switching off the wireless receiver when not needed. In this paper, we describe an algorithm which allows the nodes to learn the behavior of each other by only observing the transmission behaviors, and from this derive the schedule without external help. Our approach is robust to statistical variations in the nodal transmission periods. We draw important conclusions on the effect of quasi-periodicity on the scalability of the solution.

The topology parameters, such as the number of beacons, the beacons' heights from the ground and the appropriate distance between the beacons, have to be also evaluated to satisfy the localization requirements. In the present work1 we investigate the feasibility of sensor node localization by exploiting the inherent resources of the WSN technology, specifically the RSS of the exchanged messages. It is demonstrated that the RSS can be used for outdoor localization under well-defined topology constraints. Localization techniques, topology parameters and factors influencing the localization accuracy are combined in simulation examples to evaluate their impact concerning the positioning accuracy. Furthermore, the RF propagation model and the topology parameters being identified are validated in real outdoor localization experiments.	experiment;rss;radio frequency;requirement;sensor node;simulation;software propagation	Tsenka Stoyanova;Fotis Kerasiotis;Christos P.

However, the coexistence of LTE and WiFi technologies in the same unlicensed bands needs careful design to avoid severe interference between them. In this paper, we propose a coexistence scheme to create opportunities for LTE-LAA small cells and WiFi devices to transmit simultaneously. We combine Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) direction of arrival (DOA) estimation with null steering techniques to avoid collisions between LTE-LAA and WiFi transmissions. We assume that the LTE-LAA small cells are equipped with the latest 802.11 receivers for monitoring WiFi transmissions and for capturing simultaneous transmission timing. The performance of the proposed scheme in terms of collision avoidance and channel occupancy time ratio is evaluated via simulations. The results show that with DOA estimation and null steering, LTE-LAA small cells can transmit simultaneously with nearby WiFi devices without causing significant interference to them. As a result, LTE-LAA small cells can gain much more channel access opportunities and longer channel occupancy time while being “invisible” to coexisting WiFi networks.	coexist (image);collision detection;compaq lte;direction of arrival;estimation theory;interference (communication);music (algorithm);scheduling (computing);simulation	Long Li;Amir Hossein Jafari;Xiaoli Chu;Jie Zhang	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7511073	embedded system;estimation;telecommunications link;telecommunications;interference;statistics	Mobile	24.054188791435546	83.8077707353922	150534

The system implementation is based on the GNU Radio software platform with the Universal Software Radio Peripheral as the hardware component. Even though the technique needs some modification at the reference nodes in the form of a rotational directional antenna, we show that the mobile nodes do not need hardware modifications. We use maximum likelihood based amplitude estimation and least squares based line-of-sight time-delay estimation, to account for the presence of multipath components in the received signal. These techniques enable a more accurate estimation of the bearing of the mobile node with respect to each of the reference nodes. The proposed algorithm does not require any synchronization between the reference nodes and the mobile node. However, the reference nodes are assumed to be synchronized.

If all of data are transmitted to a Fusion Center (FC), the power of sensor node would run out rapidly. On the other hand, the data also needs a filter to remove the noise. Therefore, an efficient fusion estimation model, which can save the energy of the sensor nodes while maintaining higher accuracy, is needed. This paper proposes a novel mixed H₂/H∞-based energy-efficient fusion estimation model (MHEEFE) for energy-limited Wearable Body Networks. In the proposed model, the communication cost is firstly reduced efficiently while keeping the estimation accuracy. Then, the parameters in quantization method are discussed, and we confirm them by an optimization method with some prior knowledge. Besides, some calculation methods of important parameters are researched which make the final estimates more stable. Finally, an iteration-based weight calculation algorithm is presented, which can improve the fault tolerance of the final estimate. In the simulation, the impacts of some pivotal parameters are discussed.

ac38329d77d1801caca5a4cc6f306a3178eeb30d	distributed laser charging: a wireless power transfer approach		Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising solution to provide convenient and perpetual energy supplies to electronics. Traditional WPT technologies face the challenge of providing Watt-level power over meter-level distance for Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices, such as sensors, controllers, smart-phones, laptops, etc. Distributed laser charging (DLC), a new WPT alternative, has the potential to solve these problems and enable WPT with the similar experience as WiFi communications. In this paper, we present a multimodule DLC system model, in order to illustrate its physical fundamentals and mathematical formula. This analytical modeling enables the evaluation of power conversion or transmission for each individual module, considering the impacts of laser wavelength, transmission attenuation, and photovoltaic-cell (PV-cell) temperature. Based on the linear approximation of electricity-to-laser and laser-to-electricity power conversion validated by measurement and simulation, we derive the maximum power transmission efficiency in closed-form. Thus, we demonstrate the variation of the maximum power transmission efficiency depending on the supply power at the transmitter, laser wavelength, transmission distance, and PV-cell temperature. Similar to the maximization of information transmission capacity in wireless information transfer (WIT), the maximization of the power transmission efficiency is equally important in WPT. Therefore, this paper not only provides the insight of DLC in theory, but also offers the guideline of DLC system design in practice.

The computation time of the proposed algorithm increases exponentially with the number of the sensor types, while that of standard algorithms is exponential in the number of the sensors. This confirms high speed performance of the proposed algorithm, since the number of sensor types is usually far less than the number of sensors.	algorithm;computation;scheduling (computing);sensor;time complexity	Shogo Arai;Yasushi Iwatani;Koichi Hashimoto	2011	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2011.2141450	electronic engineering;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;soft sensor;computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;scheduling	Robotics	16.91331173890906	78.69448304221794	150904

A popular infrastructure-free solution for indoor positioning is a calibration-based positioning, commonly known as fingerprinting. Fingerprinting solutions require extensive and error-free surveys of environments to build radio-map databases, which play a key role in position estimation. Fingerprinting also requires random updates of the database, when there are significant changes in the environment or a decrease in the accuracy. The calibration of the fingerprinting database is a time-consuming and laborious effort that prevents the extensive adoption of this technique. In this paper, we present a systematic LOCALIzation approach, """"LOCALI"""", for indoor positioning, which does not require a calibration database and extensive updates. The LOCALI exploits the floor plan/wall map of the environment to estimate the target position by generating radio maps by integrating path-losses over certain trajectories in complex indoor environments, where triangulation using time information or the received signal strength level is highly erroneous due to the fading effects caused by multi-path propagation or absorption by environmental elements or varying antenna alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that by using the map information and environmental parameters, a significant level of accuracy in indoor positioning can be achieved. Moreover, this process requires considerably lesser effort compared to the calibration-based techniques."""	antenna device component;calibration;database;estimated;fingerprint (computing);global positioning system;indoor positioning system;map;mathematical optimization;mike lesser;multipath propagation;numerous;software propagation;solutions;transmitter;establishment and maintenance of localization;triangulation	Muhammad Usman Ali;Soojung Hur;Yongwan Park	2017		10.3390/s17061213	fingerprint;simulation;internationalization and localization;induced pluripotent stem cell;telecommunications;computer science;remote sensing	HCI	19.48744954122026	75.25531902966598	150938

Using a tutorial style, this paper surveys and updates the literature contributions that have applied a diverse set of theoretical games to solve a variety of challenging problems, namely in wireless data communication networks. During our literature discussion, the games are initially divided into three groups: classical, evolutionary, and incomplete information. Then, the classical games are further divided into three subgroups: non-cooperative, repeated, and cooperative. This paper reviews applications of games to develop adaptive algorithms and protocols for the efficient operation of some standardized uses cases at the edge of emerging heterogeneous networks. Finally, we highlight the important challenges, open issues, and future research directions where GT can bring beneficial outcomes to emerging wireless data networking applications.	algorithm;game theory;semantic network;telecommunications network;world-system	Jose Moura;David Hutchison	2017	CoRR		simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;management science;mathematical economics;algorithm	Mobile	21.115808244722327	85.07016532478505	151126

These induce distortions on the correlation function that reflect upon a degraded pseudoranges measurement and poor positioning accuracy. On the other hand, the wide spread use of GNSS receivers in critical applications demands for improved performance in terms of positioning accuracy and integrity. This paper proposes a new algorithm based on the statistical testing of post-correlation measurements to detect signal distortions and to prevent degradations in the receiver positioning performance. The application of statistical tests to GNSS is not yet deeply investigated, but some recent works already show good performance when Goodness of Fit (GoF) tests are applied to raw signal samples to detect interference. The paper presents a quality monitoring algorithm, based on the application of a statistical testing, known as sign test, applied to the post correlation stage of a GNSS receiver. Promising results are obtained to detect distortions in the correlation shape, for two different harsh environments, i.e., with the presence of interference sources and under a spoofing attack. The main advantages of the proposed method are the low complexity, the indipendence from the type of disturbance and the possibility of its application to any GNSS modulation.	algorithm;carrier-to-noise ratio;data integrity;degraded mode;distortion;experiment;interference (communication);modulation;multipath propagation;phase detector;satellite navigation;simulation;spoofing attack;statistical model	Micaela Troglia Gamba;Beatrice Motella;Marco Pini	2013	2013 International Conference on Localization and GNSS (ICL-GNSS)	10.1109/ICL-GNSS.2013.6577267	electronic engineering;gnss augmentation;geography;telecommunications;remote sensing	Mobile	20.79718104152471	75.84869874814066	151150

Ideally, a broadcasting algorithm should have the ability to quickly disseminate data, while keeping the number of transmissions low. In this paper we develop a model describing the message count in large-scale wireless sensor networks. We focus our attention on the popular Trickle algorithm, which has been proposed as a suitable communication protocol for code maintenance and propagation in wireless sensor networks. Besides providing a mathematical analysis of the algorithm, we propose a generalized version of Trickle, with an additional parameter defining the length of a listen-only period. This generalization proves to be useful for optimizing the design and usage of the algorithm. For single-cell networks we show how the message count increases with the size of the network and how this depends on the Trickle parameters. Furthermore, we derive distributions of inter-broadcasting times and investigate their asymptotic behavior. Our results prove conjectures made in the literature concerning the effect of a listen-only period. Additionally, we develop an approximation for the expected number of transmissions in multi-cell networks. All results are validated by simulations.	algorithm;approximation;communications protocol;simulation;software propagation	Thomas M. M. Meyfroyt;Sem C. Borst;Onno J.

4d6d924907c44fb2307052322c2bb19512804835	kalman prediction based proportional fair resource allocation for a solar powered wireless downlink		Optimization of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) downlink with an energy harvesting transmitter (base station) is considered. The base station (BS), which is attached to the central controller of the network, sends control information to the gateways of individual WSNs in the downlink. This paper specifically addresses the case where the BS is supplied with solar energy. Leveraging the daily periodicity inherent in solar energy harvesting, the schedule for delivery of maintenance messages from the BS to the nodes of a distributed network is optimized. Differences in channel gain from the BS to sensor nodes make it a challenge to provide service to each of them while efficiently spending the harvested energy. Based on PTF (Power-Time-Fair), a close-to-optimal solution for fair allocation of harvested energy in a wireless downlink proposed in previous work, we develop an online algorithm, PTF-On, that operates two algorithms in tandem: A prediction algorithm based on a Kalman filter that operates on solar irradiation measurements, and a modified version of PTF. PTF-On can predict the energy arrival profile throughout the day and schedule transmission to nodes to maximize total throughput in a proportionally fair way. key words: Broadcast, energy harvesting, proportional fairness, time sharing, industrial wireless sensor networks, solar energy, Kalman filter, prediction.	fairness measure;kalman filter;online algorithm;proportionally fair;quasiperiodicity;telecommunications link;throughput;time-sharing;transmitter	Neyre Tekbiyik;Elif Tugce Ceran;Kemal Leblebicioglu;Tolga Girici;Elif Uysal-Biyikoglu	2018	CoRR		computer network;online algorithm;wireless sensor network;throughput;proportionally fair;telecommunications link;computer science;communication channel;base station;resource allocation	Mobile	14.733495228317505	83.68557177323456	151601

We address the estimation of a target multidimensional process by means of samples captured by nodes randomly and uniformly distributed and transmitted to a collector through a self-organizing clustered network. The estimation in the presence and in the absence of collaborative signal processing with different types of data interpolators are compared in terms of both process estimation error and network life-time. Our analytical model, aimed at providing useful information for WSN design, takes many aspects into account, such as distance-dependent path loss and shadowing, energy consumption, information routing, process estimation quality, node density, transmission protocol and system parameters. As an example result, fixing requirements on estimation errors and network life-time, the node density is found as a function of the system/protocol parameters.	approximation;communicating sequential processes;interdependence;organizing (structure);performance evaluation;randomness;requirement;routing;self-organization;sensor;signal processing;software propagation	Roberto Verdone;Andrea Conti;Daniele Sangiorgi;Davide Dardari	2004	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2004.

To compare all technologies on an equal basis, we have developed an analyzer that computes the energy consumption for a given protocol based on the power required in a given state (Sleep, Idle, Tx, and Rx) and the duration of each state. We consider the case of an energy constrained node that uploads data to a sink, analyzing the physical (PHY) layer under medium access control (MAC) constraints, and assuming IPv6 traffic whenever possible. This paper considers the energy spent in retransmissions due to corrupted frames and collisions as well as the impact of imperfect clocks. The comparison shows that the BLE offers the best lifetime for all traffic intensities in its capacity range. LoRa achieves long lifetimes behind 802.15.4 and BLE for ultra low traffic intensity; SIGFOX only matches LoRa for very small data sizes. Moreover, considering the energy consumption due to retransmissions of lost data packets only decreases the lifetimes without changing their relative ranking. We believe that these comparisons will give all users of IoT technologies indications about the technology that best fits their needs from the energy consumption point of view. Our analyzer will also help IoT network designers to select the right MAC parameters to optimize the energy consumption for a given application.		&#x00C9;lodie Morin;Mickael Maman;Roberto Guizzetti;Andrzej Duda	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2688279	wireless sensor network;6lowpan;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;clock drift;computer security;internet of things;computer network	Mobile	11.514627048076015	84.94007987035641	151888

The optimal quantization scheme minimizes the mean squared estimation error subjected simultaneously to both a total system power as well as individual node power constraints. According to the derived optimal scheme, sensors with poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) refrain from transmitting their observations. The rest of the sensors transmit their quantized observations. The number of quantized bits depends on the SNR and the maximum power constraint at each node.

This paper proposes a decentralized MRTA approach considering the robots' residual expendable resources and their limited communication ranges. The proposed approach consists of two algorithms, namely, resource-aware cost generation (RCG) and ad hoc network-based task allocation (ANTA). The RCG algorithm allows each robot to generate a credible cost of task performance considering its residual resources in task planning. The ANTA algorithm constructs the minimal spanning tree network among the robots and determines the robot with the lowest cost for the task through multihop communication in a decentralized manner. The advantages of the proposed approach are minimization of unnecessary task performance cost caused by resource shortage of robots during task execution and the use of an ad hoc network among the robots to allow more robots to participate in the task allocation process. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through computer simulations for multirobot foraging as a test problem.	algorithm;computer simulation;file spanning;hoc (programming language);minimum spanning tree;range concatenation grammars;robot;tree network	Dong-Hyun Lee;Sheir Afgen Zaheer;Jong-Hwan Kim	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2014.2326987	simulation;engineering;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	12.713132682114	75.37541592851302	151957
8777d0c617e0eed82d451dd6961585d286028ba4	a survey on hybrid beamforming techniques in 5g: architecture and system model perspectives		The increasing wireless data traffic demands have driven the need to explore suitable spectrum regions for meeting the projected requirements. In the light of this, millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has received considerable attention from the research community. Typically, in fifth generation (5G) wireless networks, mmWave massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications is realized by the hybrid transceivers which combine high dimensional analog phase shifters and power amplifiers with lower-dimensional digital signal processing units. This hybrid beamforming design reduces the cost and power consumption which is aligned with an energy-efficient design vision of 5G. In this paper, we track the progress in hybrid beamforming for massive MIMO communications in the context of system models of the hybrid transceivers’ structures, the digital and analog beamforming matrices with the possible antenna configuration scenarios and the hybrid beamforming in heterogeneous wireless networks. We extend the scope of the discussion by including resource management issues in hybrid beamforming. We explore the suitability of hybrid beamforming methods, both, existing and proposed till first quarter of 2017, and identify the exciting future challenges in this domain.

The proposed approach analyzes the shape of the Doppler spectrum of the received signal which is correlated to the number of people moving in the monitored environment. Unlike a radar-like approach, the use of a reference signal is not required. Experimental results are presented for two different rooms/environments without any constraint on the movements of the volunteers.	confusion matrix;doppler effect;radar	Simone Di Domenico;Giovanni Pecoraro;Ernestina Cianca;Mauro De Sanctis	2016	2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)	10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763227	estimation;simulation;doppler effect;telecommunications;computer science;radio frequency;wireless;statistics	Robotics	23.166663071187447	76.21764671185417	151976

The adoption of PTZ cameras with dynamic field of view nature can increase the resolution of mobile targets and adapt the network coverage significantly. However, leverage these benefits calls for more configuration cost and sophisticated solutions. In this paper, we consider the specific problem of coverage problem in terms of configuration cost and coverage quality in PTZ camera networks. We argue that the coverage algorithms can exploit the dynamic field of view nature of PTZ cameras to reduce the configuration cost by taking into account the heterogeneous coverage quality demands for different targets in a surveillance application. We propose a new coverage definition, termed probability coverage (p-coverage), according to the patrolling property of PTZ cameras. A optimal coverage issues, min-quantity, is formulated underlying the proposed p-coverage framework. A greedy-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the above probability-based optimal coverage problem. The proposed solutions are evaluated to highlight the relative significance of configuration cost gain with respect to diverse coverage demand.	cost efficiency;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);maxima and minima;pan–tilt–zoom camera	Pu Zhou;Jing Wu;Chengnian Long	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364318	computer vision;patrolling;greedy algorithm;simulation;next-generation network;computer science;probability;computer security;statistics	Robotics	13.256225336854873	77.78274693468003	152530

Wi-Fi was not designed to operate in such scenarios. Because of its contention based channel access and backoff procedure, Wi-Fi presents low channel access efficiency and sensible performance degradation in terms of user throughput for dense deployments. This paper discusses the challenges of Wi-Fi operation in dense deployment scenarios and the benefits of a proposed adaptive transmit power mechanism.

Compared with general Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), WBANs have more stringent requirements on reliability and energy efficiency. Though WBANs are applied within limited transmission range, the on-body channel condition can be very challenging because of blocking or absorbing of signal. In this paper, we are looking into the design of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols and propose an opportunistic scheduling scheme by applying heuristic scheduling and dynamic superframe length adjustment to improve the system performance.

It is also recognized that more efficient allocations could be achieved through spectrum markets; however, most discussions have so far focused on secondary markets, which are managed by licensees. Here we take a more expansive view, and discuss some challenges and implications of implementing extensive spectrum markets across locations, time, and diverse sets of applications. The discussion is motivated by first examining the fundamental question: Is spectrum scarce or abundant? Given that spectrum is indeed scarce, and that spectrum property rights are appropriately defined, we speculate on the emergence of a two-tier market; the upper tier consists of spectrum owners that trade spectrum assets analogous to land rights, and the lower tier consists of spot markets for limited-duration rentals of spectrum assets from owners at particular locations. The changes such spectrum markets could bring to the provision of wireless services and wireless network design are discussed along with methods for addressing related interference management issues.	centralized computing;e-services;emergence;interference (communication);multitier architecture;network planning and design;norm (social);software deployment;spectral efficiency;stellar classification	Randall Berry;Michael L.

The hybrid satellite terrestrial network based on the control and user plane (C/U) separation concept is expected to support flexible and customized resource scheduling and management toward global ubiquitous networking and unified service architecture. In this paper, centralized and distributed resource management strategies (CRMS and DRMS) are proposed and compared com- prehensively in terms of throughput, power consumption, spectral and energy efficiency (SE and EE) and coverage probability, utilizing the mature stochastic geometry. Numerical results show that, compared with DRMS strategy, the U-plane cooperation between satellite and terrestrial network under CRMS strategy could improve the throughput and EE by nearly 136% and 60% respectively in ultra-sparse networks and greatly enhance the U-plane coverage probability (approximately 77%). Efficient resource management mechanism is suggested for the hybrid network according to the network deployment for the future 5G wireless network.	centralized computing;forwarding plane;image plane;job scheduler;numerical method;profiling (computer programming);scheduling (computing);software deployment;sparse matrix;terrestrial television;throughput;ubiquitous computing	Jiaxin Zhang;Barry G.

8f098dbfe8f7dc46e2e784e430c243d0e23e978d	on the performance of indoor ultra-dense networks for millimetre-wave cellular systems		The combination of Ultra-Dense Networks (UDN) and millimetre Waves (mmW) communications has recently been recognized by the industry and research community as a promising solution to cope with the evolving requirements of the fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks. Indeed, the problem of capacity provisioning has drawn the attention to mmW due to the spectrum scarcity at lower frequency bands. Additionally, the densification process has already started with the introduction of the well-known Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets).Thus the use of UDN is another natural approach for increasing the overall network capacity, especially in such indoor environments where high data rates and service demand are expected. In this paper, the combination of the previous paradigms is analysed by means of comprehensive system-level simulations. Unfortunately, the particularities of indoor deployments make radio propagation difficult to predict and limit the macro-cell coverage, hence these simulations have been evaluated using advanced Ray Tracing (RT) techniques. Results confirm the superior system performance of the mmW and UDN tandem with respect to current operating bands.

We first formulate our problem as an optimization problem and show that it is NP-Hard. Then, we design two algorithms: a fixed-tree relaxation-based and a novel and very efficient local distributed optimization to optimize jointly the sensor selection and the routing structure. We also provide a lower bound for our optimization problem and show that our local distributed optimization algorithm provides a performance that is close to this bound. Although there is no guarantee that the gap between this lower bound and the optimal solution of the main problem is always small, our numerical experiments support that this gap is actually very small in many cases. An important result from our work is that because of the interplay between the communication cost over the links and the gains in estimation accuracy obtained by choosing certain sensors, the traditional shortest-path-tree routing structure, widely used in practice, is no longer optimal, that is, our routing structures provide a better trade-off between the overall power efficiency and the final estimation accuracy obtained at the querying node. Comparing to more conventional sensor selection and fixed routing algorithms, our proposed joint sensor selection and routing algorithms yields a significant amount of energy saving.	algorithm;convex optimization;experiment;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;numerical analysis;optimization problem;performance per watt;routing;sensor;shortest path problem	Santosh Shah;Baltasar Beferull-Lozano	2012	2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems	10.1109/DCOSS.2012.19	algorithm design;mathematical optimization;routing;static routing;convex optimization;wireless sensor network;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;machine learning;distributed computing	EDA	14.245714909331532	80.21556105945487	154093

Visible light communication (VLC) is an alternative method to reduce the burden of RF-based communication, especially in indoor communications. 70% of the communication is indoors, and light emitting diode (LED) arrays are spreading for illumination purposes thanks to their low energy and higher lifetime. VLC can be realized as a secondary application in LED arrays that are placed for lighting. In this way, some of the wireless traffic can be sent using light, with less cost and less carbon footprint. For these reasons, VLC attracts significant research interests. We provide an extensive survey of the current literature by outlining challenges and future research areas in order to facilitate future research in this area. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

21ed73c04b03f678f0f238b7598fd7ea2d42b3b5	probabilistic per-packet real-time guarantees for wireless networked sensing and control		The mission-critical nature of wireless networked sensing and control (WSC) systems, such as the control of industrial plants, requires stringent real-time delivery of packets. Due to inherent dynamics and uncertainties in wireless communication, real-time communication guarantees are probabilistic in nature. In this paper, a probabilistic framework is therefore proposed for per-packet real-time delivery guarantee. The notion of real-time in this paper differs from the existing work in the sense that it ensures, in an execution history of arbitrary length, every packet is successfully delivered before its deadline with a probability no less than a user-specified threshold (e.g., 99%). The framework has several novel building blocks: First, “R3 (requirement-reliability-resource) mapping” translates the upper layer probabilistic real-time communication requirement, and the lower layer links reliability into the resource (i.e., optimal number of transmission opportunities) reserved for each packet. Second, “EDF (earliest deadline first) based real-time scheduling” as well as the “admission test” and “traffic load optimization” maximize system utility while satisfying per-packet real-time communication requirements. The proposed admission test is proved to be both sufficient and necessary, and the simulation results show that the proposed framework ensures probabilistic per-packet real-time communication.	earliest deadline first scheduling;mathematical optimization;mission critical;network packet;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;world sudoku championship	Yu Chen;Hongwei Zhang;Nathan Fisher;Le Yi Wang;George Yin	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2018.2795567	computer science;real-time computing;wireless network;wireless sensor network;probabilistic logic;scheduling (computing);earliest deadline first scheduling;job shop scheduling;wireless;network packet	Embedded	11.064716128843667	84.34451304484386	154319

fa87bec88c501204d60fca931c9860fcd9f30331	mutual-information-based incremental relaying communications for wireless biomedical implant systems	qos;wbans;communication protocol;network lifetime	Network lifetime maximization of wireless biomedical implant systems is one of the major research challenges of wireless body area networks (WBANs). In this paper, a mutual information (MI)-based incremental relaying communication protocol is presented where several on-body relay nodes and one coordinator are attached to the clothes of a patient. Firstly, a comprehensive analysis of a system model is investigated in terms of channel path loss, energy consumption, and the outage probability from the network perspective. Secondly, only when the MI value becomes smaller than the predetermined threshold is data transmission allowed. The communication path selection can be either from the implanted sensor to the on-body relay then forwards to the coordinator or from the implanted sensor to the coordinator directly, depending on the communication distance. Moreover, mathematical models of quality of service (QoS) metrics are derived along with the related subjective functions. The results show that the MI-based incremental relaying technique achieves better performance in comparison to our previous proposed protocol techniques regarding several selected performance metrics. The outcome of this paper can be applied to intra-body continuous physiological signal monitoring, artificial biofeedback-oriented WBANs, and telemedicine system design.	anatomy, regional;beckwith-wiedemann syndrome;biofeedback;body dysmorphic disorders;communications protocol;downtime;electromyography;expectation–maximization algorithm;implants;increment;mathematical model;mathematics;mutual information;network topology;patients;provisioning;quality of service;relay device component;routing;small;systems design;telemedicine;testbed;sensor (device)	Yangzhe Liao;Mark S.

In this context, cloud-based radio access networks have garnered significant interest as a cost-effective solution to the problem of coping with denser networks and providing higher data rates. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, a quantitative analysis of the cost of such networks is yet to be undertaken. This paper develops a theoretic framework that enables computation of the deployment cost of a network (modeled using various spatial point processes) to answer the question posed by the paper's title. Then, the framework obtained is used along with a complexity model, which enables computing the information processing costs of a network, to compare the deployment cost of a cloud-based network against that of a traditional LTE network, and to analyze why they are more economical. Using this framework and an exemplary budget, this paper shows that cloud-based radio access networks require approximately 10% to 15% less capital expenditure per square kilometer than traditional LTE networks. It also demonstrates that the cost savings depend largely on the costs of base stations and the mix of backhaul technologies used to connect base stations with data centers.	access network;backhaul (telecommunications);cloud computing;compaq lte;computation;data center;information processing;software deployment;theory	Vinay Suryaprakash;Peter Rost;Gerhard P.

The deployed sensors are unreliable. We characterize imperfect sensors with misdetection and false-alarm probabilities. We model intruder activities with Markov Chains. A set of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) models the imperfect sensors and intruder activities to be monitored. A novel sequential change detection/isolation algorithm is developed to detect and isolate a change from an HMM representing no intruder activity to another HMM representing some intruder activities. Procedures for estimating the entry time and the trace of intruder activities are developed. A domain monitoring example is given to illustrate the presented concepts and computational procedures.	algorithm;computation;hidden markov model;markov chain;sensor	Tae-Sic Yoo;Humberto E.

However, the Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) error mitigation has considerable importance in localization of wireless nodes. In order to mitigate NLOS errors in indoor localization this paper proposes and investigates a novel approach which creates a hybrid combination of channel impulse response (CIR)-based fingerprinting (FP) positioning and an iterative Time of Arrival (TOA) real time positioning method using Ultra Wideband (UWB) signaling. Besides, to reduce the calculation complexities in FP method, this paper also introduces a unique idea for the arrangement of reference nodes (or tags) to create a fingerprinting database. The simulation results confirm that the proposed hybrid method yields better positioning accuracies and is much more robust in NLOS error mitigation than TOA only and FP only and a conventional iterative positioning method.	committed information rate;computational complexity theory;fingerprint (computing);greater;iterative method;large;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;line-of-sight (missile);node - plant part;performance;sensor node;simulation;small;time of arrival;ultra-wideband	Md.

The paper examines ways of extending the life of such networks by introducing a 'sleep mode' in the sensor node. Quantitative analysis is used to show that although there is a complex relationship between 'sleeping' and energy conservation, it is possible to make significant energy savings while incurring only modest degradation in performance. A n optimum energy saving curve is derived which provides a basis for the design of extended-life ad hoc wireless sensor networks.	elegant degradation;hoc (programming language);network packet;quality of service;sensor node;sleep mode;smart battery;telecommunications network;throughput	Qiang Gao;Keith J.

Based on existing approaches, we start our study from the standard random deployment of a sensor network and then we consider a coarse-grain localization algorithm which associates sensors with coordinates related to a central node, called sink. Once each sensor is related to an estimated position, it starts to send data to the sink according to a provided scheduling of communications which takes care of energy consumption, collisions and time. We propose a scheduling of communications based on distributed and fast coloring algorithms which require O(1) computational time. As the localization is referred to coarse-grain coordinates, it happens that more than one sensor is associated with the same coordinates, hence leader-election mechanism is considered.	geographic coordinate system;routing	Alfredo Navarra;Maria Cristina Pinotti	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-19222-7_16	real-time computing;computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	11.402783418528612	77.98170608846496	155098
fa192e467393f83294f1c24f4d20c92fad4455b2	narrowband internet of things: evolutions, technologies, and open issues		We are on the threshold of the explosive growth in the global Internet-of-Things (IoT) market. Comparing with the legacy human-centric applications, machine type communication scenarios exhibit totally different characteristics, such as low throughput, delay insensitivity, occasional transmission, and deep coverage. Meanwhile, it also requires the terminal devices to be cheap enough and sustain long battery life. These demands hasten the prosperity of low power wide area (LPWA) technologies. Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is the newest Long Term Evolution (LTE) specification ratified by the third generation partner project as one of the LPWA solutions to achieve the objectives of super coverage, low power, low cost, and massive connection. Working in the licensed frequency band, it is designed to reuse and coexist with the existing LTE cellular networks, which endows it with outstanding advantages in decreasing network installation cost and minimizing product time-to-market. In this backdrop, it has been extensively regarded as one of the most promising technologies toward the IoT landscape. However, as a new LTE standard, there are still a lot of challenges that need to overcome. This paper surveys its evolutions, technologies, and issues, spanning from performance analysis, design optimization, combination with other leading technologies, to implementation and application. The goal is to deliver a holistic understanding for the emerging wireless communication system, in helping to spur further research in accelerating the broad use of NB-IoT.	backdrop cms;coexist (image);compaq lte;file spanning;frequency band;holism;internet of things;mathematical optimization;naive bayes classifier;profiling (computer programming);throughput	Jun Xu;Junmei Yao;Lu Wang;Zhong Ming;Kaishun Wu;Lei Chen	2018	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2017.2783374	throughput;computer network;computer science;narrowband;reuse;telecommunications link;wireless;internet of things;narrowband iot;cellular network	Mobile	22.052171134618742	87.45918888343431	155518

These heterogeneous applications lead to many constraints that need to be addressed in a flexible way. We investigate the division of the bandwidth into several subbands, each one having a given physical layer numerology to support a given type of 5G services. This work highlights and demonstrates the possible coexistence of Broadband, Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency and Internet of Things services within the same channel using a flexible waveform. We describe field-test experiments carried out with an implementation of the BF-OFDM (Block-Filtered OFDM) physical layer on custom hardware prototyping boards.

be93ba5e19ebc5615371d4d4f476260460bf3e43	qos enhanced channel access in ieee 802.11ah networks		Recently, the IEEE 802.11ah protocol has been released for communication between low power IoT devices. IEEE 802.11ah is a wireless LAN technology that operates in the unlicensed low frequency band of 1GHz or lower and is a technology created for network communication between IoT devices. IEEE 802.11ah has a new feature called RAW (Restricted Access Window) to handle large numbers of nodes in a long range. The RAW mechanism groups the nodes and allows only the nodes belonging to the RAW selected by the access point (AP) to have channel access. The RAW mechanism is an effective way to reduce collisions between nodes. However, 802.11ah supports a long transmission range and many sensor nodes will try to access the channel. If RAW size is set small, there will be many collisions between nodes, and delays will occur. If RAW size is set large, delay will occur because RAW Turn Around time increases. As a result, the quality of service cannot be guaranteed. So we proposed two new algorithms. First, we propose a method to reduce the maximum delay by allocating the nodes that cannot access the channel to the reserved slots preferentially. Second, we propose a method to change reservation slot duration for nodes that cannot access channel by detecting collision frequency. We implemented this through the NS-3 simulator and confirmed the effect of reducing the actual maximum delay.	algorithm;frequency band;network packet;quality of service;real-time computing;reserved word;sensor;simulation;wireless access point	Jeongin Kim;Ikjun Yeom	2017	2017 17th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2017.8261199	ieee 802.11ah;throughput;quality of service;computer network;real-time computing;wireless;turnaround time;internet of things;reservation;computer science;communication channel	Mobile	10.263010322295298	87.35672172670367	155653

Although advance network planning and dense node deployment may initially achieve the required performance, they often fail to adapt to the unpredictability of physical reality. This paper explores efficient use of mobile sensors to address the limitations of static WSNs in target detection. We propose a data fusion model that enables static and mobile sensors to effectively collaborate in target detection. An optimal sensor movement scheduling algorithm is developed to minimize the total moving distance of sensors while achieving a set of spatiotemporal performance requirements including high detection probability, low system false alarm rate and bounded detection delay. The effectiveness of our approach is validated by extensive simulations based on real data traces collected by 23 sensor nodes.	algorithm;mission critical;requirement;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;software deployment;stationary process;tracing (software)	Guoliang Xing;Jianping Wang;Ke Shen;Qingfeng Huang;Xiaohua Jia;Hing-Cheung So	2008	2008 The 28th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	10.1109/ICDCS.2008.81	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;operating system;sensor fusion;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;scheduling;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	13.12432761426072	77.57241731853735	155675

The critical challenge that wireless sensor networks often face is to sustain long-term operation on limited battery energy. Coverage maintenance schemes can effectively prolong network lifetime by maintaining sufficient sensing coverage over a target region using a small number of active sensors while scheduling the other sensors to sleep. We envision future wireless sensor networks are composed of a vast number of extremely miniaturized sensors (e.g., millimeter-scale) deployed in exceedingly high density (e.g., more than 1000sensors/m 2 ). Therefore, the key issue of coverage maintenance for the future sensor networks is the scalability to sensor deployment density. In this paper, we propose a novel coverage maintenance scheme, called scalable coverage maintenance (SCOM). SCOM is energy efficient and scalable to sensor deployment density in terms of communication overhead (i.e., number of transmitted and received beacons) and computational complexity (i.e., time and space complexity).

The transport mechanisms have been tailored to maximize single cell performance by enforcing strict synchronism and orthogonality within a single cell and within a single contiguous frequency band. Various emerging trends reveal major shortcomings of those design criteria: (1) The fraction of machine-type-communications (MTC) is growing fast. Transmissions of this kind are suffering from the bulky procedures necessary to ensure strict synchronism. (2) Collaborative schemes have been introduced to boost capacity and coverage (CoMP), and wireless networks are becoming more and more heterogeneous following the non-uniform distribution of users. Tremendous efforts must be spent to collect the gains and to manage such systems under the premise of strict synchronism and orthogonality. (3) The advent of the Digital Agenda and the introduction of carrier aggregation are forcing the transmission systems to deal with fragmented spectrum. 5GNOW will question the design targets of LTE and LTE-Advanced having these shortcomings in mind. The obedience of LTE and LTE-Advanced to strict synchronism and orthogonality will be challenged. It will develop new PHY and MAC layer concepts being better suited to meet the upcoming needs with respect to service variety and heterogeneous transmission setups. A demonstrator will be built as Proof-of-Concept relying upon continuously growing capabilities of silicon based processing. Wireless transmission networks following the outcomes of 5GNOW will be better suited to meet the manifoldness of services, device classes and transmission setups being present in envisioned future scenarios like smart cities. The integration of systems relying heavily on MTC, e.g. sensor networks, into the communication network will be eased. The per-user experience will be more uniform and satisfying. To ensure this 5GNOW will contribute to upcoming 5G standardization.	compaq lte;frequency band;named pipe;obedience (human behavior);phy (chip);smart city;synchronicity;telecommunications network;user experience	Gerhard Wunder;Martin Kasparick;Stephan ten Brink;Frank Schaich;Thorsten Wild;Ivan Gaspar;Eckhard Ohlmer;Stefan Krone;Nicola Michailow;Ainoa Navarro;Gerhard P.

Thanks to the use of both TOA/AOA measurements, the proposed technique can rely on two base stations (BS) only and achieves better performance compared to the original approximate maximum likelihood (AML) method. The use of two BSs is an important advantage in wireless cellular communication systems because it avoids hearability problems and reduces network signaling burden.

Alternative methods may lead to imprecise placement resulting in coverage holes. To provide the required high coverage in these situations, we propose to deploy sensor networks composed of a mixture of mobile and static sensors in which mobile sensors can move from dense areas to sparse areas to improve the overall coverage. This paper presents a bidding protocol to assist the movement of mobile sensors. In the protocol, static sensors detect coverage holes locally by using Voronoi diagrams, and bid for mobile sensors based on the size of the detected hole. Mobile sensors choose coverage holes to heal based on the bid.

The main issue of the MLCS problem is to compute the minimum latency a schedule, that is, to compute a schedule with the minimum number of timeslots, such that all data from all nodes can be collected to a sink node without any collision or interference. We introduce an approximation algorithm with O(1)-approximation ratio that works in both the interference models by yielding a schedule whose latency is bounded by O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the network.	approximation algorithm;data aggregation;interference (communication);interrupt latency;schedule (computer science);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio	Min Kyung An;Hyuk Cho	2014	2014 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems (CITS)	10.1109/CITS.2014.6878957	signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;zero-forcing precoding;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Embedded	11.363238423048193	82.7743130230065	156605

Because of limited collection time and bandwidth, the fusion center (FC) is not able to collect the local observations from all sensor nodes. A distributed detection scheme with a selection strategy and a capability to operate in a finite bandwidth is required. We propose an ordered sequential detection scheme which jointly integrates a reliability-based splitting algorithm, an ordered-transmission strategy, and a sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). The proposed scheme allows the FC to collect the local observations in descending order of their reliabilities by using a reliability-based splitting algorithm. As it receives successfully transmitted observations, the FC sequentially decides whether to make a global decision or to continue collecting more local observations. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms a conventional SPRT scheme. The improvement increases as the number of sensor nodes in the network increases.	algorithm;estimation theory;network packet;numerical analysis;scheme;sensor node;sorting	Seksan Laitrakun;Edward J.

e58dab040b3dadd7f3faa1361f5a088a925d977e	from massive mimo to c-ran: the openairinterface 5g testbed		5G will be much more than just a new radio interface — 5G will fundamentally change the way networks are operated. Traditional telecoms equipment will be replaced successively with general purpose computing platforms. This change will affect both the core network and the radio network, where it is also called cloud-RAN (C-RAN). The C-RAN architecture allows for flexible splits between different processing elements in the radio network, for an optimal trade-off between processing in the cloud or in the remote radio unit (RRU). OpenAirInterface (OAI) is an open source initiative that today provides Rel-8/Rel-10 3GPP compliant reference implementation of eNodeB, UE, RRH and EPC that runs on general purpose computing platforms. Already today OAI offers several functional splits for its 4G radio stack, for example between the Radio Cloud Center (RCC) and a Remote Radio Unit (RRU). Moreover, Eurecom is currently deploying a C-RAN network at its premises in Sophia-Antipolis, France, using a low-cost solution for RRU based on off-the-shelf equipment. In this paper we are going to describe the OAI C-RAN architecture with a special emphasis on the possibilities to do multi-cell distributed MIMO processing. In particular we will show how to we can apply our recently developed TDD reciprocity calibration scheme to this distributed setting and integrate it seamlessly into the normal LTE operation.	c-ran;centralized computing;cloud computing;commodity computing;common public radio interface;compaq lte;electronic product code;gigabit;mimo;open-source software;reference implementation;remote radio head;software propagation;test-driven development;testbed;unreal development kit	Florian Kaltenberger;Xiwen Jiang;Raymond Knopp	2017	2017 51st Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers	10.1109/ACSSC.2017.8335413	computer network;mimo;architecture;electronic engineering;c-ran;cloud computing;computer science;enodeb;core network;testbed;telecommunications equipment	Networks	22.755321561197192	87.05597144953255	156856

We studied the traffic pattern of smartphones and observed that a good portion of the packets are of small size and the generated traffic is bursty in nature. Motivated by these observations, we propose a Low Energy Data-packet Aggregation Scheme (LEDAS) in this paper. It accumulates a number of upper layer packets into a burst at medium access control (MAC) level, based on accumulation time, size, and number of packets. With this scheme, larger bursts lead to longer inactivity periods during which the communication module can be kept in doze mode. In addition, fewer MAC frames lead to less overheads and contentions in the wireless medium. However, the data packets incur delays due to the accumulation process. We have given a detail flowchart description of the technique. By means of analysis, we have derived expressions for the average values of burst size, burst inter-arrival times, and number of packets in a burst. We also evaluated the efficacy of the technique by simulations and showed the energy-delay trade-offs. Finally, we explained a test-bench to evaluate the energy saving potential of LEDAS on a smartphone.	access control;communications protocol;diagram;electronic circuit;experiment;flowchart;mobile app;network packet;network traffic control;schematic;simulation;smartphone;state transition table;tree accumulation	Rajesh Palit;Sagar Naik;Ajit Singh	2011	2011 7th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference	10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982599	embedded system;airfield traffic pattern;lead;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer security;computer network	Mobile	11.634985683163764	86.55518450169245	157359

Conventional localization requires dense anchors with known positions or high transmit power in sparse networks to reach successful localization, which is not suitable for low-cost and low-power sensors. Cooperative localization is a promising solution for wireless sensors' localization, in which the agents needing to be located cooperate with neighboring nodes by exchanging messages and perform measurements with them. In this paper, a distributed cooperative localization algorithm on factor graph is proposed to locate the sensors. Resorting to the linearization method to tackle the nonlinearity in range measurement, Gaussian parametric messages are obtained with closed forms using the sum-product algorithm on factor graph, which leads to low computational complexity and low communication overhead. Numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the proposed algorithm, which shows superior performance to the particle-based SPAWN estimator.	algorithm;belief propagation;computation;computational complexity theory;dijkstra's algorithm;factor graph;gaussian blur;internationalization and localization;iteration;low-power broadcasting;message passing;nonlinear system;numerical linear algebra;overhead (computing);sensor;simulation;sparse matrix	Bin Li;Nan Wu;Hua Wang;Jingming Kuang;Chengwen Xing	2014	2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992066	computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	16.958410421566608	75.51615569250954	157466

In battery powered sensor networks, it is important to balance electric energy of batteries of nodes in order to maximize the life time of networks. In this paper, we propose two distributed protocols to balance electric energy of batteries of nodes. The proposed algorithms are based on the population protocol model which is a computational model for networked nodes with very limited resources. The goals of the algorithms are twofold: minimizing the loss of electric energy caused by wireless transmission, and minimizing the time to balance. The proposed algorithms are evaluated by computer simulation.

Localization of individual mobile node is a challenging task in wireless sensor networks. Localization system is not only for location identification but also provides the base for routing, density control, tracking, and a number of other communication network aspects. In real time applications of outdoor or indoor environments, there are significant challenges for node localization in WSN. Keeping in view the fact that many precise and smart solutions have been proposed, an approach for range free localization is Concentric Anchor Beacon (CAB), which comes with the requirement of improvement. In this paper, we have presented a novel solution “Power Tuning Anchors” (PTA) algorithm that outperforms in terms of accuracy. In PTA, mobile node localizes its position on the basis of minimum received power levels transmitted by the neighboring anchors. Localization error, anchor density, radio range and Gitter between two consecutive power levels are the performance metrics used for evaluation of PTA. Initial empirical results have shown better precision and more accuracy in terms of aforementioned performance parameter.	algorithm;anchor text;gitter;program test authority;routing;telecommunications network	Sohail Jabbar;Muhammad Zubair Aziz;Abid Ali Minhas;Danial Hussain	2010	2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology	10.1109/CIT.2010.419	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Robotics	16.87562792911255	74.9805693212363	157586

Nowadays, GSM network, with its vast coverage in most countries, and also its competitive ever-growing market, is becoming popular as the main medium for the machine-to-machine applications, and AMR is not an exception. At present, using GSM, as the medium of AMR, is not cost-effective for domestic meters; however, it is economical for commercial and industrial (C&I) meters. This paper portrays prominent features of a project, recently accomplished at Niroo Research Institute (NRI), which uses GSM/SMS as the medium of AMR.

In this paper, we propose to exploit the geometric relationship inherent in multipath propagation, i.e., multipath geometry, via cooperation among nodes for localization. We characterize the contribution of this multipath geometry in terms of the nodes’ squared position error bound, which is the fundamental limit of localization accuracy. Analytical and numerical results validate the benefit of using multipath geometry in wideband cooperative localization.	fisher information;location awareness;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;software propagation	Yuan Shen;Moe Z.

This work proposes a scheme (SSMCA), developed around the cellular automata (CA), for efficient management of battery power in sensor nodes with optimized cost of implementation. Each sensor node is assumed to be equipped with a segment of the CA, selected for the network that defines the state (active/standby) of the node at next time instant. The CA based management of status (active/standby) of a node ensures the reduced battery power consumption in nodes of a cluster as well as in the whole sensor network. As a segment of the CA is planted within a node, the additional cost for implementation of the proposed scheme is marginal. The simulation results establish that the SSMCA can better utilize the resources and ensure a maximally covered energy efficient sensor network.	automata theory;cellular automaton;certificate authority;marginal model;sensor node;simulation	Indrajit Banerjee;Sukanta Das;Hafizur Rahaman;Biplab K.

This is achieved by a new signal source coding method based on the Walsh transform. This research is motivated by the need for extended service life of wireless sensor networks, where individual sensor nodes are energy constrained. Theoretical background is introduced, and its effectiveness is established through simulations and experiments. The simulations are conducted using electrocardiogram (ECG) and bearing vibration signals, and the results are comparatively evaluated against the Haar transform coding, discrete cosine transform (DCT) coding, pulse code modulation, and fixed-word-length Walsh coding. Experimental verification is performed by implementing the algorithm on a wireless test bed. Results indicate that up to 58% energy reduction can be achieved for wireless transmission of ECG signals, as compared to other commonly used coding methods. For bearing vibration signal transmission, the energy consumed during transmission is comparable to that of the near-optimal DCT coding.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);computer programming;data compression;discrete cosine transform;experiment;haar wavelet;hadamard transform;modulation;reconfigurability;simulation;systems design;testbed;transform coding	Abhijit Kadrolkar;Robert X.

In contrast to current state-of-the-art connectivity-based localization methods, the proposed algorithm is highly scalable with linear computation and communication costs with respect to the size of the network; and fully distributed where each node only needs the information of its neighbors without cumbersome partitioning and merging process. The algorithm is theoretically guaranteed and numerically stable. Moreover, the algorithm can be readily extended to the localization of networks with a one-hop transmission range distance measurement, and the propagation of the measurement error at one sensor node is limited within a small area of the network around the node. Extensive simulations and comparison with other methods under various representative network settings are carried out, showing the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;computation;numerical stability;scalability;sensor node;simulation;software propagation	Miao Jin;Su Xia;Hongyi Wu;Xianfeng Gu	2017	Axioms	10.3390/axioms6020015	wireless sensor network;merge (version control);observational error;theoretical computer science;scalability;computation;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;brooks–iyengar algorithm;sensor node;distributed computing;computer science	Mobile	13.768090104317832	80.40146751981872	158326

The generated energy can be stored in a buffer. The sensor node periodically senses a random field and generates a packet. These packets are stored in a queue and transmitted using the energy available at that time. We obtain energy management policies that are throughput optimal, i.e., the data queue stays stable for the largest possible data rate. Next we obtain energy management policies which minimize the mean delay in the queue. We also compare performance of several easily implementable sub-optimal energy management policies. A greedy policy is identified which, in low SNR regime, is throughput optimal and also minimizes mean delay.	data rate units;greedy algorithm;markov chain;network packet;norm (social);queue (abstract data type);real life;routing;scheduling (computing);sensor node;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral leakage;throughput;transceiver	Vinod Sharma;Utpal Mukherji;Vinay Joseph;Shrey Gupta	2010	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2010.04.080749	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network	Metrics	15.057655037651857	82.31523892722542	158355

In this paper, we present a centralized generating algorithm running at the sink to obtain the distributed wavelet basis in WSN. And on this basis, Wavelet Transform-based Distributed Compressed Sensing (WTDCS) algorithm is proposed to compress and reconstruct sensor observations with spatial correlations. Finally, the analysis of relationship between reconstruction error and energy consumption in WTDCS is carried out by simulation. The results show that WTDCS can achieve high performance in terms of energy and reconstruction accuracy, as compared to conventional distributed wavelet transform algorithm.	algorithm;centralized computing;compressed sensing;data compression;fast fourier transform;simulation;wavelet transform	Haifeng Hu;Zhen Yang	2011	2011 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2011.6096737	embedded system;electronic engineering;computer science;theoretical computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Mobile	15.842174983845974	80.22147362904342	158417

In this regard, millimeter wave (mmW) communication technologies have recently emerged as an attractive solution to realize the vision of a high-speed and reliable wireless small cell backhaul network (SCBN). In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for managing the spectral resources of a heterogeneous SCBN that can exploit simultaneously mmW and conventional frequency bands via carrier aggregation. In particular, a new SCBN model is proposed in which small cell base stations (SCBSs) equipped with broadband fiber backhaul allocate their frequency resources to SCBSs with wireless backhaul, by using aggregated bands. One unique feature of the studied model is that it jointly accounts for both wireless channel characteristics and economic factors during resource allocation. The problem is then formulated as a one-to-many matching game and a distributed algorithm is proposed to find a stable outcome of the game. The convergence of the algorithm is proven and the properties of the resulting matching are studied. Simulation results show that under the constraints of wireless backhauling, the proposed approach achieves substantial performance gains, reaching up to 30% compared to a conventional best-effort approach.	backhaul (telecommunications);best-effort delivery;distributed algorithm;frequency band;one-to-many (data model);scalability;simulation	Omid Semiari;Walid Saad;Zaher Dawy;Mehdi Bennis	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248860	telecommunications;wireless network;wi-fi array;computer network	Mobile	22.86112007952764	87.49707561913205	158660

The quantitativedescription of spatial epidemics is based on two prominenttheoretical approaches, diffusive dispersal and direct couplingor effective force of infection. The first ansatz assumes randomwalkmovement of the host between different locations whereasthe second employs an effective force of infection betweendistinct populations. Both models are inconsistent with importantaspects of human mobility, most importantly the bidirectionalmovements between individuals’ homes and distant location. Weintroduce and investigate a novel epidemiological model thatexplicitely takes into account this bidirectional nature of humanmovements. In various topologies (networks and lattices) we findsignificant differences as well as similarities among all threemodels, depending on the parameters. On a lattice we obtain ananalytical expression for the velocity of the propagating epidemicfront. In contrast to the diffusion approach, our model predictsa saturation of the velocity with increasing traveling rate. Ouranalysis is supported by numerical simulations on both latticesand networks and provides a framework for incorporating theabundance of pervasive data on individual human mobility intodisease dynamics modeling.	numerical analysis;pervasive informatics;population;simulation;velocity (software development)	Vitaly Belik;Theo Geisel;Dirk Brockmann	2009	2009 International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering	10.1109/CSE.2009.432	direct coupling;simulation;infectious disease;epidemic model;computer science;lattice;mathematical model;force;random walk;reaction–diffusion system;artificial neural network;network topology;statistics	Robotics	12.884320680190363	88.28963420791496	158727

Many protocols for wireless networks - routing, topology control, information storage/retrieval and numerous other applications - have been based on the idealized unit-disk graph (UDG) network model. The significant deviation of the UDG model from many real wireless networks is substantially limiting the applicability of such protocols. A more general network model, the quasi unit-disk graph (quasi-UDG) model, captures much better the characteristics of wireless networks. However, the understanding of the properties of general quasi-UDGs has been very limited, which is impeding the designs of key network protocols and algorithms. In this paper, we present results on two important properties of quasi-UDGs: separability and the existence of power efficient spanners. Network separability is a fundamental property leading to efficient network algorithms and fast parallel computation. We prove that every quasi-UDG has a corresponding grid graph with small balanced separators that captures its connectivity properties. We also study the problem of constructing an energy-efficient backbone for a quasi-UDG. We present a distributed localized algorithm that, given a quasi-UDG, constructs a nearly planar backbone with a constant stretch factor and a bounded degree. We demonstrate the excellent performance of these auxiliary graphs through simulations and show their applications in efficient routing.	algorithm;communications protocol;computation;entity–relationship model;ibm notes;internet backbone;lattice graph;linear separability;locality of reference;network model;parallel computing;routing;simulation;topology control;unit disk graph	Jianer Chen;Anxiao Jiang;Iyad A.

We define the capacity of a journey (i.e., a path in space and time, from a source to a destination) as the maximum amount of data that can be transferred from the source to the destination in the given journey. Combining a stochastic model (conveying all possible journeys) and an analysis of the durations of the nodes' encounters, we study the properties of journeys that maximize the space-time information propagation capacity, in bit-meters per second. More specifically, we provide theoretical lower and upper bounds on the information propagation speed, as a function of the journey capacity. In the particular case of random way-point-like models (i.e., when nodes move for a distance of the order of the network domain size before changing direction), we show that, for relatively large journey capacities, the information propagation speed is of the same order as the mobile node speed. This implies that, surprisingly, in sparse but large-scale mobile DTNs, the space-time information propagation capacity in bit-meters per second remains proportional to the mobile node speed and to the size of the transported data bundles, when the bundles are relatively large. We also verify that all our analytical bounds are accurate in several simulation scenarios.	routing;simulation;software propagation;sparse matrix;waypoint	Philippe Jacquet;Bernard Mans;Georgios Rodolakis	2010	2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462164	routing;mobile telephony;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;stochastic modelling;trajectory;operating system;space time;delay-tolerant networking;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;mobile computing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	13.038396903712115	88.38583451755666	159542
22e8869a58c80702110b88da4600ec257783bfbb	charm: exploiting geographical diversity through coherent combining in low-power wide-area networks		Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) are an emerging wireless platform which can support battery-powered devices lasting 10-years while communicating at low data-rates to gateways several kilometers away. Not all such devices will experience the promised 10 year battery life despite the high density of LPWAN gateways expected in cities. Transmission from devices located deep within buildings or in remote neighborhoods will suffer severe attenuation forcing the use of slow data-rates to reach even the closest gateway, thus resulting in battery drain. This paper presents Charm, a system that enhances both the battery life of client devices and the coverage of LPWANs in large urban deployments. Charm allows multiple LoRaWAN gateways to pool their received signals in the cloud, coherently combining them to detect weak signals that are not decodable at any individual gateway. Through a novel hardware and software design at the gateway, Charm carefully detects which chunks of the received signal need to be sent to the cloud, thereby saving uplink bandwidth. We present a scalable solution to decoding weak transmissions at city-scale by identifying the set of gateways whose signals need to be coherently combined over time. In evaluations over a test network and from simulations using traces from a large LoRaWAN deployment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Charm demonstrates a gain of up to 3x in range and 4x in client battery-life.	cloud computing;coherent;full scale;gateway (telecommunications);low-power broadcasting;mimo;scalability;simulation;software deployment;software design;telecommunications link;tracing (software);transmitter	Adwait Dongare;Revathy Narayanan;Akshay Gadre;Anh Luong;Artur Balanuta;Swarun Kumar;Bob Iannucci;Anthony Rowe	2018	2018 17th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN)		wireless sensor network;real-time computing;computer network;lpwan;attenuation;software deployment;computer science;telecommunications link;cloud computing;scalability;default gateway	Mobile	23.54714025002512	88.23658819220594	159644

However, this approach suffers from a design issue in delivering the strict requirements needed by some monitoring applications. Carefully balancing Energy, Delay and Accuracy is essential for achieving these requirements. In this work, we focus on distributed data aggregation, where a sensor estimates the network information by the exchange of readings with different priority levels. We then propose an optimal decision policy for scheduling the transmission of the aggregated data at the node level. To model the investigated problem, we first adopt Markov Decision Process (MDP) whereby we define the reward function. Then, we apply a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find a set of optimal decisions that ensures the best trade-off between energy saving, delay and accuracy of the received data based on their priority level. The simulation results yield excellent performance and our optimization shows a significant enhancement up to 20% compared to the other policies.	data aggregation;decision problem;download;genetic algorithm;lero (software engineering);markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;performance evaluation;reinforcement learning;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;software engineering;software release life cycle;vii	Imane Horiya Brahmi;Florian Maire;Soufiene Djahel;John Murphy	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343638	random variable;real-time computing;genetic algorithm;wireless sensor network;computer science;data mining;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;markov process;distributed database;statistics;computer network	Embedded	13.43560365397102	81.54912823494449	159659

Advantages of using a narrowband signal instead of a UWB signal for the feedback path are discussed. The proposed MAC (Medium Access Control) protocol is based on IEEE 802.15.4/4a beacon enabled star topology. Performance is analyzed by varying the number of sensors.

In wireless sensor networks WSNs, the task of localising sensor nodes with unknown position is important for efficient network configuration and operation. This challenge has stimulated research of various localisation algorithms. In this paper we propose robust localisation algorithm for large scale three-dimensional 3D WSNs based on multidimensional scaling MDS. Our approach has two main improvements over classical MDS algorithm. Firstly, it uses heuristic approach for distance matrix calculation, and secondly, it applies Levenberg-Marquardt LM method for absolute map refinement using received signal strength RSS measurements. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed approach is compared to other 3D WSN localisation techniques and it is shown that the proposed approach outperforms other techniques for 3D localisation.	algorithm	Nasir Saeed;Biljana Risteska Stojkoska	2016	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2016.10000216	wireless sensor network;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;multidimensional scaling;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	16.852117911407714	75.0069705638021	159719

When one needs to send an unexpectedly large dataset in high-bandwidth situations to a remote center office, a robot can distribute its data to other robots via IEEE802.11 WLAN. In previous research, a relay function was introduced to improve the performance in this system type. However, the relay function was only evaluated using a simple model due to computational complexity. Therefore, we propose a heuristic method for evaluating the relay function, which can simplify the computation. This method can reduce the computational complexity, and the relay function can obtain higher efficiency than direct communication.	approximation algorithm;compaq lte;computation;computational complexity theory;heuristic;local optimum;relay;robot;throughput	Takuya Sakakibara;Shigeo Shioda;Tutomu Murase	2018		10.1145/3164541.3164543	computer science;throughput;link aggregation;real-time computing;robot;computational complexity theory;wireless;computation;relay;heuristic	Robotics	18.202880591922792	87.3724620666586	159816

Based on the observation that phase rate deviation among radios is a limiting factor for the achievable precision, we propose a distributed algorithm for automatic phase rate equalization and show by experiments that an improved precision below one microsecond is possible in the given setups. It is also experimentally demonstrated that the stochastic nature of coupling is a key ingredient for convergence to synchrony. The proposed scheme can be applied in wireless systems for distributed synchronization of transmission slots, or sleep cycles.	firefly	Günther Brandner;Udo Schilcher;Christian Bettstetter	2016	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2016.01.001	synchronization;real-time computing;self-organization;telecommunications;computer science	Metrics	14.63380460405471	83.59071211209283	160420

Time-Spread Multiple-Access (TSMA) policies that have been proposed for ad hoc network environments, can also be employed in sensor networks, since no control overhead is introduced. However, they do not take advantage of any cross-layer information in order to exploit the idiosyncrasies of the particular sensor network environment such as the presence of typically static nodes and a common destination for the forwarded data. An adaptive probabilistic TSMA-based policy, that is proposed and analyzed in this paper, exploits these idiosyncrasies and achieves higher system throughput than the existing TSMA-based policies without any need for extra control overhead. As it is analytically shown in this paper, the proposed policy always outperforms the existing TSMA-based policies, if certain parameter values are properly set; the analysis also provides for these proper values. It is also shown that the proposed policy is characterized by a certain convergence period and that high system throughput is achieved for long convergence periods. The claims and expectations of the provided analysis are supported by simulation results presented in this paper.	access control;hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);simulation;throughput	Konstantinos Oikonomou;Ioannis Stavrakakis	2007	EURASIP J.

Fingerprinting allows target localization on the basis of radio-frequency measurements of the Received radio Signal Strength (RSS), taking into account the presence of fading by means of a training phase. Motion capture is then performed by localizing, through fingerprinting, a group of targets placed on the portion of interest of the user arm---the approach can be easily extended to other portions of the user body. We experimentally investigate, through a SunSPOT wireless sensor network test-bed, different fingerprinting-based localization algorithms, namely deterministic and probabilistic, optimizing, in each case, the system parameters. In particular, the optimization is carried out by minimizing the localization error.	algorithm;experiment;mathematical optimization;motion capture;probabilistic turing machine;rss;radio frequency;radio wave;testbed	Matteo Giuberti;Marco Martalò;Gianluigi Ferrari	2011		10.1145/2007036.2007044	embedded system;motion capture;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;radio frequency;local system;testbed	Vision	18.183411951273623	74.58335496570363	160813

The minimum exposure path (MEP) problem is, given a pair of points x and y inside a sensor field, find a path between x and y of a minimum exposure. In this paper we introduce the first rigorous treatment of the problem, designing an approximation algorithm for the MEP problem with guaranteed performance characteristics. Given a convex polygon P of size n with O(n) sensors inside it and any real number ε > 0, our algorithm finds a path in P whose exposure is within an 1 + ε factor of the exposure of the MEP, in time O(n/εψ), where ψ is a topological characteristic of the field. We also describe a framework for a faster implementation of our algorithm, which reduces the time by a factor of approximately Θ(1/ε), by keeping the same approximation ratio.	approximation algorithm;computation;emoticon;media-embedded processor;messaging pattern;sensor;theory;time complexity	Hristo Djidjev	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-73090-3_20	embedded system;mathematical optimization;wireless sensor network;computer science	Theory	14.745365024944533	76.44563681351279	160855

Although a sensor node is likely to be equipped with only one antenna, it is possible to group several sensors to form a virtual MIMO link. Such grouping can be formed by means of clustering. In this paper, we propose a distributed MIMO-adaptive energyefficient clustering/routing scheme, coined cooperative MIMO (CMIMO), which aims at reducing energy consumption in multihop WSNs. In CMIMO, each cluster has two cluster heads (CHs), which are responsible for routing traffic between clusters (i.e., inter-cluster communications). CMIMO has the ability to adapt the transmission mode and transmission power on a per-packet basis. The transmission mode can be one of four transmit/receive configurations: 1 × 1 (SISO), 2 × 1 (MISO), 1 × 2 (SIMO), and 2 × 2 (MIMO). We study the performance of CMIMO via simulations. Results indicate that our proposed scheme achieves a significant reduction in energy consumption, compared to nonadaptive clustered WSNs.	cluster analysis;cooperative mimo;network packet;routing;sensor node;simulation interoperability standards organization;system analysis	Mohammad Z.

10792c2373d536a320893b227d10b8d6dfe51b36	a slotted aloha message concentration protocol for wireless sensor networks	protocols receivers transmitters signal to noise ratio delays cloud computing	Wireless sensor network applications, including the Internet of Things (IoT), will benefit from message concentration protocols, which gather messages originating at a large number of spatially distributed nodes (devices) into a small subset of those nodes, each holding a subset of the messages. This concentration facilitates more efficient access to the network or cloud, in the aggregate, than when each device seeks individual direct access. Such protocols must be lightweight and capable of operating without knowledge of the (potentially dynamic) network topology. In this paper we propose an extremely simple multi-round Aloha-based protocol, wherein the set of live nodes in each round randomly partition into transmitters and receivers, and the receivers collect messages from all transmitters within range. The protocol requires judicious choice of both the multi-round contention probabilities and transmission powers to effectively tradeoff between the four performance metrics of interest - the degree of message concentration, the fraction of lost messages, the protocol delay, and the transmission power. We analyze a special case of this protocol using basic results from stochastic geometry and branching processes.	aggregate data;cloud computing;communications protocol;concatenation;interference (communication);internet of things;network topology;random access;randomness;transmitter	Steven Weber	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925551	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	13.427525183587337	83.77655420831289	161236

Some techniques of node scheduling have been proposed to reduce energy consumption. By exploiting the redundancy of network coverage, they turn off unnecessary nodes, or make nodes work in turn, which require high nodes density or sacrificing tracking quality. We present TPSS, a two-phase sleep scheduling protocol, which divides the whole tracking procedure into two phases and assigns different scheduling policies at each phase. To balance energy savings and tracking quality, we further optimize the node scheduling protocol in terms of network coverage and nodes state prediction. We evaluate our method in an indoor environment with 36 sensor nodes. Comparing with the existing methods, all the experimental results show that our method has a high performance in term of energy savings and tracking quality.	two-phase commit protocol	Qianqian Ren;Jianzhong Li;Hong Gao	2009		10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336966	fair-share scheduling;embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;computer network	Mobile	11.982848788321494	77.59981400923466	161492
ee3e817ca7180ee31948870d2d1ac2cf50fbe592	on characterizing and modelling collective behaviour in non-coordinated wireless networks		During the last few years we have witnessed a rapid evolution of wireless technologies and a steep growth in the number of wireless networking devices. This proliferation of devices and networks is posing higher demands in terms of connectivity and capacity. Consequently, this necessitates a reduced reliance on infrastructure-based networks and support for network connectivity through non-coordinated networks. The attention of the research community has thus largely shifted from carefully planned, infrastructure-based wireless networks to non-coordinated, infrastructure-less wireless networks. The development of emerging non-coordinated wireless networks is, however, challenging. Significant efforts are still needed in both theoretical and practical domains for their analysis, modelling, and practical implementation. The objective and contribution of this thesis is to study non-coordinated wireless networks using approaches that are novel to wireless networking research. This work is largely inspired by concepts and methods of statistical mechanics. In general, it is mainly motivated by the core idea behind statistical mechanics: the analysis of collective behaviour in systems comprising of many individual entities. We apply one of the most widely used approximation methods of statistical mechanics – the mean field method – to present a novel and flexible analysis of the throughput of a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol with respect to offered traffic. Furthermore, we exploit the notion of phase transitions; we argue that network characterization and modelling via phase transitions can be very fruitful, as phase transitions designate abrupt qualitative changes, that is, operational points of significant importance. We discuss a different approach on the stability of Nash Equilibria and question whether a Nash Equilibrium is always a desirable solution. We also propose employing phase transitions for modelling hard inequality constraints in utility-based network optimization, and phase diagrams for characterizing wireless networks. In addition, motivated by the need for analytical work that goes beyond the assumption of Poisson distributed nodes, we study the percolation phase transition of clustered wireless topologies. Finally, the practical implementation of self-organizing schemes has also been a motivation for a part of this work. We show how Minority Games – a family of interaction models widely exploited in statistical mechanics – can be applied to provide self-organizing solutions for a wide range of resource allocation problems, with limited requirements for exchange of feedback information.	approximation;entity;flow network;location-based service;mathematical optimization;nash equilibrium;networking hardware;organizing (structure);percolation;phase diagram;requirement;self-organization;social inequality;throughput	Maria Michalopoulou	2016			phase transition;wireless network;percolation;mean field theory;mathematics;distributed computing;nash equilibrium	Mobile	13.607319547941167	87.02922072328911	161587

To fill this void, a general analytical model for the system level performance evaluation of mobile wireless networks taking into account both resource insufficiency and link unreliability is proposed and mathematically analyzed in this paper. In the mathematical analysis, for the sake of generality, the involved time variables (i.e., cell dwell time, unencumbered call interruption time, and channel holding time) are considered to have a general probability distribution. Then, original and easily computable mathematical expressions for many fundamental system level performance metrics are derived. The proposed analytical model allows obtaining more general and realistic results.	computable function;convergence insufficiency;interrupt;mobile phone;performance evaluation;telecommunications network	Carmen B.

This paper proposes an intelligent management of multiple access schemes for contention access and contention free access with game theory. The strategies are determined by requirements of applications and channel status. Nodes in a network choose various strategies for best payoff according to different conditions including normal status, packets-oriented services, emergent situation and bad link states with specific utility functions. The novel management model supports flexible resource allocation and enhances the system performance, which are evaluated by simulations of Castalia under various conditions.	emergence;game theory;requirement;simulation	Jing Zhou;Aihuang Guo;Hung T.

Different from methods using radar, optical or acoustic sensors to detect UAV, this paper proposes a novel distance-based support vector data description (SVDD) algorithm using hash fingerprint as feature. This algorithm does not need large number of training samples and its computation complexity is low. Hash fingerprint is generated by extracting features of signal preamble waveforms.

These multi rate attributes provide additional significant opportunities in network design for achieving higher energy efficiency, besides traditional approaches of saving energy. In this paper, we propose a novel multi rate sensor network scheme to take advantage of power scaling for saving energy consumption. It can be easily synthesized into existing wireless sensor network MAC protocols, providing multi rate service for upper layer, and achieving communication energy efficiency. By monitoring a desirable BER threshold as the critical system parameter, the quality of received multi-rate data is assured. Based on this BER and the corresponding modulation scheme, the SNR at receiver end can be derived. The transmission power can be supplied optimally according to this SNR and the channel attenuation between sender and receiver. This dynamic power scaling scheme can lead to optimal energy efficiency since it demands that only a necessary amount of communication energy be consumed for multi-rate DSP applications. Our simulation shows that this multi data rate scheme with dynamic power scaling achieves energy saving significantly	critical system;data rate units;digital signal processing;image scaling;modulation;network planning and design;real-time transcription;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;x.690	Wei Wang;Dongming Peng;Honggang Wang;Hamid Sharif	2006		10.1145/1163673.1163683	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;computer network	Mobile	10.995731228766385	83.69430475864344	162780

The determination of the deployment quality is hindered by various factors that cause coverage holes, such as the existence of jammers and destruction of sensors. This paper presents an analytical deployment quality measure in terms of network parameters, including the sensor count, sensing coverage, coverage hole count, coverage hole area size and deployment area size. Assuming a random deployment model for both sensors and holes, our method determines the probability of detection of a target following a linear trajectory by a single sensor and generalizes it to derive the probability of detection in a network with coverage holes. The overall probability of detection is used as the network quality measure and is proposed as a suitable metric under sensor loss assumptions. The proposed deployment quality metric (DQM) is based on the shortest path strategy to provide a conservative estimation for the intruder detection performance. We show that it provides a good estimation of the actual deployment quality with given coverage hole and jamming area properties. Our metric is suitable for real life and simulation scenarios and is computationally inexpensive compared to both simulation based and distributed quality measurements.	radio jamming;software deployment	Mehmet Yunus Donmez;Rabun Kosar;Cem Ersoy	2010	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2010.07.007	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;statistical power;shortest path problem;computer security;computer network	Mobile	14.103613714670077	77.53745601957193	162865
822151ee4d64cbcac1956e55b23f2255d6218757	optimising link quality for throughput enhancement in wireless sensor networks		End-to-end throughput is a major concern in wireless networks. One key approach for enhancing throughput is the optimisation of link quality. This can be efficiently done via power control. Link quality metrics, such as the Expected Transmission Count (ETX), promotes throughput maximisation, since it employs bidirectional links and it is additive by nature. This means that the ETX from the basestation to a node is the sum of all the ETX values across the route. Definitely, nodes behave selfishly, in most cases, in order to satisfy their benefits from their strategies. The methodology that describes this kind of behaviour more accurately is game theory. Thus, we consider nodes to be individual players that operate to maximise their utilities. In this paper, we propose a distributed game-theoretic algorithm, which attempts to keep the reliability of transmission to high standards, while reducing energy consumption. The actions of the nodes are transmission power levels that reside on a finite space; hence, we proceed with majorisation properties and the concavity of the utility function to indicate convergence. Furthermore, we employ the Fictitious Play learning methodology, which is a very well-known learning algorithm for game theoretic approaches, to show some learning properties of our approach. We provide simulations to highlight the efficiency of our approach.		Evangelos D.

Network nodes frequently employ directional antennas to improve spatial throughput. In such networks, between two nodes, it is of interest to compute a path with a channel assignment for the links such that the path and link bandwidths are the same. This is achieved when any two consecutive links are assigned different channels, termed as ''Channel-Discontinuity-Constraint'' (CDC). CDC-paths are also useful in TDMA systems, where, preferably, consecutive links are assigned different time-slots. In the first part of this paper, we develop a t-spanner for CDC-paths using spatial properties; a sub-network containing O(n/@q) links, for any @q>0, such that CDC-paths increase in cost by at most a factor t= (1-2 sin(@q/2))^-^2. We propose a novel distributed algorithm to compute the spanner using an expected number of O(nlogn) fixed-size messages. In the second part, we present a distributed algorithm to find minimum-cost CDC-paths between two nodes using O(n^2) fixed-size messages, by developing an extension of Edmonds' algorithm for minimum-cost perfect matching. In a centralized implementation, our algorithm runs in O(n^2) time improving the previous best algorithm which requires O(n^3) running time. Moreover, this running time improves to O(n/@q) when used in conjunction with the spanner developed.		Swaminathan Sankararaman;Alon Efrat;Srinivasan Ramasubramanian;Pankaj K.

6f4ccf7a913b33dda120f2810d078d42898e9e63	he-mac: harvest-then-transmit based modified edcf mac protocol for wireless powered sensor networks		Energy transfer (ET) and energy harvesting (EH) through radio frequency (RF) signals are a promising technology that can reduce the dependency on batteries in wireless sensor networks. However, there is a tradeoff between the RF-based ET and data communication when they operate in the same frequency band. Therefore, a proper medium access control (MAC) protocol is needed in wireless powered sensor networks (WPSNs). However, a utilization degradation problem occurs when the distributed coordination function (DCF) MAC protocol of the IEEE 802.11 is applied to WPSNs. In order to overcome this problem, this paper extends the IEEE 802.11e enhanced DCF (EDCF) into a harvest-then-transmit-based modified EDCF MAC (HE-MAC) protocol. In addition, the HE-MAC’s Markov chain model and steady-state probabilities are derived and used in the performance analysis. Next, based on the steady-state conditions, optimization is conducted to maximize the EH rate, which satisfies the frame generation rate and transfers additional energy to achieve a self-sustained energy consumption profile. Finally, the simulation performance of EH protocols HE-MAC, RF-MAC, and DOS are compared, where the results show that HE-MAC provides in a superior performance for the range of interest.	access control;computation;dos;design rule for camera file system;electron tomography;elegant degradation;energy level;exception handling;exponential hierarchy;frequency band;markov chain;mathematical optimization;radio frequency;simulation;steady state	Taeyoung Ha;Junsung Kim;Jong-Moon Chung	2018	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2017.2757024	distributed coordination function;radio frequency;real-time computing;computer network;wireless sensor network;mathematics;energy harvesting;network allocation vector;frequency band;energy consumption;wireless	Mobile	13.45573976020998	83.31107400909065	163240

These networks have high traffic of data and waste energy with an unnecessary number of active sensor nodes. In this paper we address the Density Control, Coverage and Connectivity Problem (DCCCP) in WSNs, that consists in activating a subset of sensor nodes, which assure the area coverage and the nodes connectivity, and minimize the energy consumption. We propose Multiperiod and Periodic approaches to solve the DCCCP. The Multiperiod approach divides the expected network lifetime in time periods and calculates, in a global way, a solution for each period, that minimizes the network energy consumption considering all time periods at once. The Multiperiod Approach has a global view of the nodes and the network expected lifetime. The Periodic Approach solves the problem as an static problem, updates the list of available nodes and repeats the procedure. The Periodic Approach has a global view of the nodes but not of the network lifetime, it finds local solutions (considering the periods) that together form a global solution, represented by the sum of all local solutions. These approaches are modeled through Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We compare our optimal solutions with Geographical Adaptive Fidelity (GAF) and Hierarchical Geographical Adaptive Fidelity (HGAF). Given the global aspects of our approaches we expect to derive lower bound for energy consumption for density control algorithms in WSNs.	algorithm;complex adaptive system;hoc (programming language);integer programming;linear programming;sensor	Adriana Gomes Penaranda;Andre Ricardo Melo Araujo;Fabíola Guerra Nakamura;Eduardo Freire Nakamura	2013	2013 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755048	wireless ad hoc network;mathematical optimization;wireless sensor network;integer programming;computer science;linear programming;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Embedded	11.20794040679978	79.02055330900333	163291

Nowadays, most of this information traffic is carried over long distances by optical fiber, which has intrinsic advantages such as wide transmission bandwidth and low attenuation. However, continuing traffic growth has imposed many challenges, especially for equipment manufacturers who have to develop optical transmission solutions to handle the demand for higher data rates without incurring increased capital and operational costs. A feasible approach to overcoming these challenges is to scale the channel capacity by employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) super-channels. However, OFDM is sensitive to synchronization errors, which can result in complete failure of the receiver-based digital signal processing. Measurement results of various existing OFDM synchronization methods have highlighted inherent limitations with regards to poor system performance, which determines the quality-of-service level perceived by the end user, and complexity, which throws doubts as to their suitability for implementation in actual equipment. In this article, we provide a brief overview of optical transmission systems and some of their performance specifications. We then present a simple, robust, and bandwidth-efficient OFDM synchronization method and carry out measurements to validate the presented synchronization method with the aid of an experimental setup.	adaptive server enterprise;channel capacity;digital signal processing;experiment;fiber-optic communication;frequency divider;information exchange;multiplexing;optical fiber;pmd;quality of service;software deployment	Oluyemi Omomukuyo;Octavia A.

0c54f53b26c5d9762f8e4bdfe0852faf68d828a2	fairness-aware radio resource management for medical interoperability between wban and wlan		Wireless body area networks (WBANs) in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands have been increasingly adopted for various medical applications. Due to the shared nature of the ISM bands, when a WBAN coexists with a wireless local area network (WLAN), performance of WBAN may significantly degrade because of asymmetric attributes between WBAN and WLAN such as transmit power and response time. In this paper, we propose a novel channel access protocol for achieving effective channel sharing in the aspect of efficiency and fairness, which adaptively controls the contention window size of WLAN based on the delay information of WBAN. Our extensive simulation results for real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring show that the proposed scheme can guarantee the required quality of service of WBAN while insignificant degradation of WLAN performance.	algorithm;coexist (image);elegant degradation;fairness measure;implicit shape model;interoperability;quality of service;radio resource management;real-time clock;response time (technology);sfiaplus;simulation	Byeong-Moon Cho;Kyung-Joon Park;Eun-Chan Park	2016	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/s12243-016-0499-6	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	10.807759713963499	85.98606117929857	163606

However, the general existence of faulty sensor measurements in networks will cause degradation of the network service quality and huge burden of the precious energy. While cryptography-based approaches are helpless of information generation, reputation systems are demonstrated of positive results. In this paper, we investigate the benefits of a distributed reputation system in target localization. A node reputation is defined as its measurement performance and is computed by the Dirichlet distribution. By assuming the sensing model of each node to be mixed Gaussian, we use reputation to estimate parameters of the sensing model and modify a node's original measurement. We also develop a reputation-based local voting algorithm to filter the untrustworthy data and then estimate the target location by a particle swarm optimization algorithm. To assure energy efficiency of the proposed approach, we use a reputation-based model to indicate the information importance of each data packet and ensure that a more important packet can be delivered with higher reliability. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the reputation system and demonstrate its accuracy and energy efficiency.	algorithm;cryptography;elegant degradation;experiment;mathematical optimization;network packet;particle swarm optimization;reputation system	Xue Wang;Liang Ding;Daowei Bi	2010	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2009.2022445	wireless sensor network;computer science;engineering;distributed computing;sensor fusion;efficient energy use;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	13.86944582499095	75.92288029893776	163687

Since the RSS decreases on the average with distance, it carries some information about the distance to an unknown node. By ordering the RSS's, we conclude that there are some convex sets where the position of the unknown node can be found in the intersection of them. We introduce a plane projection onto convex sets (PPOCS) approach to solve the positioning problem.

5dedc0f29ff0461700ff15fd1da5c5f9d2221313	synchronization and detection techniques for navigation and communication systems		Synchronization is a key issue in any communication system, but it becomes fundamental in the navigation systems, which are entirely based on the estimation of the time delay of the signals coming from the satellites. Thus, even if synchronization has been a well known topic for many years, the introduction of new modulations and new physical layer techniques in the modern standards makes the traditional synchronization strategies completely ineffective. For this reason, the design of advanced and innovative techniques for synchronization in modern communication systems, like DVB-SH, DVB-T2, DVB-RCS, WiMAX, LTE, and in the modern navigation system, like Galileo, has been the topic of the activity. Recent years have seen the consolidation of two different trends: the introduction of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) in the communication systems, and of the Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) modulation in the modern Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Thus, a particular attention has been given to the investigation of the synchronization algorithms in these areas.

MEMS micro robots are low-power and low-memory capacity devices that can sense and act. To deal with the MEMS micro robots characteristics, in this paper, we present an efficient redeployment algorithm without predefined positions of the target shape, which reduces the memory usage to a constant complexity. This algorithm optimizes the energy consumption by minimizing the amount of displacement and the number of messages. This solution improves the memory usage (number of states), the execution time and the number of movements by using movement of different micro robots at the same time. In addition, we show how to predict the number of movement for each node to make the algorithm robust.	algorithm;displacement mapping;fault tolerance;goto;low-power broadcasting;microbotics;microelectromechanical systems;robot;routing;run time (program lifecycle phase);scalability;software portability	Hicham Lakhlef;Julien Bourgeois;Hakim Mabed	2014	2014 IEEE 28th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/AINA.2014.128	communications protocol;distributed algorithm;prediction;shape;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;parallel algorithm;microelectromechanical systems;robustness;computer network;logical topology	Robotics	13.332995908038503	74.5659312183065	164473

Moving toward this next generation of PSCs warrants a new perspective of increased heterogeneity in emerging wireless architectures and increased multiplexing of wireless spectrum. To realize this vision, models that incentivize users to opportunistically share their spectrum as substrates over possibly multiple hops, and decentralized and open techniques that seamlessly exploit these substrates for public safety applications are much needed. The value of such multihop and multi-technology pervasive spectrum sharing (PSS) is more pronounced for application scenarios in which the need for spectrum access is vital, and infrastructure-less operation is necessary. This article introduces PSS as a new architecture where sharing is the norm, and outlines its vision, principles, and technical challenges.	multi-function printer;multiplexing;pervasive informatics;physical symbol system;wireless router	Murat Yuksel;Ismail Güvenç;Walid Saad;Naim Kapucu	2016	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2016.7432143	spectrum management;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	21.873955257297276	86.6272195916404	164482

Many companies and research institutes are carrying out preliminary studies of next-generation services and providing their outlook and requirements for the 5G service. These studies pointed out that the possibility of service disruption due to high propagation loss and block cause by an obstacle in the communication path is a challenging issue.

In this paper, we explore the impacts of some important factors of WiFi environments on the energy consumption of mobile phones, which are typical IoT end devices. The factors involve the WiFi signal strength under good signal conditions, the type and the amount of protocol packets that are initiated by WiFi APs (Access Points) to maintain basic network communication with the phones. Controlled experiments are conducted to quantitatively study the phone energy impacts by the above WiFi environmental factors. To describe such impacts, we construct a time-based signal strength-aware energy model and packet type/amount-aware energy models. The models constructed in the paper corroborate the following user experience on phone energy consumption: (1) a phone's energy is drawn faster under higher WiFi signal strengths than under lower ones even in normal signal conditions; (2) phones consume energy faster in a public WiFi network than in a private one even in the basic phone state. The energy modeling methods proposed in the paper enable ordinary developers to analyze phone energy draw conveniently by utilizing inexpensive power meters as measurement tools. The modeling methods are general and are able to be used for phones of any type and any platform.	energy modeling;experiment;mobile phone;network packet;user experience;sensor (device)	Yuxia Sun;Junxian Chen;Yong Tang;Yanjia Chen	2018		10.3390/s18061728		Mobile	18.70534588363567	79.27123311368216	164820

However, due to the unreliable wireless communication, robust query processing in such networks becomes a great challenge in the design of query evaluation algorithms for some mission-critical tasks. In this paper we propose an adaptive, localized algorithm for robust top-k query processing in sensor networks, which trades off between the energy consumption and the accuracy of query results. In the proposed algorithm, whether a sensor is to forward the collected data to the base station is determined in accordance with the calculation of a proposed local function, which is the estimation of the probability of transmitting the data successfully. We also conduct extensive experiments by simulations on real datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is energy-efficient while achieving the specified accuracy of the query results.	algorithm;database;experiment;mission critical;sensor;simulation;transmitter	Baichen Chen;Weifa Liang;Geyong Min	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23088-2_11	online aggregation;sargable;query optimization;query expansion;web query classification;data processing;computer science;base station;data mining;database;environmental monitoring;view;world wide web;information retrieval;wireless	DB	11.104233280479564	75.22757694081233	165116

Conventionally, stationary sensors are used to carry out sensing tasks in a region of interest. However, if the region is much larger than the sensing range of a single sensor, stationary sensor networks could incur many problems such as the complicated reciprocal effects between coverage and communication ranges. This paper proposes a method to collect sensing data by mobile sensors. The method first selects critical sensing locations using detection performance as a metric. The sensing tasks are assigned to a number of mobile sensors. These mobile sensors are arranged to collect sensing data through routes as short as possible. In particular, to balance the load, the routes should be planed in approximately equal in length. An approach, namely Balanced Route Planning (BRP), is developed to arrange mobile sensors' patrolling paths. The load balance condition of BRP is evaluated by simulations. The results show that BRP is a fair and effective scheme for allotting sensing tasks for mobile sensors.	algorithm;approximation;computer simulation;habitat;load balancing (computing);region of interest;robot control;sensor;stationary process	Tai-Lin Chin;Yuan-Tzu Yen	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214152	embedded system;wireless sensor network;computer science;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	11.654167258764476	77.29800539383434	165208

The goal is to find the optimal routing not only to maximize the lifetime of the network but also to provide real-time data transmission services. Considering a wireless sensor network where the nodes have limited energy, we propose a novel model Energy ∗ Delay based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm (E&D ANTS) to minimize the time delay in transferring a fixed number of data from the source nodes to the destination nodes in an energy-constrained manner. In the algorithm, an amount of artificial ants randomly explored the network and exchanged collected network information to periodically update ant routing-tables which were obtained by having integrated partial pheromones and heuristic values. Our study is focused on influence functions of pheromones. Because of the tradeoff of energy and delay in wireless network systems, we propose the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to train our model. The simulation results show that our method boasts undoubtedly a number of attractive features, including adaptation, robustness and stability.	algorithm;apache ant (another neat tool)	Yaofeng Wen;Yuquan Chen;Dahong Qian	2007			wireless sensor network;electrical efficiency;computer science;engineering;machine learning;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;ant;network delay;computer network	Embedded	10.037447059100481	80.63220176722426	165394

In particular, this bandwidth shortage poses a serious challenge in the current satellite TV broadcasting systems because of the strictly limited bandwidth available in C and Ku frequency bands. Aiming at mitigating the bandwidth shortage problem, this paper proposes an innovative mixed channel transmission scheme for the next generation satellite TV systems. The proposed scheme integrates the merits of using both broadcast and multicast methods, both Ku and Ka frequency bands, as well as both wide-shaped and spot antenna beam types. According to the conducted comprehensive simulation experiments, this mixed scheme is able to effectively enhance the frequency bandwidth utilization with still providing users affordable quality of experience. Moreover, to cope with the impact brought by ever increasing number of provided TV channels, this paper enhances the proposed scheme by using multicast method to transmit those least popular global channels, which can efficiently reduce the quality of experience degradation up to 90% in Ku- and Ka-band frequency resource restricted scenarios.	bandwidth (signal processing)	Junyu Lai;Jie Zhao;Wei Zhang;Ci He;Yasheng Zhang	2017	Int.

We summarize and discuss TVWS regulatory requirements and LRWPAN applications, the two major driving forces motivating the formation of the new IEEE 802.15.4m standard. These forces define the criteria necessary for consideration during IEEE 802.15.4m system design to meet regulatory requirements and optimize performance. First, system design is presented from the perspective of LR-WPAN channelization with reference to the TV channel plan. Next, design considerations for network architecture and topology are discussed by relating the architecture requirement in TVWS regulations to that in the legacy IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Third, the PHY and MAC layer designs, which are crucial for meeting the criterion of optimizing LR-WPAN performance to support potential applications, are studied. In the PHY layer, the existing design in IEEE 802.15.4 is listed and discussed with regard to its applicability and reusability in TVWS. In the MAC layer, two functional entities, the TVWS operation-enabling feature and the dynamic frequency-band switching mechanism, are discussed with respect to their necessity and practicality for performance enhancement.	channelization (telecommunications);entity;lr parser;network architecture;phy (chip);requirement;systems design;white spaces (radio)	Chin-Sean Sum;Liru Lu;Ming-Tuo Zhou;Fumihide Kojima;Hiroshi Harada	2013	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2013.6495764	ieee 802.11s;embedded system;network allocation vector;neurfon;ieee 802.1x;ieee 802;telecommunications;ieee 802.11b-1999;ieee 802.11u;ieee 802.11h-2003;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Embedded	23.037692443588316	85.74919311254526	166050

This is due to the incidence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) distance measurements between the anchors and an unlocalized node. While a large corpus of research work dealt with the scenario where the NLOS distances form a minority of the total distances to anchors, there has been not much research done to handle the situation where a majority or even all distance measurements to anchors are NLOS in nature. In our previous work, we showed that using localizers in a cluttered environment can improve the localization accuracy of a target node even when all the distance measurements are NLOS. Instead of NLOS bias, these techniques suffer residual multi-hop error, which is caused due to the distance overestimate when a multi-hop chain is used instead of the straight-line distance. In this paper, we analyze the effect of clutter topology on the multi-hop error. We use machine learning techniques to estimate the aggregate forms of the multi-hop error for a given clutter topology when only characteristic features of the clutter topology are provided.	aggregate data;algorithm;clutter;incidence matrix;machine learning;shortest path problem;software deployment;vii	Muzammil Hussain;Agathoniki Trigoni	2014	2014 12th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)	10.1109/WIOPT.2014.6850307	telecommunications;machine learning	Mobile	17.497064292375217	74.78849723740178	166348

Most of home automation networks (depending on the specific application) are mainly characterized by periodic traffic flows. In soft real-time contexts, the main problem is represented by the efficient allocation of guaranteed time slots (GTSs) for periodic traffic flows transmission in IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Moreover, it is important to ensure adequate performance for those embedded devices competing for the access to the medium through the carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance algorithm (CSMA/CA). The main aim of this paper is to show a new approach for network flows scheduling in home automation applications based on IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor networks. This work addresses several advantages due to the introduction of rate monotonic (RM) for guaranteed time slots (GTSs) allocation combined with priority-based CSMA/CA for latencies reduction on transmission attempts as clearly demonstrated by obtained results.

28d9dfa3a103f342cd5dd14f268392468695bc9f	receiver memory management method for harq in lte-based satellite communication system	satellite communication;lte;geo;harq memory management	For the successful deployment of the long term evolution (LTE)-based mobile satellite service, the price of a user terminal is one of the major factors. A user terminal for the LTE-based satellite communication needs to be implemented with a similar hardware size that is used for a terrestrial LTE user terminal. However, for quality of service provision, the satellite user terminal needs a larger size of memories than the terrestrial terminal does. This is very evident by considering that the N -channel stop and wait hybrid automatic repeat request requires proportionally increasing memory size by the propagation delay, resulting in unmanageable amount of memories in the satellite system. To resolve this problem, we propose an efficient memory management method at the user terminal when the size of memory is insufficient. The simulation results in this paper reveal that the proposed method can increase the throughput about 20.7% when a user terminal is operated under very low throughput condition with an insufficient memory size, compared with the case without memory management scheme. In addition, we show that the additional throughput gain can be obtained by the packet scheduling using the information of receiver memory status.

758e09a561d82b6b911d78223890bbbf011c9dfb	topological entropy in wireless networks subject to composite fading		We analyze topological entropy in wireless networks that are subject to local scattering and macroscopic shadowing effects. To this end, we model a network as a random geometric graph with probabilistic pair connections (due to channel randomness) and define uncertainty as the Shannon entropy of the underlying graph ensemble. We present new bounds on topological entropy that are functionals of the underlying composite fading distributions and use these to show that different fading models lead to very different network entropies under certain conditions, a result that has significant implications for self-organization and storage of the network state. We also study the behavior of the entropy bounds as the number of nodes n in the network grows large while the typical connection range r0 varies monotonically with n. This analysis leads to two key results that quantify the rate of growth or decay of r0, as a function of the number of nodes n, that must be obeyed in order for the entropy bounds to converge to a positive limit. Although the contributions of this paper are theoretical, they have applications in systems such as ad hoc networks employing opportunistic routing and device-to-device (D2D) networks for future cellular communication.	converge;directed graph;entropy (information theory);formal system;geometric graph theory;hoc (programming language);mobile phone;network topology;overhead (computing);random geometric graph;randomness;routing;routing table;self-organization;shannon (unit);topological entropy	Justin P.

A general scenario is considered for deployed networks with two types of sensor nodes, harvesting enabled nodes (HNs), and none-harvesting nodes (NHNs). The aim is to use only the HNs for relaying packets, while NHNs use will be limited to sensing and transmitting their own readings. The problem is modeled using graph theory and reduced to finding the minimum weighted connected dominating set in a vertex weighted graph. A limited number of relay nodes is added at the positions close to the NHNs in the resulted set. The weight function ensures minimizing the number of NHNs in the set, and thus reducing the relay nodes to be added. Our contribution is to consider relay node placement (addition) in energy harvesting WSN, where only HNs are used to forward packets. This is to preserve the limited energy of NHNs. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed relay node addition strategy prolongs the network lifetime, from the double, to factors of several tens of times. This is at a reasonable cost in terms of the number of relay nodes added, which is compared to a lower-bound derived in the paper.	computation;connected dominating set;graph theory;greedy algorithm;heuristic;lattice boltzmann methods;linear programming;np-hardness;relay;routing;simulation;time complexity;transmitter;uncompressed video;weight function	Djamel Djenouri;Miloud Bagaa	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248303	telecommunications;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;relay channel;computer network	Robotics	11.347359237640593	79.9536125730439	166928
f86814660bdb17d1c8abfd918ee1e2b22585d666	a comprehensive survey on blind source separation for wireless adaptive processing: principles, perspectives, challenges and new research directions		With the rapid proliferation of wireless services, the frequency spectrum has become increasingly crowded, and the interferences and composite signals will be ubiquitous in the wireless receiver. For deeply dissecting and detecting the expected signals, the research community has to investigate the smart signal processing technology to resisting the influence of detrimental signals. For this purpose, blind source separation has been shown to be a promising method for achieving simultaneous spectrum utilization and wireless adaptive interference cancellation. The attractive features and appealing advantages of blind source separation make it an attractive theory for source extraction or recovery, which plays a crucial role in helping realize intelligent signal processing for wireless communication. It can recover the unobserved sources only from the wireless received mixed signals based on the features of the source signal exempted from channel estimation and synchronization manipulation. Wireless communication systems can benefit the high spectrum efficiency, strong anti-interference, and adaptive signal processing through the blind separation mechanism. So far, numerous researchers have made tremendous efforts to investigate this field for enhancing spectrum efficiency, anti-interference ability, and signal detection performance through employing the philosophy of blind separation. These meaningful and appealing research works motivate us to make a comprehensive survey with regard to this area. In this paper, the fundamental principle of the blind separation mechanism, involving independent component analysis, sparse component analysis, non-negative matrix factorization, and bounded component analysis will be reviewed briefly, and then, the critical technologies applied in various wireless communication systems will be overviewed, such as in direct-sequence code division multiplexing access, frequency hopping, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, multiple input multiple output, wireless sensor networks, cognitive radio networks, radio frequency identification devices, and communication security. In addition, the important research challenges and meaningful research directions pertaining to the area of blind separation applied in wireless communications systems are also discussed.	blind signal separation;channel state information;cognitive radio;communications security;detection theory;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;independent component analysis;interference (communication);multiplexing;non-negative matrix factorization;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;sensor;signal detection (psychology);signal processing;source separation;sparse matrix;spectral density;spectral efficiency;visually impaired persons	Zhongqiang Luo;Chengjie Li;Lidong Zhu	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879380	wireless sensor network;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;distributed computing;signal processing;cognitive radio;blind signal separation;computer science;spectral efficiency;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;multiplexing	Mobile	21.450198573185165	85.12880595894336	166954

However, these works can only work well for regular data patterns. In this work, we further consider the scenario that the network may randomly have urgent events. Assume that time is divided into fixed-length slots, and several consecutive slots are grouped as a frame. For a node, we assign one regular slot and several event slots to it. Each node wakes up in its regular slots to sense the environmental information and to gather reports from its child nodes. In a frame, each node also wakes up in the assigned event slots for a short period to detect possible events. When detecting an event, the node wakes its ancestors up to relay event packets. In this paper, we design a two-phase approach to support quick event detection and reporting in a low-duty-cycled WSN. Simulation results show that our designs can indeed achieve our goals.	randomness;relay;run-length encoding;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;tree (data structure);two-phase commit protocol;two-phase locking	Meng-Shiuan Pan;Ping-Lin Liu	2014	2014 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785487	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	10.106134169731131	82.47233546329298	167159

One common functionality of networks formed by such directional sensors is to monitor a set of discrete targets continuously. Large scale deployment makes sensor recharge impossible. By abundant deployment, it is reasonable and necessary to select subsets of sensors to operate alternatively so as to prolong the network lifetime. Such problem has been proved to be NP-Complete. This paper approximates network lifetime problem by randomized algorithm. Through constructing  elementary sessions , which denotes active subset of sensors covering all targets, and linear programming, the approximating solution is derived within extremely less duration comparing to previous works.

Most existing studies focused on mapping and scheduling tasks to multiple sensors to ensure the task can be completed before deadline. Nevertheless, one vital aspect is neglected, that is, self-organization of WSN in task allocation. In this paper, we consider the problem of complex task allocation in which a task requires different resources for execution. A task-oriented self-organization mechanism is proposed to guarantee real time in task assignment. Toward this end, the frequently accessed sensors in previous task allocation will modify their structural links that can achieve a better allocation of tasks in the future.

a08c1a576803447ef49a9de227f8181f104bb790	comparison of lorawan classes and their power consumption		Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications benefit greatly from low-power long-range connectivity. A promising technology to achieve the low-power and long-range requirements is seen in LoRaWAN, a media access control (MAC) protocol maintained by the LoRa Alliance and leveraging Semtech's patented LoRa radio modulation technology. LoRaWAN provides three different device classes (A, B and C), which provide a tradeoff between performance (i.e., throughput and latency) and energy consumption. This paper offers a theoretical and experimental comparison of these classes. The objective of the quantitative experiment was twofold: to verify the published current levels of different operating modes in a LoRa chip's datasheet and to compare the battery lifetime for the LoRa class A and C modes of operation. We used a high-end current sensing circuit to gather the voltage levels and temporal variation with increasing payload sizes and spreading factors. Using the Ohmic Law, the energy drain can be calculated and compared across the different spreading factors (SF) and classes.	access control;block cipher mode of operation;datasheet;internet of things;low-power broadcasting;modulation;requirement;throughput	Phui San Cheong;Johan Bergs;Chris Hawinkel;Jeroen Famaey	2017	2017 IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology (SCVT)	10.1109/SCVT.2017.8240313	latency (engineering);real-time computing;chip;throughput;media access control;modulation;energy consumption;bandwidth (signal processing);datasheet;computer science	Mobile	12.175461966908465	84.78698515694623	167440

This paper first presents an ATDOA localization model, and then primarily focuses on two new localization algorithms for the system. The first algorithm is a two-step positioning algorithm that combines semidefinite programming (SDP) with a Taylor series method to achieve global convergence as well as superior estimation accuracy, and the second algorithm is a constrained least-squares method that has the advantage of low complexity and fast convergence while maintaining good performance. In addition, a novel receiver re-selection method is presented to significantly improve estimation accuracy. In this paper, we also derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the ATDOA positioning system using a distance-dependent noise variance model, which describes a realistic indoor propagation channel.	algorithm;least squares;local convergence;multilateration;positioning system;semidefinite programming;software propagation	Shuai He;Xiaodai Dong;Wu-Sheng Lu	2017	EURASIP J.

This paper studies the age of information from a scheduling perspective. We consider a wireless broadcast network where a base-station updates many users on stochastic information arrivals. Suppose that only one user can be updated for each time. In this context, we aim at developing a transmission scheduling algorithm for minimizing the long-run average age. To develop a low-complexity transmission scheduling algorithm, we apply the Whittle's framework for restless bandits. We successfully derive the Whittle index in a closed form and establish the indexability. Based on the Whittle index, we propose a scheduling algorithm, while experimentally showing that it closely approximates an age-optimal scheduling algorithm.	algorithm;experiment;fractal dimension;information;replay attack;scheduling (computing)	Yu-Pin Hsu	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2018.8437712	mathematical optimization;broadcasting (networking);computer science;scheduling (computing);wireless;information age	Embedded	16.927507757099722	83.02136161545506	167930
d782b3f69f0d9f1e5c354a619c311a280e231efd	a modified optimization model for the location selection of distribution transformer used in rural power network	distribution transformer;modified optimization model;model research;rural power network;location selection	The rural power networks play a very important role in the power network in China. The rural networks built in the old days are usually not standardized, and therefore, a lot of problems emerged these days. Such as, most of the transmission line is aged, the insulation ability of the transmission line degraded, the household voltage is relatively low, the distribution network line loss is very high, and so on. As the rural power network mainly distributes in the hilly and mountainous land, the altitude of the load points has an important impact to the location of distribution transformer. Meanwhile, because of the existence of the sag, the length of the transmission line is not a straight-line distance. Therefore, this paper modified the traditional optimization model used in the location of distribution transformer, introduced the line correction coefficient (α) which was connected with the sag, improved the line distance computational formula according to the altitude of the load points, and put forward the modified optimization model which is called M-TLOM. Then, an optimized location system of distribution transformer (DTLOS 1.0) based on the Visual Basic 6.0 was developed. The instance analysis indicated that, the modified model could reduce the loss of distribution network.	transformer	Chao Tang;Shiping Zhu;Jiao Li;Daojun Zhang;Jun Yang	2014	JCP	10.4304/jcp.9.4.875-882	telecommunications;distribution transformer	ECom	24.563005584065333	78.83552588870691	168133

Many transmission schemes are studied such as point to point links using diversity coding, point to point links using multiplexing, tradeoffs between both and at last multi-point to point links. This last scheme was already covered by Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) processing but a step forward was made with multiple subscriber detection. This paper asses the multi-point to point links for uplink and point to multi-point for the downlink based on OFDM waveform in the frame of the Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) IEEE Std 802.16-2004 or HIPERMAN standard. It describes a realistic implementation of transceivers for Physical (PHY) layer to Medium Access Control (MAC) layer allowing a system capacity increase with minor modifications of the standard and with a low impact on the complexity of the subscriber equipment. In this context, this paper proposes to focus on based-band techniques: The Obele algorithm based on the channel knowledge in the downlink and multiple-user detection in the uplink. The algorithm complexity and the tradeoffs for implementation are extensively discussed.	baseband	Patrick Rosson;Marc Chenu-Tournier;Dominique Noguet	2006	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-005-9010-9	complexity;eigendecomposition of a matrix;channel access method;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;point-to-point;computer science;wireless distribution system;computer network	Mobile	24.208980995084907	83.92061943754992	168256

We propose to deploy sensors in polygon layers over a locally computable equilateral triangle tessellation (TT) for optimal F-coverage formation, and introduce two types of deployment polygon, H-polygon and C-polygon. We propose two strictly localized solution algorithms, Greedy Advance (GA), and Greedy-Rotation-Greedy (GRG). The two algorithms drive sensors to move along the TT graph to surround POI. In GA, nodes greedily proceed as close to POI as they can; in GRG, when their greedy advance is blocked, nodes rotate around POI along locally computed H- or C-polygon to a vertex where greedy advance can resume. We prove that they both yield a connected network with maximized hole-free area coverage. To our knowledge, they are the first localized sensor self-deployment algorithms that provide such coverage guarantee. We further analyze their coverage radius property. Our study shows that GRG guarantees optimal or near optimal coverage radius. Through extensive simulation we as well evaluate their performance on convergence time, energy consumption, and node collision.	computable function;greedy algorithm;point of interest;sensor;simulation;software deployment;software release life cycle	Xu Li;Hannes Frey;Nicola Santoro;Ivan Stojmenovic	2011	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2010.261	mathematical optimization;greedy algorithm;simulation;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;mobile computing	Mobile	13.159137316183573	75.94293630374209	168288

Such an issue is becoming increasingly more challenging with the emerging of information-intensive applications that require high data collection rate. To address this issue, in this paper, we investigate the throughput capacity of WSNs, where multiple mobile relays are deployed to collect data from static sensors and forward them to a static sink. To facilitate the discussion, we propose a new mobile-relay-assisted data collection (MRADC) model. Based on this model, we analyze the achievable throughput capacity of large-scale WSNs using a constructive approach, which can achieve a certain throughput by choosing appropriate mobility parameters. Our analysis illustrates that, if the number of relays is less than a threshold, then the throughput capacity can be linearly increased with more relays. On the other hand, if the number is greater than the threshold, then the throughput capacity becomes a constant, and the capacity gain over a static WSN depends on two factors: 1) the transmission range and 2) the impact of interference. To verify our analysis, we conduct extensive simulation experiments, which validate the selection of mobility parameters and demonstrate the same throughput behaviors obtained by analysis.	experiment;interference (communication);relay;sensor;simulation;throughput	Wang Liu;Kejie Lu;Jianping Wang;Liusheng Huang;Dapeng Oliver Wu	2012	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2012.2188145	electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;capacitive sensing;computer network	Mobile	12.076564195327531	82.24125513061337	168335

Our approach uses cloud computing data center as the central communication and optimization infrastructure supporting a cognitive radio network of AMI meters which we label netbook advance metering infrastructure (Net-AMI). The Net-AMI is a novel low cost infrastructure of AMI meters that operate akin to netbooks with wireless transceiver that access to cloud data center energy services, cognitive radio services, and wireless communication services. Access occurs via cognitive radios channels. We claim that this solution solves the important problem in smart grid systems of how to develop an extensible, persistent, smart grid information network with a lifespan equivalent to that of most power systems (20-30 years). By persistence, we imply always operable, entirely software upgradeable, and independent of cellular networks. Our system is extensible and can easily handle thousands of variations in power systems, communication protocols, control, and energy optimization protocols. We formulate necessary link analysis and optimum scheduling of downlink and uplink Net-AMI packets in a multiuser cognitive radio environment.	cloud computing;cognitive radio;data center;ibm power systems;link analysis;mathematical optimization;microgrid;multi-user;netbook;operability;persistence (computer science);scheduling (computing);smart meter;telecommunications link;transceiver	Kranthimanoj Nagothu;Brian Todd Kelley;Mo M.

3040348de64aa44a957a718066bd6685cedf902e	assessing combinatorial design for analyzing system performance of a computer network		Combinatorial design concerns with the arrangement of a finite set of elements into patterns (subsets, words, arrays) according to specified rules. The usefulness of this design method is that the number of input combination can be reduced dramatically, but the combinatorial set covers all of them. This paper presents the application of this design method in communication networks. Communication engineers can use this novel method to generate test cases for producing a cost-effective set of experiments to recognize the factors that have the least and most impact on the system's performance. A familiar scenario is used for the experiment, and five factors with different values are chosen to qualify their effect on the network performance. The experimental set is generated using combinatorial design method, and then it is used to analyze the impact of each factor. The experiments showed the effectiveness of the method to be used for analyzing the effect of factors on the communication network.	experiment;network performance;telecommunications network;test case	Bestoun S.

5288181faa2d9cb461450178bb8e65c3dfe037d5	a method of improving the tracking method of csi personnel		In the trajectory tracking process of indoor environment, in order to reduce the communication overhead and reduce the complexity of the algorithm, a human trajectory tracking method for improving the CSI (Channel State Information) signal is proposed. Firstly, the AOA (Angle-of-Arrival) spectrum is extracted from the CSI to represent the probability of the target position (angle), and the Doppler shift obtained by the Music algorithm is combined with the AOA spectrum to determine the moving speed and position of the personnel. Finally, The neural network algorithm determines the position of personnel and simulates the movement trajectory of the personnel to achieve accurate tracking and positioning of indoor personnel. Compared with other algorithms and different people’s movement speeds, simulation experiments show that the personnel tracking method proposed in this paper can greatly improve the accuracy and stability of positioning.

To build an efficient communication network is crucial for the success of a smart grid network. This study improves the previous published work by proposing two novel evolutionary heuristic approaches (discrete differential evolutionary clustering approach and particle swarm optimisation clustering approach) to obtain the minimum number and location of the powerful nodes to fulfil the connectivity requirement of a smart meters network. The contribution of this study includes the designing and implementing of the two novel evolutionary heuristic approaches which could significantly improve the optimal solution [the least number of the local data centres (powerful nodes)] for a smart meter network which has arbitrary number of smart meters (ordinary nodes) with arbitrary transmission range. Comprehensive case studies and numerical statistical analysis demonstrate that the approaches could efficiently obtain better optimal results, and the connectivity of the smart meter network could be fulfilled with minimum number of the powerful nodes.	heuristic	Hui Miao;Guo Chen;Zhao Yang Dong	2016	IET Networks	10.1049/iet-net.2016.0003	simulation;engineering;theoretical computer science;machine learning	HPC	18.883300860404272	85.11961147183015	168635

4ca2abd5ea2a001145439f3e03d0da9390f02609	machine learning-aided radio scenario recognition for cognitive radio networks in millimeter-wave bands		Radio scenario recognition is critically important to acquire comprehensive situation awareness for cognitive radio networks in the millimeter-wave bands, especially for dense small cell environment. In this paper, a generic framework of machine learning-aided radio scenario recognition scheme is proposed to acquire the environmental awareness. Particularly, an advanced back propagation neural network-based AdaBoost classification algorithm is developed to recognize various radio scenarios, in which different channel conditions such as line-of-sight (LOS), non-line-of-sight (NLOS), and obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) are encountered by the desired signal or co-channel interference. Moreover, the advanced AdaBoost algorithm takes the offline training performance into account during the decision fusion. Simulation results show that machine learning can be exploited to recognize the complicated radio scenarios reliably and promptly.	cognitive radio;machine learning	Jingyun Wang;Youping Zhao;Xingjie Guo;Chen Sun	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-76207-4_5	adaboost;cognitive radio;artificial neural network;machine learning;non-line-of-sight propagation;extremely high frequency;backpropagation;situation awareness;computer science;artificial intelligence;communication channel	Vision	19.557811550024375	87.64394815727015	168717

As the agents move towards an event to localize it, the coverage of the region deteriorates; on the other hand, if an agent does not help in localizing an event, it will take longer for other agents to localize it. The decision on how an agent should trade off localization and coverage depends on a particular network deployment. We show how different deployments can be parametrized and propose a distributed algorithm to solve the task allocation problem. The algorithm is shown to be stable and scalable, and is shown to converge to an optimal equilibrium position. The proposed parametrization of the task allocation problem depends on the number of agents in the network; we thus present a fast and robust algorithm based on consensus protocols for estimating this number.	collision detection;converge;convex set;correctness (computer science);discrepancy function;distributed algorithm;event-driven architecture;internationalization and localization;mobile agent;scalability;software deployment	Carlos H.

baae7370d21b8f20283e3e6c162b3332424d237c	poster: on the immortality of wireless sensor networks by wireless energy transfer - a node deployment perspective	elektroteknik och elektronik;electrical engineering electronic engineering information engineering	The lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be substantially extended by transferring energy wirelessly to the sensor nodes. In this poster, a wireless energy transfer (WET) enabled WSN is presented, where a base station transfers energy wirelessly to the sensor nodes that are deployed in several regions of interest, to supply them with energy to sense and to upload data. The WSN lifetime can be extended by deploying redundant sensor nodes, which allows the implementation of duty-cycling mechanisms to reduce nodes’ energy consumption. In this context, a problem on sensor node deployment naturally arises, where one needs to determine how many sensor nodes to deploy in each region such that the total number of nodes is minimized, and the WSN is immortal. The problem is formulated as an integer optimization, whose solution is challenging due to the binary decision variables and a non-linear constraint. A greedybased algorithm is proposed to achieve the optimal solution of such deployment problem. It is argued that such scheme can be used in monitoring systems in smart cities, such as smart buildings and water lines.	algorithm;duty cycle;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;region of interest;sensor node;smart city;software deployment;the immortal;upload	Rong Du;Carlo Fischione;Ming Xiao	2017			embedded system;telecommunications;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	10.977129721347977	79.43659057174301	168855

This algorithm improves the DV-Hop in a special situation to get the unknown nodes’ initial positions and employs the Cube Radius scale to get the final position.

It has been demonstrated that the use of a mobile sink can significantly increase the network lifetime by balancing the load among nodes. However, in existing solutions, nodes either send their data through multihop towards the sink which induces energy consumption due to relaying process, or the nodes store the data until the sink comes at their vicinity, which usually requires an infinite buffer capacity or induces buffer overflow if the buffer is of fixed size. In this paper, we propose a new approach in which nodes send their data through multihop path of reduced length by offering nodes the possibility to buffer data while waiting the sink coming closer (not necessarily at node range), which exempts more sensors from relaying these data. This strategy allows to save energy, while ensuring no data is lost due to buffer overflow. We model the problem of optimizing WSN lifetime with limited buffer capacity and controlled mobile sink using a Linear Program (LP). For arbitrary topologies, our LP determines the sink sojourn times at each possible location, the data transfer rates between nodes and the buffered packets quantities. Compared to previous models, our solution achieves better lifetime and enables to generate and transmit more data to the mobile sink. We show that our scheme also better balance the load among nodes. Finally, we derive from the numerical results a distributed algorithm for data collection in WSN. We show through simulation that our approach leverages latency for energy saving, and we compare its performances against single-hop and multihop forwarding protocols.	buffer overflow;data buffer;distributed algorithm;linear programming;mathematical optimization;network packet;numerical analysis;performance;programming model;programming paradigm;sensor;simulation	Tifenn Rault;Abdelmadjid Bouabdallah;Yacine Challal	2013	Global Information Infrastructure Symposium - GIIS 2013	10.1109/GIIS.2013.6684346	telecommunications;engineering;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	10.091473929337903	81.09769943864845	168970

In this paper, we deal with the use of wireless networks at the device level. Specifically, after an analysis of the communication requirements, we introduce a general profile of a wireless fieldbus. Both the physical and data link layers are taken directly from existing wireless local area networks and wireless personal area networks standards, whereas the application layer is derived from the most popular wired fieldbuses. We discuss implementation issues related to two models of application layer protocols and present performance results obtained through numerical simulations.

Effective protocols for suchdata transfers rely on spatio-temporal correlations in sensor data for in-network data compression. The message complexity of these schemes is generally lowerbounded by n, for a network with n sensors, since correlation is not collocatedwith sensing. Consequently, as the number of nodes and network density increase,these protocols become increasingly inefficient. We present here a novel protocol,called SNP, for fine-grained data collection, which requires approximatelyO(n-R) messages, where R, a measure of redundancy in sensed data generallyincreases with density. SNP uses spatio-temporal correlations to near-optimally compress data at the source, reducing network traffic and power consumption.We present a comprehensive information theoretic basis for SNP and establishits superior performance in comparison to existing approaches. We support ourresults with a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the performance of SNPin a real-world sensor network testbed.	data compression;data rate units;information theory;network traffic control;sensor;testbed	Asad Awan;Suresh Jagannathan;Ananth Grama	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-89894-8_37	data compression;in situ resource utilization;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;data mining;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;statistics;computer network;data collection	Mobile	10.620147815688084	74.58149116593123	169172

Each node has a limited energy supply and generates information that needs to be communicated to a sink node. The basic operation in such a network is the systematic gathering and transmission of sensed data to a base station for further processing. During data gathering, sensors have the ability to perform in-network aggregation (fusion) of data packets route to the base station. The lifetime of such a sensor system is the time during which we can gather information from all the sensors to the base station. Given the location of sensors and the base station and the available energy at each sensor, we are interested in finding an efficient manner in which the data should be collected from all the sensors and transmitted to the base station at a given rate, such that system lifetime is maximized. We present an adaptive data aggregation node selection scheme to solve this problem. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed protocols significantly outperform previous methods, in terms of energy saving and system lifetime.	data aggregation	Sangbin Lee;Kyu-Ho Han;Kyungsoo Lim;Sunshin An	2007			telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Mobile	10.792142189673655	79.61770579011574	169243
d15ed77334bad75b16ce6343fbf390f4b99a030a	throughput, energy efficiency and interference characterisation of 802.11ac		This paper is the first of its kind in presenting a detailed characterisation of IEEE 802.11ac using real experiments. 802.11ac is the latest Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) standard that is rapidly being adapted because of its potential to deliver very high throughput. The throughput increase in 802.11ac can be attributed to three factors—larger channel width (80/160 MHz), support for denser modulation (256 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)) and increased number of spatial streams for Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO). We provide an experiment evaluation of these factors and their impact using a real 802.11ac testbed. Our findings provide numerous insights on benefits and challenges associated with using 802.11ac in practice. Because utilisation of larger channel width is one of the most significant changes in 802.11ac, we focus our study on understanding its impact on energy efficiency and interference. Using experiments, we show that utilising larger channel width is in general less energy efficient because of its higher power consumption in idle listening mode. Increasing the number of MIMO spatial streams is comparatively more energy efficient for achieving the same percentage increase in throughput. We also show that 802.11ac link witnesses severe unfairness issues when it coexists with legacy 802.11. We provide a detailed analysis to show how medium access in heterogeneous channel width environment leads to the unfairness issues. We believe that these and many other findings presented in this work will help in understanding and resolving various performance issues of next generation WLANs.

Based on the challenges due to emerging demands and rapid technological advance, the frontend of a radio frequency (RF) transceiver has to reorganize its typical architecture to achieve service convergence. A solution for the RF-frontend architecture of an Internet of Things sensor network oriented system is proposed. It has been identified that state-of-the-art technology has to improve in terms of spectrum allocation, driven bandwidth and energy consumption. Key strategies as Cognitive Radio/Software-Defined-Radio combined with high performance tunable RF components can satisfy these requirements, and thus, reconfigure and adapt the wireless transceiver for different environments and user needs. Furthermore, the frequency range of operation can also be greatly enhanced by using tunable components to enable agile and universal functionality, as well as significant improvement in the utilization of resources.	agile software development;cognitive radio;frequency allocation;frequency band;internet of things;radio frequency;requirement;smart city;transceiver	Erick Gonzalez-Rodriguez;Holger Maune;Lufei Shen;Ibrahim A.

However, the GNSS is inherently vulnerable to intended or unintended radio interference, and this threat has become more serious because of the easy availability of GNSS jammers on the market. From the robustness and safety perspectives, PNT services should not solely rely on GNSS. APNT solutions must be made available in the case of a GNSS outage. In this article, we investigate APNT solutions for aerial vehicles for which highly standardized PNT services are required to ensure secure and safe transportation, including solutions that have been proposed by the FAA in North America. We discuss the basic principle of each solution and analyze and compare their characteristics under different application scenarios. Finally, we conclude the article by predicting future trends in APNT solutions.	catastrophic interference;downtime;global positioning system;interference (communication);national executive committee for space-based positioning, navigation and timing;satellite navigation;television antenna	Shuai Han;Zijun Gong;Weixiao Meng;Cheng Li;Xuemai Gu	2016	IEEE Wireless Communications	10.1109/MWC.2016.1500181RP	air navigation;navigation;satellite navigation;simulation;gnss augmentation;global positioning system;gnss applications;static timing analysis	Mobile	23.49398112158267	79.24461649057656	169288

As they are expected to be deployed in harsh environments for long durations, the research community have turned their attention to tapping on ambient energy to power such networks. However, since energy harvesting rates are still significantly lower than the power consumption in each wireless sensor node, the energy availability is sporadic, making the design of runtime policies in WSN powered by ambient energy harvesting (WSN-HEAP) to maximize performance an important but challenging task. In this paper, using extensive simulations, we evaluate the efficacy of transmission power control for 2-D WSN-HEAP deployed in a grid topology in terms of throughput, data delivery ratio and fairness. When a fixed power is assigned to all nodes, we observe a trade-off between throughput and fairness: throughput is maximized at lower powers at the expense of fairness and vice versa. When nodes are assigned powers according to their proximity from the sinks, we observe that assigning the minimum transmission power required for each node to communicate with its nearest sink maximizes all performance metrics. This indicates that minimizing interference dominates over multi-sink redundancy in a 2-D WSN-HEAP.	fairness measure;interference (communication);network packet;regular grid;sensor node;simulation;throughput	Hwee Pink Tan;Alvin C.

Aggregates are computed from local device variables using functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX and MIN. The process of aggregation and detection is performed using a standard gossiping scheme. A key design element is to let nodes dynamically adjust their neighbor interaction rates according to the distance between the nodes' local estimate of the global aggregate and the threshold itself. We show that this allows considerable savings in communication overhead. In particular, the overhead becomes negligible when the aggregate is sufficiently far above or far below the threshold. We present evaluation results from simulation studies regarding protocol efficiency, quality of threshold detection, scalability, and controllability.	aggregate data;gossip protocol;max;overhead (computing);scalability;simulation	Fetahi Zebenigus Wuhib;Rolf Stadler;Mads Dam	2009	2009 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management	10.1109/INM.2009.5188818	network management;communications protocol;gossip protocol;network switch;computer science;distributed computing;computer security;artificial neural network;communications system;computer network	Arch	12.18417549009875	85.63218633839871	169532

Particularly, there have been several algorithms proposed to solve the DTC problem in the literature. However, these existing algorithms are all under the assumption that each node knows what kind of topology the whole system is as well as what kind of role it plays in the system. Obviously, such an assumption is not practical in wireless sensor networks since the topology of a wireless sensor network cannot be known in advance. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed algorithm to solve the DTC problem without any global assumption. Moreover, we further reduce the message complexity of the foregoing algorithm, and then propose a more message-efficient version, which is still not based on any global assumption.	computation;counting problem (complexity);distributed algorithm;leader election;need to know;network topology;sensor web	Che-Cheng Chang;Jichiang Tsai	2013	2013 IEEE 37th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference	10.1109/COMPSAC.2013.34	distributed algorithm;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;wireless sensor network;computer science;theoretical computer science;communication complexity;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;broadcasting;approximation algorithm;network topology;computer network	Embedded	11.758055411369986	80.20582650260195	169570

Based on our analysis, we also present recommendations on suitable values for the relevant network design parameters, which provide a reasonable tradeoff between accuracy and computational expense for this problem. In addition, we also analyse the theoretical Cramer-Rao bound as the benchmark for the best possible tracking performance. We demonstrate that the results from our simulations closely match the theoretical bounds. We also present initial results from experiments comprising of a 25 node wireless sensor network. Initial experimental results are promising and show that the PF based estimation is suitable for detection and tracking using inexpensive wireless sensor network devices.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;benchmark (computing);computation;experiment;network planning and design;pf (firewall);particle filter;performance evaluation;prototype;real-time transcription;sampling (signal processing);sensor web;simulation;software deployment;time complexity;tracking system	Nadeem Ahmed;Yifei Dong;Salil S.

8dc7cc939af832d071c2a050fd0284973ac70695	lorea: a backscatter reader for everyone!		Computational RFID (CRFID) platforms have enabled reconfigurable, battery-free applications for close to a decade. However, several factors have impeded their wide-spread adoption: low communication range, low throughput, and expensive infrastructure— CRFID readers usually cost upwards of $1000. This paper presents LoRea, a backscatter reader that achieves an order of magnitude higher range than existing CRFID readers, while costing a fraction of their price. LoRea achieves this by diverging from existing designs of CRFID readers and more specifically, how self-interference is tackled. LoRea builds on recent work that frequency-shifts backscatter transmissions away from the carrier signal to reduce selfinterference. LoRea also decouples the carrier generation from the reader, helping to further decrease self-interference. Decoupling carrier generation also enables the use of deployed infrastructure of smartphones and sensor nodes to provide the carrier signal. Together these methods reduce cost and complexity of the reader. LoRea also purposefully operates at lower bitrates than recent backscatter systems which enables high sensitivity and longer range. We evaluate LoRea experimentally and find that it achieves a communication range of up to 225 m in lineof-sight scenarios. In indoor environments, where the signal traverses several walls separating the reader and the backscatter tag, LoRea achieves a range of 30 m. These results illustrate how LoRea outperforms stateof-art backscatter systems and CRFID platforms.	carrier wave;complexity;coupling (computer programming);experiment;interference (communication);smartphone;throughput	Ambuj Varshney;Oliver Harms;Carlos M.

This paper presents a receiver-centric interference model featuring two main advantages over previous work. First, it reflects the fact that interference occurs at the intended receiver of a message. Second, the presented interference measure is robust with respect to addition or removal of single network nodes. Regarding both of these aspects our model intuitively corresponds to the behavior of interference in reality. Based on this interference model, we show that currently known topology control algorithms poorly reduce interference. Motivated by the observation that already one-dimensional network instances display the intricacy of the considered problem, we continue to focus on the so-called highway model. Setting out to analyze the special case of the exponential node chain, we eventually describe an algorithm guaranteeing to achieve a /spl I.nroot//spl Delta/-approximation (where n=4) of the optimal connectivity-preserving topology in the general highway model.	algorithm;existential quantification;foremost;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);time complexity;topology control	Pascal von Rickenbach;Stefan Schmid;Roger Wattenhofer;Aaron Zollinger	2005	19th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium	10.1109/IPDPS.2005.65	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer network;logical topology	Embedded	14.219702389457723	86.9035933457475	170422

In order to overcome the propagation challenges, mmWave systems use a large number of antenna elements both at the base station and at the user equipment, which leads to high directivity gains, fully directional communications, and possible noise-limited operations. The fundamental differences between mmWave networks and traditional ones challenge the classical design constraints, objectives, and available degrees of freedom. This paper addresses the implications that highly directional communication has on the design of an efficient medium access control (MAC) layer. The paper discusses key MAC layer issues, such as synchronization, random access, handover, channelization, interference management, scheduling, and association. This paper provides an integrated view on MAC layer issues for cellular networks, identifies new challenges and tradeoffs, and provides novel insights and solution approaches.	access control;channelization (telecommunications);frequency band;interference (communication);random access;scheduling (computing);software propagation	Hossein Shokri Ghadikolaei;Carlo Fischione;Gábor Fodor;Petar Popovski;Michele Zorzi	2015	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2456093	transmitter;electronic engineering;telecommunications;gain;microwave transmission;computer science;engineering;radio resource management;antenna;interference;radio frequency;communications system;computer network	Mobile	22.682225305255052	85.65434607606278	170881

Data gathering trees capable of performing aggregation operations are also referred to as Data Aggregation Trees (DATs). Currently, most of the existing works focus on constructing DATs according to different user requirements under the Deterministic Network Model (DNM). However, due to the existence of many probabilistic lossy links in WSNs, it is more practical to obtain a DAT under the realistic Probabilistic Network Model (PNM). Moreover, the load-balance factor is neglected when constructing DATs in current literatures. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on constructing a Load-Balanced Data Aggregation Tree (LBDAT) under the PNM. More specifically, three problems are investigated, namely, the Load-Balanced Maximal Independent Set (LBMIS) problem, the Connected Maximal Independent Set (CMIS) problem, and the LBDAT construction problem.

In addition, some of the home appliances (e.g., a microwave oven) may operate in this crowded ISM band. WiFi-based, ZigBee-based devices and home appliances operating at the same frequency and physical space can cause harmful interference to one another, particularly to ZigBee technology. Therefore, the ZigBee Frequency Agility mechanism is introduced by the ZigBee Alliance to ZigBee networks for resolving such harmful interference. In this paper, we experimentally study the performance of the ZigBee Frequency Agility mechanism using a home area network (HAN) testbed. The measurement results show that this mechanism can effectively overcome interference caused by WiFi-based devices. However, in the extreme case, when all the channels are occupied, the mechanism is not effective as expected. In addition, it is observed that the response time for the ZigBee Frequency Agility mechanism to perform channel switching is depending on packet-error-rate (PER) and send-packet-counter thresholds. Low thresholds can reduce channel-switching time but increases signaling overhead. Thus, in order to obtain optimum performance, self-adaptive PER and send-packet-counter thresholds based on interference level are desired rather than static ones.	bit error rate;experiment;interference (communication);microwave;network packet;overhead (computing);response time (technology);sfiaplus;switching time;testbed	Mohd Adib Sarijari;Mohd Sharil Abdullah;Anthony C.

The hybrid wireless network consists of n randomly distributed nodes equipped with a directional antenna, and m regularly placed base stations connected by optical links. We investigate the ad hoc mode throughput capacity when each node is equipped with a directional antenna under an L-maximum-hop resource allocation. That is, a source node transmits to its destination only with the help of normal nodes within L hops. Otherwise, the transmission will be carried out in the infrastructure mode, i.e., with the help of base stations. We find that the throughput capacity of a hybrid wireless network greatly depends on the maximum hop L, the number of base stations m, and the beamwidth of directional antenna θ. Assuming the total bandwidth W bits/sec of the network is split into three parts, i.e., W<sub>1</sub> for ad hoc mode, W<sub>2</sub> for uplink in the infrastructure mode, and W<sub>3</sub> for downlink in the infrastructure mode. We show that the throughput capacity of the hybrid directional wireless network is Θ(nW<sub>1</sub>/θ<sup>2</sup> L log n) + Θ(mW<sub>2</sub>), if L = Ω(n<sup>1/3</sup>/θ<sup>4/3</sup> log<sup>2/3</sup> n); and Θ((θ<sup>2</sup>L<sup>2</sup> log<sup>2/3</sup> n); and + Θ(mW<sub>2</sub>), if L = o(n<sup>1/3</sup>/θ<sup>4/3</sup> log<sup>2/3</sup> n), respectively. Finally, we analyze the impact of L, m and θ on the throughput capacity of the hybrid networks.	apollonian network;hoc (programming language);l (complexity);multicast;randomness;telecommunications link;throughput	Guanglin Zhang;Youyun Xu;Xinbing Wang;Mohsen Guizani	2010	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2010.07.090330	electronic engineering;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;directional antenna;base station;resource management;wireless network;computer network	Mobile	16.099437376289668	88.48293304272485	171370

The proposed strategies iteratively compute the new candidate position of each sensor based on the existing coverage holes. These holes are obtained using a Voronoi diagram for the case of sensors with the same sensing ranges, and a multiplicatively weighted Voronoi (MW-Voronoi) diagram for the case of sensors with different sensing ranges. Each sensor is driven by some virtual forces which are applied to it from the vertices and boundaries of its Voronoi cell. These forces are obtained in such a way that when the sensor is relocated, the covered area of the corresponding cell increases. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed strategies, and their superiority to existing algorithms.	algorithm;computer simulation;distributed computing;iteration;microwave;relocation (computing);sensor;simulation;software deployment;vertex (geometry);voronoi diagram	Hamid Mahboubi;Amir G.

This contribution starts with a brief section that underlines the paramount importance of the mobile radio communications channel. Then, spectrum issues are discussed to emphasize the reasons for spectrum scarcity as well as the importance of dynamic spectrum allocation. Some remarks about the development of software defined radio from digital radio lead to a discussion of the most important engineering aspects of CR, for example, location and spectrum awareness, transmission power control, and signal analysis. Because usually papers about CR are somewhat visionary, we first describe practical steps to an implementation of helpful CR properties into a mobile communication base station, as well as user terminal equipment.

In a dense WSN, a part of the region covered by a sensor may also be covered redundantly by a neighbouring sensor. In this paper, we analyse the redundancy in the coverage of a heterogeneous WSN and define the redundancy degree of a sensor. We follow a probabilistic approach to derive the expected redundancy degree of a sensor with a given number of sensors of each type in the neighbourhood. We demonstrate the accuracy of the analysis, and study the impact of the number of sensors of different types on the expected redundancy degree with numerical and simulation results. We also demonstrate an application of the redundancy analysis in the design of a heterogeneous WSN. We propose an algorithm to determine the minimum number of sensors of different types required to satisfy the desired coverage ratio and simultaneously minimise the cost of the network.	algorithm;computation;qt (software);scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;software deployment	Hari Prabhat Gupta;Seela Veerabhadreswara Rao;Venkatesh Tamarapalli	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6654800	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;numerical analysis;computer science;probability;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;statistics;computer network	Robotics	12.421245412349025	77.71257278475873	172277

Unfortunately, the difficulty of performing detailed measurements limits the consistency in parameters and methodology of current datasets. Using different datasets, multiple research studies can arrive at conflicting conclusions about the performance of wireless systems. Correcting this situation requires consistent and comparable wireless traces collected from a variety of deployment environments. In this paper, we describe AirLab, a distributed wireless data collection infrastructure that uses uniformly instrumented measurement nodes at heterogeneous locations to collect consistent traces of both standardized and user-defined experiments. We identify four challenges in the AirLab platform, consistency, fidelity, privacy, security, and describe our approaches to address them.	experiment;software deployment;tracing (software)	Vinod Kone;Mariya Zhivkova Zheleva;Mike P.

The proposed protocol allows secondary wireless sensors nodes to recognize spectrum opportunities and transmits data based on the licensed users' arrival prediction on the channel. It estimates the number of active cognitive wireless sensor nodes and it also adjusts the sleep cycle in order to conserve energy. The proposed protocol does not need a dedicated common control channel to negotiate for the data channels. We evaluate delay, energy consumption, and goodput, which are the three important qualities of service parameters through simulation. The simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves higher energy conservation with a small cost of delay and adequate aggregated goodput.

The main theme of this paper is location management. Because imprecision is an inherent property in object-tracking sensor networks, this paper focuses on the scenarios where users can tolerate a certain degree of imprecision in their query results. We intend to develop a location management scheme that can achieve two goals. First, multiple precision levels are provided. Second, the query cost is proportional to the precision level. To achieve these two goals, we propose a tree-based imprecision-tolerant location management scheme that includes three major components: (1) update and query mechanisms that can support imprecision-tolerant queries, (2) the approach to taking the statistics of imprecisiontolerant queries and (3) a tree construction algorithm that can reduce the query cost and minimize the increment of update cost. Performance evaluations are conducted through simulations to verify the proposed scheme.	algorithm;fault tolerance;location-based service;moea framework;national supercomputer centre in sweden;simulation;the computer journal	Chih-Yu Lin;Yu-Chee Tseng;Yung-Chih Liu	2010	Comput.

It is noted that within the CIoT design we observe the convergence of energy harvesting, cognitive spectrum access and mobile cloud computing technologies. We unify these distinct technologies into a CIoT architecture which provides a flexible, dynamic, scalable and robust network design road-map for large scale IoT deployment. Since the prime objective of the CIoT network is to ensure connectivity between things, we identify key metrics which characterize the network design space. We revisit the definition of cognition in the context of IoT networks and argue that both the energy efficiency and the spectrum efficiency are key design constraints. To this end, we define a new performance metric called the ‘overall link success probability’ which encapsulates these constraints. The overall link success probability is characterized by both the self-sustainablitiy of the link through energy harvesting and the availability of spectrum for transmissions.

To improve localization, a Voronoi region based approach is utilized to form a HMM for detection and tracking of mobile target. The observations used for the HMM localization are obtained from the power delay profile of the received signals. In UWB systems the use of entire power delay profiles instead of the total power only, allows to reach higher localization accuracy. This is due to the power delay profile being a measure of the power as well as the time of arrival. Simulation results suggest a performance gain of 7dB over the maximum likelihood estimation for localization in presence of path loss at intermediate values of signal to noise ratio (SNR).	algorithm;centralized computing;hidden markov model;markov chain;rss;radar;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;systems design;time of arrival;ultra-wideband;voronoi diagram	Yogesh Nijsure;Yifan Chen;Charan Litchfield;Predrag B.

Therefore, the scheduling problem is converted into edge coverage problem, which is substantially different from the previous point coverage problems. We formulate aforementioned problem into CARP (Capacitated Arc Routing Problem), which has been proved to be NP-hard. Then we use the genetic algorithm cooperated with a decoding scheme to solve it.

Sensor nodes have access to conditionally independent observations, given the state of nature, and they transmit their data over separate wireless channels. The communication link between each node and the fusion center is subject to fading, with certain nodes possibly having much better connections than others. Upon reception of the information, the fusion center attempts to accurately reconstruct the state of nature. Large deviation theory is employed to obtain design guidelines for wireless sensor networks with a large number of nodes. The normalized Chernoff information is shown to be an appropriate performance metric to compare prospective sensor nodes. For the specific example of binary sensor nodes sending data over Rayleigh fading channels, the performance loss due to fading is found to be small.	chernoff bound;prospective search;rayleigh fading;sensor	Jean-François Chamberland;Venugopal V.

Some of the techniques commonly used for localization are time of arrival (ToA), time difference of arrival (TDoA), angle of arrival (AoA), and time of flight (ToF). In the wireless domain, measurements are susceptible to errors resulting from the nature of the medium, the relatively low precision, and the presence of obstacles, which produce non-line of sight (NLOS) errors. The NLOS errors are a major concern as they could result in significant degradation in accuracy. In this paper, we propose an efficient technique that uses the distance estimates of the device from a group of anchors to localize the device with better accuracy in the presence of NLOS errors. Our technique is based on the notion that in general, for any estimate, the proportion of the NLOS error can be upper bounded. Using this upper bound information our technique reduces the uncertainty in the position of the wireless device that is being localized. The technique is distributed and is simple. In comparison to the standard localization procedure, where localization is done independent of the presence of NLOS errors, our technique uses the information about the NLOS error bounds to improve the accuracy of estimation. Simulation results show that our technique reduces the position error of the wireless device by 40% on an average and by at least 80% in the best case. The uncertainty in localization is also reduced significantly.	algorithm;angle of arrival;best, worst and average case;elegant degradation;internationalization and localization;multilateration;simulation;time of arrival;wordnet	Satyajayant Misra;Weiyi Zhang;Guoliang Xue	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.206	time of flight;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;angle of arrival;non-line-of-sight propagation;wireless network;time of arrival;upper and lower bounds	Visualization	18.946926629919957	75.21435972358988	173556

Since the wireless communication range of each sensornode is limited, data is propagated in a multi-hop manner untilit reaches one or more speciﬁc sink nodes. However, sensornodes usually employ a sleep scheduling mechanism for powersaving to prolong the operational lifetime of the network and aretherefore not always available for forwarding messages receivedfrom neighboring nodes. In this paper, we analytically investigatethe diffusion behavior of information in a WSN modeled as atwo-dimensional spatial branching process. Our analysis permitsthe derivation of the extinction probability of information beingdiffused from a source node. Our model permits observing howthe activity pattern of each node inﬂuences the probability ofmaintaining time-dependent information in the network. I.

A high percentage of accidents occur at these locations. The introduction of wireless communications technologies onboard passenger vehicles is enabling the sharing of information and through it enhancing the situational awareness of vehicle drivers. In this paper the implementation of safety applications for cooperative vehicle systems is presented applied to road intersection safety. The system relies on three fundamental technologies: communications, localization and the modelling of the environment surrounding the subject vehicle. The paper centres in a case study, the priority crossing of an Emergency Service Vehicle at an intersection. An analysis of the issues identified during the implementation and testing is included. The implementation represents an instance of the architecture developed for cooperative vehicles applications as part of the European project, SAFESPOT.	internationalization and localization	Javier Ibanez Guzman;Stéphanie Lefevre;Abdelkader Mokkadem;Sylvain Rodhaim	2010	13th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625246	vehicle information and communication system;engineering;automotive engineering;transport engineering;computer security	Robotics	23.476045737370033	78.40925792791894	174016

Although solutions based on inertial sensing systems are promising, they are subject to drift. We address the problem of positional drift by having the responders themselves deploy beacons, specifically ultrasound beacons, as they progress into an unknown environment. Our research focuses on a sensor network approach that does not require any pre-deployment of infrastructure. This paper targets two important aspects within the context of providing positioning service for emergency responders namely on how to locate the deployed static beacons, and on how to track the responders by using a combination of ultrasound and inertial measurements. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) characterisation of the errors encountered in an inertial-based pedestrian dead reckoning solution and ultrasound range measurements in a mobile setting, (ii) an algorithm for ultrasound beacon localisation (using multidimensional scaling), (iii) formulation of a Kalman filtering based algorithm for tracking the responder using a combination of ultrasound range and inertial measurements, and (iv) the presented algorithms are evaluated using data collected from real deployments and are compared against an ultra-wideband (UWB) precision location system. Our approach of preventing the drift in inertial estimates by combining with ultrasound measurements are promising and offers a viable solution to providing positioning and tracking support to emergency responders.	dead reckoning;design review (u.s. government);extended kalman filter;hoc (programming language);image scaling;inertial navigation system;mobile device;multidimensional scaling;particle filter;positioning system;randomized algorithm;sensor;shortest path problem;software deployment;ultra-wideband	Kavitha Muthukrishnan;Stefan Dulman;Koen Langendoen	2010	2010 Ubiquitous Positioning Indoor Navigation and Location Based Service	10.1109/UPINLBS.2010.5654049	electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	18.55424833056158	74.91401725357036	174106

For this purpose, we propose a transceiver with a minimized power consumption obtained by advanced power amplification units, since they are a major cause of power dissipation in mobile systems. Appropriate semiconductor technologies, amplifier concepts, and suitable signal conditioning techniques assure the energy savings. Measures to adapt the power dissipation to the signal power level lead to significant efficiency improvement in low traffic situations. Solutions driven by the transceiver architecture will allow the implementation of features requested by energy-efficient systems and ensure access to higher layer control mechanisms, enabling power management at the system level. The individual power saving contributions of solutions acting at the transceiver level are indicated, but the benefit expected from co-acting solutions in a holistically optimized energy-efficient system can only be analyzed at the mobile radio system level by considering additional measures taken in the radio infrastructure network.	amplifier;cpu power dissipation;control system;electrical engineering;enhanced entity–relationship model;holism;kasparov's gambit;power management;radio frequency;semiconductor;transceiver	Dieter Ferling;Thomas Bitzer;Thomas Bohn;Dirk Wiegner;Andreas Pascht	2010	Bell Labs Technical Journal	10.1002/bltj.20441	electronic engineering;real-time computing;electrical efficiency;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;efficient energy use;computer network	EDA	18.9065055124394	83.33405356552821	174206

It is intended to be used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications involving battery-powered devices with low throughput requirements. A LoRaWAN network consists of multiple end nodes that communicate with one or more gateways. These gateways act like a transparent bridge towards a common network server. The amount of end devices and their throughput requirements will have an impact on the performance of the LoRaWAN network. This study investigates the scalability in terms of the number of end devices per gateway of single-gateway LoRaWAN deployments. First, we determine the intra-technology interference behavior with two physical end nodes, by checking the impact of an interfering node on a transmitting node. Measurements show that even under concurrent transmission, one of the packets can be received under certain conditions. Based on these measurements, we create a simulation model for assessing the scalability of a single gateway LoRaWAN network. We show that when the number of nodes increases up to 1000 per gateway, the losses will be up to 32%. In such a case, pure Aloha will have around 90% losses. However, when the duty cycle of the application layer becomes lower than the allowed radio duty cycle of 1%, losses will be even lower. We also show network scalability simulation results for some IoT use cases based on real data.	anatomic node;bridging (networking);checking (action);chlorhexadol;duty cycle;gateway (telecommunications);header of a document;interference (communication);internet of things;kilohertz;light;network packet;node - plant part;one thousand;power (psychology);preparation;radio frequency;requirement;scalability;server (computing);significant figures;simulation;throughput;transmitter;collision	Jetmir Haxhibeqiri;Floris Van Den Abeele;Ingrid Moerman;Jeroen Hoebeke	2017		10.3390/s17061193	embedded system;real-time computing;scalability;telecommunications;computer science;internet of things;computer network	Networks	10.351579446283539	87.77032595811751	174255

Sensed data may become meaningless, if the locations of sensors are not known. Traditional localization techniques do not meet the requirements of low-cost and energy-conservation while performing localization tasks. Recently, the received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based range measurement technology is widely used in sensor networks due to its easy implementation. In typical indoor environments, RSSI is affected by dense multipath fading effects because people are moving around, or because furniture and equipment block transmission signals. Therefore, the overall accuracy of RSSI-based localization schemes remains low. In this paper, a new localization scheme which is based on a transmission power adjustment strategy is proposed. Firstly, power decay curves are created in a real indoor environment to accurately estimate the distances between an unknown node and anchor nodes. Secondly, the unknown node selects three nearest anchor nodes by using the minimum transmission power to limit the estimated location to a triangle area. And then, the centroid of the triangle is calculated and serves as the initial estimated point. Finally, based on the estimated distances of corresponding power curves determined by RSSI scores using different transmission power levels, the final estimated location falls in one of the three equally divided areas of the triangle. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide a low-cost solution for indoor localization with high precision.	internationalization and localization;multipath propagation;requirement;sensor	Jiing-Yi Wang;Chia-Pang Chen;Tzu-Shiang Lin;Cheng-Long Chuang;Tzu-Yun Lai;Joe-Air Jiang	2012	2012 IEEE 14th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communication & 2012 IEEE 9th International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems	10.1109/HPCC.2012.239	wireless ad hoc network;embedded system;estimation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;accuracy and precision;fading;statistics	Robotics	18.18833860770675	75.44898804320074	174336

In our settings, n nodes are deployed as a Poisson point process with density lambda in a region of size S and each sensor node can cover a unit-area disk. For any k and lambda, let V(k, lambda) be the random variable (r.v.) of the size of the region that is covered by at most k - 1 nodes. Under these assumptions, we first show that for any function omega satisfying 1 Gtomega (k) Lt k1/2 the r.v. V(k, k- omega(k)k1/2) converges almost surely to S. In contrast, if the intensity is set to lambda = k + omega(k)k1/2 we obtain that V(k, k +omega(k)k 1/2) converges almost surely to 0. These limit theorems extend the results of Zhang and Hou in [21], [22] where the authors worked with fixed degree of coverage (k = O(1)) and lambda = log S+O(k) log log S. Assume that each sensor has the same lifetime T. As consequences of our analytical results, we derive randomized algorithms (working with high probability) that can maintain constantly high degrees of coverage while prolonging the lifetime of the network.	chaitin's constant;point process;randomized algorithm;sensor node;with high probability	Gabriel Antoine Louis Paillard;Vlady Ravelomanana	2008	IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.266	random variable;stochastic process;combinatorics;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;randomized algorithm;statistics;computer network	Theory	13.965715222634282	78.88509447724665	174384

Due to the limited computation and bandwidth resources, only a small part of nodes are selected to track the target at each interval. How to improve tracking accuracy with a small number of nodes is a key problem. In recent years, a node depth adjustment system has been developed and applied to issues of network deployment and routing protocol. As far as we know, all existing tracking schemes keep underwater nodes static or moving with water flow, and node depth adjustment has not been utilized for underwater target tracking yet. This paper studies node depth adjustment method for target tracking in UWSNs. Firstly, since a Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) can quantify the estimation accuracy, its relation to node depth is derived as a metric. Secondly, we formulate the node depth adjustment as an optimization problem to determine moving depth of activated node, under the constraint of moving range, the value of FIM is used as objective function, which is aimed to be minimized over moving distance of nodes. Thirdly, to efficiently solve the optimization problem, an improved Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is proposed, in which the generating probability is modified to improve searching speed and accuracy. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify performance of our scheme.	anatomic node;computation;deploy;fisher information;formation matrix;hs algorithm;harmony search;mathematical optimization;neuronal calcium-sensor proteins;node - plant part;optimization problem;routing;search algorithm;simulation;water flow	Meiqin Liu;Duo Zhang;Senlin Zhang;Qunfei Zhang	2017		10.3390/s17122807	harmony search;electronic engineering;fisher information;wireless sensor network;engineering;real-time computing;small number;routing protocol;optimization problem;bandwidth (signal processing)	Robotics	11.55817343386474	78.12479631068922	174738
0e1ccde94d114fa56bb472e10b1ef54f080f23e3	accurate location tracking from csi-based passive device-free probabilistic fingerprinting		The research on indoor localization has received great interest in recent years. This has been fueled by the ubiquitous distribution of electronic devices equipped with a radio frequency (RF) interface. Analyzing the signal fluctuation on the RF-interface can, for instance, solve the still open issue of ubiquitous reliable indoor localization and tracking. Device bound and device free approaches with remarkable accuracy have been reported recently. In this paper, we present an accurate device-free passive (DfP) indoor location tracking system that adopts channel state information (CSI) readings from off-the-shelf WiFi 802.11n wireless cards. The fine-grained subchannel measurements for multiple input multiple output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing PHY layer parameters are exploited to improve localization and tracking accuracy. To enable precise positioning in the presence of heavy multipath effects in cluttered indoor scenarios, we experimentally validate the unpredictability of CSI measurements and suggest a probabilistic fingerprint-based technique as an accurate solution. Our scheme further boosts the localization efficiency by using principal component analysis to filter the most relevant feature vectors. Furthermore, with Bayesian filtering, we continuously track the trajectory of a moving subject. We have evaluated the performance of our system in four indoor environments and compared it with state-of-the-art indoor localization schemes. Our experimental results demonstrate that this complex channel information enables more accurate localization of nonequipped individuals.	channel state information;digital subchannel;experiment;feature vector;fingerprint;multipath propagation;multiplexing;naive bayes spam filtering;phy (chip);precise point positioning;principal component analysis;quantum fluctuation;radio frequency;tracking system	Shuyu Shi;Stephan Sigg;Lin Chen;Yusheng Ji	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2810307	multipath propagation;channel state information;feature vector;electronic engineering;filter (signal processing);physical layer;tracking system;computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;communication channel;multiplexing	Mobile	20.92093950424652	75.59567314462686	174751

The massive bandwidth, highly directional antennas, high penetration loss and susceptibility to shadowing in these bands suggest certain advantages to spectrum and infrastructure sharing. In particular, resources that are """"open"""", such as unlicensed spectrum or a deployment of base stations open to all service providers, may offer greater gains in mmWave bands than at conventional cellular frequencies. However, even when sharing is technically beneficial (as recent research in this area suggests that it is), it may not be profitable. In this paper, both the technical and economic implications of resource sharing in millimeter wave networks are studied. Millimeter wave service is considered in the economic framework of a network good, where consumers' utility depends on the network size. Detailed network simulations are used to understand data rates, profit, and demand for millimeter wave service, with and without open resources. The results suggest that """"open"""" deployments of neutral small cells that serve subscribers of any service provider encourage market entry by making it easier for networks to reach critical mass, more than """"open"""" (unlicensed) spectrum would."""	simulation;software deployment	Fraida Fund;Shahram Shahsavari;Shivendra S.

Instead of sending pairwise messages between neighbors on a fixed network topology, we construct gossip algorithms in which nodes can simultaneously recover multiple neighbors' messages and in which nodes can adjust the set of their neighbors by adjusting transmit power. We present two averaging algorithms, each based on a hierarchical clustering of the network. In the first algorithm, clusters of nodes transmit their estimates locally and randomly select a representative node for communications at the next level. In the second, each cluster mutually averages and then cooperatively transmits at the next level. For path-loss environments, these schemes achieve order-optimal or near order-optimal performance.	algorithm;cluster analysis;computer cluster;hierarchical clustering;network topology;randomness	Matthew S.

In more tactical scenarios, where capacity and reach requirements are less demanding, the ability to deploy low transmission delay wireless links is a critical capability to support secondary deployed locations. In this paper, the authors analyze the performance and military potential of short-range tactical transit case based troposcatter terminals in tactical scenarios typical of smaller deployed locations. The analysis is performed with a commercial implementation of a troposcatter system deployed to a realistic tactical scenario subject to challenging propagation conditions.	köppen climate classification;line-of-sight (missile);requirement;software propagation	Luis Bastos;Hermann Wietgrefe	2012	MILCOM 2012 - 2012 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415601	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;remote sensing	Embedded	22.968085558733097	81.24275520436882	175280

A sensor failure can affect sensors in its neighborhood and compromise the network data communication. Weather conditions may cause the power consumption of data communication to vary with uncertainty. This work introduces a compact probabilistic optimization approach to handle this problem while considering jointly or separately dependence among power consumption of the links of the network in a unified framework. We explore the concept of copulas in a dominating arborescence (DA) model for directed graphs, extended accordingly to handle the uncertain parameters. We give a proof of the DA model correctness and show that it can solve to optimality some benchmark instances of the deterministic dominating tree problem. Numerical results for the probabilistic approach show that our model tackles randomly generated instances with up to 120 nodes.	benchmark (computing);correctness (computer science);directed graph;edge dominating set;graph (discrete mathematics);mathematical optimization;numerical method;overhead (computing);polynomial;procedural generation;randomness;sensor;unified framework	Pablo Adasme;Rafael Andrade;Abdel Lisser	2017	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2016.11.011	mathematical optimization;machine learning;data mining	Embedded	12.970956020127009	78.80865833527373	175352

These versatile antennas are capable of very rapidly altering their gain pattern to form complex patterns. However, it is not immediately obvious how to best exploit their capabilities. Previous research has shown that problems arise when using the stock 802.11 MAC protocol with directional antennas, and new MAC protocols have been designed to address these issues as well as exploit some of their new capabilities. Unfortunately moving to a new MAC layer means abandoning a wealth of inexpensive 802.11 wireless equipment since these cards are not very amenable to such extensive modification. In this work, we propose, implement, and evaluate a scheme which uses the flexible gain pattern formation ability of a phase array antenna to exploit the enhanced spatial diversity potential of directional transmission in a community networking environment while still functioning with the existing 802.11 MAC.	community informatics;pattern formation;the verge	Michael Neufeld;Dirk Grunwald	2004	First International Conference on Broadband Networks	10.1109/BROADNETS.2004.88	phased array;antenna diversity;telecommunications;computer science;directional antenna;pattern formation;computer network	Mobile	22.408750685411825	83.02480213230392	175376

In free diffusion-based molecular communication, “path loss” has a different functional form compared with wireless propagation and the scenarios under consideration are not generally limited to 2-D environments as in the case of wireless networks. Hence, the constructed model takes into account the peculiarities of diffusion-based communication in 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D scenarios. The model incorporates particle-counting noise and is independent of the signaling mechanism employed. Analytical formulas are derived for the critical values of the signal strength-to-detection threshold ratio and the number of nodes that are required to achieve a connected or an almost-connected network. Monte Carlo simulations are used to validate model predictions and to suggest design guidelines for deploying nanonetworks. An empirical study is also conducted to evaluate the time required to broadcast an alarm in a connected nanonetwork of various sizes. The time to broadcast as a function of the number of nodes in a fixed region is observed to follow a power law, where the exponent depends on the dimensionality of the medium.	broadcasting (networking);gilbert cell;higher-order function;interference (communication);monte carlo method;nanonetwork;simulation;software deployment;software propagation;wireless router	Dogu Arifler	2017	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2664814	wireless ad hoc network;stochastic geometry models of wireless networks;transmitter;electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;time division multiple access;wireless;computer network	Mobile	14.16461471930246	87.23732127494416	175484

The parking lot is represented as a wireless sensor network cluster modeled as an m n grid in a rectangle of size l x h. A wireless sensor node is deployed in each grid and one gateway is set for the cluster. The status of each parking space is detected by a sensor node and the result is reported to the gateway. To reduce the false positive rate caused by various sources of interference, we developed a high-performance vehicle detection algorithm to filter out the noises from the passing-by cars and the environment. The performance of the algorithm is verified through extensive simulation. The three scenarios of low, medium and high interference levels are simulated. Results suggest that our proposed vehicle detection algorithm can effectively detect the status of parking lot with zero false positive rate at the low and medium interference levels, and 3.3% at high interference level.	algorithm;computer cluster;interference (communication);left 4 dead 2;matlab;mathematical optimization;report;sensor node;simulation	Hong-Zhong Hui;Jonathan D.

To meet this rapidly growing demand, there is an urgent need for revolutionary approaches involving new wireless network architectures as well as advanced networking technologies. Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) have attracted significant interest from both academia and industry as a means to potentially improve spatial reuse and coverage, thus allowing cellular systems to achieve higher data rates, while retaining the seamless connectivity and mobility of cellular networks. However, considering the severe inter-tier interference and limited cooperative gains, new techniques for improving both the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency through suppressing inter-tier interference and enhancing cooperative processing capabilities are needed. On the other hand, cloud computing technologies have emerged as a promising solution for providing high energy efficiency together with flexibility through software defined virtualization of communication networks and protocols. Consequently, heterogeneous cloud radio access networks (H-CRANs) that combine HetNets with cloud computing have been recognized as a potential cost-effective solution for alleviating inter-tier interference and improving cooperative processing gains in HetNets.	access network	Mugen Peng;Zhiguo Ding;Vincent K.

Inspired from Riemannian geometry of manifolds, it is claimed that extreme load at specific parts of a large power grid can occur as a consequence of the local negative curvature in its hidden metric space. This paper contributes to four areas: (1) It draws a new course in the topological study of a power grid, which is, unlike most previous studies, in accordance with the electrical characteristic, not the topographical structure, of the power grid. (2) It extends the Riemannian geometry metaphor developed for data communication networks to the power grid, an area it has never pervaded. (3) It develops a unifying approach to deal with power and data networks, precisely at a juncture where the smart grid is bringing the two networks together. (4) It provides an analytical measure for the criticality of lines and stations in a bulk transmission system, which can find a place in reliability assessment and centralized flow control in the future smart grid.	centralized computing;network congestion;network topology;self-organized criticality;telecommunications network;topography	Reza Banirazi;Edmond A.

3b212f5f2485bbbb100972c453677a77b9844f88	a novel centroid localization for wireless sensor networks		Self-localization of sensor nodes is one of the key issues in wireless sensor networks. Based on the analysis of traditional range-free algorithms such as centroid and APIT (approximate perfect point in triangulation test) schemes, the effect of random deployment of all nodes on node localization is researched. And then, an improved centroid localization algorithm (ICLA) based on APIT and the quality of perpendicular bisector is proposed. In ICLA, nodes are categorized into several kinds and localized, respectively. Extensive simulation results indicate that ICLA obtains a better localization result in random topology networks without any additional hardware. Therefore, ICLA can be an alternate solution for the node self-localization problem in large-scale wireless sensor networks.	approximation algorithm;categorization;genetic algorithm;internationalization and localization;microsoft outlook for mac;network topology;rss;randomness;sensor;simulation;software deployment	Yu Liu;Xiao Yi;You He	2012	IJDSN	10.1155/2012/829253	mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Mobile	16.07279114705767	75.49393671652497	176834
5e61caf5f21c256f43937576b457b3880e7db9b0	a practical perspective on 5g-ready highly dynamic spectrum management with lsa		A diversity of wireless technologies will collaborate to support the fifth-generation (5G) communication networks with their demanding applications and services. Despite decisive progress in many enabling solutions, next-generation cellular deployments may still suffer from a glaring lack of bandwidth due to inefficient utilization of radio spectrum, which calls for immediate action. To this end, several capable frameworks have recently emerged to all help the mobile network operators (MNOs) leverage the abundant frequency bands that are utilized lightly by other incumbents. Along these lines, the recent Licensed Shared Access (LSA) regulatory framework allows for controlled sharing of spectrum between an incumbent and a licensee, such as the MNO, which coexist geographically. This powerful concept has been subject to several early technology demonstrations that confirm its implementation feasibility. However, the full potential of LSA-based spectrum management can only become available if it is empowered to operate dynamically and at high space-time-frequency granularity. Complementing the prior efforts, we in this work outline the functionality that is required by the LSA system to achieve the much needed flexible operation as well as report on the results of our respective live trial that employs a full-fledged commercial-grade cellular network deployment. Our practical results become instrumental to facilitatemore dynamic bandwidth sharing and thus promise to advance on the degrees of spectrum utilization in future 5G systems without compromising the service quality of their users.

Coverage reflects how well an area is monitored by sensor nodes and in energy efficient networks less energy is consumed to provide the same level of services. These twin specifics are presented to evaluate the performance of a wireless sensor network. On the other hand, connectivity and k-coverage are prerequisites for a k-covered Wireless Sensor Network. Connectivity shows how nodes in a sensor network can effectively communicate and kcoverage means hotspot regions are covered by at least k sensors. In this article, we propose an Improved Harmony Search algorithm in a k-covered and connected wireless sensor network to achieve a sensor node deployment such that the covered area is optimal and data transfer has low energy consumption. Through computer simulations, experimental results verified that the proposed method improved the coverage of area in compare to some related methods.	computer simulation;hs algorithm;harmony search;java hotspot virtual machine;routing;search algorithm;sensor node;sensor web;software deployment;software release life cycle	Shohreh Ebrahim Nezhad;Hoda Jalal Kamali;Mohsen Ebrahimi Moghaddam	2010	2010 International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications	10.1109/BWCCA.2010.47	computer simulation;embedded system;mathematical optimization;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;brooks–iyengar algorithm;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;ant;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	10.489037122345955	78.505510342094	177071

In these networks, dedicated mobile chargers (MCs) move throughout the network and supply energy for power-limited sensors. The MCs not only charge the sensors but also charge each other. We develop a hop-based mobile charging policy (HMCP) minimizing the number of required MCs. The HMCP considers both the sensors’ unbalanced energy consumption rate and the MCs’ limited energy capacity. The minimum number of MCs is is formulated as an integer programming problem. We first verify the existence of an optimal solution, and later design an algorithm to obtain the optimal solution. Based on HMCP, we propose HMCP+ for the case that only one MC can recharge sensors in each region. HMCP+ plans MCs’ paths to decrease mobile energy consumption by MCs. Finally, performance of the proposed polices is validated through the simulation results.	algorithm;integer programming;mobile phone;randomness;rechargeable battery;sensor;simulation;unbalanced circuit	Zhigang Chen;Xuehan Chen;Deyu Zhang;Feng Zeng	2017	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2017.02.094	artificial intelligence;machine learning;wireless;wireless sensor network;simulation;computer network;energy consumption;mathematics;is-is;integer programming;supply energy	Mobile	11.51016375052037	79.91391017035697	177196

The wireless fingerprinting method implemented on the USRP1 device exploits differences in the phase attributes of demodulated data samples. The method does not require the use of expensive spectrum analyzer equipment and the associated high sampling and processing rates with such equipment. Instead, data sample inputs are used, sampled at a rate of 4MHz. This makes implementation using real Wireless Sensor Network nodes feasible and allows wireless fingerprints to be gathered inside each node in a network. This is important since wireless fingerprints degrade over distance, making distributed implementations more attractive. With our method, the USRP1 classifies accurately over a wide range of network conditions, including time and transmission distance. Performance is also stable for different receiving devices. We achieve average classification accuracies of 99.6% at short range, 95.3% at medium range, and 81.9% at long range when classifying a limited sample of five devices from the same manufacturer.	fingerprint (computing);radio frequency;sampling (signal processing);spectrum analyzer	David A.

This problem presents very different algorithmic challenges from aggregate and selection queries, in the sense that an individual node cannot by itself determine its inclusion in the query result. We present novel query processing algorithms for this problem, with the goal of minimizing message traffic in the network. These algorithms employ a hierarchy of local constraints, or thresholds, to leverage network topology such that message-passing is localized.

At each hop, we choose the nearest node to the transmitter within the selection region as the next hop relay. By maximizing the expected density of progress, we present an upper bound for the optimum reference distance and derive the relationship between the optimum reference distance and the optimum transmission probability. Compared with the results with routing strategy using omnidirectional antennas in [1], we find interestingly that the optimum transmission probability is a constant independent of the beamwidth, the expected density of progress with the new routing strategy is increased significantly, and the computational complexity involved in the relay selection is also greatly reduced.	computational complexity theory;fractal antenna;hoc (programming language);reference distance;relay;routing;transmitter	Di Li;Changchuan Yin;Changhai Chen;Shuguang Cui	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683598	optimized link state routing protocol;routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;dynamic source routing;directional antenna;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	16.191917297484505	86.82310667795934	177677

We assume the sensor network model in which sensors can interchange idle and active modes. Given monitoring regions, battery life and energy consumption rate for each sensor, we formulate the problem of maximizing sensor network lifetime, i.e., time during which the monitored area is (partially or fully) covered. Our contributions include (1) an efficient data structure to represent the monitored area with at most n/sup 2/ points guaranteeing the full coverage which is superior to the previously used approach based on grid points, (2) efficient provably good centralized algorithms for sensor monitoring schedule maximizing the total lifetime including (1+ln(1-q)/sup -1/)-approximation algorithm for the case when a q-portion of the monitored area is required to cover, e.g., for the 90% area coverage our schedule guarantees to be at most 3.3 times shorter than the optimum, (4) a family of efficient distributed protocols with trade-off between communication and monitoring power consumption, (5) extensive experimental study of the proposed algorithms showing significant advantage in quality, scalability and flexibility.	algorithm;centralized computing;data structure;experiment;network model;optimizing compiler;scalability;sensor	Piotr Berman;Gruia Calinescu;C.

a20d7bc004b2dcbb2720ddaaae15cdfa98e71db9	a message-passing approach to self-organizing internet-of-things based public safety networks		This paper develops a distributed self-organizing strategy for an Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based public safety network (IPSN). Recent advances in wireless broadband and multimedia services have evolved PSNs extensively. Third generation partnership project long term evolution (3GPP-LTE) becomes a basic platform for deploying public safety networks around the world. There have been extensive studies on LTE-based PSNs satisfying mission-critical requirements. However, most studies focus on investigating PSNs with network infrastructure, and there is little progress on infrastructure-less PSNs, where base stations and network coordinators become destroyed or impaired. This paper focuses on infrastructure-less PSNs, where battery-powered individual IoT devices cooperate to construct the network without any central coordination. It is aimed at maximizing the network survival time of the IPSN while satisfying mission-critical requirements. A highly nonlinear nature of the network construction problem with several constraints renders the optimization task very challenging. In addition, no coordinator exists in IPSNs and all nodes are subject to the identification of distributed strategy to achieve the goal. To this end, a state-of-the-art message-passing framework is introduced to develop a novel distributed algorithm. The major benefit originates from the controllability of the limit on wireless link hops to meet the data reliability and transmission latency required for mission-critical IPSNs. We also establish the proof on the optimality. The proposed technique converges rapidly and keeps the computation load per IoT device low, which makes it attractive for practical implementation. Simulation results verify that the proposed approach outperforms various existing approaches considerably and consistently.

It must be possible before network deployment to determine how long a network maintains operational before maintenance is required and batteries have to be replaced. Unfortunately, node lifetime is very dependent on the radio environment in which the node is operated. As we will demonstrate in this paper the node lifetime in a very busy radio environment can be up to 11 times shorter than in a quiet environment. WSNs employ duty-cycled communication protocols where receivers periodically sample the channel to determine if it has to remain active to receive a message. Radio interference triggers the receive mechanism causing an unnecessary wake-up which leads to an increase in a node's energy consumption. In this paper we present a method for estimating node energy consumption in a target radio environment. We describe how to capture the essential characteristics of the radio environment and how to use this information to predict node lifetime. We demonstrate the usability of the proposed method using the well known WSN communication protocol ContikiMAC. Our evaluation comprising real-world scenarios shows that the proposed method is able to accurately predict node lifetime.	catastrophic interference;communications protocol;contiki;duty cycle;interference (communication);software deployment;tinyos;transceiver;usability;whole earth 'lectronic link	Alex King;James Brown;John Vidler;Utz Roedig	2015	2015 IEEE 40th Local Computer Networks Conference Workshops (LCN Workshops)	10.1109/LCNW.2015.7365930	exposed node problem;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;interference;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;node;computer security;computer network	Mobile	12.600852659159536	83.76565672285103	178071

Thanks to the Vehicular Adhoc Network (VANET), in which vehicles and access points can communicate, we can collect trajectory data from vehicles in an area through wireless communication. In this paper, we select intersections to disseminate requests for collecting moving trajectories of all the vehicles in the area, while at the same time minimizing the number of selected intersections. We prove the underlying intersection selection problem is NP-Complete and propose a greedy heuristic to address it approximately. The performance, efficiency and practical issues such as broadcast intervals of the scheme are analyzed in this paper. To deal with the situation that access points are unavailable, we propose a distributed protocol to make vehicles conduct message broadcasting at the selected intersections. The simulation shows our distributed protocol is both efficient and effective.	greedy algorithm;heuristic;np-completeness;selection algorithm;simulation;wireless access point	Tan Yan;Guiling Wang	2015	Ad Hoc & Sensor Wireless Networks		computer security;computer network	Mobile	15.348879431899446	83.51803780291188	178122

The novel algorithm, DACA, features the integration of dynamic heuristic factor, expectations heuristic factor, dynamic evaporation factor, the optimal pheromone global updating strategy and the worst pheromone global updating strategy to improve ant colony algorithm. Then greedy strategy is introduced according to distribution of monitored nodes to make the algorithm more robust to environment changes. A large number of simulation results have proved the effectiveness of this algorithm and showed that the novel algorithm reduces the number of deployed nodes in the network for guaranteed connectivity and coverage.	ant colony optimization algorithms;crossover (genetic algorithm);evaporation;experiment;genetic algorithm;greedy algorithm;heuristic;hotspot (wi-fi);mutation (genetic algorithm);routing;simulation;software deployment	Hua Su;Gaoyong Wang;Xuemei Sun;Dong Yu	2016	IJES	10.1504/IJES.2016.076119	embedded system;mathematical optimization;greedy algorithm;simulation;wireless sensor network;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	11.154523184706447	78.4717542358685	178243

In practical wireless networks, it is often the case that the failure probability of a node depends on its degree (number of neighbors). We model this phenomenon as a degree-dependent site percolation process on random geometric graphs. In particular, we obtain analytical conditions for the existence of phase transitions within this model. Furthermore, in networks carrying traffic load, the failure of one node can result in redistribution of the load onto other nearby nodes. If these nodes fail due to excessive load, then this process can result in a cascading failure. Using a simple but descriptive model, we show that the cascading failure problem for large-scale wireless networks is equivalent to a degree-dependent site percolation on random geometric graphs. We obtain analytical conditions for cascades in this model. This work represents the first investigation of cascading phenomena in networks with geometric constraints.	cascading failure;percolation theory;random geometric graph	Zhenning Kong;Edmund M.

Thus, estimating the PUs position, rather than just knowing its presence through traditional spectrum sensing, becomes a key challenge. In this paper a novel cooperative localization algorithm (CLA) that uses few CRs is proposed to estimate PU position in harsh channel condition. CLA algorithm exploits a mobile CR (MCR) with unknown positions that collaborates with other fixed CRs to estimate PU position. To this purpose, the MCR exploits the signal strength measurements obtained from PUs through an energy-detection based spectrum sensing. Since channel parameters are not available in CRNs, a channel estimation technique is also applied. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the CLA in comparison to existing cooperative and non-cooperative localization algorithms. The MCR path is generated by the random waypoint model (RWP) and a multichannel scenario with shadow fading is implemented. Results show that the CLA outperforms the existing algorithms, due to its moving path independency and its higher localization accuracy. Moreover, simulation results confirm that CLA is robust to noisy channel conditions.	algorithm;channel state information;cognitive radio;computer simulation;cooperative mimo;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);internationalization and localization;memory card reader;mobile device;noisy-channel coding theorem;one-class classification;software propagation;waypoint	Sanaz Kianoush;Anna Vizziello;Paolo Gamba	2014	2014 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)	10.1109/EuCNC.2014.6882620	cognitive radio;electronic engineering;geography;telecommunications;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	20.67012440440381	75.20315054481135	178647
ced374817a639fccb01c1168f9a7a2f4c165ab68	optimization algorithms for transmission range and actor movement in wireless sensor and actor networks	actor movement;coverage;wireless sensor and actor networks;transmission radius	Wireless sensor and actor networks are composed of static sensors and mobile actors. We assume actors have a random initial location in the two-dimensional sensing area. The objective is to move each actor to a location such that every sensor node is within a bounded number of hops from some actor. Because sensors have limited energy, the new actor locations are chosen to minimize the transmission range of the sensors. However, actors also have a limited (although larger) power supply, and their movement depletes their resources. It follows that by carefully choosing the new actor locations, the total actor movement can be minimized. In this paper, we introduce the problem of simultaneously minimizing the required transmission range and amount of actor movement. To find a solution, we formulate the problem using an ILP framework. For the ILP solution to be feasible, we introduce a finite set of possible actor locations such that an optimal solution is guaranteed to be found within this set. We also present a heuristic for this problem. As a preliminary step, we study minimizing the transmission range necessary for multi-hop communication. Various heuristics for this smaller problem are proposed and their results are compared by simulation. The best of these heuristics is then enhanced to incorporate minimizing the movement of actors, and its performance is compared to the optimal ILP solution. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Many particular applications, such as battlefield intrusion detection and object tracking, require a full-coverage at any time, which is typically resolved by adding redundant sensor nodes. With abundant energy, previous studies suggested that the network lifetime can be maximized while maintaining full coverage through organizing sensor nodes into a maximum number of disjoint sets and alternately turning them on. Since the power of sensor nodes is unevenly consumed over time, and early failure of sensor nodes leads to coverage loss, WSNs require dynamic coverage maintenance. Thus, the task of permanently sustaining full coverage is particularly formulated as a hybrid of disjoint set covers and dynamic-coverage-maintenance problems, and both have been proven to be nondeterministic polynomial-complete. In this paper, a hybrid memetic framework for coverage optimization (Hy-MFCO) is presented to cope with the hybrid problem using two major components: 1) a memetic algorithm (MA)-based scheduling strategy and 2) a heuristic recursive algorithm (HRA). First, the MA-based scheduling strategy adopts a dynamic chromosome structure to create disjoint sets, and then the HRA is utilized to compensate the loss of coverage by awaking some of the hibernated nodes in local regions when a disjoint set fails to maintain full coverage. The results obtained from real-world experiments using a WSN test-bed and computer simulations indicate that the proposed Hy-MFCO is able to maximize sensing coverage while achieving energy efficiency at the same time. Moreover, the results also show that the Hy-MFCO significantly outperforms the existing methods with respect to coverage preservation and energy efficiency.	acetaminophen 500 mg / hydrocodone bitartrate 5 mg oral tablet [hy-phen];biologic preservation;chromosome structures;computer simulation;dicom;dental intrusion;experiment;html5 in mobile devices;hearing loss, high-frequency;heidelberg research architecture;heuristic;hy-phen;intrusion detection system;kdm5d gene;mathematical optimization;memetic algorithm;memetics;np (complexity);name;neuronal calcium-sensor proteins;organizing (structure);performance;point of interest;polynomial;renal adysplasia;recursion (computer science);scheduling (computing);scheduling - hl7 publishing domain;sensor;testbed	Chia-Pang Chen;Subhas Mukhopadhyay;Cheng-Long Chuang;Tzu-Shiang Lin;Min-Sheng Liao;Yung-Chung Wang;Joe-Air Jiang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics	10.1109/TCYB.2014.2371139	real-time computing;genetic algorithm;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	11.368515000033591	78.2739002570738	178950

Flexgrid breaks the spectrum up into small (typically 12.5GHz) slots, but its key feature is that contiguous slots can be joined together to form arbitrary sized blocks of spectrum. This additional flexibility will allow faster transponders that utilise high spectral efficiency modulation techniques, but no longer fit within a 50GHz slot due to their larger spectral width requirements, to be carried by the optical network. From the use of these new spectrum efficient modulation formats and finer control over spectrum allocations, a key benefit that Flexgrid offers network operators is that their WDM networks can carry more traffic. This paper will look at the capacity improvements that can be realised on a WDM network that is using Flexgrid over those that are using a traditional fixed grid.	modulation;point-to-point protocol;point-to-point (telecommunications);requirement;spectral efficiency;transponder;wavelength-division multiplexing	Paul Wright;Andrew Lord;Luis Velasco	2013	2013 17th International Conference on Optical Networking Design and Modeling (ONDM)		telecommunications;computer science;transponder;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network	Networks	24.386204764300164	86.53446829942988	179033

In a traditional sleep scheduling, however, sensors have to start up numerous times in a period, and thus consume extra energy due to the state transitions. The objective of this paper is to design an energy efficient sleep scheduling for low data-rate WSNs, where sensors not only consume different amounts of energy in different states (transmit, receive, idle and sleep), but also consume energy for state transitions. We use TDMA as the MAC layer protocol, because it has the advantages of avoiding collisions, idle listening and overhearing. We first propose a novel interference-free TDMA sleep scheduling problem called contiguous link scheduling, which assigns sensors with consecutive time slots to reduce the frequency of state transitions. To tackle this problem, we then present efficient centralized and distributed algorithms that use time slots at most a constant factor of the optimum. The simulation studies corroborate the theoretical results, and show the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.	broadcast delay;centralized computing;distributed algorithm;interference (communication);overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);sensor node;simulation;state transition table;tree (data structure)	Junchao Ma;Wei Lou;Yanwei Wu;Xiang-Yang Li;Guihai Chen	2009	IEEE INFOCOM 2009	10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061970	distributed algorithm;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	10.294830125672396	82.79612026875732	179171

This method is adapted to WSN that anchor nodes present a uniform distribution in three dimensional sensor spaces. During the localization process, by reproducing a 3D special node, which is called the reproduced node, unknown nodes can calculate their own positions automatically. This NR algorithm is a three dimensional range-free approach which does not need extra hardware requests and the unknown nodes can calculate reproduced node by position information from threedifferent anchor nodes. Finally the unknown position coordinates are obtained by the position information of above four nodes. This approach has low complexity and the localization process is much simpler in simulation. The localization error can also reach a low level compared with classic DV-Hop and Centroid which can be found in simulation and the NR algorithm needs the least localization time. In extreme situations, localization error and time are improved by 25%, 84% and 84%, 88% compared with Centroid and DV-Hop algorithms respectively.	algorithm;hop;noise reduction;position-independent code;simulation	Xiaoming Wu;Hua Wu;Yang Liu;Jianping Xing;Mingyue Zhao	2014	JCP	10.4304/jcp.9.5.1047-1052	telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing	Mobile	15.95357880987663	75.65017926136682	179226

These sensor nodes are typically battery-powered sensor nodes (BPSNs) and can rarely meet design goals of long network lifetime and high reliability. Energy-harvesting sensor nodes (EHSNs) that convert different types of energy to electrical energy are an alternative type of sensor nodes with a long lifetime but a high cost. Combining BPSNs and EHSNs has potential to deal with the conflicting design goals of long lifetime and reasonably low cost. In this study, the authors make new contributions by modelling a heterogeneous WSN consisting of both BPSNs and EHSNs and proposing a comprehensive cost function-based routing approach that integrates endto-end path reliability, cost and energy consumption for providing satisfactory quality of service to applications running on hybrid WSNs. Another contribution made in this work is the optimal deployment of EHSNs using a reliabilityimportance-analysis-based method to improve the end-to-end path reliability within hybrid WSNs.	end-to-end principle;loss function;quality of service;routing;sensor web;software deployment	Amir Ehsani Zonouz;Liudong Xing;Vinod Vokkarane;Yan Lindsay Sun	2016	IET Wireless Sensor Systems	10.1049/iet-wss.2014.0131	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;sensor node;engineering;brooks–iyengar algorithm;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	10.811604682616084	80.05488484020265	179271

Today, DAS is widely employed in cutting edge cellular communication to cover dead spots. The complexity of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) makes it challenging to build efficient and cost effective DAS systems. Orthogonal Wavelet Division Multiplexing (OWDM) is a system that has been proposed as an alternative to OFDM. In this paper we present a novel Sequential Output based Parallel Processing (SBPP) architecture for DAS using OWDM scheme. The experimental evaluation was done on a virtual test bed that includes one central processor with multiple antenna nodes and multiple mobile stations. The novel architecture shows a new approach that could provide a more flexible replacement for OFDM with reduced Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI), while still maintaining the same channel capacity characteristics as OFDM. The architecture also demonstrates an efficient resource optimization technique based on LTE-driven data rate requirements for multimedia applications.	central processing unit;channel capacity;compaq lte;data rate units;division by zero;etsi satellite digital radio;finite impulse response;ici (programming language);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;mobile phone;modulation;multiplexing;orthogonal wavelet;parallel computing;power architecture platform reference;quality of service;requirement;telecommunications network;testbed	Chinmaya Mahapatra;A.

However, when some of the measurements are from non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths, the location errors can be very large. This paper proposes a residual test (RT) that can simultaneously determine the number of line-of-sight (LOS) BS and identify them. Then, localization can proceed with only those LOS BS. The RT works on the principle that when all measurements are LOS, the normalized residuals have a central Chi-Square distribution, versus a noncentral distribution when there is NLOS. The residuals are the squared differences between the estimates and the true position. Normalization by their variances gives a unity variance to the resultant random variables. In simulation studies, for the chosen geometry and NLOS and measurement noise errors, the RT can determine the correct number of LOS-BS over 90% of the time. For four or more BS, where there are at least three LOS-BS, the estimator has variances that are near the Cramer--Rao lower bound.	chi;fisher information;formation matrix;internationalization and localization;line-of-sight (missile);resultant;simulation	Yiu-Tong Chan;Wing-Yue Tsui;Hing-Cheung So;Pak-Chung Ching	2006	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2005.861207	random variable;electronic engineering;simulation;cramér–rao bound;index term;internationalization and localization;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;non-line-of-sight propagation;base station;time of arrival;mathematics;maximum likelihood;mobile station;statistics	Metrics	23.02337593377096	74.89759180408606	179461

To address these challenges, we study the impact of node reliability and propose a cooperative positioning scheme that identifies unreliable reference nodes in the system and adaptively adjusts the scoring threshold based on the geographic locations of reference nodes. When compared with other three conventional cooperative positioning schemes, our simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme can achieve the best accuracy of about 2 meters within five iterations, and it is about 32% better than the conventional schemes in terms of accuracy.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);computation;hotspot (wi-fi);iteration;simulation;sorting	Zhenhui Situ;Ivan Wang Hei Ho;Henry C.

These applications span from safety related applications to infotainment services. IEEE 802.11p standard that operates in 5.9 GHz frequency band is widely adopted in VANETs for physical and MAC layers. The radio signals in 5.9 GHz band are less penetrating as compared to Wi-Fi that operates in 2.4 GHz band. Obstacles that impede radio signals have high impact on vehicular communication. Thus, maintaining line-of-sight among communicating vehicles improves vehicular communication. Modern day vehicular environment contains road infrastructure units such as curve roads, flyovers, underpasses, tunnels and irregular roads. The modern road infrastructure units introduce non line-of-sight conditions which result in either costly or no communication. This paper introduces a mechanism to maintain line-of-sight among communicating vehicles while considering modern road infrastructure units. The geometrical concepts are used here to model and formulate the line-of-sight (LOS) conditions in various real world scenarios. We have calculated the relative optimal position of signal repeaters / reflectors for maintaining line-of-sight condition in different road infrastructure units.	apple maps;frequency band;line-of-sight (missile);no-communication theorem;rss;radio wave;transceiver;tunneling protocol	Muhammad Ahsan Qureshi;Rafidah Md.

In order to prolong the network lifetime while maintaining coverage, many node partition algorithms have been developed. In this article, we model coverage problem by a set coverage problem. Based on the density of information, the optimal node partitions are investigated by solving an ILP problem. An intersection point method (IPM) is introduced to reduce the number of variables in ILP to O(km) where m is the number of deployed sensors; k is the number of neighbors. Even though the ILP model can give an approximately optimal solution for generating a minimum cover set. It cannot be used in a distributed scenario. Based on the Voronoi Diagram we present a distributed partition algorithm that constructs minimum node partitions by merging voronoi cells. The simulation results show that the IPM based ILP coverage model can deal with extremely large areas and improve the ILP performance by reducing the number of variables and constraints.

0fd31183cfd6013c8999260f1a001557633d87da	quality-of-sensing aware budget constrained contaminant detection sensor deployment in water distribution system		Water contamination or pollution has raised serious disasters and social impact. It is significant to alleviate its impact or reduce the risks. Deploying water quality monitoring sensors in the water distribution systems naturally becomes a promising solution. In the consideration of sensor deployment, the deployment cost and the achieved quality-of-sensing, usually in terms of coverage, are always two contradictive issues. Although massively deploying sensors implies higher quality-of-sensing, it may also incur extremely high deployment cost. Actually, it is usually infeasible with the consideration of limited sensor deployment budget. In this paper, we are motivated to investigate a budget constrained sensor deployment in water distribution system, with the goal of maximizing the quality-of-sensing. Two kinds of sensors with different prices and hence different communication capabilities are considered. The cheaper one equips with only sensor-to-sensor communication capability. While, the expensive one is further capable of cellular communication. We first formally describe our problem using a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. To address the complexity on solving MINLP, we further propose a heuristic algorithm based on genetic algorithm, whose high efficiency is extensively validated by simulation based studies.	genetic algorithm;heuristic (computer science);linear programming;mobile phone;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;sensor;simulation;software deployment;spin contamination	Deze Zeng;Shiyan Zhang;Lin Gu;Shui Yu;Zhangjie Fu	2018	J.

fe45569cfedf6cbc9dee5a138aa4e000ef303447	solving priority-based target coverage problem in directional sensor networks with adjustable sensing ranges	learning automata;greedy based algorithm;cover set formation;scheduling algorithms;directional sensor networks	The extensive applications of directional sensor networks (DSNs) in a wide range of situations have recently attracted a great deal of attention. DSNs primarily operate based on simultaneously observing a group of events (targets) occurring in a set area and maximizing network lifetime, as there are limitations to the directional sensors’ sensing angle and battery power. The higher the number of sensing ranges of the sensors and the more different the coverage requirements for the targets, the more complex this issue will be. Also known as priority-based target coverage with adjustable sensing ranges (PTCASR), this issue, which has not yet been investigated in the field of study, is the highlight of this research. A potential solution to this problem, based on the fact that sensors are frequently densely deployed, would be to organize the sensors into a few cover sets. After that the cover sets needs to be successively activated—this process is referred to as the scheduling technique. This paper aims to resolve the issue of PTCASR with the proposal of two scheduling algorithms i.e. greedy-based and learning automata-based algorithms. These proposed algorithms were assessed for their performance via a number of experiments. Additionally, the effect of each algorithm on maximizing network lifetime was also investigated via a comparative study. Both algorithms were successful in solving the problem; however, the learning automata-based scheduling algorithm proved relatively superior to the greedy-based algorithm when it came to extending network lifetime.

Unfortunately, improving one of these metrics comes at the expense of the other metric. In this paper, we investigate the design of algorithms which provide the maximum possible coverage subject to a lifetime guarantee. We assume that nodes are randomly scattered in a sensor field and the goal is to partition these nodes into K sets. At any given time, nodes belonging to only one of these sets actively sense the field. A key challenge is to achieve this partition in a distributed manner with purely local information and yet provide near optimal coverage. In this paper, we propose DRACo for this purpose. We formally prove that DRACo converges when executed in a synchronous manner. We prove that our algorithm and the optimal solution are both Nash equilibrium for an appropriately defined game. Via extensive simulations, we show that DRACo achieves near optimal coverage performance. Moreover, we show that DRACo is robust to network dynamics and can converge even when executed asynchronously. Our simulations indicate that the convergence speed of DRACo is almost constant with the number of nodes N and K.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;autocatalytic set;code coverage;converge;emoticon;greedy algorithm;iteration;nash equilibrium;norm (social);randomness;rate of convergence;requirement;sensor node;simulation;synchronization (computer science);telephone exchange;vergence	Xin Ai;Vikram Srinivasan;Chen-Khong Tham	2007	2007 4th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks	10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292865	embedded system;distributed algorithm;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	13.112416155562101	77.85164686358432	180237

How to efficiently disseminate and collect the sensing data over WSNs is a key challenge yet. In this study, assumed that there are K sensor nodes equipped with sensing apparatus within N storage sensors, these K numbers of sensors can sense environmental changes and disseminate coded (by Fountain codes) time-series data over WSNs using the simple random walk. In order to perform the Fountain codes over WSNs, the question is to disseminate data in the long range of random walks to preserve the randomness so as to promote the source decoded rate. In this paper, a framework with partial decoding is proposed due to the temporal dependency of time-series sensing data. The reasons are twofold: (a) the complete decoding is not necessary for time-series data since the missing portions can be compensated by that of neighbors; (b) even if the ideal Luby transform (LT) code is optimized in terms of convergence, the complete decoding process is high power-consuming. Furthermore, a mathematical model to estimate the appropriate source decoded rate is given to guarantee the error tolerable level (<; 4% normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE)). Experimental results show that the communication cost is affordable in the real cases.	data retrieval;emoticon;fountain code;long short-term memory;long tail;luby transform code;mathematical model;mean squared error;michael luby;overhead (computing);persistence (computer science);persistent data structure;randomness;sensor;simulation;time series	Hsien-Tzu Chiu;Chia-Cheng Yen;Jia-Shung Wang	2013	2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks	10.1109/MSN.2013.54	stochastic process;real-time computing;transform coding;wireless sensor network;convergence;fountain code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;time series;statistics;computer network;source code	Mobile	16.27195216810269	80.41405795347102	180381

This means that the main effort of nowadays wireless communications research shall be moved to energy efficient solutions. One of the most interesting approaches to achieve energy efficiency is to enable the short-range cooperative strategies among multi-standard mobile devices. The short-range cooperative strategies are highly beneficial in terms of energy savings, as they shift the wireless communications paradigm from high power cellular interfaces to low power WPAN interfaces. Keeping this in mind, our proposed clustering framework builds a solid fundament to bring short-range cooperative strategies into the wireless world. The key features of our method are robustness, simplicity and reliability, which are achieved via novel mechanisms of silent association and discrimination of non-persistent neighbors. Herein we present the analysis of state of the art clustering designs, which is followed by the detailed description of the presented method along with the results, from WiMedia MAC ns-2 simulator, that verify principles of the proposed method.	cluster analysis;cognitive network;computation;computer cluster;mobile device;programming paradigm;robustness (computer science);simulation;telecommunications network	Jacek Kibilda;Kandeepan Sithamparanathan;Radoslaw Piesiewicz	2011	2011 IEEE 73rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2011.5956287	wireless ad hoc network;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;efficient energy use;computer security;computer network	Mobile	16.457460214315503	84.49280130679536	180569
97764f830e0935a19e36fbe4b379f7cf46733f77	ressourcenarme und dezentrale lokalisierung autonomer sensorknoten in sensornetzwerken		Sensor networks consist of a mass of resource-critical and autarchic simple sensor nodes. Initially, these sensor nodes have to organize and localize autonomously. The localization process of these randomly deployed nodes must meet numerous strong conditions of small data memories, limited energy sources, a small bandwidth and others. In this work, lots of the already published range estimation algorithms are analyzed regarding the compliance to the given constraints. The presented method to determine a distance based on the minimal transmission power eliminates some sources of errors known from the measurement of the received signal strength. As a little drawback, this new technique increases the energy consumption due to more transmissions. Thus, it is predestined to static networks. The main part of this script aims to the resource-aware localization of sensor nodes. Based on an extensive analysis, it is illustrated that most of available localization algorithms do not consider at all the numerous constraints. In sensor networks with low accuracy requirements, node’s positions can be calculated by the centroid localization algorithm (CL) provided that all reference nodes can be configured optimal regarding the presented method. In borderlands of a sensor network, the accuracy of the centroid localization decreases enormously. The new presented algorithm centroid localization with edge correction (CLwEC) reduces this positioning error significantly and requires, in comparison the CL, only slightly increased resources. Therefore, it is exceedingly qualified to replace the centroid localization in resource-aware sensor networks. The positioning error could be decreased drastically by the new introduced weighted centroid localization algorithm (WCL). Its positioning error highly depends on the alignment of the beacons and results in a minimum if an optimal transmission range is adjusted. Additionally, this algorithm features a very robust error behavior despite the expected high variances of the required distance measurements. Finally, this work concludes with the presentation of a real world application. It demonstrates the distance estimation based on the minimal transmission power and the weighted centroid localization. In spite of noticeable oscillating distances, the localization accuracy is very precise.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);internationalization and localization;randomness;requirement;sensor	Jan Blumenthal	2008				Mobile	15.580546575657348	75.86011945021005	180619
911a2fcb9bb379958206d8d277edd42e9d41ef7d	distributed error estimation of functional dependency	distributed processing;functional dependency;error estimation;database application h 2 8	Measuring or estimating the number of errors in (i.e., violations to) a functional dependency (FD) offers valuable information about data semantics and quality. Most existing work focuses on FD error estimation in a centralized environment, where data are stored only in one site and the goal is to optimize the time and space complexities of the estimation algorithms. The distributed FD error estimation problem, in which the data can reside in multiple physically distributed sites, has never been studied in depth and is the subject of this work. In this work, we study a version of the distributed FD error estimation problem where a coordinator site communicates with multiple remote sites for arriving at such estimations, and the goal is to minimize this communication cost. We study two types of queries—that are dual to each other in semantics—for such estimations: one tries to maximize the accuracies of FD error estimations under fixed communication costs, and the other to minimize the communication costs needed to meet certain accuracy requirements. In our framework, each remote site maintains a concise synopsis data structure obtained by scanning its local data once, and the coordinator site receives and processes all such data structures to arrive at an estimate of the FD error. Our solution extends from the case of two remote sites to that of multiple remote sites. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed techniques via rigorous analysis and extensive experiments. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Guided by energy measurements on smartphones, which show that some services performed in parallel require less energy than their stand-alone executions, we investigate the possibility to delay some services to the time when other services have already been scheduled in such a way the total energy consumption is minimized once all services are accomplished. We define two new energy optimization problems, called Single Overlapping Pair (SOP) and Multiple Overlapping Pairs (MOP). The former assumes that a delay-tolerant service must be paired with a single pre-scheduled service, the latter that a delay-tolerant service may be paired with multiple prescheduled services. We propose new algorithms to solve both SOP and MOP optimally in polynomial time, when the set of services to be executed is known in advance. Finally, we evaluate the benefits of the energy-efficient pairing strategy via simulations on synthetic traces. The results of our preliminary experiments show a neat energy gain achievable by pairing executions, if compared to stand-alone executions. Indeed, the solution for SOP shows a 30% decrease in energy consumption, while the one for MOP shows a 70% decrease in energy demanding.	algorithm;energy drift;experiment;mathematical optimization;online and offline;polynomial;simulation;smartphone;synthetic intelligence;time complexity;tracing (software)	Mauro Conti;Daniele Diodati;Maria Cristina Pinotti;Bruno Crispo	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications	10.1109/GreenCom.2012.51	optimization problem;embedded system;availability;real-time computing;telecommunications;schedule;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;scheduling;computer security;computer network	Embedded	14.877594063954662	84.27492046832393	180804

This encompasses wide FOVs of ambient infrastructure and directional FOVs of light emitted by low-end embedded devices. This variety of light wave propagation can severely affect the transmission reliability, despite ``pointing'' devices to each other may seem enough for a reliable link. In particular, the fact that FOVs are unknown makes traditional access protocols in VLC unreliable in presence of interference among nodes of different FOVs and exacerbates the hidden-node problem. In this paper, we propose a Carrier Sensing Multiple Access/Collision Detection&Hidden Avoidance (CSMA/CD-HA) Medium Access Control protocol for a network where each node solely uses one Light Emitting Diode (LED) to transmit and receive data. The CSMA/CD-HA can enable in-band intra-frame bidirectional transmission with just one optical antenna. The key idea is to exploit the intra-frame data symbols without emission of light to introduce an embedded communication channel. This approach enables the transmission of additional data while receiving in the same optical channel and it makes the communication robust to different types of FOVs. We build a software-defined embedded platform running on Linux operating system, implement the CSMA/CD-HA protocol, and evaluate its performance through experiments. Results show that collisions caused by hidden nodes can be reduced and our protocol can increase the saturation throughput by nearly up to 50% and 100% under the two-node and four-node scenarios, respectively."""	channel (communications);diode;embedded system;experiment;fibre channel;interference (communication);intra-frame coding;linux;oled;operating system;radio frequency;software propagation;throughput;vlc media player	Qing Wang;Domenico Giustiniano	2014		10.1145/2674005.2675000	embedded system;design;telecommunications;computer science;evaluation;implementation;computer network	Mobile	19.77145600744325	82.2363489020383	181004

It employs XOR encoding in the retransmission phase to reduce the communication cost. In sparse and lossy networks, it delivers much better performance than Deluge, a typical reprogramming protocol for sensor networks. Compared to prior coding-based reprogramming protocols, it has two salient features. First, it is computationally much more lightweight than previous coding-based reprogramming protocols using Random Linear Codes or Fountain Codes. Second, it is density-aware by adapting its interpage waiting time. Hence, it achieves good performance in both dense and sparse networks. We have implemented ReXOR based on TinyOS and evaluate its performance extensively. Results show that ReXOR is indeed lightweight compared with previous coding-based reprogramming protocols in terms of computation overhead. The results also show that ReXOR achieves good network-level performance in both dense and sparse networks, compared with Deluge and a typical coding-based reprogramming protocol, Rateless Deluge.	code (cryptography);computation;exclusive or;fountain code;lossy compression;overhead (computing);retransmission (data networks);sparse matrix;tinyos	Wei Dong;Chun Chen;Xue Liu;Jiajun Bu;Yi Gao	2011	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2010.240	embedded system;communications protocol;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer network	Mobile	16.08067819829824	81.43074042062186	181388

For example, the pervasive QR codes can be viewed as communicating a short code to camera-equipped sensors and recent research has explored using screen-to-camera communications for larger data transfers. Such communications could be particularly attractive in pervasive camera based applications, where such camera communications can reuse the existing camera hardware and also leverage from the large pixel array structure for high data-rate communication. While several prototypes have been constructed, the fundamental capacity limits of this novel communication channel in all but the simplest scenarios remains unknown. The visual medium differs from RF in that the information capacity of this channel largely depends on the perspective distortions while multipath becomes negligible. In this paper, we create a model of this communication system to allow predicting the capacity based on receiver perspective (distance and angle to the transmitter). We calibrate and validate this model through lab experiments wherein information is transmitted from a screen and received with a tablet camera. Our capacity estimates indicate that tens of Mbps is possible using a smartphone camera even when the short code on the screen images onto only 15% of the camera frame. Our estimates also indicate that there is room for at least 2.5x improvement in throughput of existing screen - camera communication prototypes.	channel (communications);channel capacity;data rate units;distortion;experiment;multipath propagation;pervasive informatics;pixel;qr code;radio frequency;sensor;short code;smartphone;tablet computer;throughput;transmitter	Ashwin Ashok;Shubham Jain;Marco Gruteser;Narayan B.

Machine-type communication (MTC)/C-IoT devices need a ubiquitous connectivity, which is provided by the cellular infrastructure. As the density of these devices increases, it becomes more challenging to connect them to the cellular network within the stipulated amount of time. In this article, we look at two typical deployment scenarios of C-IoT with EC, identify the crucial challenges, and provide solutions. One solution is the RACH procedure, which enables a million devices to access the cellular network. Our emphasis is on a fast RACH procedure that allows C-IoT devices to perform a successful RACH with fewer attempts, which saves power.	computer science;edge computing;electrical engineering;internet of things;software deployment	Sreekanth Dama;Vanlin Sathya;Kiran Kuchi;S Valerrian Pasca ThomasValerrianPasca	2017	IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine	10.1109/MCE.2016.2614421	telecommunications;computer science;electricity;computer security;computer network	Mobile	21.547599440961353	87.60152776620443	182047

These devices can be attached to different parts of the human body to capture and wirelessly transmit health statistics in a wearable, non-invasive form factor. However, the small physical size of the sensor node used in BSNs can result in irregular transmission failures caused by body shadowing. Body shadowing can disrupt the radio communication due to body movement preventing the radio signal from passing through. In this work, an innovative approach based on body positioning prediction is applied to minimise the transmission failures and lower the power consumption. By analysing the impact of different leg positions and twiddling of the radio signal, an algorithm to adapt the periodicity of the transmission period for reliable transmission is proposed. The results from hardware experiment have shown that the proposed solution can achieve transmission success rate above 90% with reducing the energy consumption by about 50%.	access control;algorithm;design review (u.s. government);gait analysis;quasiperiodicity;radio wave;sensor node;wearable computer	TiongHoo Lim;Teng Weng;Iain Bate	2014	2014 4th International Conference on Wireless Mobile Communication and Healthcare - Transforming Healthcare Through Innovations in Mobile and Wireless Technologies (MOBIHEALTH)	10.4108/icst.mobihealth.2014.257424	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;body area network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Mobile	10.52091430883876	84.62833847794853	182100

In this paper, the characteristics of coverage model for directional sensor networks are analyzed, and the prototype of view orientation of wireless sensor node in surveillance area with obstacles is discussed. Then, the concept of weighted coverage modal with different weight is provided, and a novel coverage optimizing algorithm based on genetic algorithm for occlusion-free surveillance model is proposed. The dynamic optimization process is constructed for adapting the real-time changing and a discrete model of sub-regions is presented for simplifying calculation. The result of experiment show that the proposed method can optimize the coverage rate of occlusion-free surveillance in wireless directional sensor network, and make coverage rate more stable when obstacles are increased.	dynamic programming;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;modal logic;prototype;real-time clock;sensor node;simulation	Yibo Jiang;Jinwei Yang;Weijie Chen;Wanliang Wang	2010	2010 International Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks	10.1109/CASoN.2010.76	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Robotics	11.5124312253589	77.98775173439468	182132
8603d1b6d92ed8f1fd1e0e345f9a9217bbc3e706	improving the multiple access method of home networks over the electrical wiring		Data communications on domestic low-voltage powerlines benefit from a ubiquitous and already existent infrastructure. Nevertheless, high-speed communications on this environment faces obstacles such as attenuation and noise. The HomePlug standard defines MACand PHY-layer protocols for home electrical wiring networks. Its MAC protocol has introduced the deferral counter (DC) mechanism, which adapts the contention of the nodes for the medium according to the network load. This article proposes the Contention window Pro-active Increase (CPI) mechanism to enhance the performance of HomePlug. The CPI mechanism is based on DC and improves the HomePlug efficiency by faster increasing the contention window size. As a consequence, there are fewer collisions and the aggregated throughput increases. Under high network load, our simulation results show a tradeoff concerning throughput and jitter. CPI improves HomePlug throughput by up to 3% with no jitter increase and by up to 15% at the cost of additional jitter.	phy (chip);program counter;simulation;throughput;wiring	Miguel Elias M.

In particular, wireless energy harvesting, which scavenges energy from ambient radio signals, has recently received an increasing attention. In this paper, we consider a self-powered wireless system with one transmitter and one receiver, in which the transmitter has no fixed power supplies and extract energy only via wireless energy harvesting from ambient radio signals. It is assumed that the transmitter follows a save-then-transmit protocol, which specifies that a fraction (referred to as save-ratio) of time is devoted exclusively to energy harvesting while the remaining fraction is used for data transmission. We focus on the optimal save-ratio selection and achievable throughput maximization in two cases with regard to energy harvesting rate: the deterministic case, in which energy harvesting rate is known in advance, and the stochastic case, in which energy harvesting rate is unknown and only its statistical properties (e.g. probability distribution) are available. The optimal save-ratio for the two cases is theoretically derived as a function of energy harvesting rate (or its statistical properties). The experimental results characterize how the optimal save-ratio and the maximal achievable throughput vary with energy harvesting rate and validate the optimality of save-ratio selection.	expectation–maximization algorithm;mathematical optimization;maximal set;numerical analysis;power supply;simulation;throughput;transmitter;wireless router	Sixing Yin;Erqing Zhang;Ji Li;Liang Yin;Shufang Li	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6554671	stochastic process;transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	14.572829670492537	82.71338969835632	182475

This is necessary if many devices attempt to transfer large amounts of data, or occupy the channel over long periods as this will probably degrade the capacity and performance of the network. Thus, this research presents a model to manage the parameters that can influence the quality of a wireless network environment, minimizing the loss of performance. The proposed model uses a fuzzy controller to dynamically adjust the maximum frame size that can be transmitted according to the characteristics of the transmission medium. The initial results of this research show that it is possible to enhance the performance of wireless networks by controlling parameters that have influence in the quality of the network.	profiling (computer programming)	Gustavo Pereira Mateus;Beatriz Wilges;Mario A.

We test the viability of a novel power management technique, based on the exploitation of the NIC offmode while a client-controlled streaming multimedia application is in progress. The basic idea is to switch off the card while frames are being played back, until a low-threshold level is reached in the client buffer. In this paper, pessimistic assumptions are made on the timing and power overheads associated with recovering the card from off-mode, but nevertheless a power saving of about 25% is achieved over the average power consumption incurred by the standard IEEE 802.11 mechanism. We also provide design curves showing the minimum buffer size that makes our technique effective, as a function of the network bandwidth and of the card characteristics.	handheld game console;laptop;mobile device;network interface controller;personal digital assistant;power management;streaming media	Davide Bertozzi;Luca Benini;Bruno Riccò	2002		10.1109/WCNC.2002.993395	multi-frequency network;embedded system;real-time computing;split tunneling;mobile telephony;telecommunications;power control;computer science;network interface;operating system;wireless network interface controller;computer network	EDA	11.788268643684678	87.43238765040896	182788

Further, the energy efficiency of ICNs has not been sufficiently considered. In this study, we evaluate the energy consumption of an ICN network by first measuring the power consumption of actual PCs/smartphones and constructing an energy consumption model. Then, by using the model and the simulator ndnSIM, we calculate the energy consumed by the network.

Unfortunately, wireless power transfer itself-especially through radio frequency radiation rectification-is fairly inefficient due to decaying power with distance, antenna polarization, etc. Consequently, idle charging needs to be minimized to reduce the already large costs of providing energy to the receivers. In turn, energy saving in a WPTN can be boosted by simply switching off the energy transmitter when the received energy is too weak for rectification. Therefore in this paper we propose, and experimentally evaluate, two “green” protocols for the control plane of static charger/mobile receiver WPTN aimed at optimizing the charger workflow to make the WPTN reduce idle time of transmitters. Those protocols are: “beaconing,” where receivers advertise their presence to the WPTN, and “probing” exploiting the receiver feedback from the WPTN on the level of received energy. We demonstrate that both protocols reduce the unnecessary WPTN uptime, however trading it for the reduced energy provision, compared to the base case of “WPTN charger always on.” For example, our system (in our experiments) saves at most ≈80 % of energy at the charger with only ≈17% less energy possibly harvested.	battery charger;control plane;experiment;high availability;polarization (waves);radio frequency;rectifier;recursion;transmitter;uptime	Qingzhi Liu;Michal Golinski;Przemyslaw Pawelczak;Martijn Warnier	2016	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2016.2520178	communications protocol;transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	13.938888274390212	84.00734214656508	183178

By allowing sensors to propagate data directly to mobile APs over multiaccess channels, and relieving sensors from energy-consuming network functions, SENMA has the potential of offering orders of magnitude of improvement in energy efficiency over the multihop ad hoc architecture, as demonstrated by our analysis on scalability. Optimization configurations of SENMA such as the altitude, the trajectory, and the coverage of APs are considered next, using the sum-rate as the performance metric.

When such a network is deployed, there are usually restrictions in the way that the nodes can be positioned, and this results in a node-dependent attenuation of the usable solar energy. This effect must be taken into account when placing the basestations used to communicate with the sensor nodes. In this paper we consider the minimum-cost placement of data collecting basestation nodes so that outage-free operation of the sensor nodes is obtained. This is done by minimizing the number of basestations required when taking into account the energy costs of sensor node traffic relaying. An optimization is first formulated which gives a lower bound on the number of basestations that are required. Because of the complexity of the problem, an algorithm is proposed which can be used to do placements for practical problem sizes. The algorithm uses the result from an iterated local search as a starting point, and then uses an energy aware local optimization to obtain feasible basestation placements. Results are presented which show that the algorithm performs well for a variety of network scenarios.	downtime;iterated local search;iteration;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;node (computer science);search algorithm;sensor node;sun outage	S.

59e092aece528ce584b415fba36cc2fb2143c7c4	efficient and adaptive node selection for target tracking in wireless sensor network		In target tracking wireless sensor network, choosing the proper working nodes can not only minimize the number of active nodes, but also satisfy the tracking reliability requirement. However, most existing works focus on selecting sensor nodes which are the nearest to the target for tracking missions and they did not consider the correlation of the location of the sensor nodes so that these approaches can not meet all the goals of the network. This work proposes an efficient and adaptive node selection approach for tracking a target in a distributed wireless sensor network. The proposed approach combines the distance-based node selection strategy and particle filter prediction considering the spatial correlation of the different sensing nodes. Moreover, a joint distance weighted measurement is proposed to estimate the information utility of sensing nodes. Experimental results show that EANS outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by reducing the energy cost and computational complexity as well as guaranteeing the tracking accuracy.	computational complexity theory;missile guidance;particle filter;selection algorithm;simulation	Juan Feng;Hongwei Zhao;Baowang Lian	2016	J.

Especially, many countries have been considering permission for CR-based spectrum usage of TV white space (TVWS). Even though TV band has favorable propagation property compared to other higher frequency bands, CR system in TVWS involves a fundamental limit on system capacity because of a restricted TV channel bandwidth. To overcome it, in this paper, we introduce new CR test-bed with capability of carrier aggregation. By utilizing carrier aggregation functionality, we can effectively utilize multiple TV channels and achieve higher system capacity. Moreover, the test-bed supports non-contiguous carrier aggregation as well as contiguous carrier aggregation. Because unused TV channels are spread over entire TV band sporadically in general, new test-bed provides noticeable performance improvement compared to the existing CR systems in TVWS. Detailed implementation of the test-bed including each functional module is explained, and functional test procedures with corresponding results are provided for evaluation.	channel capacity;cognitive radio;frequency band;functional testing;real-time clock;real-time computing;software propagation;spectral efficiency;testbed;throughput;white spaces (radio)	Jin-Suk Pak;Jung-Sun Um;Hoiyoon Jung;SangWon Kim;Byung Jang Jeong	2013		10.1145/2508478.2508483	electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	Networks	23.979056048228294	87.2537373038143	183747

However, irreversible degradation mechanisms jeopardize battery lifetime, calling for intelligent management policies, which minimize the impact of these phenomena while guaranteeing a minimum Quality of Service (QoS). This paper explores a mathematical characterization of these devices, focusing on the interplay between the battery discharge policy and the irreversible degradation of the storage capacity. We propose a stochastic Markov chain framework, suitable for policy optimization, which captures the degradation status of the battery. We present a general result of Markov chains, which exploits the timescale separation between the communication time-slot of the device and the battery degradation process, and enables an efficient optimization. We show that this model fits well the behavior of real batteries for what concerns their storage capacity degradation over time. We demonstrate that a degradation-aware policy significantly improves the lifetime of the sensor compared to """"greedy"""" policies, while guaranteeing the minimum required QoS. Finally, a simple heuristic policy, which never discharges the battery below a given threshold, is shown to achieve near-optimal performance in terms of battery lifetime."""	autonomous robot;discharger;elegant degradation;fits;greedy algorithm;heuristic;markov chain;mathematical optimization;quality of service;sensor;software deployment	Nicolò Michelusi;Leonardo Badia;Ruggero Carli;Luca Corradini;Michele Zorzi	2013	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2013.111113.130022	electronic engineering;real-time computing;simulation;wireless sensor network;quality of service;computer science;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;markov process;mobile wireless sensor network;energy harvesting;statistics	Embedded	13.59230361765643	82.53633837284706	183776
9e7d5d05e9ce17896609b040275cecf6cb7e6a86	effects of beamforming and antenna configurations on mobility in 5g nr		The future 5G systems are getting closer to be a reality. It is envisioned, indeed, that the rollout of first 5G network will happen around end of 2018 and beginning of 2019. However, there are still a number of issues and problems that have to be faces and new solutions and methods are needed to solve them. Along these lines, the effects that beamforming and antenna configurations may have on the mobility in 5G New Radio (NR) is still unclear. In fact, with the use of directive antennas and high frequencies (e.g., above 10 GHz), in order to meet the stringent requirements of 5G (e.g., support of 500km/h) it is crucial to understand how the envisioned 5G NR antenna configurations may impact mobility (and thus handovers). In this article, first we will briefly survey mobility enhancements and solution currently under discussion in 3GPP Rel. 15. In particular, we focus our analysis on the physical layer signals involved in the measurement reporting and the new radio measurement model used in 5G NR to filter the multiple beams typical of directive antenna with a large number of antenna elements. Finally, the critical aspect of mobility identified in the previous sections will be analyzed in more details through the obtained results of an extensive system-level evaluation analysis.

Failure of the two nodes or failure of the last available route between them ends their communication. In this paper, we analyze the maximum lifetime of node-to-node communication in static ad hoc networks when alternative routes that keep the two nodes connected to each other are node-disjoint. We target ad hoc networks with random topology modeled as a random geometric graph. The analysis is provided for (1) networks that support automatic repeat request (ARQ) at the medium access control level, and (2) networks that do not support ARQ. On the basis of this analysis, we propose numerical algorithms to predict at each moment the maximum duration that two nodes can still communicate with each other. Then, we derive a closed-form expression for expected maximum node-to-node communication lifetime in the network. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also derive upper and lower bounds on the lifetime of node-disjoint routes in static ad hoc networks. We verify the accuracy of our analysis using extensive simulation studies.	access control;algorithm;automatic repeat request;geometric graph theory;hoc (programming language);numerical analysis;random geometric graph;random graph;simulation	Javad Vazifehdan;R.

83ffa28209aa5d6ce5f2d8a67b11fbc3730efa11	investigations on enhanced power saving mechanism for ieee 802.16m network with heterogeneous traffic	medium access control;power saving mechanism;sleep mode;ieee 802 16m	In this paper, power management mechanisms for IEEE 802.16m network using power saving class (PSC) are suggested for heterogeneous traffic. The proposed algorithms, namely, combined cyclic binary exponent (CCBE), combined anti-cyclic binary exponent (CABE) and combined truncated binary exponent (CTBE) are derived by combining the existing PSC-I and PSC-II with appropriate modifications. The mobile station (MS) with existing PSC-I, PSC-II and combined PSC (CPSC) suffers from high response delay and/or more energy consumption if the packet interarrival time of heterogeneous traffic increases. The main reason behind reduced performance is due to the fixed position and duration of the listen interval in these PSC. To optimize the listen interval, the sleep interval of PSC-I is customized to realize the three proposed algorithms. In addition, the modified sleep interval of PSC-I is combined with fixed sleep interval of PSC-II. Finally, the resultant combined PSC is formulated by applying a scaling rule that minimizes and positions the duration of listening interval by referring the current listen interval of PSC-II. The performance of three PSC is studied by varying the interarrival time, minimum and maximum sleep intervals at the MS. It is observed with CCBE algorithm, the number of listen intervals, response delay and power consumption is reduced by 8.02%, 22.71% and 15.60%, than CABE, respectively. Similarly, CCBE shows an improvement of 28.62%, 25.24% and 31.97% than CTBE algorithm. Also, the performance of CCBE is improved by 57.82%, 89.67% and 64.16% than conventional CPSC algorithm.

f42f07e9d1b96288e8911b54946c27c6c3524cf9	optimal energy allocation scheme in distributed estimation for wireless sensor networks over rayleigh fading channels		We focus on the issue of energy and bandwidth limitations in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). To tackle this issue, we propose the optimal energy allocation scheme and the optimal number of quantization bits by using alternating optimization method. Firstly, we determine the optimal energy allocation scheme which minimizes the reconstruction error on fusion center by keeping the number of quantization bits per sensor fixed. Secondly, we determine the optimal number of quantization bits per sensor such that the energy allocation scheme achieves the minimum reconstruction error. To find the optimal energy allocation scheme and the optimal number of quantization bits jointly, we propose an iterative algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithms do not only achieve better results than equal energy allocation scheme but also produce reconstruction error close to that of unquantized estimation. This paper also investigates the effects of sensor noise observation and propagation losses on the design of optimal energy allocation scheme. The optimal energy allocation scheme suggests the allocation of more energy to sensors with small variance noise of sensor observation.		Eni D.

In this paper, we study constrained versions of the relay node placement problem, where relay nodes can only be placed at a subset of candidate locations. In the connected relay node placement problem, we want to place a minimum number of relay nodes to ensure the connectivity of the sensor nodes and the base stations. In the survivable relay node placement problem, we want to place a minimum number of relay nodes to ensure the biconnectivity of the sensor nodes and the base stations. For each of the two problems, we discuss its computational complexity, and present a framework of polynomial time O(1) -approximation algorithms with small approximation ratios.	approximation algorithm;computational complexity theory;polynomial;regular expression;relay;requirement;sensor web;time complexity	Satyajayant Misra;Seung Don Hong;Guoliang Xue;Jian Tang	2008	IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.65	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;base station;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;relay channel;approximation algorithm;computer network	Mobile	12.786947831660346	79.4697134868433	184185

Supporting mobile applications via public WiFi networks has received significant research attention due to the drastic increase of penetration rate of 802.11-based networks. Nevertheless, recent empirical studies showed that unplanned WiFi networks cannot provide satisfactory Quality of Service for interactive mobile applications due to intermittent network connectivity. In this paper, we exploit realistic mobility characteristics of users to deploy WiFi Access Points (APs) for continuous service for mobile users. We study two AP deployment problems that aim to maximize the continuous user coverage and to minimize the AP deployment cost, respectively. Both problems are formulated based on mobility graphs that capture the statistical mobility patterns of users. We prove that both problems are NP-hard. We develop several optimal and approximation algorithms with provable performance bounds for different topologies of mobility graphs. The effectiveness of our approaches is validated by extensive simulations using real user mobility traces.	ap computer science;approximation algorithm;emergence;internet;mobile app;np-hardness;penetration test;provable security;quality of service;simulation;software deployment;tracing (software);web service	Tian Wang;Guoliang Xing;Minming Li;Weijia Jia	2010	The 7th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Systems (IEEE MASS 2010)	10.1109/MASS.2010.5663941	the internet;quality of service;mobile telephony;computer science;theoretical computer science;np-hard;communication complexity;distributed computing;mobility model;empirical research;approximation algorithm;computer network	Mobile	12.473626921035116	88.21995935718218	184276

Sensors, however, have significant power constraint (battery life), making communication very expensive. Another important issue in the context of sensor-based information systems is that individual sensor readings are inherently unreliable. In order to address these two aspects, sensor database systems like TinyDB and Cougar enable in-network data aggregation to reduce the communication cost and improve reliability. The existing data aggregation techniques, however, are limited to relatively simple types of queries such as SUM, COUNT, AVG, and MIN/MAX. In this paper we propose a data aggregation scheme that significantly extends the class of queries that can be answered using sensor networks. These queries include (approximate) quantiles, such as the median, the most frequent data values, such as the <i>consensus</i> value, a histogram of the data distribution, as well as range queries. In our scheme, each sensor aggregates the data it has received from other sensors into a fixed (user specified) size message. We provide strict theoretical guarantees on the approximation quality of the queries in terms of the message size. We evaluate the performance of our aggregation scheme by simulation and demonstrate its accuracy, scalability and low resource utilization for highly variable input data sets.	avg;approximation algorithm;data aggregation;database;information system;max;range query (data structures);scalability;sensor;simulation;tinyos	Nisheeth Shrivastava;Chiranjeeb Buragohain;Divyakant Agrawal;Subhash Suri	2004	Proceedings. 13th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (IEEE Cat.

To quantify how well events are detected in such networks, coverage of events is a fundamental problem to be studied. However, traditional studies mostly focus on analyzing the coverage of the FoI, which is usually called area coverage. In this paper, we propose an analytic method to evaluate the performance of event coverage in sensor networks with randomly deployed sensor nodes and stochastic event occurrences. We provide formulas to calculate the probabilities of event coverage and event missing. The numerical results show how these two probabilities change with the sensor and event densities. Moreover, simulations are conducted to validate the analytic method. This method can provide guidelines for determining the amount of sensor nodes to achieve a certain level of coverage in event-driven sensor networks.	event-driven programming;numerical analysis;randomness;sensor;simulation;software deployment	Huimin She;Zhonghai Lu;Axel Jantsch;Dian Zhou;Lirong Zheng	2011	2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140101	stochastic process;wireless sensor network;computer science;data mining;statistics;computer network	Mobile	14.263156826963627	85.64209906976114	184509

Energy harvesting—conversion of ambient energy into electrical energy—has emerged as a viable alternative to battery power. Indeed, the harvested energy mitigates the dependency on battery power and can be used to transmit data. However, unfair data delivery delay and energy expenditure among sensors remain important issues for such networks. We study performance of sensor networks with mobile sinks: a mobile sink moves towards the transmission range of the different static sensor nodes to collect their data. We propose and analyse a Markovian queueing system to study the impact of uncertainty in energy harvesting, energy expenditure, data acquisition and data transmission. In particular, the energy harvesting sensor node is described by a system with two queues, one queue corresponding to the battery and the other to the data buffer. We illustrate our approach by numerical examples which show that energy harvesting correlation considerably affects performance measures like the mean data delay and the effective data collection rate.	queueing theory;sensor node	Eline De Cuypere;Koen De Turck;Dieter Fiems	2018	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-017-0338-8	computer network;battery (electricity);real-time computing;wireless sensor network;data buffer;energy harvesting;computer science;queueing theory;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;sensor node	Robotics	12.377262537737387	82.20895010063408	184661

This paper proposes the energy-per-useful-bit (EPUB) metric for evaluating and comparing sensor network physical layers. EPUB includes the energy consumption of both the transmitter and receiver, and amortizes the energy consumption during the synchronization preamble over the number of data bits in the packet. Using EPUB, we compare six existing sensor network PHYs. Next, we optimize the PHY according to EPUB. We conclude that the EPUB of sensor network PHYs can be reduced by increasing data rate, lowering carrier frequency, and using simple modulation schemes such as OOK to reduce synchronization overhead	carrier frequency;carrier wave;epub;mathematical optimization;modulation;network packet;optimizing compiler;overhead (computing);phy (chip);transmitter;uncompressed video	Josephine Ammer;Jan M.

ef884681fd376fc4f4b53178f459240ebd18f924	wireless nocs using directional and substrate propagation antennas		Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoCs) are introduced to improve the performance for long distance communication within a chip. The on-chip antennas utilized in these WNoCs can be omni-directional or bi-directional, broadcasting to every receiving antenna or directional only in a specific pairing, respectively. There are positives and negatives for both types of antennas, although bi-directional antennas that do not cross paths have the added benefit of decreasing the possibility of interference. This work analyzes the performance of a WNoC with bi-directional antennas that uses an innovative substrate propagation technique recently introduced in literature. Antennas that use substrate propagation are capable of longer distance communication compared to typical on-chip antennas that use surface propagation. It is shown that by using the substrate propagation technique, wireless NoCs with minimal bi-directional antennas can reduce the number of wireless nodes by 66% while achieving similar performance of within ±5% of throughput.	bi-directional text;electronic data processing;fractal antenna;interference (communication);network on a chip;network packet;overhead (computing);packet switching;software propagation;throughput;tower array;wireless router	Vasil Pano;Yuqiao Liu;Isikcan Yilmaz;Ankit More;Baris Taskin;Kapil R.

We have considered a sensor network where numerous sensor nodes are spread in a grid like manner. These sensor nodes are capable of storing data and thus act as a separate datasets. The entire network of these sensors act as a set of distributed datasets. Each of these datasets has its local temporal dataset along with spatial data and the geographical coordinates of a given object or target. In this paper an algorithm is introduced that mines global temporal patterns from these datasets and results in the discovery of linear or nonlinear trajectories of moving objects under supervision. The main objective here is to perform in-network aggregation between the data contained in the various datasets to discover global spatio-temporal patterns; the main constraint is that there should be minimal communication among the participating nodes. We present the algorithm and analyze it in terms of the communication costs.

In C-RAN the fronthaul links between processing Base Band Units (BBUs) and Remote Antenna Units (RAUs) are conventionally based on fiber optic, although its deployment cost can be excessive. Radio over Copper (RoC) is an alternative/complementary technology for the fronthauling especially suitable for self-powered indoor deployment since it leverages on the pre-existing LAN cables. In this paper we consider a RoC C-RAN architecture as a low-cost bandwidth-efficient in-building solution to guarantee enhanced indoor coverage as required by 5G and beyond mobile systems. In particular, the focus of the paper is to gain insights into the optimal resource allocation to/from the RAU equipped with multiple antennas or multiple radios (e.g., 5G and WiFi) and the cable resources to fully exploit the capabilities of the twisted-pair cable over the last 50–100m. Numerical results validate the proposed method considering a realistic radio environment where the performance of indoor users are impaired by the interference of outdoor non-cooperating cells.	c-ran;centralized computing;interference (communication);next-generation network;numerical method;optical fiber;radio access network;requirement;shortest path problem;software deployment;twisted pair	Andrea Matera;Umberto Spagnolini	2017	2017 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)	10.1109/EuCNC.2017.7980784	software deployment;frequency-division multiplexing;local area network;radio access network;computer network;interference (wave propagation);resource allocation;bandwidth (signal processing);baseband;computer science	Mobile	23.390888463665984	86.58287977577348	185219

In the analysis we focus on LTE enhancement in the enterprise buildings. We discuss the unique cost features of DAS and Femto systems and highlight the importance of backhaul visibility in the cost analysis. For enterprise building solutions, we show the cost advantage of low-cost Femtocells over DAS in all scenarios regardless of coverage building size.

In many applications with wireless sensor networks, it is essential to understand how well an interested area is monitored (covered) by sensors. The traditional way of evaluating sensor coverage requires that every point in the field should be monitored and the sensor network should be connected to transmit messages to a processing center (sink). Such a requirement is too strong to be financially practical in many scenarios. In this study, we address another type of coverage problem, sweep coverage, when we utilize mobile nodes as supplementary in a sparse and probably disconnected sensor network. Different from previous coverage problem, we focus on retrieving data from dynamic Points of Interest (POIs), where a sensor network does not necessarily have fixed data rendezvous points as POIs. Instead, any sensor node within the network could become a POI. We first analyze the relationship among information access delay, information access probability, and the number of required mobile nodes. We then design a distributed algorithm based on a virtual 3D map of local gradient information to guide the movement of mobile nodes to achieve sweep coverage on dynamic POIs.

Wireless local loop (WLL) systems could also have been implemented in the '70s in U.S. rural areas, but were not. The cost justifications at that time for WLL were: For the Near Term — Using the radio link for WLL was the solution because the cost of laying a long wire cable to connect to a remote point was very high. For the Long Term — Using the wire link was the solution. Although the cost of laying a long wire cable was high in the beginning, adding more users along the wire link later on would drive the cost per user down as the years went by. Nevertheless , when the network layout reached its limit, WLL was the solution. For an Urban Situation — In New York City, laying additional wire cables was very costly. Therefore, WLL was the solution. In the meantime, in the '70s Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) was developed and could have been applied in wireless local loop systems to gain two advantages: • It could have been easier to acquire the spectrum from the FCC for WLL in the '70s. • WLL services could have been deployed first; then we could have gone into cellular markets using bundled services, that is, providing wireless local loop and cellular together using the same spectrum and operating the same wireless communication network. By taking this approach, both wireless local loop and cellular operations would have taken place in the '70s. Since telephone companies did not take advantage of this opportunity in the '70s, wireless operators were busy developing cellular systems in the '80s. Now, in the '90s, we are starting to look at the domestic and international markets for WLL. Since a WLL system is a fixed-to-fixed link system without the wireline connected, as shown in Fig. 1, the advantages are: • WLL can eliminate many problems and be cost inherent in many areas and many countries. • WLL can shorten the time to deploy a telephone network. • WLL can easily be moved around to accommodate new changes. • WLL is a quick start for startup telephone systems. The attributes of a WLL system (Fig. 1) are as follows: • Coverage increase: the path loss is based on free space loss. • Capacity increases: the required WLL carrierl-to-interference ratio, (C/I) WLL , is much lower …	in the beginning... was the command line;interference (communication);microwave;mobile phone;telecommunications network;wireless local loop	William C.

Frequency planning is becoming a key issue in the current scenario, with exceedingly high growth rates in many countries which compel operators to re-configure networks virtually on a monthly basis. Therefore, the search for smart techniques, which may considerably alleviate planning efforts (and associated costs) becomes extremely important for operators in a competitive market. Although reference is made particularly to a market leader (GSM and its offspring), the considerations reported are quite general, and can be applied to any TDMA/FDMA system. The article examines such well-known concepts as fractional loading, frequency hopping, and intelligent antennas in order to elaborate on them and show how they may impact conventional planning methodology and deprive complex dynamic channel allocation methods of any practical interest. The evaluation of this impact is extended to mixed cellular architectures, starting from a real case for the city of Munich and finally identifying some basic guidelines for cell planning.

Leading this shift are ultra-wideband (UWB) RF solutions that have demonstrated their potential for very high accuracy indoor localization.  This talk will explore how and why UWB technologies have driven many of the recent advancements in wireless localization. It will then explore how non-traditional UWB designs can solve two key upcoming challenges: scaling up in number (to thousands of localized devices) and down in power (to microwatt scale power budgets). Enabling these opportunities requires decoupling localization from data transmission and rethinking how we utilize the UWB channel from the ground up.	coupling (computer programming);image scaling;radio frequency;scalability;ultra-wideband	Pat Pannuto	2016		10.1145/2980115.2980124	electronic engineering;telecommunications;electrical engineering	Mobile	21.24990321131669	83.44092614461415	185557

Researchers often simulate their proposals rather than deploying high-cost test-beds or develop complex mathematical analysis. However, simulation results rely on physical layer assumptions, which are not usually accurate enough to capture the real behavior of a WSN. Such an issue can lead to mistaken or questionable results. Besides, most of the envisioned applications for WSNs consider the nodes to be at the ground level. However, there is a lack of radio propagation characterization and validation by measurements with nodes at ground level for actual sensor hardware. In this paper, we propose to use a low-computational cost, two slope, log-normal path-loss near ground outdoor channel model at 868 MHz in WSN simulations. The model is validated by extensive real hardware measurements obtained in different scenarios. In addition, accurate model parameters are provided. This model is compared with the well-known one slope path-loss model. We demonstrate that the two slope log-normal model provides more accurate WSN simulations at almost the same computational cost as the single slope one. It is also shown that the radio propagation characterization heavily depends on the adjusted model parameters for a target deployment scenario: The model parameters have a considerable impact on the average number of neighbors and on the network connectivity.	algorithmic efficiency;breakpoint;channel (communications);computation;computer simulation;experiment;height above ground level;interpretation (logic);near field communication;network performance;scientific literature;software deployment;software propagation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Alejandro S.

Sensed data are associated with a value, decaying in time. In this scenario, we address the problem of finding the path of the AUV so that the Value of Information (VoI) of the data delivered to a sink on the surface is maximized. We define a Greedy and Adaptive AUV Path-finding (GAAP) heuristic that drives the AUV to collect data from nodes depending on the VoI of their data. For benchmarking the performance of AUV path-finding heuristics, we define an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation that accurately models the considered scenario, deriving a path that drives the AUV to collect and deliver data with the maximum VoI. In our experiments GAAP consistently delivers more than 80 percent of the theoretical maximum VoI determined by the ILP model. We also compare the performance of GAAP with that of other strategies for driving the AUV among sensing nodes, namely, random paths, TSP-based paths and a “lawn mower”-like strategy. Our results show that GAAP always outperforms every other heuristic in terms of delivered VoI, also obtaining higher energy efficiency.	acoustic cryptanalysis;autonomous robot;experiment;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;linear programming;mathematical model;modal logic;pathfinding;randomness;robotic lawn mower	Petrika Gjanci;Chiara Petrioli;Stefano Basagni;Cynthia A.

VLC is therefore a good match for indoor setups that need to support a large number of nodes with moderate bandwidth requirements. But designing a VLC system for worst-case operating conditions is more restrictive than necessary. This paper presents a software-based VLC system that adapts link sensitivity and capacity to match environment constraints. Compared to a fixed sensing scheme, an adaptive scheme increases channel capacity by almost an order of magnitude under favorable conditions or significantly extends the communication range. This adaptive link sensitivity allows communication even without a direct line of sight between two devices, opening new opportunities to use VLC systems in novel scenarios involving different types of embedded devices -- ranging from network nodes that only include a single Light Emitting Diode (LED), such as consumer electronics, toys, and wearables, to LED light bulbs that run Linux and provide an indoor VLC communication fabric.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;channel capacity;diode;embedded system;internet backbone;led lamp;line-of-sight (missile);linux;mobile device;oled;phy (chip);requirement;toys;vlc media player;wearable technology	Stefan Schmid;Benjamin von Deschwanden;Stefan Mangold;Thomas R.

Without consideration of importance of image, camera sensors can capture images of the intruder crossing the barrier but cannot guarantee that the captured images are the important portion of the intruder. Without consideration of breadth of image, image identification may be difficult. If camera sensors have rotation capability, how to select effective camera sensors to reduce the number of camera sensors required for barrier construction is another important issue. In this paper, for WVSNs consisting of camera sensors with and without rotation capability, we will respectively propose an algorithm to find a barrier with encircled coverage capability and   β     β        breadth. The proposed algorithms ensure that if any intruder crosses the barrier, important portions of the intruder can be clearly captured. Finally, the success rate of the proposed algorithms in three camera sensor distribution settings, including Uniform distribution, Poisson distribution and Gaussian distribution, will be evaluated through simulations.

Especially for team sports such as footfall and rugby, how to reliably collect vital data from many players spread in a large field is a key issue. In our previous work [1], we developed a real-time vital data collection system in which a wireless sensor node attached at the waist position of each player broadcasts packets to data collection nodes placed around a football field. Our field experiments showed that, (1) for the 920 MHz band, the packet success rate can be almost 1.0 when using 3 or 4 data collection nodes, whereas for the 2.4 GHz band, the packet success rate is less than 0.85 even when using 6 data collection nodes, and (2) the suitable antenna height of the data collection node is 2 meters. In this paper, we discuss a suitable packet forwarding method from the data collection nodes to a sink node at a technical trainer or a coach. By field experiments, we compare the packet error rate between a single-hop packet forwarding in the 920 MHz band and a multi-hop packet forwarding in the 2.4 GHz band. Furthermore, we show some interesting events on the packet error rates for different player positions such as forward, midfielder, defender and goalkeeper.	bit error rate;experiment;network packet;performance evaluation;real-time clock;real-time transcription;sensor node;wrapper function	Shinsuke Hara;Kouhei Tezuka;Tetsuo Tsujioka;Hajime Nakamura;Takashi Kawabata;Kenji Watanabe;Masanao Ise;Noa Arime;Hiroyuki Okuhata	2014	2014 8th International Symposium on Medical Information and Communication Technology (ISMICT)	10.1109/ISMICT.2014.6825203	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;packet forwarding;packet switch;computer security	Mobile	18.80839124500583	77.82430710823671	186195

To analyze energy consumption and to predict a lifetime of a network, a comprehensive energy model based on commercial products is necessary. Therefore, we have focused on the analysis of energy consumption during RF communication with particular 802.15.4 compliant nodes. We have designed experimental testbed and explored the scenario of node association and data transmission. For the measurement we used IRIS sensor nodes with 802.15.4/Zigbee protocol stack and shunt connection. The results show that energy consumption cannot be calculated only from datasheet values of current drain and length of a packet but intervals of listening and waiting between transmissions play important role as well.	datasheet;network packet;protocol stack;radio frequency;sensor;software deployment;testbed	Patrik Moravek;Dan Komosny;Milan Simek;Lubomir Mraz	2011	2011 34th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)	10.1109/TSP.2011.6043770	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;quantum mechanics;computer network	Mobile	11.68146435951781	84.59124064666955	186512
1c2805215bf8074434c85931db59b884f8bd5b4c	an adaptive cross-layer approach for energy-efficient and qos-constrained multimedia transmission over wireless channels		The main goal of research and industrial work in wireless telecommunications has been to maximize performance or reduce energy consumption to lengthen the battery life of mobile devices. The challenge in the next future is to make green telecommunications networks, and specifically wireless devices that present the highest energy consumption coefficient per bit transmitted among all the networking devices. However, making a network device green can cause performance deterioration. The target of this paper is to propose a cross-layer approach for the transmission of multiplexed rate-controlled multimedia streams over wireless channels. The proposed approach is adaptive in both the video sources and the wireless transmitter. To this purpose this paper proposes an Energy-efficient ARQ protocol with five possible transmission laws, in order to exploit the correlation of the wireless channel behavior. In addition, in order to compensate transmission bandwidth reduction due to the energy saving policies, a source Rate Controller is introduced. Finally, using an analytical model of the system, the transmission laws are compared, and some guidelines are provided to choose one of them and design its parameters.	quality of service	Alfio Lombardo;Carla Panarello;Giovanni Schembra	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-37977-2_5	wi-fi array;wireless multimedia extensions;computer network	Embedded	11.400182492155615	86.78163919681379	186672

In this article, we propose a distributed range-based localization algorithm for wireless sensor network. The algorithm is mainly based on an adaptively local circular searching area where each unknown sensor must find inside a position that minimizes the error distance with neighboring sensors using a local function. The new position of a sensor is broadcast to neighboring sensors allowing collaboratively to other sensors re-estimate their new positions. The iterative process is repeated until a stopping criterion is reached. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, and results indicate that the approach overcomes the other methods in both accuracy and time of convergence.	local search (optimization);search algorithm	Oscar Osvaldo Saldaña Hernández;Juan Cota-Ruiz;Rafael González-Landaeta;Ernesto Sifuentes	2016	IJDSN	10.1177/1550147716669624	wireless sensor network;machine learning;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;visual sensor network	Mobile	15.529696703155851	75.75909777797041	186695

Typical architectures using DNP3 have a two level hierarchy, where a specialized data aggregator receives observed state from devices within a local region, and the control center collects the aggregated state from the data aggregator. The DNP3 communications are asynchronous across the two levels; this leads to the possibility of completely filling a data aggregator's buffer of pending events, when a compromised relay sends overly many (false) events to the data aggregator. This paper investigates the attack by implementing the attack using real SCADA system hardware and software. A Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) model is developed for understanding conditions under which the attack is successful and effective. The model is validated by a Möbius simulation model and data collected on a real SCADA testbed.	dnp3;data aggregation;markov chain;real-time computing;relay;scanline rendering;simulation;testbed	Dong Jin;David M.

In this paper, we designed an optimized barrier coverage and an energy-efficient clustering algorithm for forming Vonoroi-based Wireless Sensor Networks(WSN) in which we proposed a mobile target tracking scheme (CTT&MAV) that takes full advantage of Voronoi-diagram boundary to improve detectability. Simulations verified that CTT&MAV outperforms random walk, random waypoint, random direction and Gauss-Markov in terms of both the average hop distance that the mobile target moved before being detected and lower sensor death rate. Moreover, we demonstrate that our results are robust as realistic sensing models and also validate our observations through extensive simulations.

We measure the delay to a given node in the number of hops data travels from the source to that node, and our objective in this paper is to construct an energy-efficient broadcast tree that has a maximum depth Delta, where Delta; represents the end-to-end hop constraint in the network. We characterize the optimal solution to a closely related problem in massively dense networks using a dynamic programming formulation. We prove that the optimal solution can be obtained by an algorithm of polynomial time complexity O(Delta2). The solution to the dynamic program indicates that there is a single optimal policy applicable to all massively dense networks. Elaborating on the insights provided by the structure of the problem in massively dense networks, we design an algorithm for finding a solution to the hop constrained minimum power broadcasting problem in general networks. By extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed optimization-based algorithm generates broadcast trees within 20% of optimality for general dense networks.	algorithm;constrained optimization;dynamic programming;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);hop;mathematical optimization;simulation;time complexity	Kerem Bülbül;Özgür Erçetin;Tonguç Ünlüyurt	2009	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2008.105	wireless ad hoc network;multicast;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	12.866133503821812	85.019126843132	187925

Ordering based energy efficient classification in sensor networks has shown significant savings in transmissions. The study presented in this paper improves upon the earlier work on ordered classification by extending the classification scheme to nonlinear kernel methods and introducing ordering based Neyman-Pearson (NP) classification. Given a specified level α ∈(0, 1), NP criterion ensures to keep a false alarm rate no greater than α while minimizing the miss rate. This study demonstrates transmissions can be saved, without degradation in error probability, using an ordering based NP-classification approach. The average number of transmissions saved is lower bounded by a quantity proportional to the number of sensors employed.	comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;elegant degradation;kernel method;nonlinear system;pearson hashing;sensor	Selcem Artan;Yusuf Artan	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5495815	wireless sensor network;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	Embedded	16.69029271287383	79.54855831955572	188006

Also, these devices can be equipped with a camera and then deployed in hostile environments. A key characteristic of these devices is that they can communicate wirelessly and form an ad-hoc, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Devices in a WSN then collaboratively monitor environment factors or objects, and forward data back to one or more central nodes. A key challenge in WSN is ensuring nodes operate in the order of months as they have limited energy resource, and it is impractical to replace their batteries due to their large numbers, and they may be deployed in inaccessible terrains. Hence, it is critical that these devices or nodes employ energy efficient protocols. To this end, we present PairWise, a novel, low power, time division multiple access (TDMA) based protocol for use in WSNs. PairWise is easily deployable in large scale WSNs as nodes are not synchronized globally. Instead, they synchronize and establish a pair of channels with each of their neighbors independently. Each channel hops pseudo randomly in time according to a seed and maximum rendezvous period (MRP). Hence, nodes using PairWise experience very minimal to no collision during communications. Apart from that, higher layer protocols are able to control the MRP of each channel such that a node's duty cycle matches the observed traffic load. We have implemented PairWise in the ns-2 simulator, and compared it to Sensor Medium Access Control (S-MAC) and a TDMA MAC. Our results show PairWise to have very low power consumption whilst ensuring packets have minimal delays. Moreover, PairWise has a high goodput with increasing node density, where goodput is defined as the number of packets that are transmitted by each node pair successfully over a given total number of packets.	access control;control knob;duty cycle;embedded system;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;goodput;hoc (programming language);media redundancy protocol;multi-function printer;network packet;pseudorandomness;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;randomness;schedule (computer science);while	Kwan-Wu Chin	2009	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2009.5373748	radio-frequency identification;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;efficient energy use;computer network	Mobile	10.841279375243593	82.21363045342586	188390

In a standard sleep mode operation with a binary exponential algorithm, a mobile station (MS) can begin a wake period if it is aware of the existence of its own downlink packets during a listening interval. In a light traffic environment, this conventional standard operation consumes a considerable amount of power to switch modes (sleep/listen/wake). To solve this problem, in this paper, a new power saving scheme based on Joint Control of Buffer-threshold and Timer (JCBT) is proposed. To see the performance behavior of the JCBT scheme, we consider the total power consumption per unit time and the average packet transfer delay as performance measures.

We focus on this area and propose a method to reduce WLAN device power consumption, particularly on WiFi according to standard 802.11. The proposed method defines a new PHY state that consumes less power than the active states but can switch back fast to an active state. The PHY switches to this state during part of an overheard packet. No change is required to the WLAN protocol or any other device in the network, allowing for full compatibility with the existing devices. The performance analysis is done both analytically and by simulation.

Under the prescribed cost constraints, we analyze such heterogeneous deployments both mathematically and through simulations, and show how they impact the coverage aging process of a sensor network, i.e., how it degrades over time as some nodes become energy-depleted. We derive expressions for the heterogeneous mixture of devices that optimizes the lifetime sensing coverage in a single-hop direct communication model. We then investigate a multi-hop communication model through simulations, and examine the impact of heterogeneity on lifetime sensing coverage and coverage aging both with and without data aggregation. Our results show that using an optimal mixture of many inexpensive low-capability devices and some expensive high-capability devices can significantly extend the duration of a network's sensing performance.	clozure cl;data aggregation;depletion region;load balancing (computing);requirement;sensor;simulation;software deployment	Jae-Joon Lee;Bhaskar Krishnamachari;C.-C.

839a3f6db30920fdd6be577c78dfdb89829262f7	dare: data recovery through application layer coding for lorawan		Internet of Things (IoT) solutions are increasingly being deployed for smart applications. To provide good communication for the increasing number of smart applications, there is a need for low cost and long range Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies. LoRaWAN is an energy efficient and inexpensive LPWAN solution that is rapidly being adopted all around the world. However, LoRaWAN does not guarantee reliable communication in its basic configuration. Transmitted frames can be lost due to the channel effects and mobility of the end-devices. In this study, we perform extensive measurements on a new LoRaWAN network to characterise spatial and temporal properties of the LoRaWAN channel. The empirical outage probability for the farthest measured distance from the closest gateway of 7.5 km in our deployment is as low as 0.004, but the frame loss measured at this distance was up to 70%. Furthermore, we show that burstiness in frame loss can be expected for both mobile and stationary scenarios. Frame loss results in data loss, since in the basic configuration frames are only transmitted once. To reduce data loss in LoRaWAN, we design a novel coding scheme for data recovery called DaRe, which extends frames with redundant information that is calculated from the data from previous frames. DaRe combines techniques from convolutional codes and fountain codes. We develop an implementation for DaRe and show that 99% of the data can be recovered with a code rate of 1/2 for up to 40% frame loss. Compared to repetition coding DaRe provides 21% more data recovery, and can save up to 42% energy consumption on transmission for 10 byte data units. DaRe also provides better resilience to bursty frame loss. This study provides useful results to both LoRaWAN network operators as well as developers of LoRaWAN applications. Network operators can use the characterisation results to identify possible weaknesses in the network, and application developers are offered a tool to prevent possible data loss.	byte;code rate;convolutional code;data recovery;downtime;fountain code;internet of things;jumbo frame;repetition code;smart pascal;software deployment;stationary process	P.

K-coverage is necessary for many applications, such as intrusion detection, data gathering, and object tracking. It is also desirable in situations where a stronger environmental monitoring capability is desired, such as military applications. In this paper, we study the problem of k-coverage in deterministic homogeneous deployments of sensors. We examine the three regular sensor deployments - triangular, square and hexagonal deployments - for k-coverage of the deployment area, for k ≥ 1. We compare the three regular deployments in terms of sensor density. For each deployment, we compute an upper bound and a lower bound on the optimal distance of sensors from each other that ensure k-coverage of the area. We present the results for each k from 1 to 20 and show that the required number of sensors to k-cover the area using uniform random deployment is approximately 3-10 times higher than regular deployments.	intrusion detection system;sensor;software deployment	Parvin Asadzadeh Birjandi;Lars Kulik;Egemen Tanin	2013	2013 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing	10.1109/ISSNIP.2013.6529844	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer security	Mobile	13.578804647622835	78.68479949150621	189203

In this study, we propose a distributed cone based tracking algorithm for a target that can move with highly dynamic kinematics along linear and nonlinear trajectories. The algorithm provides wakening of a group of nodes in a cone shaped region along the trajectory of the target and particle filtering is used in the prediction of the next state of the target to decrease the target missing ratios. Algorithm used is adaptive in that the shape of the cone is determined dynamically in accordance with the target kinematics. We compared our algorithm with traditional tracking approaches, a recent tracking algorithm (Semi-Dynamic Clustering (SDC)) and other tracking algorithms that we have previously proposed. Simulation results show that, in terms of target missing ratios, our algorithm is superior to all of these algorithms. Secondly, lower target missing ratios lead to less frequent execution of recovery mechanisms which in turn results in lower energy consumptions.	algorithm;approximation;experiment;imperative programming;kalman filter;lookahead carry unit;nonlinear system;particle filter;simulation;smart data compression;tracking system	Aysegul Alaybeyoglu;Kayhan Erciyes;Aylin Kantarci	2013	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2013.052348	computer vision;simulation;wireless sensor network;particle filter;computer science	Vision	12.02172346706361	77.19520620585655	189669
31da52822df5eb66646ac23731bc61d1d89fa860	evolutionary algorithm optimized centralized offline localization and mapping		Effective exploration of hardly accessible unknown environments impacts many applications such as monitoring underground infrastructure, exploration of natural resources, e.g. oil and gas, and in-vivo exploration for diagnostic purposes. In many of these scenarios, the environment is only accessible by miniaturized agents (mm-sized or less). Consequently, miniature autonomous sensory agents (MASA) can play an imperative role. However, MASA present wide range of challenges caused by their scaled-down size. Firstly, these agents are strongly limited in energy, consequently, special design constraints must be set. Secondly, these agents are usually kinetically passive thus, the widely used Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques can not be used. As a result, a new problem definition is needed, where agents’ motion is not controlled and, consequently, localization and mapping is conducted offline. In this paper, we formally introduce what we dub as the Centralized Offline Localization And Mapping (COLAM) problem, highlighting its objectives and constraints. Furthermore, we illustrate a comprehensive solution to this problem using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) based framework to optimize the agents’ resources and conduct adequate localization and mapping. Finally, we apply this solution on two different environments each with different physical properties.	autonomous robot;centralized computing;evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;imperative programming;internationalization and localization;jamie wilkinson;numerical analysis;online and offline;reflection mapping;simultaneous localization and mapping;sorting;video-in video-out	Stephan Schlupkothen;Ahmed Hallawa;Gerd Ascheid	2018	2018 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2018.8390410	wireless sensor network;genetic algorithm;evolutionary algorithm;simultaneous localization and mapping;computer science;wireless ad hoc network;distributed computing;sorting	Robotics	11.672804515902152	76.50348617762754	189691

The interconnection of such nano-devices with traditional wireless networks and ultimately the Internet enables a new networking paradigm known as the Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT). Despite their promising applications, nano-devices have constrained power, energy, and computation capabilities along with very limited memory on board, which may only be able to hold one packet at once and, thus, requires packets to be delivered before certain hard deadlines. Toward this goal, a fully-distributed computation-light provably-correct scheduling/MAC protocol is introduced for bufferless nano-devices, which can maximize the network throughput, while achieving perpetual operation. More specifically, the proposed scheduling algorithm allows every nano-device to make optimal transmission decisions locally based on its incoming traffic rate, virtual debts, and channel sensing results. It is proven that the proposed algorithm is timely throughput optimal in the sense that it can guarantee reliable data delivery before deadlines as long as the incoming traffic rates are within the derived maximum network capacity region. This feature not only can lead to high network throughput for the IoNT, but also guarantees that the memory of each device is empty before the next packet arrives, thus addressing the fundamental challenge imposed by the extremely limited memory of nano-devices. In addition, the optimal deadline is derived, which guarantees that all the nano-devices can achieve perpetual communications by jointly considering the energy consumption of communications over the terahertz channel and energy harvesting based on piezoelectric nano-generators.	algorithm;computation;correctness (computer science);distributed computing;gnu nano;interconnection;internet;network packet;piezoelectricity;programming paradigm;scheduling (computing);throughput	Nadine Akkari Adra;Pu Wang;Josep Miquel Jornet;Etimad A.

Under a probabilistic sensor detection model, a sensor node has ability to detect its neighbors' location and local uniformity. Coverage and uniformity oriented virtual forces are considered, and then a mobile node's local optimal location can be estimated for maximum coverage area and better uniformity. Simulation results show that HLVFA has better performances than improved VFA.	algorithm;circuit complexity;performance;sensor node;simulation;software deployment	Cheng-Chih Yang;Jyh-Horng Wen	2013	2013 Seventh International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/IMIS.2013.109	wireless sensor network;computer science;probability;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	13.206405001432811	76.07157333402832	189820

In order to implement the next generation of data centers, new challenges must be overcome. These include reducing the energy consumption, increasing the data rates, reducing the communication latency, increasing the flexibility and scalability, and reducing the maintenance time and cost. One promising way for meeting these challenges is to employ multichannel optical wireless communication as part of the data center hybrid communication network. In this paper, we analyze three technologies that could be used in this context: MIMO (Multiple-in-Multipleout), multiplexing through orbital angular momentum of light, and direct modulation through the large number of modes associated with orbital angular momentum. Our results indicate that these technologies could provide an innovative and flexible means of meeting the challenges of the next generation of data centers.	angular momentum operator;angularjs;channel capacity;data center;mimo;modulation;molecular orbital;multiplexing;next-generation network;object access method;optical wireless;polarization (waves);requirement;scalability;software propagation;telecommunications network;transmitter	Judy Kupferman;Shlomi Arnon	2017	Journal of Communications and Information Networks	10.1007/s41650-017-0040-8	mimo;latency (engineering);telecommunications network;optical wireless;orbital angular momentum of light;angular momentum;data center;computer network;multiplexing;computer science	Networks	22.5814201591507	86.3787811881349	189917

In addition, cloud radio access network (C-RAN) architectures are considered instrumental to fully exploit the capabilities of future 5G RANs. However, RAN centralization imposes stringent requirements on the transport network, which today are addressed with purpose-specific and expensive fronthaul links. As the demands on future access networks rise, so will the challenges in the fronthaul and backhaul segments. It is hence of fundamental importance to consider the design of transport networks alongside the definition of future access technologies to avoid the transport becoming a bottleneck. Therefore, we analyze in this work the impact that future RAN technologies will have on the transport network and on the design of the next generation fronthaul interface. To understand the especially important impact of varying user traffic, we utilize measurements from a real-world 4G network and, taking target 5G performance figures into account, extrapolate its statistics to a 5G scenario. With this, we derive both per-cell and aggregated data rate requirements for 5G transport networks. In addition, we show that the effect of statistical multiplexing is an important factor to reduce transport network capacity requirements and costs. Based on our investigations, we provide guidelines for the development of the 5G transport network architecture.	backhaul (telecommunications);c-ran;common public radio interface;extrapolation;mimo;multiplexing;network architecture;network packet;next-generation network;radio access network;real life;requirement;software-defined networking;uncompressed video;x86	Jens Bartelt;Nikola Vucic;Daniel Camps-Mur;Eduard Garcia Villegas;Ilker Demirkol;Albrecht J.

Although various localization algorithms have been proposed recently, most of them require nodes be equipped with range-determining hardware to obtain distance information. In this paper, we propose a concentric anchor-beacons (CAB) localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks. CAB is a range-free approach and uses a small number of anchor nodes. Each anchor emits beacons at different power levels. From the information received by each beacon heard, nodes determine which annular ring they are located within each anchor. Each node uses the approximated center of intersection of the rings as its position estimate. Simulation results show that the estimation error reduces by half when anchors transmit beacons at two different power levels instead of at a single level. CAB also gives a lower estimation error than other range-free localization schemes (e.g., Centroid, APIT) when the anchor-to-node range ratio is less than four.	approximation algorithm;broadcast television systems;computation;information exchange;overhead (computing);sensor node;simulation;testbed	Vijayanth Vivekanandan;Vincent W.

Such low-duty-cycle operation leads to orders of magnitude longer communication delays in comparison with traditional always-active networks, imposing a new challenge in many time-sensitive sensor network applications (e.g., tracking and alert). In this paper, we introduce novel solutions for bounding sink-to-node communications in energy-harvesting sensor networks. We first present an optimal solution for the sink-to-one case and its distributed implementation. For the sink-to-many case, we theoretically prove its NP-Hardness and in approximability property, followed by an efficient heuristic solution. We have evaluated our design with both extensive simulation and a TinyOS/Mote based implementation. Compared with an improved version of a state-of-the-art design, our delay maintenance design effectively provides E2E delay guarantees while consuming as much as 60% less energy.	active networking;approximation algorithm;distributed algorithm;duty cycle;experiment;heuristic;ibm notes;microsoft research;np-hardness;sensor node;simulation;testbed;tinyos	Yu Gu;Tian He	2010	2010 IEEE 30th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	10.1109/ICDCS.2010.41	maintenance engineering;embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	11.658742156335322	81.34084996060406	190316

From the perspective of system-level wireless emulation, average link SNR is the dominant factor in the performance of a wireless link. Thus, this work seeks to develop a systematic link SNR mapping method that replicates real-world link SNRs on an indoor testbed. The challenge is to optimize the nodes' spatial configuration and transmission powers to overcome the inherent propagation differences, as expressed in terms of pathloss exponents and environmental shadowing, between the real world and a given testbed. To avoid the technical difficulty of """"forward mapping"""" from the real world to the testbed, we have developed a reverse mapping method to turn a testbed configuration with given link SNRs into a corresponding real-world configuration. By inducing the dB link gain differences between the testbed and the real world distance-dependent path loss to have a Gaussian distribution, a close approximation to real-world log-normal shadow fading is achieved.

To reduce the cost of data communications in smart grid, in this paper, we assume that cognitive radio technique is used to transmit the meter data from smart meters to the data aggregator unit (DAU). Smart meters are deployed in the houses representing consumption nodes to measure and report power demand. Also, smart meters are used by generators of the community renewable power generation facility (CRPGF) which is one of the distributed energy resources (DERs), to collect and estimate renewable power production capacity. However, the transmission of meter data must be performed within a limited period of time (i.e., deadline). By using absorbing Markov chain, we analyze the average packet loss probability of meter data, and study the impact of packet loss on the power supply cost optimization made by the meter data management system (MDMS).	absorbing markov chain;cognitive radio;data aggregation;data hub;embedded system;emoticon;mathematical optimization;network packet;pa degree;performance evaluation;power supply;scheduling (computing);smart meter;transmitter	Qiumin Dong;Dusit Niyato;Ping Wang	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214080	telecommunications;computer science;smart grid;markov process;statistics	Mobile	14.874922188301198	82.09986277237539	190543

The problem is NP-hard and can be solved approximately using best known centralized set cover algorithms. However, either distributed or localized solutions for this problem are much more realistic and useful in practice. Different distributed and a few local algorithms are known in the literature. In this paper, we propose a cellular automaton based local algorithm for the redundant readers elimination optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cellular automaton based algorithm (that is, a strictly local algorithm) to solve this problem. We compare the performance of our algorithm with other local algorithms and establish that our algorithm gives much better results. We also compare our algorithm with the best known centralized approximation algorithm and find very competitive results even though our algorithm is a local one.	approximation algorithm;cellular automaton;centralized computing;internationalization and localization;local algorithm;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;radio-frequency identification;scheduling (computing);set cover problem;simulation	Nafiul Rashid;Salimur Choudhury;Kai Salomaa	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7510604	radio-frequency identification;wireless sensor network;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;distributed computing;automaton;approximation algorithm	EDA	13.62621546800734	79.87596176394683	191084

Many research works have proposed solving this problem by using wireless communication systems based on radiofrequency. Nevertheless, those approaches usually deliver an accuracy of up to two metres, since they are hindered by multipath propagation. On the other hand, in the last few years, the increasing use of light-emitting diodes in illumination systems has provided the emergence of Visible Light Communication technologies, in which data communication is performed by transmitting through the visible band of the electromagnetic spectrum. This brings a brand new approach to high accuracy indoor positioning because this kind of network is not affected by electromagnetic interferences and the received optical power is more stable than radio signals. Our research focus on to propose a fingerprinting indoor positioning estimation system based on neural networks to predict the device position in a 3D environment. Neural networks are an effective classification and predictive method. The localization system is built using a dataset of received signal strength coming from a grid of different points. From the these values, the position in Cartesian coordinates ( x , y , z ) is estimated. The use of three neural networks is proposed in this work, where each network is responsible for estimating the position by each axis. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system leads to substantial improvements to accuracy over the widely-used traditional fingerprinting methods, yielding an accuracy above 99% and an average error distance of 0.4 mm.	apache axis;artificial neural network;axis vertebra;cartesian closed category;caudal part of ventral lateral nucleus;computational complexity theory;diode;discrete system;discretization;electromagnetic spectrum;emergence;estimated;experiment;fingerprint (computing);illumination (image);immunoglobulin kappa-chains;indoor positioning system;lightheadedness;location awareness;manuscripts;mobile device;multipath propagation;neural network simulation;neural tube defects;ninety nine;rss;reflection (computer graphics);robustness (computer science);silo (dataset);software propagation;transmitter;vlc media player;weight;anatomical layer;radiofrequency	David Sánchez-Rodríguez;Miguel A.

Cognitive radio is proposed to overcome the problem of low spectrum utilisation by offering large bandwidth to mobile users via the dynamic spectrum access techniques and heterogeneous wireless architectures. In fact, it provides for users the ability to interact with the RF environment and perfectly adapt the transmission parameters. However, the CR networks must overcome some challenges such as the channel fluctuations, the available frequencies and the various QoS requirements of different applications. Spectrum management presents a promising solution for the realisation of these challenges. This paper surveys recent research advances linked to cognitive radios and open research issues in spectrum management. Existing works in the spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing and spectrum decision are reviewed and discussed in detail. For each issue, we highlight the key challenges of open research.

It enables a dynamic and large-scale phenomena monitoring just by exploring the variety of technologies which have been embedded in modern cars. However, VCS applications might generate a huge amount of data traffic between vehicles and the remote monitoring center, which tends to overload the LTE networks. In this paper, we describe and analyze a gEo-clUstering approaCh for Lte vehIcular crowDsEnsing dAta offloadiNg (EUCLIDEAN). It takes advantage of opportunistic vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to support the VCS data upload process, preserving, as much as possible, the cellular network resources. In general, it is shown from the presented results that our proposal is a feasible and an effective scheme to reduce up to 92.98% of the global demand for LTE transmissions while performing vehicle-based sensing tasks in urban areas. The most encouraging results were perceived mainly under high-density conditions (i.e., above 125 vehicles/km2), where our solution provides the best benefits in terms of cellular network data offloading.	cluster analysis;compaq lte;coupled cluster;cylinder-head-sector;embedded system;euclidean distance;hoc (programming language);imperative programming;max;overhead (computing);region of interest;simulation;stationary process;tcp offload engine;telecommunications link;transmitter;upload;vehicle-to-vehicle;veritas cluster server	Douglas F.

The networks' ability to locate and track an object is directed linked to the nodes' ability to locate themselves. Consequently, localization systems are essential for target tracking applications. In addition, sensor networks are often deployed in remote or hostile environments. Therefore, density control algorithms are used to increase network lifetime while maintaining its sensing capabilities. In this work, we analyze the impact of localization algorithms (RPE and DPE) and density control algorithms (GAF, A3 and OGDC) on target tracking applications. We adapt the density control algorithms to address the k-coverage problem. In addition, we analyze the impact of network density, residual integration with density control, and k-coverage on both target tracking accuracy and network lifetime. Our results show that DPE is a better choice for target tracking applications than RPE. Moreover, among the evaluated density control algorithms, OGDC is the best option among the three. Although the choice of the density control algorithm has little impact on the tracking precision, OGDC outperforms GAF and A3 in terms of tracking time.	algorithm;sensor;establishment and maintenance of localization	Andre N.

93574827efa9dddf11d290cc55dbde6aea714453	a simple model of mtc in smart factories		In this paper we develop a simple, yet accurate, performance model to understand if and how evolutions of traditional cellular network protocols can be exploited to allow large numbers of devices to gain control of transmission resources in smart factory radio access networks. The model results shed light on the applicability of evolved access procedures and help understand how many devices can be served per base station. In addition, considering the simultaneous presence of different traffic classes, we investigate the effectiveness of prioritised access, exploiting access class barring techniques. Our model shows that, even with the sub-millisecond time slots foreseen in LTE Advanced Pro and 5G, a base station can accommodate at most few thousand devices to guarantee access latencies below 100 ms with high transmission success probabilities. This calls for a rethinking of wireless access strategies to avoid ultra-dense cell deployments within smart factory infrastructures.	access network;algorithm;coexist (image);communications protocol;compaq lte;industry 4.0;mission critical;random access;real-time clock;telecommunications link	Paolo Castagno;Vincenzo Mancuso;Matteo Sereno;Marco Ajmone Marsan	2018	IEEE INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8485942	lte advanced;automatic gain control;distributed computing;computer network;computer science;internet of things;access network;wireless;base station;cellular network	Mobile	21.863746550387823	88.47943519014059	191659

A collaborative and compressed mobile sensing algorithm is proposed for distributed robotic networks to build scalar field maps. In order to move in the sensing field and to avoid collision with obstacles and with each other, a control law is embedded into the robots. At a sampling time, each robot senses and adds data within its sensing range and collaborates to the others by exchanging data with its neighbors. A compressed sensing (CS) measurement created is a sum of scalar values collecting by a connected group of robots. A certain number of CS measurements is required at each robot to reconstruct all sensory readings from points of interest visited by the group of robots. The method reduces significantly data traffic among robots. We further analyze and formulate power consumption for the robots, and suggest some optimal cases for the robot to consume the least power.		Minh Tuan Nguyen;Hung Manh La;Keith A.

1afd578f821cf923924c5ca273f1d75461dda984	flow demands oriented node placement in multi-hop wireless networks		In multi-hop wireless networks, flow demands mean that some nodes have routing demands of transmitting their data to other nodes with a certain level of transmission rate. When a set of nodes have been deployed with flow demands, it is worth to know how to construct paths to satisfy these flow demands with nodes placed as few as possible. In this paper, we study this flow demands oriented node placement problem that has not been addressed before. In particular, we divide and conquer the problem by three steps: calculating the maximal flow for single routing demand, calculating the maximal flow for multiple routing demands, and finding the minimal number of nodes for multiple routing demands with flow requirement. During the above solving procedure, we prove that the second and third step are NP-hard and propose two algorithms that have polynomial-time complexity. The proposed algorithms are evaluated under practical scenarios. The experiments show that the proposed algorithms can achieve satisfactory results on both flow demands and total number of wireless nodes.	algorithm;asynchronous system;data aggregation;experiment;hop;maximal set;maximum flow problem;np-hardness;network packet;return-oriented programming;routing;time complexity;transmitter	Zimu Yuan	2015	CoRR		mathematical optimization;real-time computing;flow network;multi-commodity flow problem;computer science;distributed computing	Mobile	11.751066054851215	79.98560865941141	192262

Directional sensors are characterized by three important parameters: sensing range, field of view and orientation. These parameters have significant impact on the overall cost of the directional sensor network. In this paper, we present an integer linear programming formulation for the directional sensor placement problem in which the goal is to minimize the network cost by appropriately choosing the values of the above parameters for each sensor to be installed in the sensor field.

It serves marine, airborne, and terrestrial users, both military and civilian. Specifically, GPS includes the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) which provides civilian users with 100 meter accuracy, and it serves military users with the Precise Positioning Service (PPS) which provides 20-m accuracy. Both of these services are available worldwide with no requirement for a local reference station. In contrast, differential operation of GPS provides 2to 10-m accuracy to users within 1000 km of a fixed GPS reference receiver. Finally, carrier phase comparisons can be used to provide centimeter accuracy to users within 10 km and potentially within 100 km of a reference receiver. This advanced tutorial will describe the GPS signals, the various measurements made by the GPS receivers, and estimate the achievable accuracies. It will not dwell on those aspects of GPS which are well known to those skilled in the radio communications art, such as spread-spectrum or code division multiple access. Rather, it will focus on topics which are more unique to radio navigation or GPS. These include code-carrier divergence, codeless tracking, carrier aiding, and narrow correlator spacing.	airborne ranger;gps signals;global positioning system;ibm 1401 symbolic programming system;terrestrial television	Per K.

In this work, we present MAWS (Mobile Access of Wide-Spectrum Networks), the first scheme designed for mobile clients to evaluate and select both APs and spectral bands in wide-spectrum networks. Because of the potentially vast number of spectrum and AP options, scanning may be prohibitive. Consequently, our key technique is for clients to infer channel quality and spectral usage for their current location and bands using limited measurements collected in other bands and at other locations. We experimentally evaluate MAWS via a widespectrum network that we deploy, a testbed providing access to four bands at 700 MHz, 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. To the best of our knowledge, the spectrum of these bands is the widest to be spanned to date by a single operational access network. A key finding of our evaluation is that under a diverse set of operating conditions, mobile clients can accurately predict their performance without a direct measurement at their current location and spectral bands.	access network;experiment;image scanner;software deployment;stellar classification;testbed;throughput	Anastasios Giannoulis;Paul Patras;Edward W.

Dense deployment of sensor nodes makes the sensor observations highly correlated in the space domain. In addition, consecutive samples obtained by a sensor node are also temporally correlated for the applications involving the observation of the variation of a physical phenomenon. Based on the physical characteristics and dispersion pattern over the area, the phenomenon to be observed can be modeled as point source or field source. Clearly, understanding the spatio-temporal correlation characteristics of the point and field sources brings potential advantages to be exploited in the design of efficient communication protocols. In this paper, a theoretical analysis of spatio-temporal correlation in WSN is carried out. The objective of this analysis is to capture the spatio-temporal characteristics of point and field sources in WSN. First, the model for point and field sources are developed and their spatio-temporal characteristics are analytically derived along with the distortion functions. Based on the theoretical analysis, numerical simulations are performed. This analytical work provides tools for finding the feasible operating region in terms of spatial and temporal resolution for a specific distortion constraint considering spatio-temporal correlation, signal properties, and network variables in WSN.	computer simulation;consistency model;distortion;numerical analysis;sensor node;software deployment	Mehmet C.

So it is important to make the best use of the batteries to prolong the lifetime of the networks. With this objective in mind, a cooperative automatic retransmission request (CARQ) protocol is introduced for WSNs and a generalized discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) model is proposed for analyzing the throughput and energy efficiency of the protocol. Numerical results show that the energy efficiency of the scheme is much better than that of the traditional ARQ scheme.	cooperative mimo;throughput	Hualiang Chen;Yueming Cai;Weiwei Yang;Dongmei Zhang;Yingbo Hu	2012	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2011.08.005	throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;computer network	Mobile	12.140402365069976	82.50461917550878	193221

In this algorithm, the sensor selection scheme based on the information utility measure is used. To update the estimation in each selected node, a neighborhood radius equal to the communication range of the sensor nodes is defined and all sensors located in the neighborhood circle, whose radius is equal to the neighborhood radius and the selected node is its centre, collaborate their information. To decrease the energy consumption, the neighborhood radius is reduced gradually based on the error covariance value of the estimation. In addition, this paper includes a new method for the initial point calculation which is important in the recursive methods used for distributed algorithms in wireless sensor networks. Numerical examples are used to study the performance of the algorithms. Simulation results show the accuracy of the new algorithm becomes better while its energy consumption is low enough.	distributed algorithm;recursion;sensor;simulation	Hossein Khonsari;Mohammad Hossein Kahaei	2010	Wireless Sensor Network	10.4236/wsn.2010.27068	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	15.2111640887638	75.903257896125	193309

The energy of each sensor is limited which limits network lifetime. There are many existing energy efficiency algorithms to prolong network lifetime. Basically, there are two kinds of methods. One is energy-efficiency management, such as duty-cycling using virtual-backbones. The other one is energy provision, such as energy harvest from the environment. In this paper, we introduce a new problem, CDSEH, to combine these two methods together. We also propose a new standard to define the network lifetime of a WSN. We prove that the CDSEH problem is NP-Complete and propose two approximate algorithms accordingly. Extensive simulation results are shown to validate the performance of our algorithms.	approximation algorithm;centralized computing;connected dominating set;correctness (computer science);distributed algorithm;duty cycle;experiment;np-completeness;sensor;simulation	Tuo Shi;Siyao Cheng;Zhipeng Cai;Jianzhong Li	2016	IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524504	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Robotics	10.952260208361778	79.84387467488776	193429

In this survey, we focus on outdoor terrestrial OWC links which operate in near IR band. These are widely referred to as free space optical (FSO) communication in the literature. FSO systems are used for high rate communication between two fixed points over distances up to several kilometers. In comparison to radio-frequency (RF) counterparts, FSO links have a very high optical bandwidth available, allowing much higher data rates. They are appealing for a wide range of applications such as metropolitan area network (MAN) extension, local area network (LAN)-to-LAN connectivity, fiber back-up, backhaul for wireless cellular networks, disaster recovery, high definition TV and medical image/video transmission, wireless video surveillance/monitoring, and quantum key distribution among others. Despite the major advantages of FSO technology and variety of its application areas, its widespread use has been hampered by its rather disappointing link reliability particularly in long ranges due to atmospheric turbulence-induced fading and sensitivity to weather conditions. In the last five years or so, there has been a surge of interest in FSO research to address these major technical challenges. Several innovative physical layer concepts, originally introduced in the context of RF systems, such as multiple-input multiple-output communication, cooperative diversity, and adaptive transmission have been recently explored for the design of next generation FSO systems. In this paper, we present an up-to-date survey on FSO communication systems. The first part describes FSO channel models and transmitter/receiver structures. In the second part, we provide details on information theoretical limits of FSO channels and algorithmic-level system design research activities to approach these limits. Specific topics include advances in modulation, channel coding, spatial/cooperative diversity techniques, adaptive transmission, and hybrid RF/FSO systems.	backhaul (telecommunications);backup;closed-circuit television;disaster recovery;fixed point (mathematics);forward error correction;mimo;modulation;optical wireless;quantum key distribution;radio frequency;software propagation;systems design;terrestrial television;transmission (bittorrent client);transmitter;turbulence	Mohammad Ali Khalighi;Murat Uysal	2014	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/COMST.2014.2329501	optical transport network;free-space optical communication;multiwavelength optical networking;telecommunications;computer science;optical performance monitoring;computer network	Networks	22.945185045488884	82.05543612184569	193694

This paper addresses the problem of single target tracking in controlled mobility sensor networks. The proposed method consists of estimating the current position of a single target. Estimated positions are then used to predict the following location of the target. Once an area of interest is defined, the proposed approach consists of moving the mobile nodes in order to cover it in an optimal way. It thus defines a strategy for choosing the set of new sensors locations. Each node is then assigned one position within the set in the way to minimize the total traveled distance by the nodes. While the estimation and the prediction phases are performed using the interval theory, relocating nodes employs the ant colony optimization algorithm. Simulations results corroborate the efficiency of the proposed method compared to the target tracking methods considered for networks with static nodes.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;computer simulation;interval arithmetic;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;performance;relocation (computing);sensor;triangulation (geometry)	Farah Mourad;Hicham Chehade;Hichem Snoussi;Farouk Yalaoui;Lionel Amodeo;Cédric Richard	2012	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2011.154	estimation;ant colony optimization algorithms;simulation;wireless sensor network;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;operating system;ant colony;mobile computing;computer security	Mobile	13.8960547101936	76.28988225865182	193719

45a484945816c30c76f8f0b381987e24d0d53ce6	uncertainty-aware sensor deployment strategy in mixed wireless sensor networks		Deployment is a fundamental issue inwireless sensor networks (WSNs), which affects the performance and lifetime of the networks. Usually the sensor locations are precomputed based on “perfect” sensor detection model, whereas sensors may not always provide reliable information, either due to operational tolerance levels or environmental factors. Therefore, it is very important to take into account this uncertainty in the deployment process. In this paper, we address the problem of sensor deployment in a mixed sensor network where the mobile and static nodes work collaboratively to perform deployment optimization task. We consider the Gaussian white noise in the environment and present a centralized algorithm (FABGM for short) which discoveres vacancies by using detection model based on false alarm and moves the mobile nodes according to the method based on bipartite graph matching in this study. In this algorithm, the management node of the WSNs collects the geographical information of all of the static and mobile sensors. Then, the management node executes the algorithm to get the best matches between mobile sensors and coverage holes. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	algorithm;centralized computing;mathematical optimization;precomputation;region of interest;sensor;sensor web;simulation;software deployment;white noise	Yan Chang;Shukui Zhang;Yonghui Zhang;Jianxi Fan;Jin Wang	2013	IJDSN	10.1155/2013/834704	sensor node;deployment diagram;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	12.203310901449797	77.23834507126108	193918

The effect of multipath and shadowing introduces ambiguity into the readings, leading to a range of distances that can be inferred from a single measurement. This contribution highlights the frequency dependancy of these effects. Lower and upper bounding constraints are introduced to achieve an practical operational range and mitigate the possibility of ambiguous RSS measurements. In the results section we verify our theoretical limits with practical based experimental results. We also highlight the gains in RMSE when our thresholding approach is transferred to a localisation scheme.	multipath propagation;rss;thresholding (image processing)	Cassim Ladha;Bayan S.

Occasionally, the broadcast nature of this protocol may incur high power consumption which is a critical issue of sensor nodes. In this paper, several energy efficient forwarding algorithms are proposed and investigated. These algorithms aim at finding an optimum trade-off between system resource consumption and system reliability. Also, when wireless links or sensor nodes are subject to failure, it is important to prevent the loss of messages.

Existing methods provide an instantaneous coordinate estimate via radio tomographic imaging or location fingerprinting. In this paper, we explore the problem of, after a person has exited the area of the network, how can we estimate their path through the area? We present two methods which use recent line crossings detected by the network's links to estimate the person's path through the area. We assume that the person took a linear path and estimate the path's parameters. One method formulates path estimation as a line stabbing problem, and another method is a linear regression formulation. Through simulation we show that the line stabbing approach is more robust to false detections, but in the absence of false detections, the linear regression method provides superior performance.	algorithm;computer simulation;fingerprint (computing);sensor	Peter Hillyard;Samira Daruki;Neal Patwari;Suresh Venkatasubramanian	2013	2013 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing	10.1109/GlobalSIP.2013.6737071	electronic engineering;geography;telecommunications;statistics	Robotics	21.082222159883518	74.64119773250357	194406

Air interface design, including waveforms, is a very important component for the success of 5G mobile broadband (MBB) in terms of flexibility, energy efficiency and cost efficiency. In this paper, we compare two waveforms, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and filter bank multicarrier (FBMC), in terms of these requirements. We show that OFDM is a suitable waveform for MBB due to reasonably low overhead, low cost and latency; whereas FBMC loses its spectral properties when non-linear power amplifier is used.	audio power amplifier;beamforming;carrier frequency;cost efficiency;filter bank;frequency band;frequency divider;gigabit;mimo;minimum bounding box;multiplexing;nonlinear system;overhead (computing);requirement;scalability;spectral efficiency;switch;user experience;waveform	Jaakko Vihriälä;Natalia Y.

It is observed that the quality of event estimation at the sink (fusion center) degrades considerably with correlated packet losses during transmission from the sensors. A novel diversity technique based on field estimation is proposed to mitigate the effects of packet losses on the quality of estimation at the sink. Dense deployment of sensor nodes and the spatial nature of the observed physical phenomenon result in the sensor observations being noisy spatial samples of an unknown underlying function. The proposed algorithm exploits this feature, using supervised learning to achieve diversity. A new information fusion methodology based on approximate likelihood is proposed to integrate the information obtained from the learning algorithm into the classical estimation framework. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.	approximation algorithm;network packet;sensor;simulation;software deployment;supervised learning	Priyadip Ray;Pramod K.
