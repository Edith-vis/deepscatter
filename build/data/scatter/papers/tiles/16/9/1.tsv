31d713bf411969faf3edbd1ab67eb4182e3c74e0	fall detection system for elderly people - a neural network approach		In this work a new approach for a fall detection system is proposed. The device integrates a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope to measure linear acceleration and angular velocities, respectively. Information from both sensors is used to characterize movements through selected features extracted from raw data. A classification system based on a Feedforward Backpropagation Neural Network is then trained, based on the extracted features. The performed tests present low false positives and low false negatives rates with good specificity and sensitivity values.	angularjs;artificial neural network;backpropagation;coefficient;feed forward (control);gyroscope;overfitting;sensitivity and specificity;sensor	Getúlio Igrejas;Joana S.

The purpose of this paper was to study how to improve the prediction accuracy while using support vector regression (SVR) to predict the pinch force. Four healthy subjects performed constant-posture force-varying pinch operations. The sEMG signal was acquired using two electrodes while the force signal was recorded by a JR3 sensor. The time domain feature of sEMG and the force signal were then applied as the input of the SVR model. In order to improve the prediction accuracy, the parameters of SVR model were optimized by applying particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The relative mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficients (CC), and mean average error (MAE) were calculated as the criteria. The results show that the predicted force is close to the real pinch force by SVR modeling technique. The RMSE results are below 8% and the CC results are above 96% with 4 subjects. Compared with the grid search (GS) method, the PSO-SVR achieves a tradeoff between the accuracy and the computational costs with different kinds of training data.	algorithm;coefficient;computation;displacement mapping;electromyography;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;particle swarm optimization;performance;poor posture;real-time computing;real-time transcription;roland gs;support vector machine;the superficial	Xinqing Wang;Juan Gao	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2015.7222697	control engineering;engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Robotics	12.408095596969178	-86.18299542073743	103043

This leads to rapid uncoordinated contractions of the ventricles and sudden cardiac death if not treated within minutes of its occurrence. The mechanism of VF initiation and maintenance is still elusive, however the mother rotor and multiple wavelet theories attempt to explain the mechanism behind this lethal arrhythmia. In mother rotor theory, VF is believed to be maintained by high frequency periodic sources called rotors that could be tracked using the phase progression along and through the myocardium using spatio-temporal electrical mapping of the heart. There are exiting works including our previous works that have related the formation of these rotors to anatomical and physiological heterogeneities observed in the myocardium. In this study we performed an correlation exercise of the locations of rotors with scar boundary maps and dominant frequency maps and elucidated this relation using human VF data acquired from isolated human hearts. The results suggest that in 14 rotors over 6 human hearts that we studied, all rotors co-localized to boundary zones of scar and low-high dominant frequency locations. The mean variance of the dominant frequency over the spatial location of the rotor was found to be 0.55 with average minimum of 4.15 Hz to a maximum of 5.71 Hz. This results in human VF data strongly suggest that boundary zones of healthy-non-healthy tissues and low-high frequency boundaries form a favorite substrate for rotor formation.	body tissue;cerebral ventricles;chaos theory;cicatrix;cognitive function: initiation;color gradient;design rationale;direction finding;heart ventricle;heart rate variability;hertz (hz);large;map;myocardium;processor affinity;r.o.t.o.r.;sample variance;sudden cardiac death;ventricular fibrillation;wavelet	J.

4593503c4b137cb0e32c929c8d9b7bc0a0d2ec87	automatic driver sleepiness detection using eeg, eog and contextual information		Abstract The many vehicle crashes that are caused by driver sleepiness each year advocates the development of automated driver sleepiness detection (ADSD) systems. This study proposes an automatic sleepiness classification scheme designed using data from 30 drivers who repeatedly drove in a high-fidelity driving simulator, both in alert and in sleep deprived conditions. Driver sleepiness classification was performed using four separate classifiers: k-nearest neighbours, support vector machines, case-based reasoning, and random forest, where physiological signals and contextual information were used as sleepiness indicators. The subjective Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS) was used as target value. An extensive evaluation on multiclass and binary classifications was carried out using 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out validation. With 10-fold cross-validation, the support vector machine showed better performance than the other classifiers (79% accuracy for multiclass and 93% accuracy for binary classification). The effect of individual differences was also investigated, showing a 10% increase in accuracy when data from the individual being evaluated was included in the training dataset. Overall, the support vector machine was found to be the most stable classifier. The effect of adding contextual information to the physiological features improved the classification accuracy by 4% in multiclass classification and by and 5% in binary classification.	electroencephalography;electrooculography	Shaibal Barua;Mobyen Uddin Ahmed;Christer Ahlström;Shahina Begum	2019	Expert Syst.

This study investigated the thermal patterns concomitant to specific action units performance. As thermal imaging can track dynamic patterns in facial temperature at any distance (>; 0.4 m), with high temporal (<; 20 m) and thermal (<; 20 mK@300 K) resolutions, this noninvasive technique was tested as a method to assess fluctuations of facial heat patterns induced by facial muscles contractions. Four FACS-trained coders produced nine different AUs or combination of AUs at various speeds and intensities. Using a spatial pattern approach based on PCA decomposition of the thermal signal, we showed that thermal fluctuations are specific to the activated AUs and are sensitive to the kinetics and intensities of AU production. These results open new avenues for studying patterns of facial muscle activity related to emotion or other cognitively induced activities, in a noninvasive manner, avoiding potential lighting issues.	bcs-facs;contraction mapping;kinetics internet protocol;regular expression;spatiotemporal pattern;spontaneous order;thermal grease	Sophie Jarlier;Didier Grandjean;Sylvain Delplanque;Karim N'diaye;Isabelle Cayeux;Maria Ines Velazco;David Sander;Patrik Vuilleumier;Klaus R.

Such devices like robotic arms and hands require this high dimensionality of control to restore the full range of actions exhibited in natural movement. Current BMI strategies fall well short of this goal allowing the control of only a few degrees of freedom at a time. In this paper we present work towards the decoding of 27 joint angles from the shoulder, arm and hand as subjects perform reach and grasp movements. We also extend previous work in examining and optimizing the recording depth of electrodes to maximize the movement information that can be extracted from recorded neural signals.	brain–computer interface;coat of arms;extraction;macaca mulatta;movement;neural oscillation;patients;prosthesis;robot;subgroup;anatomical layer;electrode;frontal lobe	Yan Tat Wong;Mariana Vigeral;David Putrino;David Pfau;Josh S.

cdc553b0e45922f663d89afd86e88655dc845df0	towards a wearable cough detector based on neural networks		Persistent cough is a symptom common to a number of respiratory disorders; however, reliable monitoring of cough frequency and cough severity over an extended period of time can be a challenge. Traditional methods involve subjective evaluation by care providers or patient self-reports. As an alternative, we propose an objective method for monitoring cough using a wearable microphone. We collected 24-hour audio recordings from 9 patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and lung cancer using the VitaloJAK wearable microphone. Trained professionals carefully listened to each audio stream and manually labeled each cough event. Using this data, we propose a new neural-network-based cough detection scheme. A pre-processing algorithm is used to estimate the start and end of each cough and the deep neural network is trained using each cough instance. Experiments demonstrate an average leave-one-participant-out cross-validation specificity and sensitivity of 93.7% and 97.6% respectively.	24-hour clock;algorithm;artificial neural network;cross-validation (statistics);deep learning;experiment;microphone;preprocessor;sensitivity and specificity;streaming media;wearable computer	Prad Kadambi;Abinash Mohanty;Hao Ren;Jaclyn Smith;Kevin McGuinnes;Kimberly Holt;Armin Furtwaengler;Roberto Slepetys;Zheng Yang;Jae-sun Seo;Junseok Chae;Yu Cao;Visar Berisha	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461394	persistent cough;audiology;deep learning;artificial neural network;cough frequency;wearable computer;audio signal processing;asthma;microphone;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;computer science	Robotics	14.837518318397398	-88.12714341637384	103251

The patterns vary depending on the individual heart characteristics. ECG features can be potentially used for biometric recognition. This study presents a new method using the entire ECG waveform pattern for matching and demonstrates that the approach can potentially be employed for individual biometric identification. Multi-cycle ECG signals were assessed using an ECG measuring circuit, and three electrodes can be patched on the wrists or fingers for considering various measurements. For biometric identification, our-fold cross validation was used in the experiments for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. Four different pattern matching algorithms, i.e., cosine similarity, cross correlation, city block distance, and Euclidean distances, were tested to compare the individual identification performances with a single channel of ECG signal (3-wire ECG). To evaluate the pattern matching for biometric identification, the ECG recordings for each subject were partitioned into training and test set. The suggested method obtained a maximum performance of 89.9% accuracy with two heartbeats of ECG signals measured on the wrist and 93.3% accuracy with three heartbeats for 55 subjects. The performance rate with ECG signals measured on the fingers improved up to 99.3% with two heartbeats and 100% with three heartbeats of signals for 20 subjects.	algorithm;artificial neural network;biometrics;cosine similarity;cross reactions;cross-correlation;cross-validation (statistics);database;electrocardiography;euclidean distance;experiment;fingers, unit of measurement;health level 7;holism;neural network simulation;pattern matching;performance;protein patched homolog 1, human;taxicab geometry;test set;ubiquitous computing;waveform;wavelet;wrist;electrical property;electrode	Wonki Lee;Seulgee Kim;Daeeun Kim	2018		10.3390/s18041005	cross-validation;electronic engineering;cross-correlation;engineering;pattern matching;biometrics;electrocardiography;artificial intelligence;waveform;pattern recognition;cosine similarity;test set	ML	15.14961425496447	-89.95373704507335	103334

One challenge is that rs-fcMRI is influenced by various sources of noise, particularly cardiac- and respiratory-related signal variations. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the impact of various physiological noise correction techniques, specifically those that use independent cardiac and respiration measures, on the test-retest reliability of rs-fcMRI. A group of 25 subjects were each scanned at three time points--two within the same imaging session and another 2-3 months later. Physiological noise corrections accounted for significant variance, particularly in blood vessels, sagittal sinus, cerebrospinal fluid, and gray matter. The fraction of variance explained by each of these corrections was highly similar within subjects between sessions, but variable between subjects. Physiological corrections generally reduced intrasubject (between-session) variability, but also significantly reduced intersubject variability, and thus reduced the test-retest reliability of estimating individual differences in functional connectivity. However, based on known nonneuronal mechanisms by which cardiac pulsation and respiration can lead to MRI signal changes, and the observation that the physiological noise itself is highly stable within individuals, removal of this noise will likely increase the validity of measured connectivity differences. Furthermore, removal of these fluctuations will lead to better estimates of average or group maps of connectivity. It is therefore recommended that studies apply physiological noise corrections but also be mindful of potential correlations with measures of interest.		Rasmus M. Birn;Maria Daniela Cornejo;Erin K.

On the base of taking voxels in the brain regions related to problem solving as the features, we compare two feature extraction methods, one is based on the cumulative changes of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, and the other is based on the values at each time point in the BOLD signal time course of each trial. We collected the fMRI data while participants were performing a simplified 4*4 Sudoku problems, and predicted the complexity (easy vs. complex) or the steps (1-step vs. 2-steps) of the problem from fMRI data using these two feature extraction methods, respectively. Both methods can produce quite high accuracy, and the performance of the latter method is better than the former. The results indicate that SVM can be used to predict high-level cognitive states from fMRI data. Moreover, the feature extraction based on serial signal change of BOLD effect can predict cognitive states better because it can use abundant and typical information kept in BOLD effect data.

cdf50c06665f046024da9eafe7cbcae81f49ee6b	design and testing of a new radial pulsation simulator		The importance of measuring and simulating a radial pulsation is steadily increased in medical science area, because the radial pulsation is a surrogate maker to estimate a central aortic pressure waveform which is clinically imperative for predicting cardiovascular diseases. Due to technical limits, mathematical relationship between the central and radial pressures has not been reliably demonstrated. Hence, we developed a new radial pulsation simulator prototype similar to a human cardiovascular system. The proposed radial pulsation simulator consists of a ventricular part, an atrial part, an aorta part and a radial arterial part. The central and radial pressure waveforms measured by built-in pressure sensors show similar waveforms with a human's pressure. The developed radial pulsation simulator could replicate pressure waves similar to those of the human body. The results show that the developed simulator has potentials to create both the central and radial pressure waveform, simultaneously in further works. It implies the simulator can be applied to validate the generalized transfer function between the central and radial pressures.	imperative programming;prototype;radial (radio);radial basis function;self-replicating machine;sensor;simulation;transfer function;waveform	Tae-Heon Yang;Youngmin Kim;Sam-Yong Woo	2017	2017 14th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)	10.1109/URAI.2017.7992734	transfer function;simulation;arterial part;aorta part;pressure sensor;pressure measurement;pressure waveforms;piston;waveform;engineering	Robotics	13.40541887312604	-85.16626562104818	103573

The database contains EEG registers of seven patients acquired in eyes-closed and eyes-opened conditions, in pre-and post-treatment phases. Five measures were applied: largest Lyapunov exponent, Lempel-Ziv complexity, Hurst exponent, and multiscale entropy on two different scales. The purpose is to test whether these measures are apt to detect and quantify differences from EEG registers between pre- and post-treatment. The results indicate that these measures could have a potential utility for detection of quantitative changes in specific EEG channels. In addition, the performance of some of these measures improved when the bandwidth was reduced to 3-30 Hz.	apt compounds;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;electroencephalography;eye;hertz (hz);hurst exponent;hyperactive behavior;kolmogorov complexity;largest;lempel–ziv–stac;lyapunov fractal;mood disorders;multiple personality disorder;neurofeedback;nonlinear dynamics;patients	Alexander Cerquera;Martijn Arns;Elías Buitrago;Rafael Gutiérrez;Jan A.

The method is applied to screen knee-joint vibration or vibroarthrographic (VAG) signals based on statistical parameters derived from signals and selected by the genetic algorithm. A database of 89 VAG signals was studied. With the leave-one-out procedure, the linear S2SP classifier provided an efficiency of 0.82 in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (A(z)); the nonlinear S2SP classifier provided 0.95 in A(z) value using the Gaussian kernel, and possessed good robustness around the selected kernel parameter.

In this paper, emotional states were induced via a Wizard-of-Oz mental trainer scenario, which is based on the valence-arousal-dominance model. In most experiments, classification algorithms are tested via leave-out cross-validation of one situation. These studies often show very high classification rates, which are comparable with those in our experiment (92.6%). However, in order to guarantee robust emotion recognition based on biopsychological data, measurements have to be taken across several situations with the goal of selecting stable features for individual emotional states. For this purpose, our mental trainer experiment was conducted twice for each subject with a 10-min break between the two rounds. It is shown that there are robust psychobiological features that can be used for classification (70.1%) in both rounds. However, these are not the same as those that were found via feature selection performed only on the first round (classification: 53.0%).	algorithm;cross-validation (statistics);emotion recognition;experiment;feature selection	Steffen Walter;Jonghwa Kim;David Hrabal;Stephen Clive Crawcour;Henrik Kessler;Harald C.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been recently acknowledged as a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can be used in focal epilepsy for therapeutic purposes. In this case study, it is investigated whether simple time-domain connectivity measures, namely cross-correlation and partial cross-correlation, can detect alterations in the connectivity structure estimated from selected EEG channels before and during ED, as well as how this changes with the application of TMS. The correlation for each channel pair is computed on non-overlapping windows of 1 s duration forming weighted networks. Further, binary networks are derived by thresholding or statistical significance tests (parametric and randomization tests).

The proposed system comprises a microwave Doppler sensor and range imagery using Microsoft Kinect™. The possible application of the proposed system is a driver health monitoring. We introduce the sensor fusion approach to minimize the heart beat detection error. The proposed algorithm can subtract a body motion artifact from Doppler sensor output using time-frequency analysis. The body motion artifact is a crucially important problem for biosignal monitoring using microwave Doppler sensor. The body motion speed is obtainable from range imagery, which has 5-mm resolution at 30-cm distance. Measurement results show that the success rate of the heart beat detection is improved about 75% on average when the Doppler wave is degraded by the body motion artifact.	algorithm;artifact (error);beat detection;frequency analysis;guided imagery;kinect;microwave;sensor web;time–frequency analysis	Daichi Matsunaga;Shintaro Izumi;Keisuke Okuno;Hiroshi Kawaguchi;Masahiko Yoshimoto	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319788	electronic engineering;text mining;medical research;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	Robotics	12.1220295497495	-88.341520341088	103947
66a236ee41fa99221fbf20c4066ce9ee1ae8cf32	development of a smartphone-based pulse oximeter with adaptive snr/power balancing		Millions worldwide suffer from diseases that exhibit early warnings signs that can be detected by standard clinical-grade diagnostic tools. Unfortunately, such tools are often prohibitively expensive to the developing world leading to inadequate healthcare and high mortality rates. To address this problem, a smartphone-based pulse oximeter is presented that interfaces with the phone through the audio jack, enabling point-of-care measurements of heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2). The device is designed to utilize existing phone resources (e.g., the processor, battery, and memory) resulting in a more portable and inexpensive diagnostic tool than standalone equivalents. By adaptively tuning the LED driving signal, the device is less dependent on phone-specific audio jack properties than prior audio jack-based work making it universally compatible with all smartphones. We demonstrate that the pulse oximeter can adaptively optimize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) within the power constraints of a mobile phone (< 10mW) while maintaining high accuracy (HR error < 3.4% and SpO2 error < 3.7%) against a clinical grade instrument.	audio media;cautionary warning;equilibrium;equivalent weight;jack device component;mobile phone;oxygen saturation test result;phone connector (audio);signal-to-noise ratio;smartphone	Tom Phelps;Haowei Jiang;Drew A.

Following features were extracted for this aim; linear prediction coefficients (LPC), subband wavelet entropy (SWE), subband wavelet variance (SWV), and relative power (RP). After extracting related features, analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical test was used for the statistical evaluation of these features. According to the obtained results, wavelet transform-based entropy gave the best results to determine the representing stimulation frequencies. As a result, 29 Hz stimulation frequency was determined as the most representative frequency for normal subjects, whereas 8 Hz stimulation frequency was determined as the most representative frequency for diseased subjects.

fc638542c91f0c74da4de1d93ec0891607f7ae70	deriving high performance alerts from reduced sensor data for timely intervention in acute hypotensive episodes		Alerting critical health conditions ahead of time leads to reduced mortality rates. Recently wirelessly enabled medical sensors have become pervasive in both hospital and ambulatory settings. These sensors pour out voluminous data that are generally not amenable to direct interpretation. For this data to be practically useful for patients, they must be translatable into alerts that enable doctors to intervene in a timely fashion. In this paper we present a novel three-step technique to derive high performance alerts from voluminous sensor data: A data reduction algorithm that takes into account the medical condition at personalized patient level and thereby converts raw multi-sensor data to patient and disease specific severity representation, which we call as the Personalized Health Motifs (PHM). The PHMs are then modulated by criticality factors derived from interventional time and severity frequency to yield a Criticality Measure Index (CMI). In the final step we generate alerts whenever the CMI crosses patientdisease-specific thresholds. We consider one medical condition called Acute Hypotensive Episode (AHE). We evaluate the performance of our CMI derived alerts using 7,200 minutes of data from the MIMIC II [7] database. We show that the CMI generates valid alerts up to 180 minutes prior to onset of AHE with accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of 0.76, 1.0 and 0.67 respectively, outperforming alerts from raw data.	adaptive histogram equalization;algorithm;autonomic networking;body mass index;cardiology discipline;computer memories inc.;criticality matrix;deploy;half-life 2: episode two;leukemia, myelocytic, acute;mimic;modulation;myocardial infarction;neurology speciality;numerous;onset (audio);patients;personalization;pervasive informatics;prototype;self-organized criticality;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;software deployment;syncope (medicine);time series;nervous system disorder	Rahul Krishnan Pathinarupothi;Ekanath Rangan;P.

15badcced39c3270e2aee3bdc92aff5315d2f042	identification of s1 and s2 heart sound patterns based on fractal theory and shape context		There has been a sustained effort in the research community over the recent years to develop algorithms that automatically analyze heart sounds. One of the major challenges is identifying primary heart sounds, S1 and S2, as they represent reference events for the analysis. The study presented in this paper analyzes the possibility of improving the structure characterization based on shape context and structure assessment using a small number of descriptors. Particularly, for the primary sound characterization, an adaptive waveform filtering is applied based on blanket fractal dimension for each preprocessed sound candidate belonging to pediatric subjects. This is followed by applying the shape based methods selected for the structure assessment of primary heart sounds. Different methods, such as the fractal ones, are used for the comparison.The analysis of heart sound patterns is performed using support vector machine classifier showing promising results (above 95% accuracy). The obtained results suggest that it is possible to improve the identification process using the shape related methods which are rarely applied. This can be helpful for applications involving automatic heart sound analysis.	algorithm;fractal dimension;shape context;support vector machine;waveform	Ana Gavrovska;Goran Zajic;Vesna Bogdanovic;Irini Reljin;Branimir Reljin	2017	Complexity	10.1155/2017/1580414	shape context;machine learning;support vector machine;filter (signal processing);artificial intelligence;mathematics;waveform;small number;fractal dimension;fractal;heart sounds	ML	16.33127286352278	-89.20266512923378	105141

In this paper, we proposed a novel feature extraction and a unique continuous authentication strategy and technique. We proposed One-Dimensional Multi-Resolution Local Binary Patterns (1DMRLBP), an online feature extraction for one-dimensional signals. We also proposed a continuous authentication system, which uses sequential sampling and 1DMRLBP feature extraction. This system adaptively updates decision thresholds and sample size during run-time. Unlike most other local binary patterns variants, 1DMRLBP accounts for observations' temporal changes and has a mechanism to extract one feature vector that represents multiple observations. 1DMRLBP also accounts for quantization error, tolerates noise, and extracts local and global signal morphology. This paper examined electrocardiogram signals. When 1DMRLBP was applied on the University of Toronto database (UofTDB) 1,012 single session subjects database, an equal error rate (EER) of 7.89% was achieved in comparison to 12.30% from a state-of-the-art work. Also, an EER of 10.10% was resulted when 1DMRLBP was applied to UofTDB 82 multiple sessions database. Experiments showed that using 1DMRLBP improved EER by 15% when compared with a biometric system based on raw time-samples. Finally, when 1DMRLBP was implemented with sequential sampling to achieve a continuous authentication system, 0.39% false rejection rate and 1.57% false acceptance rate were achieved.	authentication;biometrics;color gradient;compiler;database;enhanced entity–relationship model;feature extraction;feature vector;galaxy morphological classification;holism;local binary patterns;online and offline;pixel;quantization (signal processing);real-time clock;rejection sampling;resultant;run time (program lifecycle phase);sampling (signal processing);temporal logic	Wael Louis;Majid Komeili;Dimitrios Hatzinakos	2016	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2016.2599270	speech recognition;feature extraction;computer science;pattern recognition;data mining;authentication;computer security	Security	17.05743152585728	-88.48309423555021	105288

Typical non-invasive brain-computer interfaces based on event-related brain responses use eletroencephalograhy. In this study, we consider brain signals recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG), and we expect to take advantage of the high spatial and temporal resolution for the detection of targets in a series of images. This study was used for the data analysis competition held in the 20th International Conference on Biomagnetism (Biomag) 2016, wherein the goal was to provide a method for single-trial detection of even-related fields corresponding to the presentation of happy faces during the rapid presentation of images of faces with six different facial expressions (anger, disgust, fear, neutrality, sadness, and happiness). The datasets correspond to 204 gradiometers signals obtained from four participants. The best method is based on the combination of several approaches, and mainly based on Riemannian geometry, and it provided an area under the ROC curve of 0.956±0.043. The results show that a high recognition rate of facial expressions can be obtained at the signal-trial level using advanced signal processing and machine learning methodologies.

The first method explores matrices arising from networks of transitions constructed following events represented by a time series. The second method considers distributions of ordinal patterns of length three, whereby patterns with repeated values are counted as different patterns. Both methods provide estimators of dynamical aspects of short-term heartbeat signals obtained from nocturnal Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of healthy people of different ages and genders. The deceleration capacity, arising from the adjacency matrix of the network, and the entropy rate, resulting from the transition matrix of the network, are also calculated, and both significantly decay with aging. As people age, the permutation entropy grows, due to the increase in patterns with repeated values. All of these estimators describe in a consistent way changes in the beat-to-beat heart period dynamics caused by aging. An overall slowing Entropy 2015, 17 1254 down of heart period changes is observed, and an increase of permutation entropy results from the progressive increase of patterns with repeated values. This result points to the sympathetic drive becoming dominant in cardiac regulation of nocturnal heart rate with age.	adjacency matrix;angular defect;approximation algorithm;autonomic networking;efferent coupling;entropy (information theory);entropy rate;heart rate variability;homeostasis;network switch;ordinal data;rapid refresh;stochastic matrix;stochastic process;time series	Danuta Makowiec;Agnieszka Kaczkowska;Dorota Wejer;Marta Zarczynska-Buchowiecka;Zbigniew R.

b273854718e2794f2fb1ae572377158ce820178f	using accelerometric and gyroscopic data to improve blood pressure prediction from pulse transit time using recurrent neural network		We propose a method for estimating blood pressure (BP) non-invasively from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. This method has potential to be used as a continuous form of BP estimation. Along with these signals, to our knowledge, for the first time in the BP measurement studies, we included accelerometric and gyroscopic signals from a wearable device to compensate for motion during continuous BP prediction. Our prediction model is a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) architecture of a recurrent neural network (RNN), which accommodates the multiscale temporal dependency between the sequential raw signal values and the corresponding systolic and diastolic BP values. We performed a study with 50 healthy volunteers. The mean difference ± standard deviation (SD) of the RNN-based approach were $0.02\pm 4.8$ for SBP and $1.5\pm 3.7$ for DBP in seated position & $2.6\pm 6.0$ for SBP and $2.7\pm 4.5$ for DBP while walking. These values meet current validation standard requirements for measurement accuracy. Our experiments also demonstrate that the proposed RNN-based approach outperformed the classical linear regression model for BP prediction.	artificial neural network;digital back-propagation;experiment;fibre optic gyroscope;long short-term memory;random neural network;recurrent neural network;requirement;sbp;wearable technology	Shrimanti Ghosh;Ankur Banerjee;Nilanjan Ray;Peter William Wood;Pierre Boulanger;Raj S Padwal	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461959	blood pressure;accuracy and precision;pulse transit time;artificial intelligence;standard deviation;pattern recognition;recurrent neural network;linear regression;computer science;gyroscope;photoplethysmogram	Robotics	13.187627070392704	-86.73425315015658	105628

Training at an appropriate driving difficulty level can maximize long term performance. Affective state information has been used for difficulty level adjustment in our previous work. This paper integrates performance with affective state information to predict the optimal difficulty level. The participant’s performance data, physiology signals, and eye gaze data are captured.

e8df7432693e949d5c0bc46882c36d58dc0f14b8	automatic detection of respiratory arrests in osa patients using ppg and machine learning techniques		Obstructive sleep apnea is a syndrome which is characterized by the decrease in air flow or respiratory arrest depending on upper respiratory tract obstructions recurring during sleep and often observed with the decrease in the oxygen saturation. The aim of this study was to determine the connection between the respiratory arrests and the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal in obstructive sleep apnea patients. Determination of this connection is important for the suggestion of using a new signal in diagnosis of the disease. Thirty-four time-domain features were extracted from the PPG signal in the study. The relation between these features and respiratory arrests was statistically investigated. The Mann–Whitney U test was applied to reveal whether this relation was incidental or statistically significant, and 32 out of 34 features were found statistically significant. After this stage, the features of the PPG signal were classified with k-nearest neighbors classification algorithm, radial basis function neural network, probabilistic neural network, multilayer feedforward neural network (MLFFNN) and ensemble classification method. The output of the classifiers was considered as apnea and control (normal). When the classifier results were compared, the best performance was obtained with MLFFNN. Test accuracy rate is 97.07 % and kappa value is 0.93 for MLFFNN. It has been concluded with the results obtained that respiratory arrests can be recognized through the PPG signal and the PPG signal can be used for the diagnosis of OSA.	artificial neural network;feedforward neural network;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;machine learning;probabilistic neural network;radial (radio);radial basis function;tract (literature);wake-sleep algorithm	Muhammed Kursad Ucar;Mehmet Recep Bozkurt;Cahit Bilgin;Kemal Polat	2016	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-016-2617-9	speech recognition;artificial intelligence	ML	16.30899129893198	-89.86774710643382	106293

The algorithm employs discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposition to extract ABP waveform features. In the proposed method, two strategies are used. In the first strategy, the algorithm uses only the DWT coefficients of ABP. The second strategy which is introduced for the first time in this paper, the coupled DWT coefficients of ABP and electrocardiogram (ECG) are used. When DWT coefficients of ECG and ABP are coupled the detection of ABP pulses is easier and more accurate in noisy parts of the signals. Furthermore, this coupling strategy is useful for the detection of ECG R-peaks since the ABP pulses make the ECG R-peaks detectable when ECG is noisy. To meet this end, adaptive thresholding and different DWT functions were employed and fitted because of different morphologies of ABP and ECG signals. The ABP-ECG delay time is measured in different recordings and set for 254 milliseconds. For evaluation, 170 recordings of the multimodal training set of PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2014 which contained both ECG and ABP waveforms were used. The first and second strategy obtained average accuracy of 87.56% and 88.53%, respectively.	algorithm;alternating bit protocol;coefficient;discrete wavelet transform;multimodal interaction;test set;thresholding (image processing);waveform	Farhad Asadi;Mohammad Javad Mollakazemi;Ilija Uzelac;S.

Measurement sensors are realized by Mach-Zehnder fiber optic interferometers placed on chest and abdomen of pregnant women. Based on real measurements, a simplified dynamic signal model of a distribution of heartbeat sounds (HS) through human body was realized. This model allows the design, realization, and verification of the adaptive system least mean squared (LMS) algorithm. This system enables to extract fetal heart rate from a sensor placed on the abdomen, where an unwanted maternal phonocardiogram (mPCG) impairs this important signal. Standard filtration methods cannot be used because phonocardiogram of fetus and mother operate on the same frequencies. The functionality of the designed system was verified by objective parameters such as Signal Noise to Ration (SNR), Sensitivity (S+), and Positive Predictive Value (PPV).	adaptive system;algorithm;conley–zehnder theorem;heartbeat message;least mean squares filter;mathematical morphology;noise (electronics);optical fiber;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;synthetic data;value (computer science)	Marcel Fajkus;Jan Nedoma;Radek Martinek;Jan Zavadil;Vladimir Vasinek	2017	2017 40th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)	10.1109/TSP.2017.8076018	phonocardiogram;control theory;square (algebra);computer science;algorithm;heartbeat	Robotics	19.50828618139217	-89.05682371683316	106466
caff59d1ade087a397ef6657068e28841001f9ce	mental workload assessment in smartphone multitasking users: a feature selection approach using physiological and simulated data		When a user of a computer system is performing more than one task at the same time, her error rate increases drastically. In any system this is a critical issue, since the goals of the tasks are not likely to be met. In that sense, the purpose of mental workload assessment is to estimate the mental demand of tasks to take action according to that, avoiding execution errors. In this paper we study two techniques of mental workload assessment, physiological signals and simulation models of mental behavior with the ACT-R cognitive architecture. The contributions of this study are in two folds: validate a positive correlation among physiological and simulated data and, to develop a supervised model of classification with a cost-sensitive feature selection algorithm using the ACT-R simulated data as an input of the model. Results show a positive, significant correlation among the two data sources, and that the model selects features of less cost and classify better than a baseline approach with 93.1% accuracy in average.

2c08bd9f4473f3b3aebc0b0ba68d2e8ab6bbeea5	evaluation of wearable imu performance for orientation estimation and motion tracking		Introducing objective wearable IMU measurements of functional movement quality into clinical assessments may improve accuracy of diagnosis. The goal of the present study was to assess the performance of inexpensive wearable IMUs relative to conventional motion capture equipment during controlled movements that are representative of typical human movement. Thirty-five cycles of spine flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial twisting were simulated by means of a motorized gimbal at speeds of 20 cycles/min and 40 cycles/min. Differences between cycle-to-cycle maximum angle, minimum angle, and ROM values, as well as correlational analyses within IMUs and between IMUs and motion capture, in all movement directions, were compared. All absolute differences in measurements were < 1.55°. There were very high correlations between repeated IMU measures (R > 0.99) in all movement directions showing reliability between sensors and measurements. Overall, it was revealed that the sensors perform very well in the primary movement direction and one secondary axis; however, correlation in the third axis is suboptimal for orientation estimation and motion tracking.	apache axis;lateral thinking;maxima and minima;motion capture;multistage interconnection networks;sensor;wearable computer	Kristen H.

4e75829a2178ddd1f7b432594e68ca968064bffb	development of hand blood circulation measurement system for raynaud syndrome using infrared imaging		Raynaud syndrome refers to a medical condition where arterial smooth muscle contraction induces blood flow reduction. Thermal images and questionnaires have been used to assess the efficacy of treatment. In this research, a potential way to measure whole-hand blood circulation in real-time using infrared image is introduced. Normalized average pixel intensity of the regions of interest in hand was measured during or after blood circulation changes brought by temperature alteration and pressure applied to the hand or forearm. The intensity of regions has shown the tendency of the expected amount of blood in the hand in each blood circulation changes. Possible uses of this system are measuring severity of Raynaud syndrome and the efficacy of treatments.	blood circulation;cns disorder;forearm;pixel;raynaud disease;raynaud phenomenon;real-time clock;real-time computing;region of interest;smooth muscle (tissue);stiff-person syndrome;system of measurement;smooth muscle contraction	Yunchan Hwang;Minwon Seo;Jong-mo Seo	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037083	computer vision;artificial intelligence;blood flow;internal medicine;forearm;surgery;muscle contraction;medicine;cardiology	Visualization	15.527235592244667	-84.70031385079005	106883
2386bee5df616a9160a72f2ed809f3df7b15b7d9	research and development in intelligent systems xxix		This paper presents a speaker verification system that uses a self organising map composed of spiking neurons. The architecture of the system is inspired by the biomechanical mechanism of the human auditory system which converts speech into electrical spikes inside the cochlea. A spike-based rank order coding input feature vector is suggested that is designed to be representative of the real biological spike trains found within the human auditory nerve. The Spiking Self Organising Map (SSOM) updates its winner neuron only when its activity exceeds a specified threshold. The algorithm is evaluated using 50 speakers from the Centre for Spoken Language Understanding (CSLU2002) speaker verification database and shows a speaker verification performance of 90.1%. This compares favorably with previous non-spiking self organising map that used Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based input feature vector with the same dataset.	algorithm;discrete fourier transform;feature vector;neuron;self-organization;self-organizing map;speaker recognition	Miltos Petridis	2012		10.1007/978-1-4471-4739-8	computer engineering;intelligent decision support system;engineering	AI	19.096493143640103	-93.65510133404194	107055

Inertial sensors emulated from motion capture recordings, and surface electromyogram (sEMG) readings from the back and abdomen, were investigated for efficacy in recognizing flexion and extension motion of the trunk. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based method of pattern classification was used to integrate the two different sensor readings together and identify trunk motion. The classification approach involved multiple classifiers that were generated from different features extracted from the data, which were then combined using a majority voting based classifier fusion scheme. An experimental procedure to record the signals and validate the pattern classification method has been described and results are discussed.	cross-validation (statistics);electromyography;emulator;internet backbone;linear discriminant analysis;motion capture;sensor	Abhijit Kadrolkar;Frank Sup	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/SMC.2013.679	computer vision;contextual image classification;speech recognition;feature extraction;computer science;sensor;machine learning;pattern recognition;motion estimation;linear discriminant analysis	Robotics	12.875506701789257	-89.03146434901478	107085

This study introduces a new approach for the detection of nonlinear Granger causality in MV time series, based on embedding the series by a sequential, non-uniform procedure, and on estimating the information flow from one series to another by means of the corrected conditional entropy. The approach is validated on short realizations of linear stochastic and nonlinear deterministic processes, and then evaluated on heart period, systolic arterial pressure and respiration variability series measured from healthy humans in the resting supine position and in the upright position after head-up tilt.	baroreflex;causality;certified computer examiner;conditional entropy;embedding;entity handling - upright;estimated;flow;heart rate variability;iso 10303;inference;interaction;latent variable;nasal sinus;neural oscillation;nonlinear system;respiratory sinus arrhythmia;rest;simulation;stochastic process;systolic pressure;time series	Luca Faes;Giandomenico Nollo;Alberto Porta	2012	Computers in biology and medicine	10.1016/j.compbiomed.2011.02.007	granger causality;econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;conditional entropy;statistics	ML	19.92257990420756	-84.64840481539966	107214

Its clinical use for the interpretation of respiratory malfunction depends on their efficient and objective separation from vesicular sounds (VS). In this paper, an automated approach to the isolation of DAS from VS, based on their nonstationarity, is presented. The proposed scheme uses two fuzzy inference systems (FISs), operating in parallel, to perform the task of adaptive separation, resulting in the orthogonal least squares-based fuzzy filter (OLS-FF). By applying the OLS-FF to fine/coarse crackles and squawks, selected from three lung sound databases, the coherent structure of DAS is revealed and they are efficiently separated from VS. The important time domain DAS features, related to diagnostic information, are preserved and their true location and structural morphology are automatically identified. When compared to previous works, the OLS-FF performs quite similarly, but with significantly lower computational load, resulting in a faster real-time clinical screening of DAS.	biologic preservation;coherence (physics);computation;database;fuzzy logic;galaxy morphological classification;heart sounds;idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis;inference;ordinary least squares;real-time clock;respiratory distress syndrome, adult;respiratory sounds;structure of parenchyma of lung;vesicular monoamine transport proteins;amsonic acid	Paris A.

The differentiation of physiological and epileptic HFO is an important challenge and is complicated by the fact that both types are generated in mesiotemporal structures. This study aimed to identify oscillation features that serve to distinguish physiological ripples associated with sleep spindles and epileptic ripples. We studied 19 patients with chronic intracranial EEG(iEEG) with mesiotemporal implantation and simultaneous scalp EEG. Sleep spindles, ripples and spikes were visually marked during nonrapid eye movement sleep stage 2. Ripples co-occurring with spikes and in seizure onset zone (SOZ) channels but outside of spindles were considered epileptic. The SOZ is defined by the origin of clinical seizures in iEEG. Ripples co-occurring with spindles were considered as models for physiological ripples. A correlation analysis showed a significant ripple amplitude peak - spindle trough - coupling, thus proving their physiological linkage. Epileptic ripples showed significantly higher values in all amplitude features than spindle ripples. All amplitude features and peaks per sample length showed a predictive value for the classification between model physiological ripples and epileptic ripples but indicate that the specificity is not sufficient for a reliable discrimination of single ripple events. The presented results suggest that a secure identification of epileptic ripples may be available to help identify the epileptic focus in the future.	biological markers;eighty;electrocorticogram;electroencephalography phase synchronization;epilepsy;eye movements;hard disk drive;hardiness zone;hybrid fibre-optic;intracranial hypertension;ion implantation;linkage (software);mathematical morphology;onset (audio);patients;random forest;receiver operator characteristics;ripple effect;seizures;sensitivity and specificity;sleep apnea syndromes;sleep stages;spindle;stage level 2;support vector machine;synapomorphy;waveform;wavelet	Jonas C.

Physicians were among the first to employ telephones as conversational instruments, but they also thought about the potential of these instruments to be used in medical practice as diagnostic tools. However, when applying it to the chest of a healthy person, no sounds—whether of breathing, voice, or cough —could be heard; it was clear that sounds could be heard just as well, or better, through the stethoscope [1] .	electrical engineering	Simon Reif-Acherman	2017	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2016.2634958	telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;biological engineering;physics	Mobile	10.58771898647631	-88.35717265834636	107386

For the effective application of this method as a successful treatment, improving the accuracy of the early seizure detection is crucial. In this paper, we proposed the application of a frequency-based algorithm derived from principal component analysis (PCA), and demonstrated improved efficacy for early seizure detection in a pilocarpine-induced epilepsy rat model. A total of 100 ictal electroencephalographs (EEG) during spontaneous recurrent seizures from 11 epileptic rats were finally included for the analysis. PCA was applied to the covariance matrix of a conventional EEG frequency band signal. Two PCA results were compared: one from the initial segment of seizures (5 sec of seizure onset) and the other from the whole segment of seizures. In order to compare the accuracy, we obtained the specific threshold satisfying the target performance from the training set, and compared the False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN), and Latency (Lat) of the PCA based feature derived from the initial segment of seizures to the other six features in the testing set. The PCA based feature derived from the initial segment of seizures performed significantly better than other features with a 1.40% FP, zero FN, and 0.14 s Lat. These results demonstrated that the proposed frequency-based feature from PCA that captures the characteristics of the initial phase of seizure was effective for early detection of seizures. Experiments with rat ictal EEGs showed an improved early seizure detection rate with PCA applied to the covariance of the initial 5 s segment of visual seizure onset instead of using the whole seizure segment or other conventional frequency bands.	arabic numeral 0;axon initial segment;bands;drug resistant epilepsy;early diagnosis;electric stimulation technique;electroencephalography;frequency band;functional electrical stimulation;interrupt latency;negative base;onset (audio);pilocarpine;principal component analysis;seizures;spontaneous order;test set;algorithm	Jiseon Lee;Junhee Park;Sejung Yang;Hani Kim;Yun Seo Choi;Hyeon Jin Kim;Hyang Woon Lee;Byung-Uk Lee	2017		10.3389/fninf.2017.00052	latency (engineering);machine learning;frequency band;covariance matrix;epilepsy;electroencephalography;principal component analysis;ictal;algorithm;computer science;speech recognition;covariance;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition	ML	16.916544256860668	-88.73466484315524	107387

Hence preventing lung diseases is more mandatory than curing them. Specialist doctors are less available in rural areas compared to urban areas. Thus it has become necessary to develop some method by which people in remote areas can be monitored by specialist doctors who might be far away. This paper proposes a method for preliminary detection of lung infections by analyzing lung sounds obtained by auscultation. To analyze the lung sounds, FFT was calculated and plotted. A number of pre-recorded lung sounds aided the analysis as well. Classification of lung sounds, as normal or adventitious, was done based on the variations observed in the above calculations. This data can be sent wirelessly via GSM/3G to the server in hospital where a specialist doctor can further analyze it for confirmation on lung infection.	fast fourier transform;plot (graphics);server (computing)	K.

It effect one in 5 adults and has several short term and long term bad side effects on health. Sleep apnea (SA) is the most important and common component of sleep disorders. This paper presents an automatic approach for detecting apnea events by using few bio-singles that are related to breathe defect. This work uses only air flow, thoracic and abdominal respiratory movement as input. The proposed algorithm consists of three main parts which are signal segmentation, feature generation and classification. A new proposed segmentation method intelligently segments the input signals for further classification, then features are generated for each segment by wavelet packet coefficients and also original signals. In classification phase a unique parallel PSO-SVM algorithm is investigated. PSO used to tune SVM parameters, and also data reduction. Proposed parallel structure used to help PSO to search space more efficiently, also avoiding fast convergence and local optimal results that are common problem in similar parallel algorithms. Obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and robust in sleep apnea detection and statistical tests on the results shown superiority of it versus previous methods even with more input signals, and also versus single PSO-SVM. Using fewer signals means more comfortable to subject and also, reduction of cost during recording the data.	british informatics olympiad;coefficient;exploit (computer security);microsoft windows;network packet;parallel algorithm;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;population;std bus;sensor;side effect (computer science);sleep (system call);sleep mode;software bug;statistical classification;support vector machine;swarm robotics;wake-sleep algorithm;wavelet	Yashar Maali;Adel Al-Jumaily	2012	2012 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	10.1109/CEC.2012.6256138	statistical classification;support vector machine;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	Web+IR	14.480493019479235	-90.65722364558236	107835

This system comprises three serial modules with following functions: (1) separation of crackles from vesicular sounds using a wavelet packet filter (WPST–NST); (2) detection of crackles by fractal dimension (FD); (3) classification of crackles based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM). The WPST–NST filter incorporates a multi-resolution decomposition of the original respiratory signal and an entropy-based best basis selection of the coefficients. Two thresholds are defined, in time and frequency domains respectively, to separate the crackles from the respiratory sounds. Then, a denoising filter is applied to the discontinuous output of WPST–NST and a crackle-peak-detector (CPD) localizes the individual crackles by means of their fractal dimension. After that, three feature parameters, including the Gaussian bandwidth (GBW), the peak frequency (PF) and the maximal deflection width (MDW), of the crackles are extracted. Finally, crackles are classified into fine crackles (FC) and coarse crackles (CC) using Gaussian mixture models.		Xiaoguang Lu;Mohammed Bahoura	2008	Biomed.

Current assistive devices are either passive, limited to only two dimensions or very powerful. However, for reach training, weight compensation and a little assistance with limited power is sufficient. We designed and evaluated a novel three-dimensional robotic manipulator, which is able to support the arm weight and assist functional reaching movements. Key points of the design are a damper-based drive train, giving an inherently safe system and its compact and lightweight design. The system is force actuated with a bandwidth of up to 2.3 Hz, which is sufficient for functional arm movements. Maximal assistive forces are 15 N for the up/down and forward/backward directions and 10 N for the left/right direction. Force tracking errors are smaller than 1.5 N for all axes and the total weight of the robot is 25 kg. Furthermore, the device has shown its benefit for increasing reaching distance in a single-case study with a stroke subject. The newly developed system has the technical ability to assist the arm during movement, which is a prerequisite for successful training of stroke survivors. Therapeutic effects of the applied assistance need to be further evaluated. However, with its inherent safety and ease of use, this newly developed system even has the potential for home-based therapeutic training after stroke.	assistive technology;cerebrovascular accident;damper device component;dimensions;hertz (hz);maximal set;movement;physical therapy exercises;robot;safety engineering;self-help devices;small;survivors;usability	Ard J.

In current decade, it has been popular to acquire and analyze ECG by wearable devices with main purposes of long-term monitoring and potential cardiac event prediction. In this study, we aimed at developing a real time and accurate R peak detection method which may be useful for ECG analysis in the wearable devices. The method was proposed to detect R peaks using an adaptive double threshold judging strategy integrated with a speeding research operation both applied on the first derivative of filtered ECG with a low pass filter. The performance of the proposed method was then verified against R peak manual annotations on ECG data of 70 subjects (including 32 heart failure patients) collected in a previous bicycle exercise experiment. The results showed a high R peak detection accuracy (sensitivity: 99.80%; positive predictivity: 99.89%) and a short computation time (mean ± standard deviation is 0.0472 ± 0.0039 s per 40 sec ECG data at a sampling rate of 200 Hz). The results in this study indicated that the proposed method is promising to be used for real time ECG R peak detection in wearable devices in the future.	computation;low-pass filter;sampling (signal processing);time complexity;wearable technology	Jian'ai Ma;Chao Shi;Zhimin Zhang;Jun Zhu;Penghong Zhan;Yubo Fan;Deyu Li;Ling Wang	2014	2014 7th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/BMEI.2014.7002781	real-time computing;computer science;band-pass filter;accuracy and precision;statistics	AI	16.152060072373036	-87.87108817291212	108460

Recent research shows that the addition of a tuning stage, using the individual component analysis (iPCA), results in improved classification performance. We propose and evaluate a set of novel configurations for the iPCA tuning, based on a biologically inspired optimization procedure, the artificial bee colony algorithm. This procedure is implemented and tested using two different cost functions, the traditional classification error and the proposed correlation factor, which involves lower computational effort. We compare the tuned system's performance, in terms of correct classifications, to that of a system tuned using two standard algorithms, the sequential forward selection and the sequential floating forward selection. The statistical analyses of the results don't find a significant difference among the classification performances associated with the search algorithms (p <; 0.01). On the other hand, they establish a significant difference among the classification performances related to the cost functions (p <; 0.02).	amputation;artificial bee colony algorithm;bees;classification;clustered file system;computation;control system;database tuning;electromyography;feature selection;inspiration function;loss function;mathematical optimization;mental suffering;movement;performance tuning;prosthesis;run time (program lifecycle phase);search algorithm;self-tuning;stepwise regression;subgroup;isopropyl cyanoacrylate	Guillermo A.

Aim: The aim of this work is to clarify whether SaD is the main factor determining the direction of APD response to β-adrenergic stimulation. Methods: AP-clamp with D epicardial, D endocardial, and GP waveforms was applied at different diastolic intervals (DI) to measure ISO-induced current (Iiso) in GP myocytes. Dynamic Clamp was used to test the effect of Ito introduction, and of the resulting SaD, on ISO modulation of GP repolarization. Results: In AP-clamp at DI 1750 ms, Iiso was more inward with both D and GP waveforms. In Dynamic-Clamp, SaD introduction failed to change the direction of ISO-induced APD changes in GP myocytes. Conclusions: SaD profile alone may not account for differences between D and GP in terms of APD response to β-adrenergic-stimulation. Further differences of AP profile and/or diverse contributions of Ca2+ and K+ currents between the two species may be involved.	ap computer science;action potential;apache pig;auditory processing disorder;cavia;clamper (electronics);clamping (graphics);diastole;diastolic blood pressure;direct inward dial;endocardial fibroelastosis;endocardium;isoproterenol;modulation;muscle cells;right heart strain;pamidronate	Luca Sala;Bence Hegyi;Chiara Bartolucci;Claudia Altomare;M.

Using the algorithm of pattern extraction (ALOPEX) extra-cellular action potentials (APs) recorded from frog (Rana Pipiens) auditory neurons were used as feedback to optimize sound stimuli. This computer-based system works in real time to iteratively find the neuron's best excitatory frequency (BEF). Three programmable (positive and negative) threshold logic levels are used to collect 300 APs in response to normalized pure tones. Fuzzy logic is then used to separate up to five fuzzy centers (templates) from the 300 APs. The fuzzy centers are used for on-line fuzzy mapping of future responses. The five fuzzy centers allow the system to monitor up to five neighboring neurons. To study the auditory neurons of the frog, one, two, and three simultaneous tones are used as the stimulus for optimization of the best combination of frequencies. Testing with the response calculated as a parabolic function of a single best frequency demonstrated system dynamics and reliability for up to nine simultaneous tones. Experiments using one pure tone and ten stimulus presentations per iteration showed that the automated system is able to repeatedly converge to the best frequency within 100 iterations. Studies using one, two, and then three pure tones played simultaneously on the same group of neurons has shown that these tones converged on the same best frequencies by properly mixing the tones available to produce the optimal complex sound.	alopex;action potentials;action potential;algorithm;anura;auditory processing disorder;bibliothèque des ecoles françaises d'athènes et de rome;clinical use template;cluster analysis;computer;converge;feedback;fuzzy clustering;fuzzy concept;fuzzy logic;hearing loss, high-frequency;hearing problem;iteration;logic level;mathematical optimization;neuron;online and offline;parabolic antenna;pattern recognition;real-time computing;supercomputer;system dynamics;ranpirnase;statistical cluster	Michael J.

In this publication a vibrotactile P300 based BCI is introduced. Two different approaches were tested: a first approach using three stimulators and a second one that utilizes eight stimulators for emitting the stimuli. The two paradigms were tested on 18 users: A group of twelve healthy users and a second group comprising of six patients suffering Locked-In Syndrome (LIS). The control accuracy was calculated for both groups, proving the feasibility of the device, not only for healthy people but also in severely disabled patients.	brain–computer interface;programming paradigm	Rupert Ortner;Zulay Lugo;Quentin Noirhomme;Steven Laureys;Christoph Guger	2014	2014 IEEE Haptics Symposium (HAPTICS)	10.1109/HAPTICS.2014.6775460	human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;communication	Visualization	12.967022103185768	-92.42113499339857	108932
38dda9fc1e015eeda06ea65b69c9ca45a4467408	contactless monitoring of breathing patterns and respiratory rate at the pit of the neck: a single camera approach		Vital signs monitoring is pivotal not only in clinical settings but also in home environments. Remote monitoring devices, systems, and services are emerging as tracking vital signs must be performed on a daily basis. Different types of sensors can be used to monitor breathing patterns and respiratory rate. However, the latter remains the least measured vital sign in several scenarios due to the intrusiveness of most adopted sensors. In this paper, we propose an inexpensive, off-the-shelf, and contactless measuring system for respiration signals taking as region of interest the pit of the neck. The system analyses video recorded by a single RGB camera and extracts the respiratory pattern from intensity variations of reflected light at the level of the collar bones and above the sternum. Breath-by-breath respiratory rate is then estimated from the processed breathing pattern. In addition, the effect of image resolution on monitoring breathing patterns and respiratory rate has been investigated. The proposed system was tested on twelve healthy volunteers (males and females) during quiet breathing at different sensor resolution (i.e., HD 720, PAL, WVGA, VGA, SVGA, and NTSC). Signals collected with the proposed system have been compared against a reference signal in both the frequency domain and time domain. By using the HD 720 resolution, frequency domain analysis showed perfect agreement between average breathing frequency values gathered by the proposed measuring system and reference instrument. An average mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.55 breaths/min was assessed in breath-by-breath monitoring in the time domain, while Bland-Altman showed a bias of −0.03 ± 1.78 breaths/min. Even in the case of lower camera resolution setting (i.e., NTSC), the system demonstrated good performances (MAE of 1.53 breaths/min, bias of −0.06 ± 2.08 breaths/min) for contactless monitoring of both breathing pattern and breath-by-breath respiratory rate over time.

90e6829767b371477a43f1cdc3443dd1b6c25a1d	voltage sensitive dye di-4-anneps prolongs impulse conduction through ventricles, but not through av node in isolated rabbit heart	di 4 anneps;heart;electrogram	Voltage sensitive dyes are widely used for recording of action potential in various cardiac studies. The elementary condition for its application is the fact that measured electrophysiological parameters would not be affected by the measuring procedure itself. The RR interval prolongation in the presence of the most frequently used voltage sensitive dye di-4-ANEPPS has been reported, but its exact mechanism is not known. In this study, the impact of di-4-ANEPPS on impulse conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node and through cardiac ventricles in isolated rabbit heart was examined. The impulse conduction through AV node in the presence of di-4-ANEPPS was prolonged only during dye loading in the 14th, 16th and 17th minute. Only sporadic AV blocks were observed. In comparison, the prolongation of impulse conduction through cardiac ventricles was observed from the 13th minute of loading and persisted to the end of this phase as well as over the whole wash out phase.	action potential;elementary;rapid refresh	Veronika Olejnícková;Marina Ronzhina;Oto Janousek;Jana Kolárová;Katerina Fialová;Ivo Provazník;Marie Nováková	2015	2015 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)	10.1109/CIC.2015.7411123	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;forensic engineering	EDA	18.57126884130872	-82.87765549029876	109234
d2fdfd64cf97be35f77500362538e7e08aa2a91f	automatic identification and classification of fetal heart-rate decelerations from cardiotocographic recordings		Cardiotocography (CTG) consists in the simultaneous recording of two distinct traces, the fetal heart rate (FHR; bpm) and the maternal uterine contractions (UCs; mmHg). CTG analysis consists in the evaluation of specific features of traces, among which fetal decelerations (DECs) are considered the “center-stage” since possibly related to fetal distress. DECs are classified based on their duration and occurrence in relation to UCs as prolonged, early, late and variable; each class associates to a specific status of the fetus health. Typically, CTG traces are visually interpreted; however, computerized CTG analysis may overcome subjectivity in CTG interpretation. Thus, this study proposes a new automatic algorithm for computerized identification and classification of DECs. The algorithm was tested on the 552 CTG recordings constituting the “CTU-CHB intra-partum CTG database” of Physionet. Of these, 470 (85.15%) were found suitable for automatic DECs identification and classification. Overall, 5888 DECs were identified, of which 3255 (55.28%) were classified while the other 2633 (44.72%) remained unclassified due to very strict preliminary classification criteria (now required for avoiding misclassifications). Among the classified DECs, 468 (14.38%) were classified as prolonged, 1498 (46.02%) as early, 32 (0.98%) as late, 1257 (38.62%) as variable. Thus, among the classified DECs, the most common are the early and the variable ones (overall 84.64%), the occurrence of which ranged from 0 to 14 DECs per recording. These findings are in agreement with what reported in literature. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm for automatic DECs identification and classification represents a useful tool for computerized CTG analysis.	automatic identification and data capture;cardiotocography;classification;coding tree unit;computers in human behavior;deceleration;fetal distress;fetal heart;fetal tissue;inventory;tracing (software);uterine contraction;uterus;algorithm;torr	Agnese Sbrollini;Amalia Carnicelli;Alessandra Massacci;Leonardo Tomaiuolo;Tommaso Zara;Ilaria Marcantoni;Luca Burattini;Micaela Morettini;Sandro Fioretti;Laura Burattini	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512432	computer vision;artificial intelligence;fetal distress;heart rate;cardiotocography;statistical classification;fetal heart rate decelerations;cardiology;internal medicine;computer science	SE	15.985696518880594	-87.431356965975	109274
d090e398c926752c53ca31bba41e258b2ee66bfb	automated identification of myocardial infarction using harmonic phase distribution pattern of ecg data		Incorporation of automated electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis techniques in home monitoring applications can ensure early detection of myocardial infarction (MI), thus reducing the risk of mortality. Most of the published techniques use advanced signal processing tools, a huge number of ECG features, and complex classifiers, which make their hardware implementation difficult. This paper proposes the use of harmonic phase distribution pattern of the ECG data for MI identification. The morphological and temporal changes of the ECG waveform caused by the presence of MI are reflected in the phase distribution pattern of the Fourier harmonics. Two discriminative features, clearly reflecting these variations, are identified for each of the three standard ECG leads (II, III, and V2). Classification of the healthy and MI data is performed using a threshold-based classification rule and logistic regression. The proposed technique has achieved an average detection accuracy of 95.6% with sensitivity and specificity of 96.5% and 92.7%, respectively, for classifying all types of MI data from the Physionet Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt diagnostic ECG database. The robustness of the algorithm is confirmed with real data as well. The algorithm is also implemented and validated on a microcontroller-based Arduino board, which can serve as a prototype ECG analysis device. Apart from providing comparable performance to other reported techniques, the proposed technique provides distinct advantages in terms of computational simplicity of the features, significantly reduced feature dimension, and use of simple linear classifiers which ensure faster and easier MI identification.	algorithm;arduino;biometrics;computation;decision boundary;embedded system;feature model;feature vector;galaxy morphological classification;harp;linear classifier;logistic regression;mathematical morphology;microcontroller;mobile device;prototype;sensitivity and specificity;signal processing;smartphone;waveform	Deboleena Sadhukhan;Saurabh Pal;Madhuchhanda Mitra	2018	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2018.2816458	electronic engineering;classification rule;discriminative model;robustness (computer science);harmonic analysis;time–frequency analysis;signal processing;feature extraction;waveform;artificial intelligence;mathematics;pattern recognition	Visualization	17.317460885558013	-89.97339582612217	109291
f5f6af389422821207fba9b923bbd1232f905a90	swallownet: recurrent neural network detects and characterizes eating patterns	microphones;sensors;monitoring;feature extraction;character recognition	Passively detecting and counting the number of swallows in food intake enables accurate detection of eating episodes in free-living participants, and aids in characterizing eating episodes. On average, the more food consumed, the greater the number of swallows; and swallows have been shown to positively correlate with caloric intake. While passive sensing measures have shown promise in recent years, they are yet to be used reliably to detect eating, impeding the development of timely intervention delivery that change poor eating behavior. This paper presents a novel integrated wearable necklace that comprises two piezoelectric sensors vertically positioned around the neck, an inertial motion unit, and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to detect and count swallows. A unique correlation of derivative features creates candidate swallows. To reduce the FPR features are extracted using symmetric and asymmetric windows surrounding each candidate swallow to feed into a Random Forest classifier. Independently, a LSTM network is trained from raw data using automated feature learning methods. In an in-lab study comprising confounding activities of 10 participants, results show a 3.34 RMSE of swallow count using LSTM, and a 76.07% average F-measure of swallows, outperforming the Random Forest classifier. This system thus shows promise in accurately detecting and characterizing eating patterns, enabling passive detection of swallow count, and paving the way for timely interventions to prevent problematic eating.	artificial neural network;feature learning;film-type patterned retarder;long short-term memory;microsoft windows;piezoelectricity;random forest;recurrent neural network;sensor;wearable computer	Dzung T.

We developed norms for regional cortical surface areas, thicknesses, and volumes based on cross-sectional MRI scans from 2713 healthy individuals aged 18 to 94 years using 23 samples provided by 21 independent research groups. The segmentation was conducted using FreeSurfer, a widely used and freely available automated segmentation software. Models predicting regional cortical estimates of each hemisphere were produced using age, sex, estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV), scanner manufacturer, magnetic field strength, and interactions as predictors. The explained variance for the left/right cortex was 76%/76% for surface area, 43%/42% for thickness, and 80%/80% for volume. The mean explained variance for all regions was 41% for surface areas, 27% for thicknesses, and 46% for volumes. Age, sex and eTIV predicted most of the explained variance for surface areas and volumes while age was the main predictors for thicknesses. Scanner characteristics generally predicted a limited amount of variance, but this effect was stronger for thicknesses than surface areas and volumes. For new individuals, estimates of their expected surface area, thickness and volume based on their characteristics and the scanner characteristics can be obtained using the derived formulas, as well as Z score effect sizes denoting the extent of the deviation from the normative sample. Models predicting normative values were validated in independent samples of healthy adults, showing satisfactory validation R2. Deviations from the normative sample were measured in individuals with mild Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia and expected patterns of deviations were observed.

We aim to assess whether quantitative epileptic graph analysis during interictal period may be helpful to predict the seizure onset zone of ictal iEEG. Using wavelet transform, cross-correlation coefficient, and multiple hypothesis test, we propose a differential connectivity graph (DCG) to represent the connections that change significantly between epileptic and nonepileptic states as defined by the interictal events. Post-processings based on mutual information and multiobjective optimization are proposed to localize the leading epileptic regions through DCG. The suggested approach is applied on iEEG recordings of five patients suffering from focal epilepsy. Quantitative comparisons of the proposed epileptic regions within ictal onset zones detected by visual inspection and using electrically stimulated seizures, reveal good performance of the present method.	allergy unit;bands;body fluid discharge;coefficient;cross-correlation;definite clause grammar;differential diagnosis;electricity;electroencephalography phase synchronization;epilepsies, partial;epilepsy;estimated;evaluation;focal (programming language);frequency band;graph - visual representation;internationalization and localization;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;mutual information;numerous;onset (audio);patients;seizures;silicon;statistical test;visual inspection;wavelet transform;c-ha-ras p21;electrode	Ladan Amini;Christian Jutten;Sophie Achard;Olivier David;Hamid Soltanian-Zadeh;Gholam-Ali Hossein-Zadeh;Philippe Kahane;Lorella Minotti;Laurent Vercueil	2011	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2010.2099227	computer simulation;neuroscience;machine learning;mathematics;communication;neurophysiology;statistics;wavelet transform	Visualization	21.215588771860812	-84.18733420320883	109771

This paper describes and compares two such approaches. The first is founded on a weighted graph mining technique whereby the ROI is represented using a tree structure which allows the application of a weighted graph mining technique to identify features of interest, which can then be used as the foundation with which to build a classifier. The second approach is founded on a time series analysis technique whereby the ROI are represented as time series which can then be used as the foundation for a Case Based Reasoner. The presented evaluation focuses on MRI brain scan data where the classification is focused on the corpus callosum, a distinctive region in MRI brain scan data.

Continuous random force disturbances were applied at the hand while the subjects were instructed to minimize the deviation resulting from the force disturbances. The results were analyzed in the frequency domain with frequency response functions (FRFs). Two FRFs were evaluated: 1) the mechanical admittance and 2) the reflexive impedance, expressing the dynamic relation between position and muscle activation (assessed via electromyography, EMG). The reflexive impedance is a direct measure of the proprioceptive reflexes. To record all relevant dynamical characteristics of the arm, wide bandwidth signals were used as force disturbance. Distributing the power of the signal over fewer frequencies within the bandwidth improved the signal-to-noise-ratio SNR of the EMG recordings, facilitating reliable estimation of the reflexive impedance. The coherence indicated that the relation between force disturbance and EMG is linear under the given conditions and improved with the SNR. The method of designing disturbance signals and the estimation of the reflexive impedance are useful for studies aiming to quantify proprioceptive reflexes and to investigate its functionality.	body position;characteristic impedance;decreased tendon reflex;electromyography;frequency response;input impedance;muscle;poor posture;quantitative impedance;reflex action;reflex, abnormal;signal-to-noise ratio;electric impedance	Alfred C.

29a8247f8b65779570c763c7270f01d4761d04dd	a weightless neural network as a classifier to translate eeg signals into robotic hand commands		Automatic movement-prothesis control aims to increase the quality of life for patients with diseases causing temporary or permanent paralysis or, in the worst case, the lost of limbs. This technology requires the interaction between the user and the device through a control interface that detects the useru0027s movement intention. Basing on the Motor-Imagery theory, many researchers have explored a wide variety of Classifiers to identify patientsu0027 physiological signals from many different sources in order to detect patientsu0027 moves intentions. We here propose a novel approach relying on the use of a Weightless Neural Network-based classifier, whose design lends itself to an easy hardware implementation. Additionally, we employ a non-invasive light weight and easy donning EEG-helmet in order to provide a portable controller interface. The developed interface is connected to a robotic hand for controlling open/close actions. We compared the proposed classifier with state of the art classifiers by showing that the proposed method achieves similar performance and contemporaneously represents a viable and practicable solution due to its portability on hardware devices, which will permit its direct implementation on the helmet board.	artificial neural network;best, worst and average case;electroencephalography;executable;heart rate variability;inter-protocol exploitation;robot;the quality of life;wearable computer;weightless (wireless communications)	Mariacarla Staffa;Mariangela Berardinelli;Giovanni Acampora;Maurizio Giordano;Massimo De Gregorio;Fanny Ficuciello	2018	2018 27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)	10.1109/ROMAN.2018.8525521	real-time computing;control theory;computer vision;artificial neural network;artificial intelligence;software portability;electroencephalography;weightless;classifier (linguistics);computer science	Robotics	11.692276964354392	-92.615005858723	110087

Artifact rejection prior to source localization largely enhances the localization accuracy. However, many BCI approaches neglect real-time artifact removal due to its time consuming processing. With cardiac artifact rejection for real-time analysis (CARTA), we introduce a novel algorithm capable of real-time cardiac artifact (CA) rejection. The method is based on constrained independent component analysis (ICA), where a priori information of the underlying source signal is used to optimize and accelerate signal decomposition. In CARTA, this is performed by estimating the subject's individual density distribution of the cardiac activity, which leads to a subject-specific signal decomposition algorithm. We show that the new method is capable of effectively reducing CAs within one iteration and a time delay of 1 ms. In contrast, Infomax and Extended Infomax ICA converged not until seven iterations, while FastICA needs at least ten iterations. CARTA was tested and applied to data from three different but most common MEG systems (4-D-Neuroimaging, VSM MedTech Inc., and Elekta Neuromag). Therefore, the new method contributes to reliable signal analysis utilizing BCI approaches.	algorithm;brain neoplasms;brain–computer interface;broadcast delay;computation (action);deny (action);elekta xio;estimated;fastica;heart diseases;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;infomax;iteration;magnetoencephalography;neuroimaging;neuroscience discipline;real-time clock;real-time transcription;rejection sampling;signal processing;viable system model;visual artifact	Lukas Breuer;Jürgen Dammers;Timothy P.

6a8b6d1a6f16d4a8a8ebd385a7a1103a28e48c5e	pressure ulcer risk detection from complexity of activity		Activity levels in nursing home residents were measured with accelerometers over one week as part of a multicenter randomized controlled trial, and complexity of the resulting activity patterns were characterized. Among 813 study participants on whom activity data had been collected, 16 participants developed pressure ulcers by the end of the study. The fractal dimension D0 of the activity series was lower (p=0.039) in residents who developed pressure ulcers than in controls matched on the basis of race, randomization group, score on the Braden scale, and diagnoses of cardiovascular disease and dementia. Hurst exponents indicated that the scaling of the power spectrum was close to 1/ƒ in pressure ulcer cases. At timescales exceeding 30 minutes, approximate entropy tended to be higher in the controls than in the pressure ulcer cases. The fractal structure of the activity time series and its information content offer the ability to predict higher risk of development of pressure ulcers in nursing home residents.	approximate entropy;cardiovascular diseases;dementia;fractal dimension;hurst exponent;image scaling;nursing homes;pressure ulcer;randomized algorithm;self-information;spectral density;test scaling;time series;accelerometers	Nikhil S.

The objective of this study was to investigate the combined effects of LBNP and bed rest on cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). RR and systolic blood pressure (SBP) recordings from seven volunteers were analyzed during a mild LBNP protocol consisting of three different levels of LBNP (-10 mmHg, -20 mmHg, -30 mmHg) before (pre-HDBR) and on day 50 of a HDBR study. Spectra of RR and SBP were computed and BRS was assessed in the low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) bands through a bivariate model that takes into account the causal relationships between heart rate (HR) and arterial blood pressure. HR significantly increased from BL in HDBR for LBNP≤-20 mmHg. BRS gain decreased significantly in the LF band with increasing levels of LBNP in both conditions. BRS gain was significantly lower on day 50 of HDBR with respect to pre-HDBR at -20 mmHg. These data suggest that BRS in the LF range is reduced in bed rest, and these changes may be due primarily to a reduction in plasma volume associated with bed rest, which impact the physiological responses of autonomic control of circulation.	autonomic computing;bl (logic);brs/search;bands;baroreflex;bed rest;bivariate data;blood plasma volume;cardiovascular diseases;causality;dentin sensitivity;lower body negative pressure;plasma display;protocols documentation;rca spectra 70;rapid refresh;sbp;sensitivity and specificity;simulation;torr	Guadalupe Dorantes-Méndez;Manuela Ferrario;Giuseppe Baselli;Philippe P Arbeille;J.

Right decubitus position is a vagal enhancer in coronary and congestive heart disease. We evaluated vagal modulation before and after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 30 patients. Heart rate variability (HRV) indexes in frequency domain were calculated from 10-min digital electrocardiograms. Kolmogorov-Smirnov and paired t-tests were applied, p<0.05 was considered significant. The HRV indexes decreased after CABG. Higher LF/HF ratio and shorter mean RR were observed in right recumbent position postoperatively. Right lateral decubitus position did not give rise to higher vagal modulation after heart surgery.

b9b623a5d6068f21b1883f70ad054ab5b4c47c80	comparison of general purpose ecg analyzers in patients with an implanted crt device		Many QRS boundaries detectors have been previously proposed and have showed good performance with conventional ECG databases. In this study, two of such algorithms, one based on empirical mode decomposition and one based on the curve-length transformation were tested against a database obtained from patients with an implanted CRT device. This is a case of interest since increased QRS duration is a crucial clinical criteria for CRT implantation and also because the alterations on QRS morphology and stimulation artefacts present in these cases may mislead general purpose algorithms. Results showed that both methods were incapable of accurately measure QRS duration, showing significant differences (p<0,05) respect to measures obtained from expert annotation. Average errors of 17±9 and −22±19ms in the estimation of the duration of the QRS complex were obtained with EMD and CLT methods respectively. These results highlight the necessity of validating general purpose algorithms before using them in more concrete scenarios.	algorithm;cathode ray tube;database;hilbert–huang transform;ion implantation;mathematical morphology;sensor	Jaime Yagüe-Mayans;Santiago Jiménez-Serrano;Pau Alonso Fernandez;Raquel Cervigón Abad;Conrado J.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a common nonevasive and nonexpensive technique that can easily be used in clinical settings to identify brain functional abnormalities. Only few studies had identified EEG abnormalities that can predict PD patients at higher risk for dementia. Brain connectivity EEG measures, such as multiscale entropy (MSE) and phase-locking value (PLV) analyses, may be more informative and sensitive to brain alterations leading to dementia than previously used methods. This study followed 62 dementia-free PD patients for a mean of 3.4 years to identify cerebral alterations that are associated with dementia. Baseline resting state EEG of patients who developed dementia (N = 18) was compared to those of patients who remained dementia-free (N = 44) and of 37 healthy subjects. MSE and PLV analyses were performed. Partial least squares statistical analysis revealed group differences associated with the development of dementia. Patients who developed dementia showed higher signal complexity and lower PLVs in low frequencies (mainly in delta frequency) than patients who remained dementia-free and controls. Conversely, both patient groups showed lower signal variability and higher PLVs in high frequencies (mainly in gamma frequency) compared to controls, with the strongest effect in patients who developed dementia. These findings suggest that specific disruptions of brain communication can be measured before PD patients develop dementia, providing a new potential marker to identify patients at highest risk of developing dementia and who are the best candidates for neuroprotective trials.

557c5ca364f86b665311d0efcbf54b9888179a31	application of higher order statistics for atrial arrhythmia classification	independent component analysis;atrial flutter;atrial fibrillation;classifier;higher order spectra;electrocardiogram	Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are the two common atrial arrhythmia encountered in the clinical practice. In order to diagnose these abnormalities the electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used. The conventional linear time and frequency domain methods cannot decipher the hidden complexity present in these signals. The ECG is inherently a non-linear, non-stationary and non-Gaussian signal. The non-linear models can provide improved results and capture minute variations present in the time series. Higher order spectra (HOS) is a non-linear dynamical method which is highly rugged to noise. In the present study, the performances of two methods are compared: (i) 3rd order HOS cumulants and (ii) HOS bispectrum. The 3rd order cumulant and bispectrum coefficients are subjected to dimensionality reduction using independent component analysis (ICA) and classified using classification and regression tree (CART), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers to select the best classifier. The ICA components of cumulant coefficients have provided the average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of 99.50%, 100%, 99.22% and 99.72% respectively using KNN classifier. Similarly, the ICA components of HOS bispectrum coefficients have yielded the average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and PPV of 97.65%, 98.16%, 98.75% and 99.53% respectively using KNN. So, the ICA performed on the 3rd order HOS cumulants coupled with KNN classifier performed better than the HOS bispectrum method. The proposed methodology is robust and can be used in mass nts. screening of cardiac patie	artificial neural network;bispectrum;coefficient;decision tree learning;dimensionality reduction;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;linear model;nonlinear system;performance;radio frequency;random forest;relative atrial index;rugged computer;sensitivity and specificity;stationary process;time complexity;time series;wow and flutter measurement;american fuzzy lop	Roshan Joy Martis;U.

The random effects in a mixed-effects model can be used to capture the correlations among repeated measurements within a subject. Mixed effects model can be used to describe individual response profile as well as population response profile. In this manuscript, we apply mixed-effects models to the repeated measurements of cardiac function variables including heart rate, coronary flow, and left ventricle developed pressure (LVDP) in the isolated, Langendorff-perfused hearts of glutathione s-transferase P1/P2 (GSTP) gene knockout and wild-type mice. Cardiac function was measured before and during ischemia/reperfusion injury in these hearts. To describe the dynamics of each cardiac function variable during the entire experiment, we developed piecewise nonlinear mixed-effects models and a change point nonlinear mixed effect model. These models can be used to examine how cardiac function variables were altered by ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury and to compare the cardiac function variable between genetically engineered (null or transgenic) mice and wild-type mice. Hypothesis tests were constructed to evaluate the impact of deletion of GSTP gene for different cardiac function variables. These findings provide a new application for mixed-effects models in physiological and pharmacological studies of the isolated Langendorff-perfused heart.		Hyejeong Jang;Daniel J.

From these segments, the local time-frequency structures of the signal are estimated by using a four-parameter chirplet decomposition. Entitled the windowed adaptive chirplet transform (windowed ACT), this approach is applied to the analysis of visual evoked potentials (VEPs). It can provide a unified and compact representation of VEPs from the transient buildup to the steady-state portion with less computational cost than its non-windowed counterpart. This paper also details a method to select the optimal window length for signal segmentation. This approach will be useful for long-term signal monitoring as well as for signal feature extraction and data compression.	acoustic evoked brain stem potentials;algorithmic efficiency;buildup;chirplet transform;computation;data compression;feature extraction;population parameter;steady state;visual evoked cortical potential;window function	Jie Cui;Willy Wong	2008	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2008.918439	data compression;neuroplasticity;computer vision;electronic engineering;neuroscience;speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;electroencephalography;feature extraction;computer science;adhesive;local time;silicon;chirplet transform;steady state;chirp;neurophysiology;physics;wavelet transform	Visualization	20.91376406691329	-87.90345866319292	111068

Besides ictal onsets, localization of interictal epileptiform discharges provides additional information to plan resective epilepsy surgery. The main goals of this study were: 1) to develop a reliable automatic algorithm to detect high and low amplitude interictal epileptiform discharges in intracranial EEG recordings and 2) to design a clustering method to extract spatial patterns of their propagation. For detection, we used a signal envelope modeling technique which adaptively identifies statistical parameters of signals containing spikes. Application of this technique to human intracranial EEG data demonstrated that it was superior to expert labeling and it was able to detect even small amplitude interictal epileptiform discharges. In the second task, detected spikes were clustered by principal component analysis according to their spatial distribution. Preliminary results showed that this unsupervised approach is able to identify distinct sources of interictal epileptiform discharges and has the potential to increase the yield of presurgical examination by improved delineation of the irritative zone.	algorithm;cluster analysis;electrocorticography;electroencephalography;principal component analysis;software propagation;unsupervised learning	Radek Janca;Petr Jezdik;Roman Cmejla;Pavel Krsek;John G.

The sensor, called a """"ring sensor,"""" is attached to a finger base for monitoring beat-to-beat pulsation, and the data is sent to a host computer via a radio-frequency transmitter. Two major design issues are addressed: one is to minimize motion artifact and the other is to minimize the consumption of battery power. An efficient double ring design is developed to lower the influence of external force, acceleration, and ambient light, and to hold the sensor gently and securely on the skin, so that the circulation at the finger may not be obstructed. Total power consumption is analyzed in relation to characteristics of individual components, sampling rate, and CPU clock speed. Optimal operating conditions are obtained for minimizing the power budget. A prototype ring sensor is designed and built based on the power budget analysis and the artifact-resistive attachment method. It is verified through experiments that the ring sensor is resistant to interfering forces and acceleration acting on the ring body. Benchmarking tests with FDA-approved PPG and electrocardiogram reveal that the ring sensor is comparable to those devices in detecting beat-to-beat pulsation despite disturbances."""	artifact (error);attachments;central processing unit;clock rate;dental high-speed technique;electrocardiography;experiment;host (network);prototype;radio frequency;srgn gene;sampling (signal processing);transmitter device component;sensor (device)	Sokwoo Rhee;Boo-Ho Yang;H.

However, it is unknown to what extent it is affected by between- and within-subject variability during sleep. As it is hypothesized that the variability is caused by differences in subject demographics (age, gender, and body mass index), time, and physiology, we quantified these effects and investigated how they limit reliable cardiorespiratory-based sleep staging. Six representative parameters obtained from 165 overnight heartbeat and respiration recordings were analyzed. Multilevel models were used to evaluate the effects evoked by differences in sleep stages, demographics, time, and physiology between and within subjects. Results show that the between- and within-subject effects were found to be significant for each parameter. When adjusted by sleep stages, the effects in physiology between and within subjects explained more than 80% of total variance but the time and demographic effects explained less. If these effects are corrected, profound improvements in sleep staging can be observed. These results indicate that the differences in subject demographics, time, and physiology present significant effects on cardiorespiratory activity during sleep. The primary effects come from the physiological variability between and within subjects, markedly limiting the sleep staging performance. Efforts to diminish these effects will be the main challenge.	autonomic computing;body mass index;demography;disk staging;eighty;heart rate variability;human body weight;multilevel model;population parameter;sample variance;sleep apnea syndromes;sleep stages;spatial variability;physiological aspects	Xi Long;Reinder Haakma;Tim R.

6df76238266acbebe4c3754dc2798a5ccdd602ad	improvement and validation of an automated neonatal seizure detector	neonatal seizure detection;neonatal eeg;sista;epilepsy	We present the improvements made to and subsequent validation of an automated approach to detect neonatal seizures. The evaluation of the algorithm has been performed on a new and extensive data set of neonatal EEGs. Previously, we have classified neonatal seizures visually into two types: the spike train and oscillatory type of seizures and developed two separate algorithms that run in parallel for their automated detection. The first algorithm analyzes the correlation between high-energetic segments of the EEG, whereas the second one detects increases in low-frequency activity (<8 Hz) and then uses an autocorrelation. An improved version of our automated system (called ‘NeoGuard’) uses more informative features for classification and optimized parameters for thresholding. The validation was performed on 756 hours of ‘unseen’ continuous EEG monitoring data from 24 neonates with encephalopathy and recorded seizures. The seizure detection system showed a median sensitivity of 86.9 % per patient, positive predictive value (PPV) of 89.5 % and false positive rate of 0.28 per hour. The modified algorithm has a high sensitivity combined with a good PPV whereas false positive rate is much lower compared to the previous version of the algorithm.	action potential;algorithm;autocorrelation;electroencephalography;information;map (parallel pattern);the spike (1997);thresholding (image processing)	Perumpillichira J.

However, very often devices used to record ECG also record at the same time many other physiological signals containing useful information about heart rate. In the case of the poor ECG quality or its absence information about beats is lost. This raises the need for robust algorithms which could locate heartbeats in continuous long-term data from bedside monitors, allowing reliable, automatic analysis.	algorithm;heart rate variability;multimodal interaction;sensor	Jan Gieraltowski;Kamil Ciuchcinski;Iga Grzegorczyk;Katarzyna Kosna;Mateusz Solinski;Piotr Podziemski	2014	Computing in Cardiology 2014		speech recognition;computer science;biological engineering;cardiology	HCI	16.01787701282327	-87.545096863101	111357

In this framework, the phase space trajectory is reconstructed and the underlying dynamics of the brain at different mental states are identified by analyzing the shape of this trajectory. Two sets of features based on affine-invariant moments and distance series transform allow robust estimation of the properties of the phase space trajectory while maintaining real-time performance. We describe the methodological details and practical implementation of the new framework and perform experimental verification using datasets from BCI competitions II and IV. The results showed excellent performance for using the new features as compared to competition winners and recent research on the same datasets providing best results in Graz2003 dataset and outperforming competition hase space reconstruction (PSR) winner in 6 out of 9 subject in Graz2008 dataset. Furthermore, the computation times needed with the new methods were confirmed to permit real-time processing. The combination of more detailed description of the nonlinear dynamics of EEG and meeting online processing goals by the new methods offers great potential for several time-critical BCI applications such as prosthetic arm control or mental state monitoring for safety. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

cfffe2e4389fe68d5b79871086c5e57ec50ed973	inherent physiological artifacts in eeg during tdcs	electrocardiogram (ecg);electroencephalography (eeg);finite element method (fem);physiological artifact;transcranial direct current stimulation (tdcs);transcranial electric stimulation (tes)	Online imaging and neuromodulation is invalid if stimulation distorts measurements beyond the point of accurate measurement. In theory, combining transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) with electroencephalography (EEG) is compelling, as both use non-invasive electrodes and image-guided dose can be informed by the reciprocity principle. To distinguish real changes in EEG from stimulation artifacts, prior studies applied conventional signal processing techniques (e.g. high-pass filtering, ICA). Here, we address the assumptions underlying the suitability of these approaches. We distinguish physiological artifacts - defined as artifacts resulting from interactions between the stimulation induced voltage and the body and so inherent regardless of tDCS or EEG hardware performance - from methodology-related artifacts - arising from non-ideal experimental conditions or non-ideal stimulation and recording equipment performance. Critically, we identify inherent physiological artifacts which are present in all online EEG-tDCS: 1) cardiac distortion and 2) ocular motor distortion. In conjunction, non-inherent physiological artifacts which can be minimized in most experimental conditions include: 1) motion and 2) myogenic distortion. Artifact dynamics were analyzed for varying stimulation parameters (montage, polarity, current) and stimulation hardware. Together with concurrent physiological monitoring (ECG, respiration, ocular, EMG, head motion), and current flow modeling, each physiological artifact was explained by biological source-specific body impedance changes, leading to incremental changes in scalp DC voltage that are significantly larger than real neural signals. Because these artifacts modulate the DC voltage and scale with applied current, they are dose specific such that their contamination cannot be accounted for by conventional experimental controls (e.g. differing stimulation montage or current as a control). Moreover, because the EEG artifacts introduced by physiologic processes during tDCS are high dimensional (as indicated by Generalized Singular Value Decomposition- GSVD), non-stationary, and overlap highly with neurogenic frequencies, these artifacts cannot be easily removed with conventional signal processing techniques. Spatial filtering techniques (GSVD) suggest that the removal of physiological artifacts would significantly degrade signal integrity. Physiological artifacts, as defined here, would emerge only during tDCS, thus processing techniques typically applied to EEG in the absence of tDCS would not be suitable for artifact removal during tDCS. All concurrent EEG-tDCS must account for physiological artifacts that are a) present regardless of equipment used, and b) broadband and confound a broad range of experiments (e.g. oscillatory activity and event related potentials). Removal of these artifacts requires the recognition of their non-stationary, physiology-specific dynamics, and individualized nature. We present a broad taxonomy of artifacts (non/stimulation related), and suggest possible approaches and challenges to denoising online EEG-tDCS stimulation artifacts.	alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma;antibody to islet cells of pancreas measurement;conflict (psychology);electroencephalography phase synchronization;excision;increment;large;legal patent;monitoring, physiologic;morphologic artifacts;motor neuron disease;satellite cells, skeletal muscle;singular;taxonomy;transcranial direct current stimulation;attribution;electrode;physiological aspects;polarity;voltage	Nigel Gebodh;Zeinab Esmaeilpour;Devin K Adair;K.

EEG signals are collected from six children aged between two to six years old during opened and closed eyes tasks. For each time-sample, Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) is applied to EEG time series to compute the source-temporal-features that are assigned to x, y and z coordinates. The features are classified using neural network. The results show an accuracy of around 100% for eyes open task and around (83%-95%) for eyes closed tasks for the same subject. This study highlights the use of new types of features (source-temporal features), to characterize the brain functional behavior.	electroencephalography;sensor	Wafaa Khazaal Shams;Abdul Wahab;Uvais A.

348e15e646a09b9e9a664fb3316569086fb4ad6d	dynamic screening of autistic children in various mental states using pattern of connectivity between brain regions	t technology general;autism screening;connectivity feature;pattern recognition;affective face perception;eeg	A dynamic strategy for screening of ASD is proposed based on patterns of information flow between 8 brain regions.The EEG data is collected from 12 healthy and 6 autistic children in the age of 7 to10 years old.The subjects are then classified as autistic or healthy based on the connectivity features.The connectivity features are also compared with other established methods.The promising recognition rates of ?93% were achieved in this study.This study shows that patterns of functional and effective connectivity in ASD subjects are different from healthy subjects. In this study, a dynamic screening strategy is proposed to discriminate subjects with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) from healthy controls. The ASD is defined as a neurodevelopmental disorder that disrupts normal patterns of connectivity between the brain regions. Therefore, the potential use of such abnormality for autism screening is investigated. The connectivity patterns are estimated from electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from 8 brain regions under various mental states. The EEG data of 12 healthy controls and 6 autistic children (age matched in 7-10) were collected during eyes-open and eyes-close resting states as well as when subjects were exposed to affective faces (happy, sad and calm). Subsequently, the subjects were classified as autistic or healthy groups based on their brain connectivity patterns using pattern recognition techniques. Performance of the proposed system in each mental state is separately evaluated. The results present higher recognition rates using functional connectivity features when compared against other existing feature extraction methods.	mental state	Reza Khosrowabadi;Hiok Chai Quek;Kai Keng Ang;Abdul Wahab;Shen-Hsing Annabel Chen	2015	Appl.

Wavelet-based neural network model, employing the multilayer perceptron, was used for analysis of the internal carotid arterial Doppler signals. Multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) trained with the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm was used to detect stenosis and occlusion in internal carotid arteries. In order to determine the MLPNN inputs, spectral analysis of the internal carotid arterial Doppler signals was performed using wavelet transform (WT). The MLPNN was trained, cross validated, and tested with training, cross validation, and testing sets, respectively. All these data sets were obtained from internal carotid arteries of healthy subjects, subjects suffering from internal carotid artery stenosis and occlusion. The correct classification rate was 96% for healthy subjects, 96.15% for subjects having internal carotid artery stenosis and 96.30% for subjects having internal carotid artery occlusion. The classification results showed that the MLPNN trained with the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm was effective to detect internal carotid artery stenosis and occlusion.	arterial stenosis;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;carotid arteries;carotid stenosis;carotid artery occlusion;classification;coefficient;cross-validation (statistics);hidden surface determination;internal carotid artery structure;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;mental suffering;multilayer perceptron;network model;nonlinear system;occlusion of artery (disorder);sensor;signal processing;spectral density estimation;wavelet transform;weight;triangulation	Elif Derya Übeyli;Inan Güler	2005	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-005-7992-1	radiology;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;computer science;machine learning;artificial neural network;surgery;cardiology	ML	16.986147693765115	-89.67262078412679	111927
b8a376716491ba5f729d0cf3df10dd42715ab1cc	real time driving data collection and driver verification using cmac-mfcc	real time;data collection	There have been numerous studies in understanding driver behavior for purpose of understanding contributing factors to high accident rates. Driving abnormalities could be one of the many factors affecting accidents and if it can be detected this will help prevent accidents. In this paper we present simple and effective methods for an in-car data acquisition in collecting real time driving data. These data will be used to investigate the effectiveness of driver behavior, focusing on driver’s response to the brake and gas pedals as well as its rate of change. From these data, we will demonstrate simple yet effective technique in driver verification. Driver profiles were created using the cerebellum model articulation controller (CMAC) feature map taking inputs from the brake and gas pedals pressure signals. From the CMAC outputs, relevant features were extracted using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC). These features were used to verify drivers using multi layer perceptron (MLP) as classifiers. The performance of the driver verification indicates positive development in the area of intelligent vehicle driver verification system that may enhance the driver’s security, safety and comfort in driving.	biconnected component;coefficient;data acquisition;mel-frequency cepstrum;one-key mac;perceptron;quad flat no-leads package	Mohammad Khalid Ahmad;Abdul Wahab;Norhaslinda Kamaruddin	2008			embedded system;computer science;statistics;data collection	HCI	12.439556215957463	-89.71895223415116	112194

The approach is tested on several local field potentials (LFPs) and information quantification is carried out in spectral domain using Shannon's Information. The study suggests that not all IMFs are information carriers. It is found that the 1st IMF carries 60-80% of the total information from original LFP and few informative IMFs are usually the main information carriers. Adding more IMFs does not increase the information level. For different datasets, the order of the informative IMFs varies and by using information preserving EMD, only few IMFs are retained to provide a simplified representation of underlying oscillations contained in LFPs.	hilbert–huang transform	Zareen Mehboob;Hujun Yin	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04394-9_28	local field potential;theoretical computer science;machine learning;data mining;mathematics	HCI	18.83359802739697	-92.2102451457906	112196

The hemodynamic changes that accompany IEDs are poorly understood and may be critical for understanding epileptogenesis. Despite a known linear coupling of the neurovascular elements in normal brain tissues, previous simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown variable correlations between epileptic discharges and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response, partly because most previous studies assumed particular hemodynamic properties in normal brain tissue. The occurrence of IEDs in human subjects is unpredictable. Therefore, an animal model with reproducible stereotyped IEDs was developed by the focal injection of penicillin into the right occipital cortex of rats anesthetized with isoflurane. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was used to study the hemodynamic changes during IEDs. A hybrid of temporal independent component analysis (ICA) of EEG and spatial ICA of fMRI data was used to correlate BOLD fMRI signals with IEDs. A linear autoregression with exogenous input (ARX) model was used to estimate the hemodynamic impulse response function (HIRF) based on the data from simultaneous EEG-fMRI measurement. Changes in the measured BOLD signal from the right primary visual cortex and bilateral visual association cortices were consistently coupled to IEDs. The linear ARX model was applied here to confirm that a linear transform can be used to study the correlation between BOLD signal and its corresponding neural activity in this animal model of occipital epilepsy.	aliolus sp. 3 bold:aaw1843;arx;area striata structure;autoregressive model;bilateral filter;body fluid discharge;cell respiration;cerebral cortex;electroencephalography;epilepsy;focal (programming language);frequency response;hemodynamics;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;isoflurane;myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile;penicillins;resonance;seizures;stereotyping;fmri	Seyed M.

Kinematic and dynamic variables were recorded at 1,000 Hz and used to derive a set of variables to correlate with the psychophysical outcome. These included position, velocity, kinetic energy, instantaneous force (based on acceleration), mean force, and variability of the z-axis force signal from the power spectral density. The analysis implicates power of the force signal as the physical correlate of perceived roughness of sinusoidal textures. The relationship between power and roughness held across the range of spatial periods examined.	apache axis;axis vertebra;contribution;file spanning;haptic device component;haptic technology;hertz (hz);interface device component;kinetics;muscle rigidity;spatial variability;spectral density;texture mapping;velocity (software development)	Bertram J.

In fact, the vocal folds, the main organ responsible of producing voice, is damaged by smoke so that its structure and its vibration are altered. Some bio-mechanical features, describing vocals folds behavior and status are used. They are based on the two-mass model which characterizes vocal folds by the mass, the stiffness and the losses of their cover and body parts. Bio-mechanical features of smokers and non-smokers are analyzed and compared to select relevant features permitting to discriminate between the two categories of speakers. The Quadratic Discriminant Analysis is used as a tool of classification and shows a relatively good rate of detection of smokers.	british informatics olympiad;linear discriminant analysis;quadratic classifier	Sofia Ben Jebara	2014	2014 22nd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		speech recognition;acoustics;engineering;communication	Robotics	15.052986859879763	-90.02848266603146	112873
06f78322c90c5cf0cda8a6ae4f42ca6a025dba46	effect of stimulus parameters in the treatment of seizures by electrical stimulation in the kainate animal model	electric stimulation;kainate animal model;bi phasic stimulation;animal model;responsive focal stimulation;epilepsy	Preliminary results from animal and clinical studies demonstrate that electrical stimulation of brain structures can reduce seizure frequency in patients with refractory epilepsy. Since most researchers derive stimulation parameters by trial and error, it is unclear what stimulation frequency, amplitude and duration constitutes a set of optimal stimulation parameters for aborting seizure activity in a given patient. In this investigation, we begin to quantify the independent effects of stimulation parameters on electrographic seizures, such that they could be used to develop an efficient closed-loop prosthesis that intervenes before the clinical onset of a seizure and seizure generalization. Biphasic stimulation is manually delivered to the hippocampus in response to a visually detected electrographic seizure. Such focal, responsive stimulation allows for anti-seizure treatment delivery with improved temporal and spatial specificity over conventional open-loop stimulation paradigms, with the possibility of avoiding tissue damage stemming from excessive exposure to electrical stimulation. We retrospectively examine the effects of stimulation frequency (low, medium and high), pulse-width (low and high) and amplitude (low and high) in seizures recorded from 23 kainic acid treated rats. We also consider the effects of total charge delivered and the rate of charge delivery, and identify stimulation parameter sets that induce after-discharges or more seizures. Among the stimulation parameters evaluated, we note 2 major findings. First, stimulation frequency is a key parameter for inhibiting seizure activity; the anti-seizure effect cannot be attributed to only the charge delivered per phase. Second, an after-discharge curve shows that as the frequency and pulse-width of stimulation increases, smaller pulse amplitudes are capable of eliciting an after-discharge. It is expected that stimulation parameter optimization will lead to devices with enhanced treatment efficacies and reduced side-effect profiles, especially when used in conjunction with seizure prediction or detection algorithms in a closed-loop control application.	body fluid discharge;control theory;discharger;drug resistant epilepsy;electric stimulation technique;electrical stimulation electrode type;focal (programming language);functional electrical stimulation;generalization (psychology);inhibition;kainate;kainic acid;mathematical optimization;onset (audio);patients;population parameter;pulse-density modulation;sacral nerve stimulation;seizures;sensitivity and specificity;small;stemming;transcranial electrical stimulation;algorithm;width	Pooja Rajdev;Matthew P.

03bda03c37488243baa9b06f3a47a8b634bb78d6	a novel few-channel strategy for removing muscle artifacts from multichannel eeg data		Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are often contaminated by muscle artifacts. Various methods have been proposed to suppress muscle artifacts from multichannel EEG recordings. However, the existing multichannel approaches have their own limitations. Instead of using multichannel techniques, in this paper, we propose an effective few-channel technique that combines multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) with canonical correlation analysis (CCA), termed as MEMD-CCA, to remove muscle artifacts from multichannel EEG recordings. The proposed method consists of two steps. First, the proposed method partitions multichannel EEG into several few-channel EEG groups and deals with each group individually. Next, MEMD is utilized to decompose every few-channel EEG groups into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and then CCA is applied on the IMFs to separate sources related to muscle activity. We compare the denoising performance between multichannel and few-channel approaches through simulated and real-life EEG data contaminated by muscle artifacts. The results demonstrate the advantage of few-channel approaches over multichannel ones for rejecting muscle artifacts without altering the desired EEG information.	electroencephalography;hilbert–huang transform;noise reduction;real life	Xueyuan Xu;Aiping Liu;Xun Chen	2017	2017 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)	10.1109/GlobalSIP.2017.8309106	hilbert–huang transform;canonical correlation;noise reduction;multivariate statistics;electroencephalography;communication channel;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;computer science	Robotics	21.285548667003447	-89.80690374544187	113039

Patients with ET exhibit a complex progressive and disabling tremor, and medical management often fails. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been successfully applied to this disorder, however there has been no quantifiable way to measure tremor severity or treatment efficacy in this patient population. The quantified amelioration of kinetic tremor via DBS is herein demonstrated through the application of a smartphone (iPhone) as a wireless accelerometer platform. The recorded acceleration signal can be obtained at a setting of the subject's convenience and conveyed by wireless transmission through the Internet for post-processing anywhere in the world. Further post-processing of the acceleration signal can be classified through a machine learning application, such as the support vector machine. Preliminary application of deep brain stimulation with a smartphone for acquisition of a feature set and machine learning for classification has been successfully applied. The support vector machine achieved 100% classification between deep brain stimulation in `on' and `off' mode based on the recording of an accelerometer signal through a smartphone as a wireless accelerometer platform.	action tremor;amelioration pattern;back;bilateral filter;cell nucleus;classification;deep brain stimulation;direct-broadcast satellite;essential tremor;feedback;implants;internet;kinetics;machine learning;miniaturization;movement disorders;node - plant part;patients;real-time clock;smartphone;support vector machine;tablet dosage form;tablet computer;thalamic structure;video post-processing;accelerometers;neurostimulation	Robert LeMoyne;Nestor Tomycz;Timothy Mastroianni;Cyrus McCandless;Michael Cozza;David Peduto	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319948	embedded system;text mining;medical research;simulation;computer science;engineering;biological engineering	Mobile	10.22621580224565	-87.57439744154014	113060

The aims of automated processing are on one side to ease the work of medical doctors and on the other side to make the evaluation more objective. This paper addresses the problem of computer-assisted sleep staging. It describes ongoing research in this area. The proposed solution comprises several consecutive steps, namely EEG signal pre-processing, feature extraction, feature normalization, and application of decision trees for classification. The work is focused on the feature extraction step that is regarded as the most important one in the classification process.	autoregressive model;coefficient;decision tree;disk staging;electroencephalography;experiment;feature extraction;preprocessor;the quality of life;wavelet transform	Lenka Lhotská;Václav Gerla;Jiri Bukartyk;Vladimir Krajca;Svojmil Petránek	2008			wavelet;constant q transform;harmonic wavelet transform;second-generation wavelet transform;continuous wavelet transform;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;wavelet packet decomposition;stationary wavelet transform;discrete wavelet transform;fast wavelet transform;lifting scheme;wavelet transform	ML	16.72559106695108	-89.70199997086522	113356

The method consists of three steps: first, empirical modes are extracted from the signals; those functions carry non-linear and non-stationary components in frequency limited bands. Second, the empirical modes are Hilbert transformed, resulting in very sharply localized ridges in the time- frequency plane; the obtained time-frequency representations are known as Huang-Hilbert spectra. At last, the latter are pairwise aligned by means of the stochastic-event synchrony method (SES), a recently proposed procedure to match pairs of multi-dimensional point processes. The level of similarity of two Huang-Hilbert spectra is quantified by three parameters: timing and frequency jitter of coincident ridges, and fraction of non-coincident ridges. The proposed method is used to detect steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) in electroencephalography (EEG) signals; numerical results indicate that the method is vastly more sensitive to SSVEP than classical synchrony measures, and therefore, it may prove to be useful in applications such as brain-computer interfaces. Although the paper mostly deals with EEG, the presented synchrony measure may also be applied to other kinds of time series."""	accessible surface area;brain–computer interface;coherence (physics);electroencephalography;gene regulatory network;hilbert space;interdependence;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;peripheral;scsi enclosure services;stationary process;steady state;time series	Justin Dauwels;Tomasz M.

The treatment involved the application of Orofacial Regulation Therapy, associated with physical therapy using a pen-shaped electrode whith an FES current. The treatment was administered for a period of one year and involved two weekly 15 minute sessions. The stimuli were performed with modulated current at a frequency of 60 hertz, pulse width of 300 miliseconds, rise of four (4) seconds, decay of four (4) seconds, time ON of one (1) second, time OFF of five (5) seconds, in trapezoidal pulses (forming a mini cycle of 14 seconds with 30 pulses) at an intensity level measured according to the patient’s sensitivity, associated with the PNF method. The mobile pen-shaped electrode was positioned at precise points on the paralyzed muscles of the face, and the fixedelectrode was positioned on the Deltoid muscle. There was satisfactory rehabilitation of muscles in the left hemiface and acquired improvement in the oral consumption of the bolus. The symmetry of the face was also enhanced, along with facial expressions and connotation measuring four (4) on the Chevalier scale.	bolus tracking;facial recognition system;functional electrical stimulation;prenex normal form;pulse-width modulation;shin megami tensei: persona 3;un/cefact	Fabiana S.

However, software environments used to create these technologies are often designed for expert developers. This research paper investigates the feasibility of JavaScript as a development platform for non-critical BCI systems. We also discuss the current issues with JavaScript-based BCIs and introduce a new library, WebBCI, which is designed to take the initial step towards addressing these issues. Initial benchmarks of WebBCI suggest JavaScript can run common EEG and BCI methods such as band power extraction, common spatial pattern, and linear discriminant analysis in real-time on an array of devices, including mobile phones.	electroencephalography	Pierce Stegman;Chris Crawford;Jeffrey G.

Such measures are usually obtained in a clinical environment with commercial stereoscopic 3D devices that allow to sample kinematics at high frequency and with high accuracy and precision, but that are, on the other hand, expensive, time consuming, and, most of all, are not portable. Consequently, such assessments are available only in clinics. With the aim of developing applications for neurological patients movement analysis in home environment, an experimental study has been conducted to compare the performances of a passive-marker motion capture system with the Kinect. Data were acquired simultaneously with the two systems during reaching against gravity movements. Results suggest that Kinect may be a valid tool for studying reaching against gravity and assessing upper-limb functionality at home in neurological patients.	experiment;kinect;motion capture;performance;stereoscopic video game;stereoscopy	Alessandro Scano;Marco Caimmi;Matteo Malosio;Lorenzo Molinari Tosatti	2014	5th IEEE RAS/EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics	10.1109/BIOROB.2014.6913837	computer vision;simulation;engineering;physical therapy	Robotics	12.286217670784891	-83.47212444212674	113888

The particular features and brain functional patterns of the Parkinson's disease cause that there are regions that conveniently reveal the presence of the pathology, in this case mainly the striatum region. The selection of the brain mask makes incidence in two main aspects: the selection of the region of interest (striatum and surrounding area) for the analysis, but also the selection of the region without significance, which is the reference area for the intensity normalization, previous to the analysis. This work studies the statistical significance in the selection of ROIs in 3D brain images for Parkinson, depending on the objective to be achieved in the posterior analysis process.	genetic selection;image processing;incidence matrix;linear discriminant analysis;neostriatum;p-value;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;region of interest	Pablo Padilla;Javier Ramírez;Juan Manuel Górriz;Diego Salas-Gonzalez;Ignacio Álvarez	2014	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-474-9-19	image processing;data mining;artificial intelligence;medicine;pattern recognition;statistical significance	ML	23.313780494296516	-80.4705201008846	114358

We address interindividual versus person-dependent recognition, recognition based on discrete affective states versus recognition based on affective dimensions, and efficient feature extraction with respect to affect. Principal component analysis (PCA), kernel PCA, linear discriminant analysis, and general discriminant analysis are compared to either reduce temporal information in gait or extract relevant features for classification. Although expression of affect in gait is covered by the primary task of locomotion, person-dependent recognition of motion capture data reaches 95% accuracy based on the observation of a single stride. In particular, different levels of arousal and dominance are suitable for being recognized in gait. It is concluded that gait can be used as an additional modality for the recognition of affect. Application scenarios include monitoring in high-security areas, human-robot interaction, and cognitive home environments.	affective disorders, psychotic;anterior descending branch of left coronary artery;arousal;dimensions;feature extraction;human–robot interaction;kernel principal component analysis;linear discriminant analysis;local-density approximation;machine learning;modality (human–computer interaction);motion capture;test set	Michelle Karg;Kolja Kühnlenz;Martin Buss	2010	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)	10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2044040	computer vision;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;affective computing;linear discriminant analysis;principal component analysis	Vision	11.523431446011726	-91.9289442428174	114554

e838032fda0b71ae2df421cff8236673fef0afb3	inferring sources of dementia progression with network diffusion model		Pinpointing the sources of dementia is crucial to the effective treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In this paper, we model the dementia progression by a diffusive model over the brain network with sparse impulsive stimulations. By solving inverse problems, we localize the possible origins of Alzheimer’s disease based on a large set of repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in ADNI. The distribution of the sources averaged over the sample population is evaluated. We find that the dementia sources have different concentrations in the brain lobes for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, indicating possible switch of the dementia driving mechanism. Our model provides a quantitative way to perform explanatory analysis of the dynamics of dementia.	color gradient	Chenhui Hu;Xue Hua;Paul M.

3e7022f60f1b6e5ea03dbbf89b2bfe15dff74f01	a neural-network-based investigation of eye-related movements for accurate drowsiness estimation		Many studies reported that eye-related movements, e.g., blank stares, blinking and drooping eyelids, are highly indicative symptoms of drowsiness. However, few researchers have investigated the computational efficacy accounted for drowsiness estimation by these eye-related movements. This paper thus analyzes two typical eye-related movements, i.e., eyelid movements Xel(t) and eyeball movements Xeb(t), and investigates neural-network-based approaches to model temporal correlations. Specifically, we compare the effectiveness of three combinations of eye-related movements, i.e., [Xel(t)], [Xeb(t)], and [Xel(t),Xeb(t)], for drowsiness estimation. Furthermore, we investigate the usefulness of two typical types of neural networks, i.e., CNN-Net and CNNLSTM-Net, for better drowsiness modeling. The experimental results show that [Xel(t),Xeb(t)] can achieve a better performance than [Xel(t)] for short time drowsiness estimation while [Xeb(t)]alone performs worse even than the baseline method (PERCLOS). In addition, we found that CNN-Net are more effective for accurate drowsiness level modeling than CNNLSTM-Net.	artificial neural network;baseline (configuration management);biological neural networks;blepharoptosis;blepharospasm;blinking;chorea;computation;disorders of excessive somnolence;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;estimation theory;experiment;eye movements;eyelid structure;long short-term memory;movement;neural network simulation	Mingfei Sun;Masanori Tsujikawa;Yoshifumi Onishi;Xiaojuan Ma;Atsushi Nishino;Satoshi Hashimoto	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513491	computer vision;eyeball movements;drooping eyelids;artificial neural network;artificial intelligence;hidden markov model;computer science	SE	12.135273475372571	-89.67239143531351	114866

All were in sinus rhythm and underwent 60 min head-up tilt table test under ECG recording. ChD group underwent MIBG scintigraphy and confirmed sympathetic denervation. Histogram of RR-interval series was calculated, with 100 ms class, ranging from 500 ms to 1200 ms. For each class, mean of normal RR-intervals (MRR) and mean of the peak-to-peakR-to-T wave interval (MRT), representing VRD, were analyzed in RR-intervals pairs of acceleration (AC) and deceleration (DC) phases, reflecting sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on heart rate, respectively. Regression lines of MRT vs. MRR were computed in the whole series, and in DC and AC phases, and respective slopes calculated (sMRT T, sMRT DC and sMRTAC). Student t-test compared groups. RT-interval was larger in ChD group. sMRTT, sMRT DC and sMRT AC function showed no difference between groups, and all increased directly to MRR. In both groups, MRT increased as a linear function of MRR. In ChD, RT-interval analysis was not able to confirm loss of sympathetic driven RR-interval variation.	image rectification;interval arithmetic;linear function;maxima and minima;rapid refresh;rectifier;virtual retinal display	Paulo Roberto Benchimol-Barbosa;Olivassé Nasario-Junior;Jurandir Nadal;Roberto Coury Pedrosa	2016	2016 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)		telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;communication	HCI	16.339581131423596	-84.39693826261599	114912

However, procedures of selecting features, as well as procedures of single-trial classification, are not fully investigated for optimal performance. In the present study, we investigated the performance of different configurations of feature extractions in both temporal and frequency domains, for discriminating response errors in a color-word matching Stroop task. Motivated by our previous investigations, we evaluated both temporal and frequency features with component signals, which were obtained from EEG signals via an independent component analysis (ICA). Five component signals (independent components, ICs), originated from the frontal, motor, parietal, and occipital areas, were included in detecting error-related brain activity from single-trial EEG data. The results showed that better performance can be achieved by optimizing time window and frequency range of selected features, sampling scheme of feature-related data, and training of classifiers. However, a simple combination of features from multiple component signals can only slightly improve the detection performance of errors in single-trial data as compared to the frontal IC only. More importantly, it is indicated that four ICs other than the frontal one also carry similar discriminative information about errors in both temporal and frequency domains. The fact suggests flexible means in detecting errors from EEG beyond the frontal brain areas, which might be very valuable in practical applications such that the frontal area is not accessible.	brain–computer interface;electroencephalography;extraction;frequency band;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;matching;neuroimaging;neuroscience discipline;performance engineering;sampling (signal processing);sensor;single-instance storage	Guofa Shou;Lei Ding	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591303	psychology;neuroscience;speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;electroencephalography;feature extraction;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;communication;quantum mechanics	Visualization	14.572711986129905	-92.88372490528194	115156

In this paper, a new approach is presented for analysis of EEG signals and detection and localization of sleep spindles. By estimating auto recursive (AR) models on short segments the EEG is described as a superposition of harmonic oscillators with damping and frequencies varying in time. Most of the oscillatory events are detected, whenever the damping coefficients of one or more frequencies fall below a predefined threshold. The algorithm works well for the detection of sleep spindles and in addition identifies delta and alpha waves.	algorithm;alpha waves;autoregressive model;coefficient;electroencephalography;recursion	P.

A phenomenon that is recently mentioned as one of information encoding strategies in the brain is cross frequency coupling (CFC), means the interactions between different frequency bands in physiological signals such as EEG. This interaction can occur between various components of such signals including amplitude or power, phase and frequency. Different types of CFC have been reported in various cognitive tasks and within or between different brain regions. However the role of CFC in encoding of information about the category of visual objects is greatly unknown and here we attempted to investigate it. So in this paper, we used machine learning algorithms to find out whether CFC contains such information. To this end, we recorded EEG from 10 participants while they were observing stimuli from 12 different visual object categories. Then amplitude–amplitude coupling (AAC), phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) and phase–phase coupling (PPC) within each electrode were calculated for the recorded signals in order to use them as input to SVM classifier. The results show that phase-phase coupling can provide more information about the category of objects compared to other types of CFC, by classification performance of 92.33% against 70.28% and 60.52% for phase–amplitude and amplitude–amplitude coupling, respectively. In addition, this feature was more informative when occurred between alpha and gamma frequency bands. The performance of classification by means of CFC features was then compared with the result of classification by wavelet transform on the same data. We observed that PAC can improve the performance of categorical-based classification relative to wavelet coefficients (with the performance of 70.73%). So we can conclude that cross frequency coupling encompass useful information about semantic category of stimuli which is not available in time-frequency components of the signal obtained by wavelet transform.

In order to blindly extract underlying activities, the common approach however only uses either spatial or temporal independence. More convincing results can be achieved by requiring the transformed data to be as independent as possible in both domains. First introduced by Stone, spatiotemporal independent component analysis (ICA) is a promising algorithm for fMRI decomposition. We propose an algebraic spatiotemporal ICA algorithm with increased performance and robustness. The feasibility of the algorithm is demonstrated in an application to the analysis of an fMRI data sets of a human brain performing an auditory task.	algorithm;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;marc (archive);resonance	Fabian J.

BACKGROUND Clinicians often monitor multiple patients. An auditory display that intermittently conveys the status of multiple patients may help.   METHOD Nonclinician participants listened to sequences of 500-ms earcons that each represented the heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels of a different simulated patient. In each sequence, one, two, or three patients had an abnormal level of HR and/or SpO2. In Experiment 1, participants reported which of nine patients in a sequence were abnormal. In Experiment 2, participants identified the vital signs of one, two, or three abnormal patients in sequences of one, five, or nine patients, where the interstimulus interval (ISI) between earcons was 150 ms. Experiment 3 used the five-sequence condition of Experiment 2, but the ISI was either 150 ms or 800 ms.   RESULTS Participants reported which patient(s) were abnormal with median 95% accuracy. Identification accuracy for vital signs decreased as the number of abnormal patients increased from one to three, p < .001, but accuracy was unaffected by number of patients in a sequence. Overall, identification accuracy was significantly higher with an ISI of 800 ms (89%) compared with an ISI of 150 ms (83%), p < .001.   CONCLUSION A multiple-patient display can be created by cycling through earcons that represent individual patients.   APPLICATION The principles underlying the multiple-patient display can be extended to other vital signs, designs, and domains.	auditory perception;auditory display;earcon;eighty nine;information sciences institute;interval arithmetic;oxygen saturation test result;patients;qt interval feature (observable entity);heart rate	Anna Hickling;Birgit Brecknell;Robert G.

To better understand the possible microvascular mechanisms behind these clinical observations, we evaluated the sequels of subacute superior sagittal sinus (SSS) thrombosis in rats using micro- and nano-CT imaging of the same specimen to provide large volume and high resolution CT image data respectively. SSS thrombosis was induced in 11 animals which were euthanized after 6h (n=4) or 6 weeks (n=7). Eight sham-operated rats served as controls. After infusion of contrast into the vasculature of the brains, these were isolated and scanned using micro-, nano-, and synchrotron-based micro-CT ((8 μm³), (900 nm)³, and (1.9 μm³) voxel sizes). The cross-sectional area of the superior sagittal sinus, microvessels and cortical veins were quantified. Tissue sections were stained against VEGF antigen. Immunohistochemistry was confirmed using quantitative rtPCR. SSS thrombosis led to a congestion of the bridging veins after 6h. After 6 weeks, a network of small vessels surrounding the occluded SSS was present with concurrent return towards the diameter of the draining bridging veins of controls. This microvascular network connected to cortical veins as demonstrated by nano- and synchrotron-based micro-CT. Also the volume fraction and number of cortical veins increased significantly. Immunohistochemistry in the region of the microsvascular network demonstrated a strong immunoreactivity against VEGF, confirmed by rtPCR. The sequel of subacute SSS thrombosis induced a network of microvessels (""""venogenesis"""") draining the bridging veins.

The continuity is associated with EEG “stationarity” which we propose to evaluate with adaptive segmentation of EEG into pseudo-stationary intervals. The histograms of these intervals are then used as new features for the assessment of EEG maturity. In our experiments, we used Bayesian model averaging over decision trees to differentiate two age groups, each included 110 EEG recordings. The use of the proposed EEG features has shown, on average, a 6% increase in the accuracy of age differentiation.	capability maturity model;decision tree;electroencephalography;ensemble learning;experiment;feature extraction;scott continuity;stationary process	Livia Jakaite;Vitaly Schetinin;Joachim Schult	2011	2011 24th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)	10.1109/CBMS.2011.5999109	speech recognition;bayesian probability;computer science;machine learning;decision tree;pattern recognition;statistics	NLP	19.068916825858864	-86.0521749457074	116009
9e4453db194ff8e249d51cc6ec5e8a72be756d57	reducing sensor noise in meg and eeg recordings using oversampled temporal projection		Objective: Here, we review the theory of suppression of spatially uncorrelated, sensor-specific noise in electro- and magentoencephalography (EEG and MEG) arrays, and introduce a novel method for suppression. Our method requires only that the signals of interest are spatially oversampled, which is a reasonable assumption for many EEG and MEG systems. Methods: Our method is based on a leave-one-out procedure using overlapping temporal windows in a mathematical framework to project spatially uncorrelated noise in the temporal domain.  Results: This method, termed “oversampled temporal projection” (OTP), has four advantages over existing methods. First, sparse channel-specific artifacts are suppressed while limiting mixing with other channels, whereas existing linear, time-invariant spatial operators can spread such artifacts to other channels with a spatial distribution which can be mistaken for one produced by an electrophysiological source. Second, OTP minimizes distortion of the spatial configuration of the data. During source localization (e.g., dipole fitting), many spatial methods require corresponding modification of the forward model to avoid bias, while OTP does not. Third, noise suppression factors at the sensor level are maintained during source localization, whereas bias compensation removes the denoising benefit for spatial methods that require such compensation. Fourth, OTP uses a time-window duration parameter to control the tradeoff between noise suppression and adaptation to time-varying sensor characteristics. Conclusion: OTP efficiently optimizes noise suppression performance while controlling for spatial bias of the signal of interest. Significance: This is important in applications where sensor noise significantly limits the signal-to-noise ratio, such as high-frequency brain oscillations.	3d projection;acclimatization;artifact (software development);distortion;electroencephalography;epilepsy, temporal lobe;image noise;magnetoencephalography;mathematics;microsoft windows;morphologic artifacts;noise reduction;oversampling;population parameter;propylene glycol;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix;time-invariant system;white noise;zero suppression	Eric B.

The conditions of individual under EEG test is a key issue. In general, EEG feature extraction can be associated to other information like Electrocardiogram (ECG), ergospirometry and electromyogram (EMG). However, in some cases, a multidimensional representation is used; bispectrum is an example of such a representation. HOS (high order statistics), for instance, include the bispectrum and the trispectrum (third and fourth order statistics, respectively). Advanced estimate spectral analysis can reveal new information encompassed in EEG signals. That is the reason the author propose an algorithm based on DSD (Decimated Signal Diagonalization) that is able of processing exponentially dumped signals like those that regard EEG features.

feabf08eb9d58b4998e78924fc4b0adc912cf2aa	assessment of heart rate variability during an endurance mountain trail race by multi-scale entropy analysis		The aim of the study was to analyze heart rate variability (HRV) response to high-intensity exercise during a 35-km mountain trail race and to ascertain whether fitness level could influence autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulation. Time-domain, frequency-domain, and multi-scale entropy (MSE) indexes were calculated for eleven mountain-trail runners who completed the race. Many changes were observed, mostly related to exercise load and fatigue. These changes were characterized by increased mean values and standard deviations of the normal-to-normal intervals associated with sympathetic activity, and by decreased differences between successive intervals related to parasympathetic activity. Normalized low frequency (LF) power suggested that ANS modulation varied greatly during the race and between individuals. Normalized high frequency (HF) power, associated with parasympathetic activity, varied considerably over the race, and tended to decrease at the final stages, whereas changes in the LF/HF ratio corresponded to intervals with varying exercise load. MSE indexes, related to system complexity, indicated the existence of many interactions between the heart and its neurological control mechanism. The time-domain, frequency-domain, and MSE indexes were also able to discriminate faster from slower runners, mainly in the more difficult and in the final stages of the race. These findings suggest the use of HRV analysis to study cardiac function mechanisms in endurance sports.	audio normalization;autonomic computing;autonomous robot;balance theory;heart rate variability;helicon focus;interaction;modulation;nonlinear system;race condition	Montserrat Vallverdú;Aroa Ruiz-Muñoz;Emma Roca;Pere Caminal;Ferran A.

Although OT, which is a noninvasive imaging technique for measuring hemodynamic response related to brain activation, is particularly useful for studying infants, the signals occasionally contain undesirable artifacts caused by body movements, so data corrupted by body-movement artifacts must be eliminated to obtain reliable results. For this purpose, we applied a wavelet transform to automatically detect body-movement artifacts in OT signals. We measured OT signals from nine healthy infants in response to speech stimuli. After the continuous signals had been divided into blocks (a block is a time series of OT signal in a 30-s period including a 10-s stimulation period), they were classified into two groups (movement blocks and non-movement blocks) according to whether the participants moved or not by video judgment. Using those data, we developed a wavelet-based algorithm for detecting body-movement artifacts at a high discrimination rate being consistent with the actual body-movement state. The wavelet method has two parameters (scale and threshold), and a Monte Carlo analysis gave the mean optimal parameters as 9+/-1.9 (mean+/-standard deviation) for the scale and as 42.7+/-1.9 for the threshold. Our wavelet method with the mean optimal parameters (scale=9, threshold=43) achieved a higher discrimination rate (mean+/-standard deviation: 86.3+/-8.8%) for actual body movement than a previous method (mean+/-standard deviation: 80.6+/-8.7%) among different participants (paired t test: t(8)=2.92, p<0.05). These results demonstrate that our wavelet method is useful in practice for eliminating blocks containing body-movement artifacts in OT signals. It will contribute to obtaining reliable results from OT studies of infants.	body dysmorphic disorders;carotid body paraganglioma;classification;hemodynamics;leucaena pulverulenta;monte carlo method;morphologic artifacts;movement;optical phenomena;sensor;time series;topography;wavelet analysis;algorithm;t test	Hiroki Sato;Naoki Tanaka;Mariko Uchida-Ota;Yukiko Hirabayashi;Makoto Kanai;Takashi Ashida;Ikuo Konishi;Atsushi Maki	2006	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.06.028	wavelet;computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;statistics	ML	18.307732695122006	-86.64316694241909	117009

METHODS NMRI nude mice (n = 34) were divided into two groups and subcutaneously injected with FaDu cells in medium either including (+MG) or excluding matrigel (-MG). In sub study I seven mice from each group (+MG, n = 7; -MG, n = 7) were (18)F- fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT scanned on Day 5, 8, 12, 15, and 19. In sub study II ten mice from each group (+MG, n = 10; -MG, n = 10) were included and tumors collected for immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of tumor microenvironment including; proliferation ratio, micro vessel density, average vessel area, hypoxia, nuclear density, and necrosis. Tumors for IHC were collected according to size (200-400 mm(3), 500-700 mm(3), 800-1100 mm(3)).   RESULTS FDG uptake and tumor growth was statistically compatible for the tumors established with or without MG. The IHC analysis on all parameters only identified a significantly higher micro vessel density for tumor size 500-700 mm(3) and 800-1100 mm(3) and average vessel area for tumor size 500-700 mm(3) in the -MG group. Comparable variations were observed for tumors of both the +MG and -MG groups. No difference in tumor take rate was observed between groups in study.   CONCLUSIONS Matrigel did not affect tumor growth or tumor take for the FaDu xenograft model evaluated. Tumors in the -MG group displayed increased angiogenesis compared to the +MG tumors. No difference in (18)F-FDG PET uptake for tumors of different groups was found. Based on these observations the influence of matrigel on tumor imaging and tumor microenvironment seems minor for this particular xenograft model.	basement membrane;blood vessel tissue;ct scan;fluorodeoxyglucose f18;functional discourse grammar;habitat;head and neck neoplasms;head and neck structure;hypopharyngeal carcinoma;hypoxia;immunohistochemistry;magnetic resonance imaging;mg (editor);necrosis;nephroblastoma;non-small cell lung carcinoma;pathologic neovascularization;polyethylene terephthalate;scanning;tumor microenvironment;xenograft procedure;xenograft type of graft;hypopharynx;matrigel;pediatric intracranial germ cell brain tumor	Frederikke P.

The features of the reflex response provide initial perspective regarding the status of the nervous system. An iPhone wireless accelerometer application integrated with a potential energy impact pendulum attached to a reflex hammer has been successfully developed, tested, and evaluated for quantifying the patellar tendon reflex. The iPhone functions as a wireless accelerometer platform. The wide coverage range of the iPhone enables the quantification of reflex response samples in rural and remote settings. The iPhone has the capacity to transmit the reflex response acceleration waveform by wireless transmission through email. Automated post-processing of the acceleration waveform provides feature extraction of the maximum acceleration of the reflex response ascertained after evoking the patellar tendon reflex. The iPhone wireless accelerometer application demonstrated the utility of the smartphone as a biomedical device, while providing accurate and consistent quantification of the reflex response.	digital single-lens reflex camera;email;feature extraction;hammer;nervous system structure;patella;quantitation;reflex action;smartphone;structure of patellar ligament;tendon structure;video post-processing;waveform;accelerometers	Robert LeMoyne;Timothy Mastroianni;Warren S.

The learning procedure involves the extraction of a large number of candidate features from EEG data, from which a very small subset of most statistically relevant features is selected for further processing. A statistical prediction model based on mixture of factor analysis (MFA) model is constructed from a training set that classifies the respective subject into responder and non-responder classes. A leave-2-out (L2O) cross-validation procedure is used to evaluate the prediction performance. This pilot study involves 27 subjects who received either left high-frequency (HF) active rTMS therapy or simultaneous left HF and right low-frequency active rTMS therapy. Our results indicate that it is possible to predict rTMS treatment efficacy of either treatment modality with a specificity of 83% and a sensitivity of 78%, for a combined accuracy of 80%.	class;cross reactions;cross-validation (statistics);electroencephalograph;eighty;electroencephalography;factor analysis;helicon filter;mfa message structure;machine learning;major depressive disorder;modality (human–computer interaction);pharmacology;sensitivity and specificity;subgroup;test set;transcranial magnetic stimulation	Ahmad Khodayari-Rostamabad;James P.

We propose a Bayesian framework to extend current Steady State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) classifiers to a maximum a posteriori (MAP) classifiers by using a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) to learn the distribution of features conditioned on stimulation class. To demonstrate our framework we extend Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) style methods. Traditionally, in either example, the class is estimated as the class associated with the maximum feature. Our framework increases performance by relaxing the assumption that a stimulation class's sample often maximizes its class-associated feature. Further, by leveraging the KDE, we present a method which estimates the performance of a classifier under different stimulation frequency sets. Using this, we optimize the selection of stimulation frequencies from those present in a training set.	brain–computer interface;kernel density estimation;spectral density;statistical classification;steady state;test set	Matt Higger;Murat Akçakaya;Hooman Nezamfar;Gerald LaMountain;Umut Orhan;Deniz Erdogmus	2015	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2014.2368952	brain–computer interface;kernel density estimation;speech recognition;electroencephalography;computer science;machine learning;harmonic analysis;pattern recognition;mathematics;accuracy and precision;correlation;statistics	Vision	14.526969716411086	-93.05791704824588	117577

In order to monitor biological substances in daily life, we developed a minimally invasive needle type device with which biological substances are extracted through a microperfusion system inserted under the skin. The perfusion needle has a flow channel with perforated membrane through which biological substances from subepidermal tissue are extracted. The efficacy of the device was examined by measuring lactate concentration of exercising mice. Lactate was successfully collected from the back skin of the mice running on a treadmill using a fabricated microperfusion needle.

Such an approach is useful when further detailed analyses for discrimination or characterization requires dimensionality reduction. Our approach can accommodate a categorical variable such as diagnosis (e.g. schizophrenic patient or healthy control), or a continuous variable like severity of the disorder. This information is utilized as a reference for measuring a component's discriminant power after principle component decomposition. After sorting each component according to its discriminant power, we extract the best components for discriminant analysis. An application of our reference selection approach is shown using a functional magnetic resonance imaging data set in which the sample size is much less than the dimensionality. The results show that the reference selection approach provides an improved discriminant component set as compared to other approaches. Our approach is general and provides a solid foundation for further discrimination and classification studies.	categorical variable;dimensionality reduction;linear discriminant analysis;magnetic resonance imaging;patients;principal component analysis;schizophrenia;sorting;statistical classification;fmri	Jingyu Liu;Lai Xu;Arvind Caprihan;Vince D.

Windowing approaches are normally used for segmentation, but no clear consensus exists on which window size should be preferably employed. In fact, most designs normally rely on figures used in previous works, but with no strict studies that support them. Intuitively, decreasing the window size allows for a faster activity detection, as well as reduced resources and energy needs. On the contrary, large data windows are normally considered for the recognition of complex activities. In this work, we present an extensive study to fairly characterize the windowing procedure, to determine its impact within the activity recognition process and to help clarify some of the habitual assumptions made during the recognition system design. To that end, some of the most widely used activity recognition procedures are evaluated for a wide range of window sizes and activities. From the evaluation, the interval 1-2 s proves to provide the best trade-off between recognition speed and accuracy. The study, specifically intended for on-body activity recognition systems, further provides designers with a set of guidelines devised to facilitate the system definition and configuration according to the particular application requirements and target activities.	activity recognition;categories;finite-state machine;microsoft windows;phase i/ii trial;randomness;requirement;system configuration;systems design;window function;biologic segmentation	Oresti Baños;Juan Manuel Gálvez;Miguel Damas;Héctor Pomares;Ignacio Rojas	2014		10.3390/s140406474	telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;data mining;nanotechnology;biological engineering;segmentation;statistics;activity recognition	HCI	11.322467398006886	-88.05170615800186	118400

Up to the 20th independent component, each of them contained one or two positive (or negative) peaks in terms of 32-channel EEGs reconstructed on the electrode surface by the deflation procedure, and these peaks were analyzed by 1- or 2-dipole source localization method. Moreover, the quantification method based on these ECDL results yielded a good discrimination between right- and left-hand movement imageries, even if regardless of the time course of the localization results, instead of only for one male subject.

More than 80% of OSA sufferers remain undiagnosed and the situation demands simplified, convenient technology for community screening. Almost all OSA patients snore and snoring is the earliest nocturnal symptom of OSA. Snore signals (SS) are produced due to vibration of soft tissues in the narrowed parts of the UA. It is known that the UA properties are gender specific. In this paper, we work under the hypothesis that gender specific analysis of snore sounds should lead to a higher OSA detection performance. We propose a snore based multi-parametric OSA screening technique, which incorporates the gender differences in the algorithm. The multi feature vector was modeled using logistic regression based algorithms to classify subjects into OSA/non-OSA classes. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by carrying out K-fold cross validation. This procedure was applied to male (n=51) and female (n=36) data sets recorded in a clinical sleep laboratory. Each data set consisted of sound recordings of 6-8 hr. duration. The performance of the method was evaluated against the standard laboratory method of diagnosis known as polysomnography. Our gender-specific technique resulted in a sensitivity of 93±9% with specificity 89±7% for females and sensitivity of 91±8% with specificity 89±12% for males. These results establish the possibility of developing cheap, convenient, non-contact and an unattended OSA screening technique.	class;cross-validation (statistics);eighty;feature vector;logistic regression;numerous;osa protein, drosophila;part dosing unit;patients;pituitary-dependent cushing's disease;sensitivity and specificity;sex characteristics;sleep (system call);sleep apnea syndromes;sleep apnea, obstructive;sleep disorders;sleep mode;snoring;user agent;algorithm;soft tissue	Shaminda de Silva;Udantha R.

The analysis of gait parameters can be used to assess the influence of macular degeneration on gait. This study examines the effect of macular degeneration on gait using inertial sensor based 3D spatio-temporal gait parameters. We acquired gait data from 21 young and healthy subjects during a 40 m obstacle walk. All subjects had to perform the gait trial with and without macular degeneration simulation glasses. The order of starting with or without glasses alternated between each subject in order to test for training effects. Multiple 3D spatio-temporal gait parameters were calculated for the normal vision as well as the impaired vision groups. The parameters trial time, stride time, stride time coefficient of variation (CV), stance time, stance time CV, stride length, cadence, gait velocity and angle at toe off showed statistically significant differences between the two groups. Training effects were visible for the trials which started without vision impairment. Inter-group differences in the gait pattern occurred due to an increased sense of insecurity related with the loss of visual acuity from the simulation glasses. In summary, we showed that 3D spatio-temporal gait parameters derived from inertial sensor data are viable to detect differences in the gait pattern of subjects with and without a macular degeneration simulation. We believe that this study provides the basis for an in-depth analysis regarding the impact of macular degeneration on gait.	abnormal degeneration;age related macular degeneration;area striata structure;coefficient of variance;color vision defect;correction of hearing impairment;eyeglasses;gait analysis;patients;simulation;velocity (software development);insecurity	Christoph M.

24fa42139a3b258229f365c4ae4f112ae4bcdaa5	reliability of functional magnetic resonance imaging activation during working memory in a multi-site study: analysis from the north american prodrome longitudinal study	reliability;fmri;multi site;working memory;g theory	Multi-site neuroimaging studies offer an efficient means to study brain functioning in large samples of individuals with rare conditions; however, they present new challenges given that aggregating data across sites introduces additional variability into measures of interest. Assessing the reliability of brain activation across study sites and comparing statistical methods for pooling functional data are critical to ensuring the validity of aggregating data across sites. The current study used two samples of healthy individuals to assess the feasibility and reliability of aggregating multi-site functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a Sternberg-style verbal working memory task. Participants were recruited as part of the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS), which comprises eight fMRI scanning sites across the United States and Canada. In the first study sample (n=8), one participant from each home site traveled to each of the sites and was scanned while completing the task on two consecutive days. Reliability was examined using generalizability theory. Results indicated that blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal was reproducible across sites and was highly reliable, or generalizable, across scanning sites and testing days for core working memory ROIs (generalizability ICCs=0.81 for left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, 0.95 for left superior parietal cortex). In the second study sample (n=154), two statistical methods for aggregating fMRI data across sites for all healthy individuals recruited as control participants in the NAPLS study were compared. Control participants were scanned on one occasion at the site from which they were recruited. Results from the image-based meta-analysis (IBMA) method and mixed effects model with site covariance method both showed robust activation in expected regions (i.e. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor cortex, superior parietal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, basal ganglia). Quantification of the similarity of group maps from these methods confirmed a very high (96%) degree of spatial overlap in results. Thus, brain activation during working memory function was reliable across the NAPLS sites and both the IBMA and mixed effects model with site covariance methods appear to be valid approaches for aggregating data across sites. These findings indicate that multi-site functional neuroimaging can offer a reliable means to increase power and generalizability of results when investigating brain function in rare populations and support the multi-site investigation of working memory function in the NAPLS study, in particular.	basal (phylogenetics);basal ganglia;cerebellum;cerebral cortex;cingulate cortex;constraint handling rules;functional gastrointestinal disorders;large;magnetic resonance imaging;map;memory disorders;memory bound function;memory, short-term;neuroimaging;numerous;oxygen;parietal lobe;population;prefrontal cortex;quantitation;reliability (characteristic);sample variance;scanning;spatial variability;temporal lobe;thalamic structure;twenty two;fmri;travel	Jennifer K.

In this paper, an improvement of the measurement evaluation method is introduced, which is used during the sport activity in real-time. The basis of the novel approach is our previously reported anytime hierarchical fuzzy risk calculation model, which is able to handle some uncertainties, imprecision, and subjectivity in the data and in the evaluation process and can cope with the dynamically changing environment, available time, and resources. In the new model the input membership functions, which are tuned according to the patient characteristics, are modified based on the data recorded during previous measurements under the same conditions. By this, the person-dependent characteristics and the unavoidable changing of the dynamic reactions of the human organism can also be considered and the risk level can be more reliably predicted.	anytime algorithm;approximation algorithm;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;performance tuning;real-time clock;risk assessment;sensitivity and specificity;staggered tuning	Edit Tóth-Laufer;Annamária R.

However, determining effective intervention success in this population, and the mechanisms that produce it, is currently restricted to observable behavior. The need of therapy assessment metrics beyond traditional behavioral criteria, led to the use of physiological signals for capturing child-therapist internal dynamics during an intervention session. Internal physiological states were measured through Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and modeled in relation to observed self- and co-regulatory behaviors. A common measure of EDA, Skin Conductance Response (SCR), was the primary signal of interest and assumed to form a non-homogeneous Poisson Process whose rate function is determined by observed regulatory behaviors. Through likelihood and residual goodness of fit analysis, statistical tests and classification tasks, our results indicate that SCR changes and observable behavior in child-therapist dyads are temporally associated and the estimated model parameters can be linked to the types of regulation stimuli.	conductance (graph);observable;process modeling;skin (computing);statistical classification	Theodora Chaspari;Matthew S.

The approach uses multivariate methods to train a model capable of decoding a subject's brain state from fMRI images. The decoded brain states can be used as a control signal for a brain computer interface (BCI) or to provide neurofeedback to the subject. The ability to adapt the stimulus during the fMRI experiment adds a new level of flexibility for task paradigms and has potential applications in a number of areas, including performance enhancement, rehabilitation, and therapy. Multivariate approaches to real-time fMRI are complementary to region-of-interest (ROI)-based methods and provide a principled method for dealing with distributed patterns of brain responses. Specifically, a multivariate approach is advantageous when network activity is expected, when mental strategies could vary from individual to individual, or when one or a few ROIs are not unequivocally the most appropriate for the investigation. Beyond highlighting important developments in rtfMRI and supervised learning, the article discusses important practical issues, including implementation considerations, existing resources, and future challenges and opportunities. Some possible future directions are described, calling for advances arising from increased experimental flexibility, improvements in predictive modeling, better comparisons across rtfMRI and other BCI implementations, and further investigation of the types of feedback and degree to which interface modulation is obtainable for various tasks.	adaptive filter;brain-computer interfaces;brain–computer interface;experiment;experimental system;generalization (psychology);interface device component;knowledge bases;knowledge base;magnetic resonance imaging;mental event;modulation;neurofeedback;neuroimaging;neuroscience discipline;nonlinear system;predictive modelling;programming paradigm;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;review [publication type];supervised learning;fmri	Stephen LaConte	2011	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.06.052	psychology;brain–computer interface;neuroscience;neural decoding;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;neurofeedback;predictive modelling;supervised learning;neuroimaging;region of interest	ML	12.66427119607166	-93.53317038897322	120856
30cea58e7d120ba3339d72a6803967202b9bbb58	neural control using eeg as a bci technique for low cost prosthetic arms		There have been significant advancements in brain computer interface (BCI) techniques using EEG-like methods. EEG can serve as non-invasive BMI technique, to control devices like wheelchairs, cursors and robotic arm. In this paper, we discuss the use of EEG recordings to control low-cost robotic arms by extracting motor task patterns and indicate where such control algorithms may show promise towards the humanitarian challenge. Studies have shown robotic arm movement solutions using kinematics and machine learning methods. With iterative processes for trajectory making, EEG signals have been known to be used to control robotic arms. The paper also showcases a case-study developed towards this challenge in order to test such algorithmic approaches. Non-traditional approaches using neuro-inspired processing techniques without implicit kinematics have also shown potential applications. Use of EEG to resolve temporal information may, indeed, help understand movement coordination in robotic arm.	algorithm;brain–computer interface;coat of arms;electroencephalography;iterative method;machine learning;robot;robotic arm	Shyam Diwakar;Sandeep Bodda;Chaitanya Nutakki;Asha Vijayan;Krishnashree Achuthan;Bipin Nair	2014		10.5220/0005134802700275	computer vision;artificial intelligence	Robotics	11.882331427237316	-93.17668189572537	121122

In EEG signal processing, we also can use the algorithm based on DWT to observe frequency-domain features in Parkinson's disease (PD). Hence, we proposed a configurable wavelet processor with feature extraction circuit in the sensor for more efficient biomedical applications. We have implemented the design with TSMC 0.18 μm technology. The total core area is 1.15 mm2, the operating voltage is 1.8 V, the operating clock frequency is 360 Hz, and the power consumption is 0.52 μW. Compared with sending raw ECG data, our design saves as much as 99.5% power while only detecting and sending R-R interval sequences in ECG application.	algorithm;clock rate;core (optical fiber);discrete wavelet transform;electroencephalography;feature extraction;frequency band;microprocessor;modulation;sensor;signal processing;usability;waveform;windows 95	Wei-Lung Yang;Hsi-Pin Ma	2015	VLSI Design, Automation and Test(VLSI-DAT)	10.1109/VLSI-DAT.2015.7114539	wavelet;electronic engineering;speech recognition;second-generation wavelet transform;computer science;theoretical computer science;wavelet packet decomposition;stationary wavelet transform;discrete wavelet transform	EDA	12.974079588601697	-88.91121066222786	121154

The ECG signal varies from person to person and it can be used as a new biometric for individual verification. The discrete wavelet transform extract signal features by wavelet coefficients of one-lead ECG signal. Using the proposed approach on 35 normal subjects and 10 arrhythmia patients, 100% verification rate was obtained for normal subjects and 81% verification rate for arrhythmia patients. Furthermore, the performance of the ECG verification system was evaluated by the false acceptance rate (FAR) and false rejection rate (FRR). The FAR was 0.83% and FRR was 0.86%for a database containing only 35 normal subjects. When 10 arrhythmia patients were added into the database, the FAR became 12.50% and the FRR 5.11%. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system works very well for normal subjects.	biometrics;coefficient;discrete wavelet transform;rejection sampling	Chuang-Chien Chiu;Chou-Min Chuang;Chih-Yu Hsu	2008	2008 International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering (mue 2008)	10.1109/MUE.2008.67	personal identity;computer vision;speech recognition;feature extraction;computer science;information security;signal processing;pattern recognition;discrete wavelet transform;biometrics	EDA	16.89352489500514	-88.56930503502834	121161

Several studies have shown that slow wave brain activities, delta (0-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz), increase as an individual becomes fatigued, while the fast brain activities, alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-35 Hz), decrease. However, an EEG is a complex piece of equipment that is generally used in laboratory based studies. In order to develop a fatigue countermeasure device for train drivers using EEG, there is a need for a simple and wireless EEG monitor.

19ce9aa92868b6c2b3a095be7125a99dbcf343e0	one diffusion acquisition and different white matter models: how does microstructure change in human early development based on wmti and noddi?		White matter microstructural changes during the first three years of healthy brain development are characterized using two different models developed for limited clinical diffusion data: White Matter Tract Integrity (WMTI) metrics from Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI). Both models reveal a non-linear increase in intra-axonal water fraction and in tortuosity of the extra-axonal space as a function of age, in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. The changes are consistent with expected behavior related to myelination and asynchrony of fiber development. The intra- and extracellular axial diffusivities as estimated with WMTI do not change appreciably in normal brain development. The quantitative differences in parameter estimates between models are examined and explained in the light of each model's assumptions and consequent biases, as highlighted in simulations. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of a model with fewer assumptions.	alignment;anatomical compartments;asynchronous i/o;asynchrony (computer programming);body of uterus;corpus callosum;diffusion kurtosis imaging;diffusion tensor imaging;estimated;exhibits as topic;internal capsule of brain;internet authentication service;intuition;knee;leukocytes;magnetic resonance imaging;multi-compartment model;nonlinear system;population parameter;sensorineural hearing loss (disorder);simulation;tissue fiber;tract (literature);white matter;brain development;myelination	Ileana O.

A BCI approach based on event-related potential (ERP) and spectral features of electroencephalographic (EEG) data derived from an auditory oddball paradigm was employed. A 128-channel EEG system recorded potentials while participants simultaneously completed a prolonged visual match-to-sample task. It was hypothesized that better classification rates would be found for a group of “bored” participants, as compared to the not-bored participants. The best classification rates were found by extracting EEG features from gamma frequencies at middle and late latencies (for the standard tones). Critically, the BCI paradigm was most effective for the bored participants (mean misclassification rate = 13%), as compared to the not-bored participants (mean misclassification rate = 21%).

In this study, we experimentally examined how aromatherapy affects the functions of the human brain during foot care by using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Four female subjects received foot care massages and aroma oil massages. We analyzed the changes in their oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentrations based on their brain activity by t-tests, and the t-test results showed significant differences between the foot and aroma oil massages. Our questionnaire results obtained from our subjects showed that they felt more comfortable and relaxed while receiving foot care with aroma oils. These results suggest that aroma oil massages are an effective foot care tool.		Kaoru Eto;Atsuko K.

The data were collected while the monkey viewed four types of optic flow and responded to the change in the display. The mean firing rate (MFR) analysis considered the mean change in firing rate for 500 ms after stimulus onset; the discriminant (DIS) analysis and the principal components (PCA+DIS) analysis considered the change in time-binned firing rate over 1000 ms after stimulus presentation, using bin sizes of 30 to 500 ms. The DIS analysis used a step-down discriminant analysis to find temporal windows in which the cell's firing rate could discriminate among the stimuli; the PCA+DIS analysis extracted the principal components of the cell's firing rates without regard for the stimulus type and then applied a step-down discriminant analysis to the PCA scores to determine whether any of the principal components could discriminate among the stimuli. The two temporal analyses found cells sensitive to the optic flows that the MFR analysis missed. A small proportion of cells showed multiple selectivities under the temporal analyses. Thus, the temporal analyses give a more complete representation of the information encoded by the firing properties of STPa neurons. Finally, this approach incorporates temporal approaches with classical statistical techniques in order to select tuned neurons from a population in an unbiased manner.	bin;epilepsy, temporal lobe;extraction;eye;linear discriminant analysis;macaca;mean squared error;microsoft fingerprint reader;microsoft windows;one thousand;onset (audio);optic flow;optic nerve glioma, childhood;responsiveness	J.

Since these networks are observed by comparing normalized R-fMRI signals, it is difficult to determine the metabolic basis of such group differences. To investigate the metabolic basis of R-fMRI network differences within a normal range, eyes open versus eyes closed in healthy human subjects was used. R-fMRI was recorded simultaneously with fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Higher baseline FDG was observed in the eyes open state. Variance-based metrics calculated from R-fMRI did not match the baseline shift in FDG. Functional connectivity density (FCD)-based metrics showed a shift similar to the baseline shift of FDG, however, this was lost if R-fMRI """"nuisance signals"""" were regressed before FCD calculation. Average correlation with the mean R-fMRI signal across the whole brain, generally regarded as a """"nuisance signal,"""" also showed a shift similar to the baseline of FDG. Thus, despite lacking a baseline itself, changes in whole-brain correlation may reflect changes in baseline brain metabolism. Conversely, variance-based metrics may remain similar between states due to inherent region-to-region differences overwhelming the differences between normal physiological states. As most previous studies have excluded the spatial means of R-fMRI metrics from their analysis, this work presents the first evidence of a potential R-fMRI biomarker for baseline shifts in quantifiable metabolism between brain states."""	ablepharon;baseline dental cement;baseline (configuration management);biological markers;exclusion;eye;family computer disk system;fluorodeoxyglucose f18;functional discourse grammar;magnetic resonance imaging;metabolic process, cellular;positron-emission tomography;positrons;rest;resting state fmri;sample variance;x-ray computed tomography;glucose metabolism;recurrent childhood brain stem glioma;technetium 99m ethylenedicysteine deoxyglucose	Garth Thompson;Valentin Riedl;Timo Grimmer;Alexander Drzezga;Peter Herman;Fahmeed Hyder	2016	Brain connectivity	10.1089/brain.2015.0394	computer science;bioinformatics;data science;data mining	Comp.	20.39156630137308	-80.31481030022633	122411

However, the BCI system based on motor imagery is still not used for real-life application due to the decreasing performance of common spatial pattern algorithm especially when the number of channels is large. In addition, with the increase of channel numbers, multi-channel EEG signals need inconvenient recording preparation and complex calculation, which will be time-consuming and lead to lower classification accuracy. To address this problem, a novel method, named binary multi-objective particle swarm optimization (BMOPSO), is proposed for channel reduction in this paper. The results indicate that the proposed approach is successful in reducing channel number and running time without lowering the classification accuracy.	algorithm;brain–computer interface;common spatial pattern;electroencephalography;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;real life;spatiotemporal pattern;time complexity	Qingguo Wei;Yanmei Wang	2011	2011 4th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics (BMEI)	10.1109/BMEI.2011.6098380	brain–computer interface;algorithm design;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;signal processing;pattern recognition	EDA	16.459009837934186	-93.66954689014317	122426
9248f523f1c194f6f32c70f592db5b6bb3273c3f	sensor agnostic photoplethysmogram signal quality assessment using morphological analysis		In this article, we propose a method to assess the clinical usability of fingertip Photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveform, collected from medical grade oximeter (train data) and smartphone (test data). We introduce a set of novel Signal Quality Indices (SQIs) to represent the noise characteristics of the PPG waveform. The SQIs are presented to a random forest classifier to discriminate between clean and noisy signals. The proposed method was evaluated on datasets annotated by four experts, resulting into a sensitivity and specificity of (92 ± 4.7 %, 95 ± 3 %) and (82.6 ± 4.6 %, 95.4 ± 3.1 %) on train and test data respectively. Further we applied the proposed method on PPG waveform of clinically proven control and disease population of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), which resulted into (77 %, 77 %) of sensitivity and specificity respectively.	computer-aided design;random forest;sensitivity and specificity;smartphone;test data;usability;waveform	Shahnawaz Alam;Shreyasi Datta;Anirban Dutta Choudhury;Arpan Pal	2017		10.1145/3144457.3144487	cad;computer science;usability;morphological analysis;test data;distributed computing;waveform;population;random forest;artificial intelligence;photoplethysmogram;pattern recognition	HCI	14.569090355392218	-88.64301012614328	122446

The task consisted in pressing the fingertip against a flat rigid surface that provided either sinusoidal or broadband vibration. Three force levels were considered, ranging from light touch to hard press. Finger contact areas were measured during the experiment, showing positive correlation with the respective applied forces. Significant effects on thresholds were found for vibration type and force level. Moreover, possibly due to the concurrent effect of large (unconstrained) finger contact areas, active pressing forces, and long duration stimuli, the measured perceptual thresholds are considerably lower than what previously reported in the literature.	acclimatization;experiment;fingertip dosing unit;haptic device component;haptic technology;muscle rigidity;requirement;skeletal bone;tendon structure	Stefano Papetti;Hanna Järveläinen;Bruno L.

The investigation was carried out on a group of 28 typical subjects as well as the subjects affected by Pes Planovalgus and Cerebral Palsy. The decision tree has been inducted by means of the vector of 255 values describing single stride with 51 samples per each of five zones of the human foot. The classification made by the resultant decision tree was correct for more then 94% strides. This allows to point the parameters which are the best discriminators between the investigated types of human gait.	decision tree;gait analysis	Marcin Derlatka;Mikhail Ihnatouski	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-13208-7_74	simulation;gait analysis;gait;computer science;decision tree	NLP	13.475780985437522	-90.29086247109313	122505

For this preliminary study, a human-machine system to investigate cooperative work was developed. Blood flow changes in the brain were examined using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and a region of interest (ROI) was determined. The relationships between the difficulty in cooperation and brain activity were assessed. A tapping task between a person and a machine was performed as a cooperative task. The machine provided a sound stimulus and the person tapped in correspondence to this stimulus. The stimulus interval was fixed, but stimuli were presented with disturbances. We assumed that degree of this disturbance was equal to the difficulty of cooperation. Our results demonstrated that cerebral activation was observed near the inferior frontal gyrus when the stimulus disturbance increased. Thus, the inferior frontal gyrus was the cerebral region associated with cooperation.	computer multitasking;electroencephalography;human–machine system;region of interest;the machine	Tomoyuki Hiroyasu;Mao Goto;Utako Yamamoto;Hisatake Yokouchi	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/SMC.2013.662	functional near-infrared spectroscopy;electroencephalography;hemodynamics	Robotics	16.351632661915467	-80.82995770348398	122564

A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used to model the movement and idle-related EEG data. The GMM built along with appropriate classification and post processing methods are used to detect movement onsets using self-paced EEG signals recorded from five subjects, achieving True–False rate difference between 63 and 98%. The results show significant performance enhancement using the proposed unsupervised method, both in the sample-by-sample classification accuracy and the event-by-event performance, in comparison with the state-of-the-art supervised methods.

Using vibrotactile and auditory stimuli as independent activation tasks, we studied the scanner performance under different imaging conditions in five healthy volunteers. Cerebral blood flow images were acquired from each volunteer using H2(15)O bolus injections of activity varying from 5-20 mCi. One-session dose-fractionation strategies were analyzed for rCBF, standard activity-concentration, switched, and cold-bolus/switched protocols. Performance characteristics. The scanner dead time grew linearly with injected dose from 10% to 25%. Random events varied from 30% to 50% of the detected events. Random and scattered events were corrected adequately at all doses. Estimated noise-effective-count curves plateau at about 10 mCi. One-session 12-injection bolus PET activation protocols. Using an acquisition protocol that accounts for the scanner performance and the practical aspects of imaging volunteers and neurological patients in a single same-day session, we assessed the correlation between the significance of activation foci and the dose/injection used. The one-session protocol employs 12 bolus injections/subject. We present evidence suggesting that when an rCBF protocol is used, image noise is reduced significantly when the activity injected increases from 5 to 10 mCi. Increasing the dose from 10 to 15 or 20 mCi yielded further but smaller reductions. Our observations also suggest that image noise will be strongly reduced if a 20-mCi dose/injection is used when data are collected using protocols that employ long acquisition times such as a switched or a cold-bolus/switched protocol.	bolus tracking;data acquisition;electron tomography;exact brand biomedical or dental material;image noise;patients;polyethylene terephthalate;positron-emission tomography;positrons;protocols documentation;scanner device component;scanning systems;small	J.

The data were acquired during a blocked experiment design: viewing unpleasant (Class 1), neutral (Class 2) and pleasant pictures (Class 3). In the multi-subject level analysis, we used a """"leave-one-subject-out"""" approach, i.e. in each iteration, we trained the SVM using data from all but one subject and tested its performance in predicting the class label of the this last subject's data. In the single-subject level analysis, we used a """"leave-one-block-out"""" approach, i.e. for each subject, we selected randomly one block per condition to be the test block and trained the SVM using data from the remaining blocks. Our results showed that in a single-subject level both temporal compression and space selection improved the SVM accuracy.

However, it is necessary to know their contraction dynamics in order to artificially induce them at the right moment of a walking cycle. This requires understanding the temporal activation pattern of both surface and deep muscles simultaneously. This study aimed at developing a system to measure and analyze the temporal activation of both surface and deep muscles during voluntary contraction and flexor reflexes (also called withdrawal reflexes) using ultrasound imaging. A set of experiments were done to verify the validity of the system, while exploring the temporal pattern of muscle activation during flexor reflexes. As a result, we were able to quantify the surface and deep muscle activity by measuring the muscle thickness, pennation angle and long-axis displacement, from the ultrasound images.

We consider the inverse problem of detecting the cog-nitive state of a human subject based on the fMRI data. We have explored classification techniques such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbour and Support Vector Machines. In order to reduce the very high dimensional fMRI data, we have used three feature selection strategies. Discriminating features and activity based features were used to select features for the problem of identifying the instantaneous cognitive state given a single fMRI scan and correlation based features were used when fMRI data from a single time interval was given. A case study of visuo-motor sequence learning is presented. The set of cognitive states we are interested in detecting are whether the subject has learnt a sequence, and if the subject is paying attention only towards the position or towards both the color and position of the visual stimuli. We have successfully used correlation based features to detect position-color related cog-nitive states with 80% accuracy and the cognitive states related to learning with 62.5% accuracy.	cog (project);cognition;color;feature selection;feature vector;machine learning;naive bayes classifier;resonance;sensor;support vector machine	Vishwajeet Singh;Krishna P.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between central artery stiffness, axonal and myelin integrity in 54 cognitively unimpaired elderly subjects (65-75 years old).   METHODS The neuronal fiber integrity of brain WM was assessed using diffusion tensor metrics and magnetization transfer imaging as measures of axonal organization (Fractional anisotropy, Radial diffusivity) and state of myelination (Myelin volume fraction). Central artery stiffness was measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Statistical analyses included 4 regions (the corpus callosum, the internal capsule, the corona radiata and the superior longitudinal fasciculus) which have been previously denoted as vulnerable to increased central artery stiffness.   RESULTS cfPWV was significantly associated with fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity (p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) but not with myelin volume fraction. Findings from this study also show that improved executive function performance correlates with Fractional anisotropy positively (p < 0.05 corrected) as well as with myelin volume fraction and radial diffusivity negatively (p < 0.05 corrected).   CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that arterial stiffness is associated with axon degeneration rather than demyelination. Controlling arterial stiffness may play a role in maintaining the health of WM axons in the aging brain.

2123f5f09edfc009176712a8e90a7113b94b209b	an evaluation of hand-force prediction using artificial neural-network regression models of surface emg signals for handwear devices		Hand-force prediction is an important technology for hand-oriented user interface systems. Specifically, surface electromyography (sEMG) is a promising technique for hand-force prediction, which requires a sensor with a small design space and low hardware costs. In this study, we applied several artificial neural-network (ANN) regression models with different numbers of neurons and hidden layers and evaluated handgrip forces by using a dynamometer. A handwear with dry electrodes on the dorsal interosseous muscles was used for our evaluation. Eleven healthy subjects participated in our experiments. sEMG signals with six different levels of forces from0N to 200N andmaximumvoluntary contraction (MVC) aremeasured to train and test ourANN regressionmodels. We evaluated three different methods (intrasession, intrasubject, and intersubject evaluation), and our experimental results show a high correlation (0.840, 0.770, and 0.789 each) between the predicted forces and observed forces, which are normalized by theMVC for each subject. Our results also reveal that ANNs with deeper layers of up to four hidden layers show fewer errors in intrasession and intrasubject evaluations.	artificial neural network;electromyography;experiment;model–view–controller;user interface	Masayuki Yokoyama;Ryohei Koyama;Masao Yanagisawa	2017	J.

A total of 25 blood cortisol profiles, sampled from 10 healthy North American men, 16-28 years of age, every 4 h for 24 h across all seasons, serve for the computation of a so-called paradesm, a 90% prediction region for the circadian amplitude-acrophase pair. A statistically significant circadian rhythm is found as the principal spectral feature in cortisol data from 58 Spanish children of short stature, 6-14 years of age, sampled at about 3-h intervals for 24 h. Differences in age, ethnicity, climate, diet, health, and sampling conditions between the two populations notwithstanding, individual estimates of the circadian amplitude and acrophase are inside the reference paradesm for 37 of 42 boys and 12 of 16 girls. The validation of the paradesm used awaits the addition of more data and procedures for nonparametric resampling, such as bootstrapping, when testing this approach further for diagnostic purposes in the clinic. >		Leopoldo Garcia;Ramón C.

Until recently, the difficulty of manual delineation has limited volumetric analyses of MR data sets to a few select regions and a small number of subjects. Increased throughput offered by faster imaging methods, automated segmentation, and deformation-based morphometry have recently been applied to overcome this limitation with mouse models of neurological conditions. We use automated analyses to produce an unbiased view of volumetric changes in a transgenic mouse model for Alzheimer's disease (AD) at two points in the progression of disease: immediately before and shortly after the onset of amyloid formation. In addition to the cortex and hippocampus, where atrophy has been well documented in AD patients, we identify volumetric losses in the pons and substantia nigra where neurodegeneration has not been carefully examined. We find that deficits in cortical volume precede amyloid formation in this mouse model, similar to presymptomatic atrophy seen in patients with familial AD. Unexpectedly, volumetric losses identified by MR outside of the forebrain predict locations of future amyloid formation, such as the inferior colliculus and spinal nuclei, which develop pathology at very late stages of disease. Our work provides proof-of-principle that MR microscopy can expand our view of AD by offering a complete and unbiased examination of volumetric changes that guide us in revisiting the canonical neuropathology.	alzheimer's disease;atrophic;color gradient;document completion status - documented;hyperlipoproteinemia type i;inferior colliculus;juvenile spinal muscular atrophy;mice, transgenic;morphometric analysis;morphometrics;neuropathology;onset (audio);osteoporosis, postmenopausal;patients;pontine structure;prosencephalon;resonance;substantia nigra structure;throughput;nervous system disorder	Alexandra Badea;G.

ec9014b63428a6f90c2a85e6855f19f16388b1e4	classification of upper limb phantom movements in transhumeral amputees using electromyographic and kinematic features		Abstract Recent studies have shown the ability of transhumeral amputees to generate surface electromyography (sEMG) patterns associated to distinct phantom limb movements of the hand, wrist and elbow. This ability could improve the control of myoelectric prostheses with multiple degrees of freedom (DoF). However, the main issue of these studies is that these ones record sEMG from sites that cannot always be integrated in a prosthesis socket. This study aims to evaluate the classification accuracy of eight main upper limb phantom movements and a no movement class in transhumeral amputees based on sEMG data recorded exclusively on the residual limb. A sub-objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of kinematic data on the classification accuracy. Five transhumeral amputees participated in this study. Classification accuracy obtained with an artificial neural network ranged between 60.9% and 93.0%. Accuracy decreased if the number of DoF considered in the classification increased, and/or if the phantom movements became more distal. Adding a kinematic feature produced an average increase of 4.8% in accuracy. This study may lead to the development of a new myoelectric control method for multi-DoF prostheses based on phantom movements of the amputee and kinematic data of the prosthesis.	electromyography;imaging phantom	Guillaume Gaudet;Maxime Raison;Sofiane Achiche	2018	Eng.

c7160ff7910856ffc1c9a58e42b0cee8279a2265	parametric dependencies of sliding window correlation		Objective: In this paper, we explore the dependence of sliding window correlation (SWC) results on different parameters of correlating signals. The SWC is extensively used to explore the dynamics of functional connectivity (FC) networks using resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) scans. These scanned signals often contain multiple amplitudes, frequencies, and phases. However, the exact values of these parameters are unknown. Two recent studies explored the relationship of window length and frequencies (minimum/maximum) in the correlating signals. Methods: We extend the findings of these studies by using two deterministic signals with multiple amplitudes, frequencies, and phases. Afterward, we modulate one of the signals to introduce dynamics (nonstationarity) in their relationship. We also explore the relationship of window length and frequency band for real rsfMRI data. Results: For deterministic signals, the spurious fluctuations due to the method itself minimize, and the SWC estimates the stationary correlation when frequencies in the signals have specific relationship. For dynamic relationship also, the undesirable frequencies were removed under specific conditions for the frequencies. For real rsfMRI data, the SWC results varied with frequencies and window length. Conclusion: In the absence of any “ground truth” for different parameters in real rsfMRI signals, the SWC with a constant window size may not be a reliable method to study the dynamics of the FC. Significance: This study reveals the parametric dependencies of the SWC and its limitation as a method to analyze dynamics of FC networks in the absence of any ground truth.	adobe swc file;estimated;frequency band;functional gastrointestinal disorders;ground truth;parametric oscillator;rest;resting state fmri;scanning;stationary process;structure of cochlear window;window function	Sadia Shakil;Jacob C.

Twelve participants (MCI: 4, history of MCI: 2, healthy elderly: 6) were recruited from the region of Philadelphia in the USA to perform a VR-IADL task. We found that touch interaction in toast task and coffee task are more difficult than that of MCI patients with having history of MCI as well as healthy older adults. Also, we found that behavioral features using autoregressive model with finger velocity data calculated from finger position data measuring in VR-IADL. Several types of feature patterns were extracted from touch interaction and finger position data. Based on the feature pattern, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was performed to calculate the accuracy of the feature patter for characterization of MCI. As the result, the sensitivity and specificity were 83%.	virtual reality	Yuki Kubota;Takehiko Yamaguchi;Tetsuya Harada;Tania Giovannetti	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-58524-6_13	support vector machine;activities of daily living;virtual reality;artificial intelligence;cognition;computer science;pattern recognition	HCI	11.500676444631225	-91.47129183469261	124219

To determine whether ECG computer programs can replace cardiologists in epidemiological studies and clinical trials, we reviewed the literature for evidence, concentrating on one influential ECG measurement, viz. QT interval duration, and one classification method, the Minnesota Code, which is the de facto standard for ECG coding. We compared interobserver variabilities of cardiologists with differences between computer programs and cardiologists, in order not to prejudice against the computer. Studies that contain this type of information indicate that interobserver variabilities are at least as large as differences between computer and cardiologist. This suggests that ECG computer programs perform at least equally well as human observers in ECG measurement and coding, and can replace the cardiologist in epidemiological studies and clinical trials.	computer program;computer programming;electrocardiography;email;epidemiology;informatics (discipline);interobserver variation;prejudice;science;viz: the computer game;observers	Jan A.

Ten of the methods were variants of the algorithmic complexity and the covariance complexity. The eleventh measure was a multivariate complexity measure proposed by Tononi and Edelman. The most significant between-condition change was observed with Tononi–Edelman complexity which decreased in the eyes open condition. Of the algorithmic complexity measures tested, the binary Lempel–Ziv complexity and the binary Lempel–Ziv redundancy of the first principal component following mean normalization and normalization against the standard deviation gave the most significant between-group discrimination. A time-dependent generalization of the covariance complexity that can be applied to nonstationary multichannel signals is also described.	analysis of algorithms;blum axioms;computational complexity theory;electroencephalography;kolmogorov complexity;lz77 and lz78;lempel–ziv–stac;principal component analysis	P.

At present, computerized fetal monitoring systems for on-line automated  signal analysis are widely used. But effective techniques enabling conclusion generation are still being searched, and neural  networks (NN) seem to be particularly attractive. In the presented work a number of investigations were carried out concerning  application of NN when quantitative parameters describing fetal CTG signal — input variables - were used for prediction of  fetal outcome (normal or abnormal). We tested how the efficiency of NN classification could be influenced by different modification  of inputs, by interpretation of fetal outcome definition (output) as well as by various modifications of learning data sets.  The obtained results gave a good background for application of the proposed classification tool within computer-aided fetal  surveillance systems.

63d3f0a555b0b0ec703b6c2e4d85b8a5f6390c8a	a smartphone-based system for automated bedside detection of crackle sounds in diffuse interstitial pneumonia patients	automatic detection;crackles;respiratory sounds;smartphone;time-varying autoregressive model	In this work, we present a mobile health system for the automated detection of crackle sounds comprised by an acoustical sensor, a smartphone device, and a mobile application (app) implemented in Android. Although pulmonary auscultation with traditional stethoscopes had been used for decades, it has limitations for detecting discontinuous adventitious respiratory sounds (crackles) that commonly occur in respiratory diseases. The proposed app allows the physician to record, store, reproduce, and analyze respiratory sounds directly on the smartphone. Furthermore, the algorithm for crackle detection was based on a time-varying autoregressive modeling. The performance of the automated detector was analyzed using: (1) synthetic fine and coarse crackle sounds randomly inserted to the basal respiratory sounds acquired from healthy subjects with different signal to noise ratios, and (2) real bedside acquired respiratory sounds from patients with interstitial diffuse pneumonia. In simulated scenarios, for fine crackles, an accuracy ranging from 84.86% to 89.16%, a sensitivity ranging from 93.45% to 97.65%, and a specificity ranging from 99.82% to 99.84% were found. The detection of coarse crackles was found to be a more challenging task in the simulated scenarios. In the case of real data, the results show the feasibility of using the developed mobile health system in clinical no controlled environment to help the expert in evaluating the pulmonary state of a subject.

Like texture perception through direct touch with the finger, texture perception by indirect means of a probe is multi-dimensional, comprising rough, hard, and sticky texture continua. In this study, we describe the individual subject variability in probe-mediated texture perception, and compare similarities and differences of texture perception between direct touch and indirect touch. The results show variability among subjects, as individual subjects may choose to rely on different degrees of three texture dimensions and do so at different scanning velocities. Despite this variability between scanning conditions within each subject, the subjects make consistently reliable discriminations of textures and subjective magnitude estimates along texture continua when indirectly exploring texture surfaces with a probe. These data contribute information that is valuable to the design of robotic sensory systems, and to the understanding of sensory feedback, which is essential in teleoperations.	basal ganglia diseases;dimensions;epilepsia partialis continua;estimated;friction;heart rate variability;image scanner;judgment;justin (robot);mechanoreceptors;nl (complexity);nash equilibrium;neuroctenus parus;numerous;quantity;rheumatoid arthritis;robot;ross quinlan;stag1 gene;scanning;sensory feedback;spatial variability;sticky bit;technical support;traffic collision avoidance system;united states national institutes of health;velocity (software development);vibration - physical agent	Takashi Yoshioka;Julia Zhou	2009	Advanced robotics : the international journal of the Robotics Society of Japan	10.1163/156855309X431703	sensory system;computer vision;multimedia;texture	Robotics	14.309988410212089	-80.74581801146297	125266

When applying FES a common problem is that stimulation electrodes have to be placed with great care in order to avoid activation of muscles close to the target muscles. A promising approach to circumvent this problem is to employ multipad FES, i.e. to employ electrode arrays containing many small electrodes allowing selective activation of muscles. In this work an algorithm is presented which automatically determines subsets of active electrodes and stimulation currents such that movements with user-specified amplitudes are induced. Using a recently developed portable multipad FES system and a virtual reality dataglove, the algorithm was tested with seven able-bodied subjects. Stimulation with parameters determined by the algorithm led to movements with a median deviation of between 0° and 5° from the specified wrist angle and between 0% and 12% from the specified degree of finger flexion.	cerebrovascular accident;closing (morphology);finger tree;functional electrical stimulation;mental suffering;movement;muscle;patients;shin megami tensei: persona 3;spinal cord injuries;virtual reality;wired glove;algorithm;electrode	Ulrich Hoffmann;Martin Deinhofer;Thierry Keller	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346314	physical medicine and rehabilitation;engineering;biomechanics;physical therapy;physiology;surgery	Robotics	13.920747676795225	-83.59476423923432	125333
c994d77f42f996ce70bd10616fb7cb5187cab79e	validation of energy expenditure prediction models using real-time shoe-based motion detectors		Objective: This study aimed to verify and compare the accuracy of energy expenditure (EE) prediction models using shoe-based motion detectors with embedded accelerometers. Methods: Three physical activity (PA) datasets (unclassified, recognition, and intensity segmentation) were used to develop three prediction models. A multiple classification flow and these models were used to estimate EE. The “unclassified” dataset was defined as the data without PA recognition, the “recognition” as the data classified with PA recognition, and the “intensity segmentation” as the data with intensity segmentation. The three datasets contained accelerometer signals (quantified as signal magnitude area (SMA)) and net heart rate (HRnet). The accuracy of these models was assessed according to the deviation between physically measured EE and model-estimated EE. Results: The variance between physically measured EE and model-estimated EE expressed by simple linear regressions was increased by 63% and 13% using SMA and HRnet, respectively. The accuracy of the EE predicted from accelerometer signals is influenced by the different activities that exhibit different count-EE relationships within the same prediction model. Conclusion: The recognition model provides a better estimation and lower variability of EE compared with the unclassified and intensity segmentation models. Significance: The proposed shoe-based motion detectors can improve the accuracy of EE estimation and has great potential to be used to manage everyday exercise in real time.	classification;contain (action);detectors;dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry;embedded system;embedding;energy metabolism;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;exercise;motion detector;real-time transcription;regression - mental defense mechanism;sample variance;signal magnitude area;silo (dataset);spatial variability;spinal muscular atrophy;accelerometers;biologic segmentation	Shih-Yun Lin;Ying-Chih Lai;Chi-Chun Hsia;Pei-Fang Su;Chih-Han Chang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2016.2636906	sma*;predictive modelling;computer vision;linear regression;speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;detector;pattern recognition	Vision	12.18625637907191	-86.12218738584433	125351

In the study we used 6-h nighttime data from 107 patients aged 60-71 y. We compare the results between male and female groups obtaining a larger diversity in males. Unfortunately, the decrease of the DC parameter, which is used as mortality risk marker in other several regulatory dysfunctions is not applicable for aortic stenosis in risk stratification. We did not observe distinction of patients who died earlier than one year after surgery. In spite of this, we introduce the modified nDC and Acceleration Capacity (nAC) parameters for a better assessment of the ability to lengthen and shorten RR intervals.	aortic valve stenosis;autonomic computing;autonomic nervous system;cns disorder;cessation of life;hardware acceleration;large;patients;population parameter;rapid refresh;signal averaging;stratification	Monika Petelczyc;Olga Lipinska;Ewa Orlowska-Baranowska;Rafal Baranowski;Jan Jacek Zebrowski	2013	Computing in Cardiology 2013		medicine;biological engineering;surgery;cardiology	ML	17.23193687840889	-84.07504586270448	125358
14eae844f4ddc6db207f5555b782167c5d4b1abb	analysis of uterine electromyography signals in preterm condition using multifractal algorithm		In this work, an attempt has been made to analyze the preterm (gestation period $\leq 37$ weeks) condition using uterine electromyography (EMG) signals and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA). The signals recorded from the electrodes placed on the surface of abdomen are used for this study and these are obtained from a publically available online database. These signals are preprocessed using 4-pole digital Butterworth filter. The preprocessed signals are subjected to MFDFA to extract multifractal features namely maximum singularity exponent, peak singularity exponent, strength of multifractality and exponent index. Generalized Hurst exponent extracted from the signals indicate that uterine EMG signals show multifractal behavior in preterm condition. Among the extracted features the coefficient of variation is found to be lower for peak singularity exponent. This indicates that this feature have lower inter-subject variability. Hence, it appears that the multifractal features can help in the assessment of uterine EMG signals for preterm detection.	algorithm;biological markers;butterworth filter;coefficient;data pre-processing;detrended fluctuation analysis;electromyography;extraction;hurst exponent;j.w. graham medal;multifractal system;quantum fluctuation;sensor;singularity project;spatial variability;the stanley parable;time series;uterine corpus carcinosarcoma;uterus;volume;electrode	N.

Compared with other electrophysiological measurements, such as electrocardiography, the progress of the applicability of the EGG has been very slow. Unlike imaging or manometrical studies, stomach motility disorders are not diagnosed based only on abnormal EGG parameters. Limitations of EGG recording, processing, computation, acceptable normal parameters, technique and reading should be known to conduct subjective assessments when EGG is used to resolve stomach dysfunction. Therefore appropriate application of non-invasive EGG should go on providing more information and insight in understanding these limitations. And so the aim of this study were to contribute the evolution of the EGG to enter the clinical world as a routine check-up method and to develop new time-frequency analysis method for the detection of gastric dysrhythmia from the EGG.	computation;discrete wavelet transform;evaluation procedure;frequency analysis;gastric acid;gastric tissue;stomach neoplasms;time–frequency analysis;checkup examination;electrode;gastric motility	Mahmut Tokmakçi	2007	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-007-9069-9	time–frequency analysis;medicine;pathology;computer science;discrete wavelet transform;anatomy	HCI	18.106946993965682	-86.94849264177961	125954

However, traditional medical devices are often bulky and expensive, and unsuitable for home healthcare. In this paper, we proposed an easy and inexpensive technique to estimate continuous blood pressure from the heart sound signals acquired by the microphone of a smartphone. A cold-pressor experiment was performed in 32 healthy subjects, with a smartphone to acquire heart sound signals and with a commercial device to measure continuous blood pressure. The Fourier spectrum of the second heart sound and the blood pressure were regressed using a support vector machine, and the accuracy of the regression was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. Statistical analysis showed that the mean correlation coefficients between the predicted values from the regression model and the measured values from the commercial device were 0.707, 0.712, and 0.748 for systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure, respectively, and that the mean errors were less than 5 mmHg, with standard deviations less than 8 mmHg. These results suggest that this technique is of potential use for cuffless and continuous blood pressure monitoring and it has promising application in home healthcare services.	cardiovascular diseases;coefficient;continuous sphygmomanometers;cross-validation (statistics);diastole;fourier analysis;heart sounds;heart failure;hypertensive disease;microphone device component;patients;smartphone;support vector machine;torr;triangulation	Rong-Chao Peng;Wen-Rong Yan;Ning-Ling Zhang;Wan-Hua Lin;Xiao-Lin Zhou;Yuan-Ting Zhang	2015		10.3390/s150923653	support vector machine;computer science;engineering;blood pressure;biological engineering;cross-validation	HCI	12.697611804462225	-86.17476128190988	125963

The current dynamic models have little clinical relevance because they cannot be correlated with the real-time signals from a human heart. This research presents a new approach for real-time simulation of the heart dynamics where the activation functions for the heart model are derived from the measured electrocardiogram (ECG) signal recording. The model is developed based on lumped mass nonlinear differential equations that can capture the coupled mechanical and physiological actions of the heart chambers, valves, pulmonary and systemic blood circulation loops. The model was implemented in Matlab/Simulink environment and tested using signals in MGH/MF Waveform Datasets from PhysioNet database. The results show that the model was able to discern the effect of variations in the electrical activations, as captured by ECG features on other heart signals, including the profiles of instantaneous pressure and volumes in different chambers and circulations. In specific, the time and frequency patterns of the right atrium and pulmonary blood pressure signals from the model closely match with the real measurements of arterial and pulmonary blood pressure, respectively. Furthermore, the model-derived pulmonary vein pressure matches with measured respiratory impedance signals. These findings support the suitability of developing a virtual instrument platform where the model-derived signals (presented appropriately) are used for clinical diagnostic in lieu of expensive instrumentations. In addition, the causal relationships between variations in ECG and the model outputs, such as pressure and volume signals, suggest definitive diagnosis methods for certain cardiovascular pathologies which are not easy to diagnosis from the ECG patterns.	causality;characteristic impedance;matlab;monumenta germaniae historica;nonlinear system;norm (social);real-time clock;real-time transcription;relevance;simulation;simulink;unix signal;virtual instrumentation;waveform	Trung Q.

In a previous study [2], we replicated the work of Montolio et al., [5] and demonstrated that, for a larger dataset, time of day of test using the AGIS metric did make a difference to the measurement of glaucoma, supporting Montolio et als work. However, in our earlier study, we used the AGIS scores for both eyes combined. In this paper, we use the measurement from just one eye at a time. A dataset of 14389 left eye AGIS scores and the same number for the right eye from 2468 Moorfield Eye Hospital patients was used as the empirical basis. We then re-compared time of test results with those of Montolios study. Results revealed that using the values from just one eye (as opposed to both) may give a distorted picture of the AGIS scores; differences in the same time period were found between the two eyes. This may have implications for choice of sampling data and analysis of glaucoma using the AGIS metric.	sampling (signal processing);software metric	Steve Counsell;Stephen Swift;Allan Tucker	2017	2017 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)	10.1109/CBMS.2017.60	statistics;data mining;simulation;computer science;sampling (statistics);glaucoma	SE	22.84851529715515	-84.53016538819229	126305

A comprehensive methodology of quantifying reproducibility of activation patterns in intracerebral electroencephalography signals is presented. It may be applied to various forms of transient epileptic events under the assumption that a time of occurrence may be assigned to them. In this paper, the method is used on two different forms of interictal events (interictal spikes or sharpwaves and transient bursts of fast activity). The methodology is based on signal processing and data mining algorithms and proceeds in three steps: (1) detection of transient paroxysmal events (monochannel event); (2) identification of quasisynchronous transient paroxysmal events (multichannel events); and (3) automatic extraction of similar activation patterns. Results show that the methodology allows reproducible sequential activation sets to be identified from signals recorded in four patients. Potential advantages of the method are discussed with respect to other approaches.	brute-force search;complement system proteins;computation (action);data mining;drug resistant epilepsy;edit distance;electroencephalography;epilepsy, complex partial;epilepsy, temporal lobe;extraction;futures studies;patients;personnameuse - assigned;rough set;seizures;sensor;signal processing;time complexity;voltage spike;algorithm	Jérôme Bourien;Jean-Jacques Bellanger;Fabrice Bartolomei;Patrick Chauvel;Fabrice Wendling	2004	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2003.820397	neuroscience;index term;electroencephalography;computer science;signal processing;data mining;biological engineering	ML	18.778948180572165	-85.7336838585588	126738

Developing a therapeutic response requires a precise measure of disease progression. However, since the early stages are for the most part asymptomatic, obtaining accurate measures of disease progression is difficult. Longitudinal databases of hundreds of subjects observed during several years with tens of validated biomarkers are becoming available, allowing the use of computational methods. We propose a widely applicable statistical methodology for creating a disease progression score (DPS), using multiple biomarkers, for subjects with a neurodegenerative disease. The proposed methodology was evaluated for Alzheimer's disease (AD) using the publicly available AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, yielding an Alzheimer's DPS or ADPS score for each subject and each time-point in the database. In addition, a common description of biomarker changes was produced allowing for an ordering of the biomarkers. The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall was found to be the earliest biomarker to become abnormal. The group of biomarkers comprising the volume of the hippocampus and the protein concentration amyloid beta and Tau were next in the timeline, and these were followed by three cognitive biomarkers. The proposed methodology thus has potential to stage individuals according to their state of disease progression relative to a population and to deduce common behaviors of biomarkers in the disease itself.	alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative;behavior;biological markers;color gradient;database;disease progression;hepatolenticular degeneration;learning disorders;nerve degeneration;neurodegenerative disorders;one health initiative;pictbridge;population;progressive disease;steady state;timeline fluoride releasing resin	Bruno Jedynak;Andrew Lang;Bo Liu;Elyse Katz;Yanwei Zhang;Bradley T.

Healthy subjects participated in this experience walked for each speed 5 minute in order of three different speed; 2, 4 km per hour on the computer controlled treadmill and EMG activity from lower limb muscles (rectus femoris, vastus medialis, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius and soleus) were recorded. The EMG data rectified and data processing all waves, and calculated the integrated EMG (iEMG) and motor units activity. Statistical processing used one way repeated measures ANOVA (=0.05). Consequently, EMG activity has increased with the rise of walking speed. At the same speed for difference of forward and backward walking, especially selective TA muscle activity was significantly high value than forward walking. It was consider that muscle atrophy of aging was prevented on backward walking. More specifically it has experimental speculation that backward walking was to perform common activities of daily living for elderly to prevent motor disfunctions.	electromyography;medial graph;rectifier (neural networks)	Takeshi Sato;Takayuki Watanabe;Hiroshi Yasuoka;Kazuaki Kawashima;Masami Miyazaki	2010		10.3182/20100831-4-FR-2021.00060	simulation;power walking;physical medicine and rehabilitation;engineering;physical therapy	HCI	13.800679168956675	-83.0245142113489	127244

Imaging from a single subject showing improved MBSImP™© scores in 17 of 18 pre- to post-treatment swallows was selected for analysis. Using a semi-automated MATLAB tracker tool, a frame-by-frame annotation of 10 coordinates mapping muscle functional groups was performed during oropharyngeal swallowing. Computational analysis of coordinate shape change was executed using MorphoJ software to determine differences in swallowing mechanics associated with multiple independent variables. Canonical variant analysis indicated significant differences in mechanics associated with respiratory-swallow phase training (D=1.92,p<.0001). Vectors allowed for visualization of changes in swallowing mechanics associated with respiratory-swallow phase training. A regression of shape associated with laryngeal vestibular closure on respiratory-swallow phase training was highly significant (p<.0001) and accounted for 94.1% of the variance.

Previous studies of this technique have begun to address some sources of interference e.g. subject movements, but have not investigated operation during speech production when breathing patterns are known to be substantially different to normal respiration. We demonstrate measurement of speech breathing with a wireless tri-axial accelerometer in a synchronously captured dataset, including annotated audio and electro-magnetic articulograph data. We find agreement between peaks in the accelerometer-derived rotation signal and manually annotated breath timings, and correlation between peak rotations and the duration of audible in breaths. In speech breathing the rotation rate signal does not appear to be a good proxy for airflow rate as previously suggested, and instead seems to better reflect the role of specific muscles around the accelerometer location. We conclude that the method can be usable during speech breathing, but that this difference should be considered. The method has some advantages for speech breathing research due to its unobtrusive nature.	interference (communication);triangular function;unobtrusive javascript	Andrew Bates;Martin J.

We study the effects of measurement and dynamical noises on low-dimensional chaotic systems, and present a numerical algorithm for estimating to what extent heart rhythm is corrupted by dynamical noises. Further analysis shows that adding increasing amounts of dynamical noise increasingly develops the complexity of chaotic dynamics. The method need not fully reconstruct an attractor, thus it is robust to measurement noises. Finally, the ECG of 53 subjects falling into three groups were used to test the algorithm. From the measured R-R intervals, a time series of 1000 first order difference points was used to estimate dynamical noise levels. We found that the estimated dynamical noise levels were correlated to the different classes of ECG.	chaos theory	Wenjiang Pei;Luxi Yang;Zhenya He	1999		10.1109/IJCNN.1999.836268	identification;entropy;simulation;computer science;noise;time series;first-order logic;control theory;mathematics;dynamic program analysis	Robotics	20.042540744734435	-86.46222477788156	127481
cc290858fdf5c97794daddd6bfc9d5b8965db556	differences between model-based electrocardiogram t wave features before and after haemodialysis		Electrolytes play an essential role in the regulation of the heart, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) can be a useful instrument for detecting metabolic disturbances. Hyperkalaemia, usually clinically silent, is a medical condition known for higher serum potassium levels and it is one of the causes of sudden cardiac deaths in chronic kidney disease patients. In order to develop a unobtrusive method capable of monitoring potassium changes remotely, our study investigated which ECG parameters are sensitive to fluctuations during the interdialytic period. Specifically, we evaluated 14 morphological and 5 model-based ECG features. Results show that T wave features: right slope, the ratio of the right slope and T wave peak amplitude, and lognormal fitting parameters show statistically significant differences if evaluated before and after haemodialysis.	sensor	A.

Signals from a waist worn Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) provides sufficient accelerometric and gyroscopic information for estimating gait parameter and identifying HS events. In this paper we propose a novel adaptive, unsupervised, and parameter-free identification method for detection of HS events during gait episodes. Our proposed method allows the device to learn and adapt to the profile of the user without the need of supervision. The algorithm is completely parameter-free and requires no prior fine tuning. Autocorrelation features (ACF) of both antero-posterior acceleration (aAP) and medio-lateral acceleration (aML) are used to determine cadence episodes. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features of signal peaks during cadence are extracted and clustered using Swarm Rapid Centroid Estimation (Swarm RCE). Left HS (LHS), Right HS (RHS), and movement artifacts are clustered based on intra-cluster correlation. Initial pilot testing of the system on 8 subjects show promising results up to 84.3%±9.2% and 86.7%±6.9% average accuracy with 86.8%±9.2% and 88.9%±7.1% average precision for the segmentation of LHS and RHS respectively.	acf;acetaminophen;algorithm;apache axis;arbitrary code execution;autocorrelation;bilateral filter;desert strike: return to the gulf;discrete wavelet transform;enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay unit per milliliter;estimated;extraction;fasciitis, plantar;gait disorders, neurologic;gait analysis;gyroscope;hereditary autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia;hypothalamic area, lateral;information retrieval;lateral thinking;leukemia, myelocytic, acute;morphologic artifacts;population parameter;posterior hypothalamic region;star catalogue;swarm;unsupervised learning;biologic segmentation	Mitchell Yuwono;Steven W.

Speech samples from the University College London Archive of Stuttered Speech (UCLASS) were used for our analysis. The stuttered events were identified through manual segmentation and were used for feature extraction. Two simple classifiers namely, k-nearest neighbour (kNN) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were employed for speech dysfluencies classification. Conventional validation method was used for testing the reliability of the classifier results. The study on the effect of different frame length, percentage of overlapping, value of ã in a first order pre-emphasizer and different order p were discussed. The speech dysfluencies classification accuracy was found to be improved by applying statistical normalization before feature extraction. The experimental investigation elucidated LPC, LPCC and WLPCC features can be used for identifying the stuttered events and WLPCC features slightly outperforms LPCC features and LPC features.	anterior descending branch of left coronary artery;archive;cepstrum;coefficient;feature extraction;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;kilohertz;linear iga bullous dermatosis;linear discriminant analysis;nearest dietary location;pcsk7 gene;pcsk7 wt allele;sampling - surgical action;stuttering	M.

In patients with subclinical physiological abnormalities, these conditions may not provide enough stress on their ability to adapt to walking. The introduction of challenging walking conditions in gait can induce responses in physiological systems in addition to the locomotor system. There is a need for a device that is capable of monitoring multiple physiological systems in various walking conditions. To address this need, an Android-based gait-monitoring device was developed that enabled the recording of a patient's physiological systems during walking. The gait-monitoring device was tested during self-regulated overground walking sessions of fifteen healthy subjects that included 6 females and 9 males aged 18-35 years. The gait-monitoring device measures the patient's stride interval, acceleration, electrocardiogram, skin conductance and respiratory rate. The data is stored on an Android phone and is analyzed offline through the extraction of features in the time, frequency and time-frequency domains. The analysis of the data depicted multisystem physiological interactions during overground walking in healthy subjects. These interactions included locomotion-electrodermal, locomotion-respiratory and cardiolocomotion couplings. The current results depicting strong interactions between the locomotion system and the other considered systems (i.e., electrodermal, respiratory and cardiovascular systems) warrant further investigation into multisystem interactions during walking, particularly in challenging walking conditions with older adults.

Data acquisition for each participant lasted 30 minutes. We obtained data related to consecutive time series with R-R interval (RRI) and pulse transit time (PTT). Using multiscale cross-approximate entropy (MCE), we quantified the complexity between the two series and thereby differentiated the influence of age and diabetes on the complexity of physiological signals. This study used MCE in the quantification of complexity between RRI and PTT time series. We observed changes in the influences of age and disease on the coupling effects between the heart and blood vessels in the cardiovascular system, which reduced the complexity between RRI and PTT series.	activated partial thromboplastin time measurement;approximate entropy;blood vessel;crisscross heart;data acquisition;diabetes mellitus;diabetes mellitus, non-insulin-dependent;nsa product types;pulse transit time;qt interval feature (observable entity);quantitation;time series;interest	Hsien-Tsai Wu;Cyuan-Cin Liu;Men-Tzung Lo;Po-chun Hsu;An-Bang Liu;Kai-Yu Chang;Chieh-Ju Tang	2013		10.1155/2013/324325	computer simulation;computational biology;developmental psychology;medicine;young adult;computer science;diabetes mellitus;surgery	HCI	18.257389654210876	-84.52877270195599	128145

3ec09cbc37f5eef5f939bae91d256b23a908495d	a prospective study of musculoskeletal outcomes among manufacturing workers: i. effects of physical risk factors		OBJECTIVE To better characterize associations between physical risk factors and upper-extremity musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders, a prospective epidemiologic study of 386 manufacturing workers was performed.   BACKGROUND Methodological limitations of previous studies have resulted in inconsistent associations.   METHOD An individual, task-based exposure assessment strategy was used to assess upper-extremity exertion intensity, repetition, and time-in-posture categories. Participants recorded time spent performing daily work tasks on a preprinted log, which was then used to calculate time-weighted-average exposures across each week of follow-up. In addition, a weekly Strain Index (SI) risk category was assigned to each participant. Incident musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders were assessed weekly. Proportional hazards analyses were used to examine associations between exposure measures and incident hand/arm and neck/shoulder symptoms and disorders.   RESULTS Incident symptoms and disorders were common (incident hand/arm symptoms = 58/100 person-years (PY), incident hand/arm disorders = 19/100 PY, incident neck/shoulder symptoms = 54/100 PY, incident neck/shoulder disorders = 14/100 PY). Few associations between separate estimates of physical exposure and hand/arm and neck/shoulder outcomes were observed. However, associations were observed between dichotomized SI risk category and incident hand/arm symptoms (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.99, 3.04]) and disorders (HR = 1.93,95% CI = [0.85,4.40]).   CONCLUSION Evidence of associations between physical risk factors and musculoskeletal outcome was strongest when exposure was estimated with the SI, in comparison to other metrics of exposure.   APPLICATION The results of this study provide evidence that physical exposures in the workplace contribute to musculoskeletal disorder incidence. Musculoskeletal disorder prevention efforts should include mitigation of these occupational risk factors.	categories;confidence intervals;epidemiology;estimated;hazard ratio;head and neck neoplasms;incidence matrix;limb structure;mental association;morbidity - disease rate;musculoskeletal diseases;personnameuse - assigned;poor posture;prospective search;python;physical hard work	Fredric Gerr;Nathan B.

edc059439aa8c2c36bad08ac98fcf73285972c42	a time-frequency based approach for generalized phase synchrony assessment in nonstationary multivariate signals	quadratic tfds;newborn eeg;instantaneous frequency;neonatal studies;cointegration;phase synchrony;time frequency distributions;article;time frequency analysis	a r t i c l e i n f o a b s t r a c t This paper proposes a new approach to estimate the phase synchrony among nonstationary multivariate signals using the linear relationships between their instantaneous frequency (IF) laws. For cases where nonstationary signals are multi-component, a decomposition method like multi-channel empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) is used to simultaneously decompose the multi-channel signals into their intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). We then apply the Johansen method on the IF laws to assess the phase synchrony within multivariate nonstationary signals. The proposed approach is validated first using multi-channel synthetic signals. The method is then used for quantifying the inter-hemispheric EEG asynchrony during ictal and inter-ictal periods using a newborn EEG seizure/non-seizure database of five subjects. For this application, pair-wise phase synchrony measures may not be able to account for phase interactions between multiple channels. Furthermore, the classical definition of phase synchrony, which is based on the rational relationships between phases, may not reveal the hidden phase interdependencies caused by irrational long-run relationships. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method using the differentiation of unwrapped phase as well as other IF estimation techniques. The results obtained on newborn EEG signals confirm that the generalized phase synchrony within EEG channels increases significantly during ictal periods. A statistically consistent phase coupling is also observed within the non-seizure segments supporting the concept of constant inter-hemispheric connectivity in the newborn brain during inter-ictal periods.	asynchronous i/o;asynchrony (computer programming);database;electroencephalography;hilbert–huang transform;instantaneous phase;interaction;interdependence;lock (computer science);population;relevance;resting state fmri;simulation;spontaneous order;synthetic intelligence	Amir H.

141b992547c31f6bf012f6dc4722cda30168bf20	wavelet-based anomaly detection on digital signals		Since today's information and telecommunication devices are very complex, it is time consuming task to find anomalies on digital signals which happen very rarely and not easy to recreate by testing. In this work, a new anomaly detection method is proposed which includes wavelet transform, k-means clustering and morphological operators such as closing and dilation to detect anomalies on digital signals. After wavelet decomposition was performed on the digital signals which recorded by the oscilloscope and then transferred to the computer, unsupervised learning and mathematical morphology have been applied. Test results show that the proposed method achieves high-detection rates.	anomaly detection;closing (morphology);cluster analysis;dilation (morphology);k-means clustering;mathematical morphology;unsupervised learning;wavelet transform	Omer Aydin;Melek Kurnaz	2017	2017 25th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2017.7960189	artificial intelligence;wavelet transform;wavelet;pattern recognition;computer vision;stationary wavelet transform;second-generation wavelet transform;digital signal;computer science;digital signal processing;discrete wavelet transform;wavelet packet decomposition	EDA	19.554640665200274	-91.75479820503695	128843

Five healthy males underwent whole-body calorimetry using a standard protocol on three separate days, with no music on day 1 (D1), and genre-specific music from online computer-generated program on days 2 (D2: random track selection) and 3 (D3: track selection based on subject-inputted mood). Measurements included pulse, blood pressure (BP), and blood samples for serum cortisol. A p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Compared with D1, overall metabolic rate during D2 and D3 was reduced by 54.7 kcal (p = 0.03) and 70.6kcal (p = 0.01), respectively, and daytime drop in serum cortisol level was lessened by 125 mmol/l (p = 0.02) and 45 mmol/l (p = 0.04), respectively. Acute effects of music on BP were dependent on genre-specific popularity. Computer-generated music reduces overall metabolic rate, influences cortisol diurnal rhythm and has acute effects on physiological responses based on genre-preference.	computer-generated holography	Petra Hanson;David Ko;Andrew Jensen Ko;Asad Ali;Sudhesh Kumar;Ian Spero;Thomas M.

Therefore, this method is tested using three simulated dipole configurations; single dipole, two distinct dipoles and one moving dipole. After that, the effect of the time component is highlighted on the localization accuracy and the importance of taking the maximum or average activity during our time window in the distinction peaks of activity.	electroencephalography;internationalization and localization;microsoft windows;simulation;tomography	Jihene Boughariou;Wassim Zouch;Ahmed Ben Hamida	2014	2014 1st International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Signal and Image Processing (ATSIP)	10.1109/ATSIP.2014.6834614	computer vision;artificial intelligence;nuclear magnetic resonance;physics	Robotics	24.02279840035522	-83.01113562673137	129147

Here we describe an intra-operative method for detection of the motor territory of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) during DBS surgery. The method incorporates eight goniometers that continuously monitor and measure the angles of the wrist, elbow, knee and ankle, bilaterally. The joint movement data and microelectrode recordings from the STN are synchronized thus enabling objective intra-operative assessment of movement-related STN activity. This method is now used routinely in DBS surgery at our institute. Advantages include objective identification of motor areas, simultaneous detection of movement for all joints, detection of movement at a joint that is not under examination, shorter surgery time, and continuous monitoring of STN activity for patients with tremor.	assignment zero;brain implant;causality;deep brain stimulation;direct-broadcast satellite;nucleus rtos;super-twisted nematic display	Reuben R.

Recent reports have shown that image acquisition parameters may influence VBM results. For systematic evaluation, gray-matter-density (GMD) changes associated with aging were investigated by VBM employing acquisitions with different radiofrequency head coils (12-channel matrix coil vs. 32-channel array), different pulse sequences (MP-RAGE vs. MP2RAGE), and different voxel dimensions (1mm vs. 0.8mm). Thirty-six healthy subjects, classified as young, middle-aged, or elderly, participated in the study. Two-sample and paired t-tests revealed significant effects of acquisition parameters (coil, pulse sequence, and resolution) on the estimated age-related GMD changes in cortical and subcortical regions. Potential advantages in tissue classification and segmentation were obtained for MP2RAGE. The 32-channel coil generally outperformed the 12-channel coil, with more benefit for MP2RAGE. Further improvement can be expected from higher resolution if the loss in SNR is accounted for. Use of inconsistent acquisition parameters in VBM analyses is likely to introduce systematic bias. Overall, acquisition and protocol changes require careful adaptations of the VBM analysis strategy before generalized conclusion can be drawn.	adaptation;aging;classification;coil device component;general material designation;gray matter;image resolution;large;magnetic resonance imaging;magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo mri;medical imaging;morphometric analysis;morphometrics;neurodegenerative disorders;rabies virus ab:acnc:pt:ser:qn;signal-to-noise ratio;statistical test;voxel;algorithm;biologic segmentation;radiofrequency	Daniel-Paolo Streitbürger;André Pampel;Gunnar Krueger;Jöran Lepsien;Matthias L.

2e050d6c31ba976d90385769daef818149d0d66c	development of an adaptive gait characterizer		The study of human gait remains one of the finest areas of biomechanics. Commonly available gait characterization systems provide information regarding speed, cadence and calories burnt during an exercise session. However, the gait of an individual changes continuously with every step. Thus, this work is inspired by the need to develop a system which enables real time analysis of critical spatio-temporal gait parameters while adapting to the walking pattern of the subject. The study of these parameters for a given subject enables us to perform an analysis of individualized gait pattern thereby allowing us to develop corrective measures for gait deficits. In this work we present a real-time analysis of intra-limb temporal parameters using the proposed system that adapts to the changing walking speed. 1	gait analysis;real-time clock	Aniket Mazumder;Vineet Vashista	2017		10.1145/3132446.3134913	simulation;machine learning;gait;preferred walking speed;artificial intelligence;computer science;cadence;gait (human)	Vision	11.9313578769376	-84.93160028772449	129406

It is especially challenging when dedicated EOG channels are unavailable or when there are very few EEG channels available for independent component analysis based ocular artifact removal. It is even more challenging to avoid loss of the signal of interest during the artifact correction process, where the signal of interest can be multiple magnitudes weaker than the artifact. To address these issues, we propose a novel discriminative ocular artifact correction approach for feature learning in EEG analysis. Without extra ocular movement measurements, the artifact is extracted from raw EEG data, which is totally automatic and requires no visual inspection of artifacts. Then, artifact correction is optimized jointly with feature extraction by maximizing oscillatory correlations between trials from the same class and minimizing them between trials from different classes. We evaluate this approach on a real-world EEG dataset comprising 68 subjects performing cognitive tasks. The results showed that the approach is capable of not only suppressing the artifact components but also improving the discriminative power of a classifier with statistical significance. We also demonstrate that the proposed method addresses the confounding issues induced by ocular movements in cognitive EEG study.

In this contribution, we use sparse support vector machines applied to p-leader multifractal features with a double aim: Assessment of the features actually contributing to classification; Assessment of the contribution of non linear features (as opposed to linear ones) to classification performance. We observe and interpret that the classification rate improves when small values of the tunable parameter p are used.	contribution;early diagnosis;fetal acidosis;fetal heart;multifractal system;nonlinear system;population parameter;signal processing;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;support vector machine	Roberto F.

However, with a few exceptions, functional and structural neuroimaging data are typically optimized to maximize the quantification of signals arising from a single source. For example, functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is typically used as an index of gray matter functioning whereas diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is typically used to determine white matter properties. While it is likely that these signals arising from different tissue sources contain complementary information, the signal processing algorithms necessary for the fusion of neuroimaging data across imaging modalities are still in a nascent stage. In the current paper we present a data-driven method for combining measures of functional connectivity arising from gray matter sources (FMRI resting state data) with different measures of white matter connectivity (DTI). Specifically, a joint independent component analysis (J-ICA) was used to combine these measures of functional connectivity following intensive signal processing and feature extraction within each of the individual modalities. Our results indicate that one of the most predominantly used measures of functional connectivity (activity in the default mode network) is highly dependent on the integrity of white matter connections between the two hemispheres (corpus callosum) and within the cingulate bundles. Importantly, the discovery of this complex relationship of connectivity was entirely facilitated by the signal processing and fusion techniques presented herein and could not have been revealed through separate analyses of both data types as is typically performed in the majority of neuroimaging experiments. We conclude by discussing future applications of this technique to other areas of neuroimaging and examining potential limitations of the methods.	body of uterus;body tissue;corpus callosum;default;diffusion tensor imaging;experiment;feature extraction;gray matter;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;magnetic resonance imaging;multimodal interaction;neuroimaging;quantitation;rest;resting state fmri;signal processing;white matter;algorithm	Alexandre R.

Three indexes are proposed in order to characterize the patient state. Statistical analysis demonstrates that they allow significant discrimination between the awake, sedated and anesthetized states.

For gait evaluation, lower limb joint angles and segment angles were estimated by the Kalman filter from the data measured with wireless inertial sensors. Electrical stimulation was applied to the common peroneal nerve or the tibialis anterior muscle by detecting stimulus timing automatically from the data of wireless inertial sensor attached on the shank of the hemiplegic side. The maximum joint angle of ankle dorsiflexion of the paralyzed side at the swing phase was increased approximately to the value of the healthy side by applying the electrical stimulation. The developed system was performed well in foot drop correction and the measured data of the inertial sensors showed the characteristics and difference of paralyzed side with and without electrical stimulation using the segment angles and joint angles.	electric stimulation technique;f-18 16 alpha-fluoroestradiol;functional electrical stimulation;kalman filter;limb structure;lower extremity;norm (social);oncogene, fps-fes;prototype;shin megami tensei: persona 3;structure of common peroneal nerve;tibialis anterior muscle structure;hemiplegics;sensor (device)	Naoto Miura;Takashi Watanabe;Kiyokazu Akasaka;Tatsuto Suzuki	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091393	kalman filter;wireless sensor network;physical medicine and rehabilitation;orthopedic surgery;computer science;engineering;physical therapy;surgery	Robotics	12.35484802391827	-85.07215849516173	130318
7b326d07af2510e5af889316543c3ba22742a796	acoustic evaluation of nasality in cerebellar syndromes		Although previous studies have reported the occurrence of velopharyngeal incompetence connected with ataxic dysarthria, there is a lack of evidence related to nasality assessment in cerebellar disorders. This is partly due to the limited reliability of challenging analyses and partly due to nasality being a less pronounced manifestation of ataxic dysarthria. Therefore, we employed 1/3-octave spectra analysis as an objective measurement of nasality disturbances. We analyzed 20 subjects with multiple system atrophy (MSA), 13 subjects with cerebellar ataxia (CA), 20 subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 20 healthy (HC) speakers. Although we did not detect the presence of hypernasality, our results showed increased nasality fluctuation in 65% of MSA, 43% of CA and 30% of MS subjects compared to 15% of HC speakers, suggesting inconsistent velopharyngeal motor control. Furthermore, we found a statistically significant difference between MSA and HC participants (p<0.001), and significant correlation between the natural history cerebellar subscore and neuroprotection in Parkinson plus syndromes – Parkinson plus scale and nasality fluctuations in MSA (r=0.51, p<0.05). In conclusion, acoustic analysis showed an increased presence of abnormal nasality fluctuations in all ataxic groups and revealed that nasality fluctuation is associated with distortion of cerebellar functions.	acoustic cryptanalysis;cerebellar model articulation controller;distortion;quantum fluctuation	Michal Novotný;Ján Rusz;K.

Nevertheless, measuring emotions via physiological measurement might be also considered as it could limit the effects of cognitive bias due to self-report following the rule that your body cannot lie. In this paper we first review in the context of emotion assessment, common physiological measurements such as cardiac and respiratory rhythms, Electroencephalography (EEG) and Galvanic Skin Resistance (GSR); more advanced techniques as infrared thermography or blood perfusion with laser Doppler flowmetry.

Previous research was mainly devoted to identify hand movements as these actions generate strong electromyography (EMG) signals recorded from the forearm. In contrast, in this paper, we assess the use of multichannel surface electromyography (sEMG) to classify individual and combined finger movements for dexterous prosthetic control. sEMG channels were recorded from ten intact-limbed and six below-elbow amputee persons. Offline processing was used to evaluate the classification performance. The results show that high classification accuracies can be achieved with a processing chain consisting of time domain-autoregression feature extraction, orthogonal fuzzy neighborhood discriminant analysis for feature reduction, and linear discriminant analysis for classification. We show that finger and thumb movements can be decoded accurately with high accuracy with latencies as short as 200 ms. Thumb abduction was decoded successfully with high accuracy for six amputee persons for the first time. We also found that subsets of six EMG channels provide accuracy values similar to those computed with the full set of EMG channels (98% accuracy over ten intact-limbed subjects for the classification of 15 classes of different finger movements and 90% accuracy over six amputee persons for the classification of 12 classes of individual finger movements). These accuracy values are higher than previous studies, whereas we typically employed half the number of EMG channels per identified movement.	abductive reasoning;amputees;autoregressive model;class;feature extraction;fitting of prosthesis;forearm;information;large;linear discriminant analysis;movement;numerical analysis;online and offline;pattern recognition;perceived quality of life;personalization;signal processing;silo (dataset);surface electromyography;the quality of life;electrode	Ali Al-Timemy;Guido Bugmann;Javier Escudero;Nicholas Outram	2013	IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/JBHI.2013.2249590	computer vision;speech recognition;feature extraction;computer science;artificial intelligence;biomechanics;machine learning;signal	HCI	14.547370661428362	-91.5625554171454	130607
8c0c4ecaf5a3f77fe9392d15959ed9cb4a33c38a	a proposal of a novel cardiorespiratory long-term monitoring device		Monitoring of respiratory movements is an important feature in planning of medical care. We present here a simple, portable, accelerometer-based device suitable for long term-monitoring of the breathing and heart rates, along with postural changes, during sleep and wakefulness. Recordings of respiratory frequency, heart rate, posture and voluntary cough were obtained from a group of volunteers who also participated in sleep studies (6-8 hrs). A pair of capacitive MEMS tri-axial accelerometers was positioned at the level of the 10 rib along the mid-axillary line bilaterally; simultaneous recordings of respiratory movements, heart rate and body position could be easily performed. The signal were digitized and used to detect body position and relative movement between accelerometers. Conventional spirometry was performed in parallel when appropriate. During resting breathing, qualitative analysis revealed that the accelerometric assessment of respiratory pattern correlated well with that obtained by spirometry. Values of respiratory rates were identical with the two techniques. Recordings of respiratory and cardiac activity during sleep were satisfactorily obtained except for short lasting episodes corresponding to changes in body position. These devices seem to be also suitable for detecting the motor pattern of cough.	microelectromechanical systems;poor posture;sensor;sleep mode;triangular function	S.

In addition, we describe the relationship between physical human features and the burden during standing when using a standing support robot. Although a number of care support devices have been developed, assistive robots are not yet popular because users do not know which devices are appropriate for their needs or physical abilities. In this study, we focus on a transfer support device and propose an algorithm for selecting transfer support equipment and a robot that suits the user's physical ability. We investigated the relationship between standing support equipment including a robot and the physical burden during standing, which is a basic transfer motion. Experimentally, we analyzed and calculated the knee and ankle joint moments and discussed the relationship between standing support equipment and knee and ankle joint moments during standing; we also investigated and the relationship between physical human features and the knee joint moment during standing. Our results identified standing support equipment that was appropriate to the user's physical ability. We found that it was effective to provide an up/down seat to persons having low residual ability; a standing support robot is appropriate for people having less residual ability in the knees, and a railing is suitable for people having low residual ability in the ankles.	ankle joint structure;assistive technology;experiment;knee joint;robot (device);algorithm	S.

The data used in this study were obtained from data set no 1 which had been used on BCI Competition III. The first part, to decrease the processing load, the number of channels are reduced by eliminating channels (electrodes) which have low separation success.

By wavelet based time-frequency analysis, we showed that two distinct neuromagentic responses corresponding to stimulus frequency and its time delayed first harmonic were found in control subjects, whereas no harmonic response was obtained for the patient. We applied a battery of methods (sample entropy measuring signal complexity and index of smoothness measuring determinism) based on nonlinear dynamical system theory in conjunction with bootstrapping surrogate analysis. The results suggested that a significant nonlinear structure was evident in the MEG signals for control subjects, whereas nonlinearity was not detected for the patient. In addition, the couplings between distant cortical regions were found to be greater for control subjects. The important role of combinational chromatic sensitivity in sustained cortical excitation was also confirmed. These findings lead to the hypothesis that the healthy human brain is most likely equipped with significantly nonlinear neuronal processing reflecting an inherent mechanism defending against hyper-excitation to chromatic flickering stimulus, and such nonlinear mechanism is likely to be impaired for a patient with photosensitive epilepsy.	nonlinear dynamics	Joydeep Bhattacharya;Katsumi Watanabe;Shinsuke Shimojo	2004	I.

Short-time hyperoxemia provoked various effects with different latencies: a) RR lengthening, with 15-s latency; b) AP increase, with 75-s latency, c) BRS and RSAS increases with 120-s latency, d) HFrr increase and LFSP and LFrr/HFrr decreases, with 135-s latency, and d) no significant changes on Res. During hyperoxemia, the instantaneous time courses of these variables are fluctuating, with subtle yet significant changes at different latencies. Initially, hyperoxemia lengthens RR by direct inhibition of the sinoatrial node, and later on, it elicits a direct vasoconstriction-dependent increment of AP, which, via baroreflex with augmented sensitivity, increases vagal outflow and reduces sympathetic activity, changes strengthened by the augmented RSAS, but hyperoxemia does not modify the respiratory variables.	autonomic networking;brs/search;emoticon;frequency analysis;rapid refresh;sensitivity and specificity;sensitivity index;time–frequency analysis	Salvador Carrasco-Sosa;Alejandra Guillén-Mandujano	2016	2016 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)		real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;anesthesia	HCI	18.194946811113045	-81.53499114263249	130904

Averaging, however, eliminates all temporal variability of the recorded signals and, therefore, hampers the exploration of the temporal dynamics underlying the generation of the N100 component. In this study, we analyzed EPs on a single-trial basis using an iterative independent component analysis procedure that is capable of extracting individual components out of an entire EP waveform. This approach allowed estimation of an N100 in each single trial and measurement of its morphological features such as polarity, which could be either negative (most frequently) or positive (less frequently). In the latter case, the N100 component was termed aberrant. We analyzed responses from 23 normal controls (NC) and 15 schizophrenia (SZ) patients in a paired stimulus paradigm, where a first stimulus S1 was followed by a second one S2 0.5 s later. To compare N100 responses within and across the two subject groups, we defined a negative polarity index NPI as the percentage of single trials that had a negative polarity N100. Our results show significantly higher NPI values in NC compared to SZ, for both the S1 and S2 responses. Additionally, the difference in NPI values between the S1 and S2 responses was significant in NC but not in SZ. We conclude that both normal and schizophrenia subjects exhibit aberrant N100 responses, but these events are more frequent in the SZ patient group. The higher number of aberrant responses can explain the lower amplitude EPs typically observed in schizophrenia, and may be one of the factors contributing to sensory gating deficits consistently reported in these patients.	autonomous sensory meridian response;basal ganglia diseases;cognition disorders;contribution;evoked potentials;expectation propagation;hearing problem;heart rate variability;independent component analysis;iterative method;new product development;patients;programming paradigm;schizophrenia;sensory gating;waveform;polarity	Darshan Iyer;Nash N.

69a702a82e2b65f5cd6d5c4b2642d495fc5829fe	measuring signal fluctuations in gait rhythm time series of patients with parkinson's disease using entropy parameters	generalized linear regression analysis;symbolic entropy;signal turns count;approximate entropy;gait analysis;parkinson s disease;stride time	Gait rhythm disturbances due to abnormal strides indicate the degenerative mobility regulation of motor neurons affected by Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this work is to compute the approximate entropy (ApEn), normalized symbolic entropy (NSE), and signal turns count (STC) parameters for the measurements of stride fluctuations in PD. Generalized linear regression analysis (GLRA) and support vector machine (SVM) techniques were employed to implement nonlinear gait pattern classifications. The classification performance was evaluated in terms of overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Our experimental results indicated that the ApEn, NSE, and STC parameters computed from the stride series of PD patients were all significantly larger (Wilcoxon rank-sum test:  p  < 0.01) than those of healthy control subjects. Based on the distinct features of ApEn, NSE, and STC, the SVM provided an accuracy rate of 84.48% and MCC of 0.7107, which are better than those of the GLRA (accuracy: 82.76%, MCC: 0.6552). The SVM and GLRA methods were able to distinguish PD gait patterns from healthy control cases with area of 0.9049 (SVM sensitivity: 0.7241, specificity: 0.9655) and 0.9037 (GLRA sensitivity: 0.8276, specificity: 0.8276) under the ROC curve, respectively, which are better or comparable with the classification results achieved by the other popular pattern classification methods.	time series	Yunfeng Wu;Pinnan Chen;Xin Luo;Meihong Wu;Lifang Liao;Shanshan Yang;Rangaraj M.

Techniques to measure the activity of the brain—especially the visual brain—are now more numerous, accessible and affordable than ever. Brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG), event related potential (ERP), optical imagery, magnetoencephalography (MEG), tools to induce localized and transient disruptions in the normal functioning of the brain like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and accurate video eye-trackers have now joined methods of single-cell recording, psychophysics, visual cognition and neuropsychology in the toolbox of the vision scientist. In contrast to unquestionable progress in measurement techniques, up until recently little progress had been made to relate brain and behavioral measurements to the properties of the distal stimuli eliciting these responses. But times are changing: Vision science is undergoing a small-scale revolution that is the topic of this special issue of Cognitive Science . New tools1 are being developed to relate stimulus properties with behavioral and brain events, and ascribe a functional role to the latter.	ct scan;cognition;cognitive science;erp;electroencephalography;eye tracking;magnetoencephalography;resonance;spiking neural network;tomography;transcranial magnetic stimulation	Frédéric Gosselin;Philippe G.

Here we demonstrate how pattern recognition and brain imaging can enhance the study of such processes by providing fast, sensitive, and non-intrusive detection of these events. This can enable efficient experimental and clinical intervention. We focus on the study of traumatic events producing flashbacks associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), using an experimental analogue of trauma (a traumatic film). These events are rare and challenging to reliably elicit in experimental settings. We show that a classifier can be built to predict, based upon brain response, which stimuli are likely to induce these rare flashbacks at the point of exposure. An ability to predict these stimuli makes possible the trialing of context-specific preventative clinical interventions. We present results from two independent datasets, outlining key analytic challenges.	cognition;pattern recognition	Katherine E. Niehaus;Ian A. Clark;Corin Bourne;Clare E. Mackay;Emily A.

The platform measured effects of postural perturbations in static and dynamic conditions. This paper describes the implementation of an FSP using force-sensing resistors as sensing elements. Real-time qualitative assessment utilized a rainbow color scale to identify areas with high force concentration. Postprocessing of the logged data provided end-users with quantitative measures of postural control. The objective of this research was to establish the feasibility of using an FSP to test and gauge human postural control. Tests were conducted in eye open and eye close states. Readings obtained were tested for repeatability using a one-way analysis of variance test. The platform gauged postural sway by measuring the area of distribution for the weighted center of applied pressure at the foot. A fuzzy clustering algorithm was applied to identify regions of the foot with repetitive pressure concentration. Potential application of the platform in a clinical setting includes monitoring rehabilitation progress of stability dysfunction. The platform functions as a qualitative tool for initial, on-the-spot assessment, and quantitative measure for postacquisition assessment on balance abilities.	cxcl1 wt allele;cluster analysis;control system;equilibration disorder;fibrin split products;foot;fuzzy clustering;mathematical optimization;microscopy, atomic force;one-way function;proprioception;real-time locating system;repeatability;sample variance;traumatic injury;algorithm;statistical cluster	Alpha Agape Gopalai;S.

This duality calls for an independent validation of compartment axial diffusivities, to determine which of the two cases holds. The aim of the present study was to use an intracerebroventricular injection of a gadolinium-based contrast agent to selectively reduce the extracellular water signal in the rat brain, and compare diffusion metrics in the genu of the corpus callosum before and after gadolinium infusion. The diffusion metrics considered were diffusion and kurtosis tensor metrics, as well as compartment-specific estimates of the WMTI-Watson two-compartment model. A strong decrease in genu T1 and T2 relaxation times post-Gd was observed (p < 0.001), as well as an increase of 48% in radial kurtosis (p < 0.05), which implies that the relative fraction of extracellular water signal was selectively decreased. This was further supported by a significant increase in intra-axonal water fraction as estimated from the two-compartment model, for both branches (p < 0.01 for Branch 1, p < 0.05 for Branch 2). However, pre-Gd estimates of axon dispersion in Branch 1 agreed better with literature than those of Branch 2. Furthermore, comparison of post-Gd changes in diffusivity and dispersion between data and simulations further supported Branch 1 as the biologically plausible solution, i.e. Da,‖ > De,‖. This result is fully consistent with other recent measurements of compartment axial diffusivities that used entirely different approaches, such as diffusion tensor encoding.	anatomical compartments;axon;body of uterus;contrast media;corpus callosum;estimated;gadolinium;knee;linear programming relaxation;mathematics;multi-compartment model;radial (radio);simulation;white matter	Nicolas Kunz;Analina R. da Silva;Ileana O.

A first version of the algorithm was applied to a data set consisting of full-night measurements on 5 subjects. The data set had a total duration of 34 hours and contained 577 respiratory events (hypopneas, obstructive and central apneas) recognized by the staff physicians of an accredited sleep laboratory. The algorithm detected 455 (79 %) of these events and 138 events that had not been marked by the physicians. 75 % of the congruently detected events were also concordantly classified. After further optimization and evaluation, this approach might be useful when implemented into a device designed to screening or treatment control of sleep-related breathing disorders at home.	acoustic cryptanalysis;input impedance;nominal impedance	Holger Steltner;Richard Staats;Michael Vogel;Christian Virchow;Heinrich Matthys;Josef Guttmann;Jens Timmer	2000		10.1007/3-540-39949-6_10	intensive care medicine;medicine;acoustics;anesthesia	HCI	15.379206214095653	-87.36860431315314	132170

A BCI system works by extracting user brain signals, applying machine learning algorithms to classify the user's brain state, and performing a computer-controlled action. Our goal is to improve brain state classification. Perhaps the most obvious way to improve classification performance is the selection of an advanced learning algorithm. However, it is now well known in the BCI community that careful selection of preprocessing steps is crucial to the success of any classification scheme. Furthermore, recent work indicates that combining the output of multiple classifiers (meta-classification) leads to improved classification rates relative to single classifiers (Dornhege , 2004). In this paper, we develop an automated approach which systematically analyzes the relative contributions of different preprocessing and meta-classification approaches. We apply this procedure to three data sets drawn from BCI Competition 2003 (Blankertz , 2004) and BCI Competition III (Blankertz , 2006), each of which exhibit very different characteristics. Our final classification results compare favorably with those from past BCI competitions. Additionally, we analyze the relative contributions of individual preprocessing and meta-classification choices and discuss which types of BCI data benefit most from specific algorithms	avg;algorithm;brain-computer interfaces;choice behavior;class;comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;experiment;feature extraction;interface device component;logistic regression;machine learning;muscle;preprocessor;signal-to-noise ratio;statistical classification;test set;algorithm	Paul S.

The objectives of the study were: (1) to find out whether train speed would significantly affect signal/sign reading; (2) to examine at which point certain types of signs or signals could be detected or recognised, and (3) to determine a speed cut-off level above which certain types of signs or signals are no longer recognisable or detectable. Fifty-seven train drivers from 12 Train Operating Companies in the UK participated in the trials. Twenty different types of lineside signs and ten types of signals were tested under six different approach speeds ranging from 100 to 350 km/h (62–218 mph). Driver performance measures were ‘time remaining to the signal/sign’ at the point of detection or recognition, and reading error rate. The results showed a significant influence of train speed on driver responses to lineside signals/signs and demonstrated a non-linear relationship between driver responses to signals/signs and approach speed. This has been used to estimate a maximum approach speed limit within which a specific signal or sign can be correctly detected or recognised. The findings and implications of the study are discussed in the paper.	nonlinear system;simulation	Guangyan Li;W.

e679239c7cac8a518d564f4df640d734994e9832	measurement of perception thresholds for electrical noise stimuli		In previous research, the application of sub-threshold electrical nerve stimulation (SENS) to peripheral nerves has been shown to improve tactile sensitivity. SENS has applications in the symptomatic treatment of a wide array of conditions that result in the loss of peripheral nerve function. These include diabetes, stroke, and age related peripheral neuropathy. The technology is dependent on careful control of the amplitude of the intervention stimulation relative to the user's perception threshold. However, little is known about the factors that influence the perception threshold and whether it can be treated as a constant. Here we present a study where we applied a two alternate forced choice paradigm to determine electrical perception threshold. We investigated participant, noise frequency characteristics, electrode location, electrode type, and electrode impedance characteristics as explanatory factors for the variability seen in the threshold outcome. We find that the electrical perception threshold is dependent on the frequency characteristics of the signal applied, but varies widely without correlation to the remaining variables. It was also highly variable when re-tested under identical conditions. Our results cast doubt on the ability to treat the electrical threshold as a single value that holds constant for a particular participant and electrode placement. This finding has significant implications in SENS applications.	abducens nerve diseases;cerebrovascular accident;characteristic impedance;diabetes mellitus;noise (electronics);peripheral nerves;peripheral neuropathy;programming paradigm;quantitative impedance;sacral nerve stimulation;spatial variability;unselected clinical trial site document;explanation;nervous system disorder	David Karpul;Sarah McIntyre;André van Schaik;Paul P.

8f13f6b16751683e1ddad1a1a7521b35dd0c0040	robust activation detection methods for real-time and offline fmri analysis	activation estimation;instantaneous activation;real-time fmri;robust regression;fmri	We propose two contributions with novel approaches to fMRI activation analysis. The first is to apply confidence intervals to locate activations in real-time, and second is a new metric based on robust regression of fMRI signals. These contributions are implemented in our four proposed methods; Instantaneous Activation Method (IAM), Instantaneous Activation Method with Past Blocks (IAMP) for real-time analysis, Task Robust Regression Distance Method (TRRD) for the new metric with robust regression and Instantaneous Robust Regression Distance Method (IRRD) for both contributions. For comparison, a statistical offline method called Task Activation Method (TAM) and a correlation analysis method are also implemented. The methods are initially evaluated with synthetic data generated using two different approaches; first using varying hemodynamic response function signals to simulate a wide range of stimuli responses, along with a Gaussian white noise, and second using no activity state data of a real fMRI experiment, which removes the need to generate noise. The methods are also tested with real fMRI experiments and compared with the results obtained by the widely used SPM tool. The results show that instantaneous methods reveal activations that are lost statistically in an offline analysis. They also reveal further improvements by robust fitting application, which minimizes the outlier effect. TRRD has an area under the ROC curve of 0,7127 for very noisy synthetic images, is reaching up to 0,9608 as the noise decreases, while the instantaneous score is in the range of 0,6124 to 0,8019 in the same noise levels.	activation function;atomic resolution microscopy;confidence intervals;experiment;frequency response;hemodynamics;ibm tivoli access manager;identity management;normal statistical distribution;online and offline;real-time clock;real-time locating system;receiver operating characteristic;simulation;super paper mario;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;white noise;fmri	Kaya Oguz;Muhammed Gökhan Cinsdikici;Ali Saffet Gonul	2017	Computer methods and programs in biomedicine	10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.03.015	econometrics;computer science;machine learning;statistics	ML	21.858307914209036	-90.3760569654699	132456
fc54319be13555362ed50e8da8ac6608f3901d5f	a novel remote rehabilitation system with the fusion of noninvasive wearable device and motion sensing for pulmonary patients		Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a type of lung disease caused by chronically poor airflow that makes breathing difficult. As a chronic illness, it typically worsens over time. Therefore, pulmonary rehabilitation exercises and patient management for extensive periods of time are required. This paper presents a remote rehabilitation system for a multimodal sensors-based application for patients who have chronic breathing difficulties. The process involves the fusion of sensory data-captured motion data by stereo-camera and photoplethysmogram signal by a wearable PPG sensor-that are the input variables of a detection and evaluation framework. In addition, we incorporated a set of rehabilitation exercises specific for pulmonary patients into the system by fusing sensory data. Simultaneously, the system also features medical functions that accommodate the needs of medical professionals and those which ease the use of the application for patients, including exercises for tracking progress, patient performance, exercise assignments, and exercise guidance. Finally, the results indicate the accurate determination of pulmonary exercises from the fusion of sensory data. This remote rehabilitation system provides a comfortable and cost-effective option in the healthcare rehabilitation system.	chronic obstructive airway disease;chronic disease;dyspnea;exercise;lung diseases, obstructive;lung diseases;multimodal interaction;patients;physical therapy exercises;stereo camera;telerehabilitation;wearable computer;sensor (device)	Chuang-Kit Tey;Jinyoung An;Nguyen Trung Hau	2017		10.1155/2017/5823740	medicine;physical medicine and rehabilitation;physical therapy;surgery	HCI	10.443269967292613	-86.89953223304153	132610

With proper training, individuals can learn to modulate the amplitude of specific electroencephalographic (EEG) components (e.g., the 8-12 Hz mu rhythm and 18-26 Hz beta rhythm) over the sensorimotor cortex and use them to control a cursor on a computer screen. Conventional spectral techniques for monitoring the continuous amplitude fluctuations fail to capture essential amplitude/phase relationships of the mu and beta rhythms in a compact fashion and, therefore, are suboptimal. By extracting the characteristic mu rhythm for a user, the exact morphology can be characterized and exploited as a matched filter. A simple, parameterized model for the characteristic mu rhythm is proposed and its effectiveness as a matched filter is examined online for a one-dimensional cursor control task. The results suggest that amplitude/phase coupling exists between the mu and beta bands during event-related desynchronization, and that an appropriate matched filter can provide improved performance	brain–computer interface;matched filter	Dean J.

These errors can result in systematic inaccuracies in activation detection. The authors have recently proposed a new method to solve both the registration and activation detection least-squares problems simultaneously. This paper gives an outline of the new method, and demonstrates its robustness on simulated fMRI datasets containing various combinations of motion and activation. In addition to a discussion of the merits of the method and details on how it can be efficiently implemented, it is shown that, compared to the standard approach, the new method consistently reduces false-positive activations by two thirds and reduces false-negative activations by one third.	activation function;least squares	Jeffery J.

8704e78a6908e52010ebf34148f4f3f853ef682d	eeg-based emotion recognition utilizing wavelet coefficients		This paper focuses on EEG (Electroencephalography) signals as a robust method for emotion recognition. In emotion recognition, researchers usually use features such as eye pupil diameter, facial features, EEG signals and physiological signals like: respiration amplitude, heart rate, skin temperature, blood volume pulse, respiration rate etc. In this paper we use just EEG signals as we believe that a human being may suffer from some physical disabilities and impairments like visual disorders, motor impairment or some other common disorders. So, the use of EEG signal, in some aspects, can be more useful and utilizable in real life. In this paper, we use a combination of some existent techniques on this theme, such as wavelet coefficients and an 8-number electrode configuration, which makes our approach really convenient and comfortable to use, and some other methods that may seem minor; But the way we employ and combine them, make a novel, productive, high efficient and reliable algorithm that highly can help people with some special disorders. To have a brief overview of the results of our work: the average Arousal F-Score and Valence F-Score for our algorithm are, respectively, 0.73 and 0.77. These values for a corresponding work are, 0.60 and 0.50, respectively. As it is seen the results have improved by 0.13 and 0.27. The results of our EEG-based algorithm are even better than the fusion of facial and EEG signals or physiological signals presented in the corresponding works. Beside this better performance, the ease and comfort that our method provides for users, is far beyond description.	algorithm;approximation;coefficient;coherence (physics);electroencephalography;emotion recognition;f1 score;feature extraction;image processing;numerical analysis;pulse;real life;statistical classification;wavelet	Ali Momennezhad	2018	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-018-5906-8	brain–computer interface;wavelet;artificial intelligence;computer science;arousal;visual disorders;emotion recognition;electroencephalography;pattern recognition	HCI	11.0152020555413	-93.95630534703157	132983

A fundamental limitation of CTA imaging is cardiac movement, which can cause artifacts and reduce the quality of the obtained images. To mitigate this problem, current approaches involve gating the image based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) to predict the timing of quiescent periods of the cardiac cycle. This paper focuses on developing a foundation for using a mechanical alternative to the ECG for finding these quiescent periods: the seismocardiogram (SCG). SCG was used to determine beat-by-beat systolic and diastolic quiescent periods of the cardiac cycle for nine healthy subjects, and 11 subjects with various cardiovascular diseases. To reduce noise in the SCG, and quantify these quiescent periods, a Kalman filter was designed to extract the velocity of chest wall movement from the recorded SCG signals. The average systolic and diastolic quiescent periods were centered at 29% and 76% for the healthy subjects, and 33% and 79% for subjects with cardiovascular disease. Both inter and intrasubject variability in the quiescent phases were observed compared to ECG-predicted phases, suggesting that the ECG may be a suboptimal modality for predicting quiescence, and that the SCG provides complementary data to the ECG.	arterial system;artifact (software development);artificial cardiac pacemaker;ct scan;cardiovascular diseases;chest wall structure;computed tomography angiography;coronary artery;diastole;electrocardiography;heart rate variability;imaging technology;kalman filter;modality (human–computer interaction);morphologic artifacts;quiescence search;seventy nine;velocity (software development);x-ray computed tomography;angiogram	Carson A.

94eff671a01229500047354b5b05443292a959d9	dilemma and solution of traditional feature extraction methods based on inertial sensors		Correctly identifying human activities is very significant in modern life. Almost all feature extraction methods are based directly on acceleration and angular velocity. However, we found that some activities have no difference in acceleration and angular velocity. Therefore, we believe that for these activities, any feature extraction method based on acceleration and angular velocity is difficult to achieve good results. After analyzing the difference of these indistinguishable movements, we propose several new features to improve accuracy of recognition. We compare the traditional features and our custom features. In addition, we examined whether the time-domain features and frequency-domain features based on acceleration and angular velocity are different. The results show that (1) our custom features significantly improve the precision of the activities that have no difference in acceleration and angular velocity; and (2) the combination of time-domain features and frequency-domain features does not significantly improve the recognition of different activities.

Ambulatory ECG is often contaminated with motion artifact. In this paper, we investigate the effect of motion artifact on myocardial ischemia alarms and on estimates of the ECG signal quality. The presence of motion artifact in an ambulatory ECG leads to false identification of myocardial ischemia. A signal quality index, based on the consistency of the shape of PQRST complexes, is able to automatically identify the degradation in signal quality associated with the false positive identification of myocardial ischemia. Since myocardial ischemia typically presents over longer periods of time than motion artifact, the signal quality index may be used to simply gate alarms generated during periods of poor signal quality. Consequently, the automatic detection of ambulatory ECG quality may lead to increased specificity of myocardial ischemia detection while maintaining the sensitivity of commercially available systems.	artifact (error);degradation (telecommunications);elegant degradation;ensemble kalman filter;identity document forgery;real-time clock;real-time computing;sensitivity and specificity	Patrick X.

6db64be4312956a3e8956cb82d8f2925a3e031e7	a novel compliance-pressure loop approach to quantify arterial compliance in systole and in diastole	arterial compliance-pressure loop;hypertension;linear and nonlinear arterial models;systolic and diastolic compliance	Abstract Arterial compliance has been recognized as a critical parameter in governing pulsatile flow dynamics. It has traditionally been assumed constant throughout the cardiac cycle and its computation has been based either on the classic Windkessel model (C) in diastole or the stroke volume over pulse pressure (C v ) method in systole. Other methods using area (C am ) or two-area (C tam ) and exponential (C(P) exp1 ) methods were used for the cardiac cycle. We proposed a novel compliance-pressure loop (CPP loop) approach for the quantification of arterial compliance and compared it to existing linear and nonlinear methods. Experimental data were gathered in 5 dogs and blood pressure levels were varied (systolic pressure of 100 mmHg–185 mmHg) with induced hypertension and vasodilation. Results showed the limited regime of validity of C (Control:0.4681 ± 0.1270 ml/mmHg, MTX:0.3015 ± 0.1264 ml/mmHg and NTP:1.8323 ± 0.7207 ml/mmHg) and C v (Control:0.3583 ± 0.0158 ml/mmHg, MTX:0.2602 ± 0.1275 ml/mmHg and NTP:0.4131 ± 0.0589 ml/mmHg), C am (Control:0.4175 ± 0.0505, MTX:0.3086 ± 0.1568 and NTP:1.4181 ± 0.4812) and C tam (Control: 0.2064 ± 0.0228 ml/mmHg, MTX:0.1967 ± 0.0884 ml/mmHg, NTP:0.0881 ± 0.0375 ml/mmHg) and that C(P) exp1 underestimates the arterial compliance compared to our method (Control:0.2233 ± 0.0168 ml/mmHg vs 0.4481 ± 0.0515 ml/mmHg, MTX:0.1976 ± 0.0964 ml/mmHg vs 0.3273 ± 0.1443 ml/mmHg and NTP: 0.2177 ± 0.0273 ml/mmHg vs 1.9990 ± 1.8221 ml/mmHg at mean arterial pressure). The CPP method based on the exponential method is superior, as it provides continuous compliance variations and CPP loop area can be readily visualized from hypotension to hypertension conditions. We conclude that the concept of using compliance-pressure loop is advantageous as it can afford continuous and accurate tracking of the dynamic arterial behavior despite greatly varying blood pressure levels.

In this paper, we proposed a new method for fetal ECG extraction based on wavelet analysis, the least mean square (LMS) adaptive filtering algorithm, and the spatially selective noise filtration (SSNF) algorithm. First, abdominal signals and thoracic signals were processed by stationary wavelet transform (SWT), and the wavelet coefficients at each scale were obtained. For each scale, the detail coefficients were processed by the LMS algorithm. The coefficient of the abdominal signal was taken as the original input of the LMS adaptive filtering system, and the coefficient of the thoracic signal as the reference input. Then, correlations of the processed wavelet coefficients were computed. The threshold was set and noise components were removed with the SSNF algorithm. Finally, the processed wavelet coefficients were reconstructed by inverse SWT to obtain fetal ECG. Twenty cases of simulated data and 12 cases of clinical data were used. Experimental results showed that the proposed method outperforms the LMS algorithm: (1) it shows improvement in case of superposition R-peaks of fetal ECG and maternal ECG; (2) noise disturbance is eliminated by incorporating the SSNF algorithm and the extracted waveform is more stable; and (3) the performance is proven quantitatively by SNR calculation. The results indicated that the proposed algorithm can be used for extracting fetal ECG from abdominal signals.	adaptive filter;algorithm;chest;clinical data;coefficient;electrocardiography;extraction;fetal monitoring;least mean squares filter;least-squares analysis;mean squared error;noise-induced hearing loss;real-time transcription;signal-to-noise ratio;standard widget toolkit;stationary process;waveform;wavelet analysis	Shuicai Wu;Yanni Shen;Zhuhuang Zhou;Lan Lin;Yanjun Zeng;Xiaofeng Gao	2013	Computers in biology and medicine	10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.07.028	adaptive filter;wavelet;computer vision;speech recognition;least mean squares filter;computer science;mathematics;stationary wavelet transform;statistics	ML	19.73393699032289	-89.20732719771549	133871
a837ed68d3dc1da84b077e2a2ef39aadd206297b	focal epileptiform spikes do not show a canonical bold response in patients with benign rolandic epilepsy (bects)	sensitivity and specificity;functional mri;blood oxygen level dependent;journal article;response function	Simultaneous EEG and functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) studies of focal epileptiform spikes commonly use the canonical haemodynamic response function (HRF) to model the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) response to these events. Support for the use of the canonical HRF has come from large studies that contain mixed cohorts of epilepsy syndromes and discharge types, and has demonstrated plausible epileptic localisation results in the majority of patients. Other studies, however, have reported that some patients show a BOLD response that differs markedly from a canonical HRF. Our aim in this study was to see if the BOLD response is well modelled by a canonical HRF in a homogeneous cohort of patients with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), an idiopathic partial epilepsy with stereotypical centrotemporal spikes on the EEG. We studied eight well-characterised and typical BECTS patients and found that the shape of the average BOLD response was different to the canonical HRF. Furthermore, a localisation analysis using the group-average response provided increased sensitivity and specificity compared to the canonical HRF. Our findings suggest that the canonical HRF may not provide the best model for the BOLD response in some epilepsy syndromes or spike-types. In studies of homogeneous patient groups, therefore, localisation results may be improved by using a group-specific BOLD response.	benign rolandic epilepsy;cell respiration;childhood absence epilepsy;discharger;electroencephalography;epilepsies, partial;epilepsy, rolandic;focal (programming language);frequency response;hemodynamics;language localisation;myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile;patients;sensitivity and specificity;syndrome;establishment and maintenance of localization;fmri	Richard A.

Currently utilized techniques to screen for this condition are questionably reliable and are often deployed in non-standard manners, so efforts have been put forth to generate an instrumental alternative based on cervical auscultation. These physiological signals with low signal-to-noise ratios are traditionally denoised by well-known wavelets in a discrete, single tree wavelet decomposition. We attempt to improve this widely accepted method by designing a matched wavelet for cervical auscultation signals to provide better denoising capabilities and by implementing a dual-tree complex wavelet transform to maintain time invariant properties of this filtering. We found that our matched wavelet did offer better denoising capabilities for cervical auscultation signals compared to several popular wavelets and that the dual tree complex wavelet transform did offer better time invariance when compared to the single tree structure. We conclude that this new method of denoising cervical auscultation signals could benefit applications that can spare the required computation time and complexity.	auscultation;basis pursuit denoising;complex wavelet transform;computation;deglutition disorders;dual;ken kennedy award;neck;noise reduction;patients;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral density;stationary wavelet transform;time complexity;time-invariant system;tree structure;triangular function;trimipramine;vibration - physical agent;benefit	Joshua M.

However, configuring such a device, in particular a combined powered knee and ankle, for individuals with a transfemoral amputation is challenging. Previous attempts have relied on empirical tuning of all control parameters. This paper describes modified stance phase control strategies - which mimic the behavior of biological joints or depend on the instantaneous loads within the prosthesis - developed to reduce the number of control parameters that require individual tuning. Three individuals with unilateral transfemoral amputations walked with a powered knee and ankle prosthesis across five ambulation modes (level ground walking, ramp ascent/descent, and stair ascent/descent). Starting with a nominal set of impedance parameters, the modified control strategies were applied and the devices were individually tuned such that all subjects achieved comfortable and safe ambulation. The control strategies drastically reduced the number of independent parameters that needed to be tuned for each subject (i.e., to 21 parameters instead of a possible 140 or approximately 4 parameters per mode) while relative amplitudes and timing of kinematic and kinetic data remained similar to those previously reported and to those of non-amputee subjects. Reducing the time necessary to configure a powered device across multiple ambulation modes may allow users to more quickly realize the benefits such powered devices can provide.	amputation above-knee (procedure);amputees;characteristic impedance;impedance parameters;kinetics internet protocol;limb prosthesis;performance tuning;power (psychology);prosthesis implantation;quantitative impedance;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;times ascent;benefit	Ann M.

34a232cf074b131e91f4f7b8298a9c26b2dfbed7	a computer-aided diagnosis system with eeg based on the p3b wave during an auditory odd-ball task in schizophrenia	design automation;computer aided diagnosis;electroencephalography electrodes feature extraction design automation sensitivity computer aided diagnosis indexes;sensitivity;indexes;electrodes;feature extraction;electroencephalography	Objective: To design a Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system using an optimized methodology over the P3b wave in order to objectively and accurately discriminate between healthy controls (HC) and schizophrenic subjects (SZ). Methods: We train, test, analyze, and compare various machine learning classification approaches optimized in terms of the correct classification rate (CCR), the degenerated Youden's index (DYI) and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). CAD system comprises five stages: electroencephalography (EEG) preprocessing, feature extraction, seven electrode groupings, discriminant feature selection, and binary classification. Results: With two optimal combinations of electrode grouping, filtering, feature selection algorithm, and classification machine, we get either a mean CCR = 93.42%, specificity = 0.9673, sensitivity = 0.8727, DYI = 0.9188, and AUC = 0.9567 (total-15 Hz-J5-MLP), or a mean CCR = 92.23%, specificity = 0.9499, sensitivity = 0.8838, DYI = 0.9162, and AUC = 0.9807 (right hemisphere-35 Hz-J5-SVM), which to our knowledge are higher than those available to date. Conclusions: We have verified that a more restrictive low-pass filtering achieves higher CCR as compared to others at higher frequencies in the P3b wave. In addition, results validate previous hypothesis about the importance of the parietal-temporal region, associated with memory processing, allowing us to identify powerful {feature,electrode} pairs in the diagnosis of schizophrenia, achieving higher CCR and AUC in classification of both right and left Hemispheres, and parietal-temporal EEG signals, like, for instance, the {PSE, P4} pair (J5 and mutual information feature selection). Significance: Diagnosis of schizophrenia is made thoroughly by psychiatrists but as any human-based decision that has a subjective component. This CAD system provides the human expert with an objective complimentary measure to help him in diagnosing schizophrenia.	abnormal degeneration;area under curve;binary classification;ccr receptors;computer-aided design;discriminant;electroencephalography phase synchronization;feature extraction;feature selection;hertz (hz);low-pass filter;machine learning;mutual information;preprocessor;receiver operating characteristic;schizophrenia;selection algorithm;sensitivity and specificity;statistical classification;temporal lobe	Lorenzo Santos-Mayo;Luis M.

However, the signal quality of dry electrodes in comparison with wet electrodes has not yet been evaluated under activities of daily life (ADL) or high motion tasks. In this study, we compared the performances of foam-based and spring-loaded dry electrodes with wet electrodes under three different task conditions: resting state, walking, and cycling. Our analysis showed that signals obtained by the 2 types of dry electrodes and obtained by wet electrodes displayed high correlation for all conditions, while being prone to similar environmental and electrode-based artifacts. Overall, our results suggest that dry electrodes have a similar signal quality in comparison to wet electrodes during motion and may be more practical for use in mobile and real-time motion applications due to their convenience. In addition, we conclude that as with wet electrodes, post-processing can mitigate motion artifacts in ambulatory EEG acquisition.	antibody to islet cells of pancreas measurement;artifact (error);artifact (software development);electroencephalography;independent computing architecture;mindo;morphologic artifacts;performance;real-time locating system;rest;resting state fmri;video post-processing;electrode	Arnold Yeung;Harinath Garudadri;Carolyn Van Toen;Patrick P.

c5898acef7121ac97e45b42aec8fda90220aa9ed	enhancement of life-threatening arrhythmia discrimination in the intensive care unit with morphological features and interval feature extraction via random forest classifier		Introduction: Intelligent patient monitoring has continued to enhance and develop in hospitals from the early stage of monitoring systems. So, practical medical monitoring devices to react to patient conditions and also detect unwanted clinical conditions are very important. Aims: Our algorithm uses pulsatile waveforms and simultaneous ECG in order to detect and enhance the determination of the life-threatening arrhythmia alarms in the context of the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology 2015 Challenge. Methods: the analysis steps included: In our algorithm, features for training the random forest classifier (RFC) were derived from applying the signal quality assessment (SQI) to both pulsatile signals and ECG signal too. Primarily, preprocessing step was done by applying the band pass filters to multiple sources, such as arterial blood pressure (ABP), photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) and then heart beat detection through the adaptive threshold were determined. The SQI approach for the pulsatile signals was applied through the ppgSQI and the jSQI algorithms and also spectral and statistical features were extracted from ECG channel as well. In a next process, the heuristic thresholding of each ABP pulse are estimated with the function of abpfeature and also heart rate (HR) features from the ECG and pulsatile signals in a segment before the alarm was extracted and computed. Also, for assessing regularity of the beats, inter-beat intervals for pulsatile waveforms and also checking the frequency maxims for better suppression of ventricular flutter/fibrillation in the ECG channel were computed. Finally, RFCs were trained with arrhythmia features set for every type of the arrhythmia. Results: our algorithm was trained with the use of 750 records provided by PhysioNet dataset for the challenge of 2015 and according to the types of arrhythmia, our overall scores varied. Our average score for our best performance for all the alarms in terms of true positive were 67% and for true negative were 77% and for false negative were 1.8%.	algorithm;alternating bit protocol;beat detection;feature extraction;heuristic;preprocessor;random forest;thresholding (image processing);wow and flutter measurement;zero suppression	Farhad Asadi;Mohammad Javad Mollakazemi;Shadi Ghiasi;Seyed Hossein Sadati	2016	2016 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)		electronic engineering;speech recognition;engineering;biological engineering	ML	16.43021164239107	-88.26440848980795	134849

Here, we test the hypothesis that visual stimulus-dependent cortical activity from awake and free-moving rats can be encoded following systemically administered MnCl(2), and activity subsequently readout using manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI), a technique that can be performed without sacrificing the animal. Unanesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats, with or without systemic injection of MnCl(2), were maintained for 8 h in either a visually stimulating environment or darkness. To identify vision-dependent changes in cortical activity, animals were anesthetized and cortices were examined by 3D RARE MEMRI. Mean signal intensities in sub-cortical regions (e.g., superior colliculus and the lateral geniculate), and cortical regions (primary and accessory visual cortices) were compared. Cortex linearization was performed to aid in layer-specific signal intensity comparisons. Manganese administration alone globally increased signal intensity in the brain (P<0.0001). In visually stimulated and unstimulated rats, layer-specific analysis revealed that stimulated rats had on average significantly (P<0.05) higher signal intensities in layers IV and V of the primary visual cortex, as well as in deeper portions of the superficial superior colliculus, relative to dark adapted rats. Such differences went undetected without layer-specific analysis. We demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility of layer-specific stimulus-dependant non-invasive MEMRI readout after encoding activity in awake and free moving rats. Future MEMRI studies are envisioned that measure the effects on cortical activity of sensory stimulation, as well as normal development, disease, plasticity, and therapy in longitudinal studies.	3d computer graphics;area striata structure;cerebral cortex;corpora quadrigemina, superior colliculus;lateral thinking;manganese poisoning;photic stimulation;rats, sprague-dawley;stimulation (motivation);the superficial;video-in video-out;anatomical layer	David Bissig;Bruce A.

The aim of this work is to determine the feasibility of using the Emotiv Epoc device in a BCI. BCIs provide a method for interaction with a computer for people with severe communication disabilities. The EEG signals of five healthy users have been registered and preprocessed. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) has been used to extract the relevant characteristics of the EEG signals. Frequency spectrum between 8 Hz 30 Hz has been calculated. An offline analysis to the recorded data has been performed using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classification algorithm in order to differentiate three and four mental tasks. Results of up to 71% classification accuracy for three tasks and 64% classification accuracy for four tasks were obtained, showing that the Emotiv Epoc is suitable to be used in a Brain-Computer Interface.	algorithm;brain–computer interface;data pre-processing;epoc (operating system);electroencephalography;emotiv systems;fast fourier transform;online and offline;spontaneous order;support vector machine	Fernando Flórez;José Maria Azorín;Eduardo Iáñez;Andrés Úbeda;Eduardo Fernández	2011			brain–computer interface;machine learning;support vector machine;artificial intelligence;computer science	HCI	12.629471161926984	-92.26477914758408	135419
276bc38b9efa56a4c42e0484707d62f6d75fbdfb	analyzing the influence of curl speed in fatiguing biceps brachii muscles using semg signals and multifractal detrended moving average algorithm	fractals;fatigue;standards;fluctuations;analysis of variance;signal processing algorithms;muscles	In this work, an attempt has been made to analyze surface electromyography (sEMG) signals of fatiguing biceps brachii muscles at different curl speeds using multifractal detrended moving average (MFDMA) algorithm. For this purpose, signals are recorded from fifty eight healthy subjects while performing curl exercise at their comfortable speed until fatigue. The signals of first and last curls are considered as nonfatigue and fatigue conditions, respectively. Further, the number of curls performed by each subject and the endurance time is used for computing the normalized curl speed. The signals are grouped into fast, medium and slow using curl speeds. The curl segments are subjected to MFDMA to derive degree of multifractality (DOM), maximum singularity exponent (MXE) and exponent length multifractality index (EMX). The results show that multifractal features are able to differentiate sEMG signals in fatiguing conditions. The multifractality increased with faster curls as compared with slower curl speed by 12%. High statistical significance is observed using EMX and DOM values between curl speed and fatigue conditions. It appears that this method of analyzing sEMG signals with curl speed can be useful in understanding muscle dynamics in varied neuromuscular conditions and sports medicine.	biceps brachii muscle structure;computation (action);exponent;fatigue;multifractal system;p-value;phenylephrine hydrochloride 10 mg oral tablet;speed (motion);surface electromyography;algorithm;curl;sports medicine specialty	Kiran Marri;Swaminathan Ramakrishnan	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591521	simulation;speech recognition;analysis of variance;fractal;engineering;mathematics;communication;statistics	Visualization	16.71024240976705	-85.1113503086016	135523

In this study, 79 patients diagnosed with probable AD were recruited from the multi-centric Prospective Dementia Database Austria (PRODEM). EEG recordings were done with the subjects seated in an upright position in a resting state with their eyes closed. Models of linear regressions explaining disease severity, expressed in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, were analyzed by the nonlinear qEEG markers of auto mutual information (AMI), Shannon entropy (ShE), Tsallis entropy (TsE), multiscale entropy (MsE), or spectral entropy (SpE), with age, duration of illness, and years of education as co-predictors. Linear regression models with AMI were significant for all electrode sites and clusters, where R2 is 0.46 at the electrode site C3, 0.43 at Cz, F3, and central region, and 0.42 at the left region. MsE also had significant models at C3 with R2 > 0.40 at scales τ = 5 and τ = 6. ShE and TsE also have significant models at T7 and F7 with R2 > 0.30. Reductions in complexity, calculated by AMI, SpE, and MsE, were observed as the MMSE score decreased.	electroencephalography;entropy (information theory);focal (programming language);mental state;mutual information;nonlinear system;prospective search;resting state fmri;shannon (unit);tsallis entropy	Carmina Reyes-Coronel;Heinrich Garn;Markus Waser;Manfred Deistler;Thomas Benke;Peter Dal-Bianco;Gerhard Ransmayr;Stephan Seiler;Dieter Grossegger;Reinhold Schmidt	2017	Entropy	10.3390/e19030130	econometrics;artificial intelligence;mathematics;tsallis entropy;statistics;entropy	ML	17.767117053510052	-84.99446888432144	135562

For this purpose, we collect 22 fetal magnetocardiogram using a 151 SQUID system from 22 low-risk fetuses in gestational ages ranging from 30 to 37 weeks. Each study lasted for 30 minutes. After the attenuation of the maternal cardiac signals, we identify the R waves using an adaptive Hilbert transform approach and calculate the fetal heart rate. On these datasets, we apply the proposed approach and the traditionally used approaches such as standard deviation of the normal to normal intervals (SDNN) and root mean square of the successive difference (RMSSD). Heart rate patterns are scored by an expert using Nijhuis criteria and revealed A, B, and D patterns. A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve is used to assess the performance of the metric to differentiate the different patterns. Results showed that only PPA was able to differentiate all pairs of fHRP with high performance.	balance theory;fetal heart;fetus;gestational age;heart failure;heart valve disease;hilbert transform;linear discriminant analysis;manuscripts;mean squared error;nonlinear system;plant roots;quantitation;receiver operator characteristics;receiver operating characteristic;score	Rathinaswamy B.

A glove embedding 20 Halleffect sensors was used for this purpose. Its performance in terms of repeatability were preliminary investigated in order to define an effective strategy for the use of the glove in these applications. After this preliminary phase, focused clinical experiments were carried out in order to verify the existence of differences usable for performance assessment in the postures of the hand of able-bodied and subjects affected by rhizoarthrosis during grasping. The data were processed by using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique. The preliminary results of these experiments showed that the use of the first and second Principal Components can allow to discriminate between able-bodied and disabled persons and also between disabled persons before and after the surgical intervention. For this reason, this approach could represent an effective tool for the surgeon during the rehabilitation process in this particular situation. Further experiments will be carried out in the future in order to confirm these preliminary results. Moreover, a new calibration procedure of the sensorised glove will be developed in order to improve the performance of the glove.	experiment;power glove;principal component analysis;repeatability;sensor	Silvestro Micera;Ettore Cavallaro;Rossella Belli;Franco Zaccone;Eugenio Guglielmelli;Paolo Dario;Diego Collarini;Bruno Martinelli;Chiara Santin;Renzo Marcovich	2003		10.1109/ROBOT.2003.1241922	simulation;orthopedic surgery;computer science;engineering;biological engineering;principal component analysis	Robotics	11.153518025234154	-84.26836171771487	135651

SenseCam is a device that can automatically record images and other data from the wearer’s whole day. It is a significant challenge to deconstruct a sizeable collection of images into meaningful events for users. The cross-correlation matrix was used, to characterise dynamical changes in non-stationary multivariate SenseCam images. MODWT was then applied to equal-time Correlation Matrices over different time scales and used to explore the granularity of the largest Eigenvalue and changes, in the ratio of the sub-dominant Eigenvalue spectrum dynamics, over sliding time windows. By examination of the eigenspectrum, we show that these approaches can identify “Distinct Significant Events” for the wearers.

To evaluate the accuracy of the approach, a simulated S/sub 2/ with A/sub 2/ and P/sub 2/ components having different overlapping intervals (5-30 ms) was synthesized. The simulation results show that the technique is very effective for extracting the two components, even in the presence of noise (-15 dB). The normalized root-mean-squared error between the original A/sub 2/ and P/sub 2/ components and their reconstructed versions varied between 1% and 6%, proportionally to the duration of the overlapping interval, and it increased by less than 2% in the presence of noise. The validated technique was then applied to S/sub 2/ components recorded in pigs under normal or high pulmonary artery pressures. The results show that this approach can successfully isolate and extract overlapping A/sub 2/ and P/sub 2/ components from successive S/sub 2/ recordings obtained from different heartbeats of the same animal as well from different animals.	chirp;error detection and correction;estimated;heart sounds;image noise;instantaneous phase;mean squared error;nonlinear system;pulmonary artery structure;simulation;time–frequency representation;version	Jingping Xu;Louis-Gilles Durand;Philippe Pibarot	2001	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/10.914790	electronic engineering;speech recognition;systems modeling;time–frequency analysis;index term;feature extraction;digital signal;computer science;engineering;circulatory system;time–frequency representation;mean squared error;communication;chirp;transient response;information extraction;physics;bioacoustics;quantum mechanics;polynomial	Visualization	19.768258814955974	-88.76046671900168	135966

In this paper, we compare three prevalent EE estimation methods and five body locations to provide a basis for selecting among methods, sensors number, and positioning. We considered 1) counts-based estimation methods, 2) activity-specific estimation methods using METs lookup, and 3) activity-specific estimation methods using accelerometer features. The latter two estimation methods utilize subsequent activity classification and EE estimation steps. Furthermore, we analyzed accelerometer sensors number and on-body positioning to derive optimal EE estimation results during various daily activities. To evaluate our approach, we implemented a study with 15 participants that wore five accelerometer sensors while performing a wide range of sedentary, household, lifestyle, and gym activities at different intensities. Indirect calorimetry was used in parallel to obtain EE reference data. Results show that activity-specific estimation methods using accelerometer features can outperform counts-based methods by 88% and activity-specific methods using METs lookup for active clusters by 23%. No differences were found between activity-specific methods using METs lookup and using accelerometer features for sedentary clusters. For activity-specific estimation methods using accelerometer features, differences in EE estimation error between the best combinations of each number of sensors (1 to 5), analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA, were not significant. Thus, we conclude that choosing the best performing single sensor does not reduce EE estimation accuracy compared to a five sensors system and can reliably be used. However, EE estimation errors can increase up to 80% if a nonoptimal sensor location is chosen.	body position;calorimetry;choose (action);dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry;eighty;energy metabolism;estimated;global positioning system;indirect coombs test;lookup table;mean squared error;metadata encoding and transmission standard;metastatic neoplasm;unobtrusive javascript;accelerometers;sensor (device)	Marco Altini;Julien Penders;Ruud J.

Early diagnosis of the breast cancer plays an important role in treating the disease. Thousands of genes microarray data is often used in cancer diagnosis. However, many of these genes which are used in the diagnosis of disease do not have a meaningful pattern. Also, to classify thousands of genes are not good in terms of performance. Therefore, it is very important to make a correct diagnosis with a small number of genes. In this study, Fisher correlation score and T test were firstly applied for gene selection. After filtering, three different approaches were applied. The first method is feature generation and dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis. The second method is feature generation and feature selection with discrete cosine transform. The third method is feature selection with filtering data.	dimensionality reduction;discrete cosine transform;feature selection;fisher information;microarray;principal component analysis	Mahmut Kaya;Hasan S.

However, other physiological events such as artifacts and deep inspiratory gasp produce sympathetic activation, being unrelated to apnea. Thus, its high sensitivity can produce misdetections and overestimate apneic episodes. In this regard, a methodology for selecting a set of relevant non-stationary features to increase the specificity of the obstructive sleep apnea detector is discussed. A time-evolving version of the standard linear multivariate decomposition is discussed to perform stochastic dimensionality reduction. As a result, performed outcomes of accuracy bring enough evidence that if using a subset of cepstral-based dynamic features, then patient classification accuracy is 83.3%. Therefore, photoplethysmography — based detection provides an adequate scheme for obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis.	artifact (software development);cepstrum;detectors;dimensionality reduction;inspiration function;morphologic artifacts;patients;photoplethysmography;quantum fluctuation;sensitivity and specificity;sleep apnea syndromes;sleep apnea, obstructive;sleep mode;stationary process;subgroup	Lina María Sepúlveda-Cano;Eduardo Gil;Pablo Laguna;Germán Castellanos-Domínguez	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090362	stochastic process;speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;medicine;pathology;feature extraction;physical therapy;remote patient monitoring;mathematics;photoplethysmogram;accuracy and precision;sleep;statistics	Vision	17.359798310452447	-87.54805775523509	136535

Measurements were taken for eight nondiabetic subjects (4 females, 4 males, aged 47±7.2 years) who had no musculoskeletal symptoms. Five variables were measured with the platform in the barefoot standing position. Ten measurements were taken using two different techniques for feet and posture positioning, during three sessions, once a week. For most measurements, no significant effect over time was found with Student’s t-test (P < .000125). The ANOVA test of statistical significance confirmed that measurement differences between subjects showed higher variations than measurements taken from the same subject (P < .001).

However, when combining these modalities, the dimensionality of the feature space rapidly increases, yielding the well-known “curse of dimensionality”. As a consequence, in order to extract useful information from this data, one has to resort to feature selection (FS) techniques to lower the dimensionality of the learning space. In this paper, we assess the impact of FS techniques for silent speech data, in a dataset with 4 non-invasive and promising modalities, namely: video, depth, ultrasonic Doppler sensing, and surface electromyography. We consider two supervised (mutual information and Fisher’s ratio) and two unsupervised (meanmedian and arithmetic mean geometric mean) FS filters. The evaluation was made by assessing the classification accuracy (word recognition error) of three well-known classifiers (knearest neighbors, support vector machines, and dynamic time warping). The key results of this study show that both unsupervised and supervised FS techniques improve on the classification accuracy on both individual and combined modalities. For instance, on the video component, we attain relative performance gains of 36.2% in error rates. FS is also useful as pre-processing for feature fusion.	curse of dimensionality;dynamic time warping;electromyography;feature selection;feature vector;multimodal interaction;mutual information;preprocessor;silent speech interface;support vector machine;whole earth 'lectronic link	João Freitas;Artur J.

This study proposes a non-biased method to quantify associations between ADC and CBP in newborns with global or focal cerebral ischemia. The study population consisted of nine neonates (age: 0 to 3 days) presenting with clinical and imaging evidence of ischemia (seven with global hypoxic ischemia, and two with focal arterial ischemic stroke) with decreased ADC. Six newborns without diffusion abnormalities on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging served as a comparative cohort (age: 0 days to 4 weeks). All patients underwent MR imaging including diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to determine ADC and axial arterial spin labeling (ASL) to determine CBP. An algorithm was developed that uses the B0 volume from the DWI raw data as a reference, co-registers the ADC and ASL-CBP data to the B0, generates mask filters, and finally performs a statistical analysis to automatically select regions of interest (ROIs) with ADC or ASL-CBP values that deviate significantly from the rest of the brain. If ROIs are identified in this analysis, the algorithm then evaluates correlation based on ROI location and volume. A significant correlation was found between decreased ADC and elevated ASL-CBP with regions of elevated ASL-CBP typically larger than the corresponding ADC abnormality. The association between decreased diffusivity and increased ASL-CBP suggests that, for this cohort, cerebral ischemia is associated with hyperperfusion.	alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive cdisc version questionnaire;arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging;blood substitute;cerebral infarction;cerebral ischemia;coefficient;congenital abnormality;diffusion magnetic resonance imaging;diffusion weighted imaging;focal (programming language);hematological disease;hypoxia;infant, newborn;ischemic cerebrovascular accident;large;mental association;myocardial ischemia;patients;region of interest;algorithm	Rudolph Pienaar;Michael J.

a3f9bcfbacecc41b75ded96814578ba9a2994ea7	progress in eeg-based brain robot interaction systems		The most popular noninvasive Brain Robot Interaction (BRI) technology uses the electroencephalogram- (EEG-) based Brain Computer Interface (BCI), to serve as an additional communication channel, for robot control via brainwaves. This technology is promising for elderly or disabled patient assistance with daily life. The key issue of a BRI system is to identify human mental activities, by decoding brainwaves, acquired with an EEG device. Compared with other BCI applications, such as word speller, the development of these applications may be more challenging since control of robot systems via brainwaves must consider surrounding environment feedback in real-time, robot mechanical kinematics, and dynamics, as well as robot control architecture and behavior. This article reviews the major techniques needed for developing BRI systems. In this review article, we first briefly introduce the background and development of mind-controlled robot technologies. Second, we discuss the EEG-based brain signal models with respect to generating principles, evoking mechanisms, and experimental paradigms. Subsequently, we review in detail commonly used methods for decoding brain signals, namely, preprocessing, feature extraction, and feature classification, and summarize several typical application examples. Next, we describe a few BRI applications, including wheelchairs, manipulators, drones, and humanoid robots with respect to synchronous and asynchronous BCI-based techniques. Finally, we address some existing problems and challenges with future BRI techniques.

This paper presents a novel haptic based gait rehabilitation system (HGRS) which has the potential to provide over-ground gait training regimens for post-stroke ambulatory subjects. It consists of a portable cane for kinesthetic sensing and a wearable vibrotactor array for tactile biofeedback. Contact of user with the handle provides light grip force, it serves the purpose of balance assurance and increased muscle activity through light touch concept and vibrotactors contribute in enhancing the gait modification through afferent signal of vibration. Walking trials conducted with stroke patients indicate increased muscle activation and balance, and improved temporal symmetry with use of HGRS. HGRS is capable of assisting physical therapists in training individuals with stroke suffering from gait abnormalities. In addition, it is easy to use and low-cost which makes it reachable to a vast domain of subjects suffering from gait abnormalities.	futures studies;gait analysis;haptic technology;rehabilitation robotics;robot;video game rehabilitation;wearable computer	Muhammad Raheel Afzal;Sanghun Pyo;Min-Kyun Oh;Young-Sook Park;Beom-Chan Lee;Jungwon Yoon	2016	2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2016.7759494	simulation;engineering;sensor;vibration	Robotics	12.768268429934539	-82.89812164379981	137076
34fd54c3d6396404a792699491dda9ef6eb4fc9c	development and pilot testing of a novel electromechanical device to measure wrist rigidity in parkinson’s disease		Quantitative assessment of the muscle tone is important when studying patients with neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). For the assessment of therapeutic progress, quantitative and objective outcome measures are needed. This article presents a novel electromechanical device to monitor the quantitative rigidity of the wrist joint against passive movement. The novel device is equipped with an electrical motor to move the wrist joint in a flexion-extension manner with different velocity profiles. The accuracy of the device was measured in terms of position, velocity and torque accuracy. The feasibility of the measurement procedure was tested in a pilot study with four PD patients and 12 healthy controls (HC), at velocities of 10 °/s,50 °/s, and 100 °/s. {The position and velocity of the developed device were (0.005 ± 0.105)° and (0.734 ±0.276) °/s, unloaded, and (0.003 ± 0.113) ° and (0.013 ± 0.038) °/s, loaded with a relaxed arm, respectively. The torque accuracy was (15.029 ± 2.235) mNm. The comparison of the median rigidity between the PD patients and HC showed significant differences at all tested velocities, during both flexion and extension movements. This device proved to have sufficient accuracy and sensitivity to precisely measure the interaction torque at the wrist joint and to differentiate PD rigidity from normal muscle tone. The device, thus provides a quantitative and objective measure of rigidity in PD.	cerebrovascular accident;movement disorders;muscle rigidity;muscle spasticity;muscle tonus;myalgia;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;relaxation;torque;velocity (software development);weighted round robin;wrist joint;nervous system disorder	Giuseppe A.

Therefore, it contains useful information for diagnosis of epilepsy. However, it is a very time consuming and costly task to handle these subtle details by a human observer. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) was proposed to automate the process of seizure detection in EEG signals. Initially, the EEG signals have been analysed using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for features extraction. Then, the PSO algorithm has been trained to recognize the epileptic signals in EEG data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of classification accuracy and stability. A comparison with other methods in the literature confirms the superiority of the PSO.	electroencephalography;particle swarm optimization;wavelet transform	Nasser Omer Sahel Ba-Karait;Siti Mariyam Hj.

EMG activity was recorded from 8 muscles of the dominant leg. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization was applied for the extraction of muscle synergies. 4 modules were sufficient to reconstruct the repertoire of muscle activations for all the subjects during PS condition, and these modules were found consistent across all the subjects (correlation >; 83%). 5 muscle synergies were necessary for the characterization in ES condition; 4 out of these modules were shared with PS condition, and the resulting additional module appeared subject-specific. These preliminary results support the existence of a modular motor control in humans.	electromyography;game controller;muscle;non-negative matrix factorization;programming paradigm;ps (unix);real-time clock;synergy	Cristiano De Marchis;Anna Margherita Castronovo;Daniele Bibbo;Maurizio Schmid;Silvia Conforto	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346672	signal reconstruction;muscle;simulation;feature extraction;computer science;engineering;biomechanics;physical therapy;machine learning;cycling;matrix decomposition;physiology;anatomy	Robotics	13.732045623243222	-83.37935810868238	137989

Methods for assessing pulmonary function and chest wall movement are essential for accurate diagnosis, as well as monitoring response to treatment, operative procedures and rehabilitation. Despite this, there is a lack of low-cost devices for rapid assessment. Spirometry is used to measure air flow expired, but cannot infer or directly measure full chest wall motion. This paper presents the development of a low-cost chest wall motion assessment system. The prototype was developed using four Microsoft Kinect sensors to create a 3D time-varying representation of a patient’s torso. An evaluation of the system in two phases is also presented. Initially, static volume of a resuscitation mannequin with that of a Nikon laser scanner is performed. This showed the system has slight underprediction of 0.441 %. Next, a dynamic analysis through the comparison of results from the prototype and a spirometer in nine cystic fibrosis patients and thirteen healthy subjects was performed. This showed an agreement with correlation coefficients above 0.8656 in all participants. The system shows promise as a method for assessing respiratory disease in a cost-effective and timely manner. Further work must now be performed to develop the prototype and provide further evaluations.	cessation of life;chest wall structure;coefficient;cystic fibrosis;evaluation procedure;inference;kinect;manikins;motion capture;operative surgical procedures;parkinson disease;patients;plethysmography;prototype;respiratory tract diseases;resuscitation procedure;scanning systems;software development kit;spirometer device component;spirometry;telephone number;television;tracking system;trunk structure;sensor (device)	James M.

Several methods are used to extract meaningful information from the large quantities of data obtained, however, at present these methods can only be used offline. Thus, all analysis currently performed is retrospective and done after the recordings have finished. Limited information about the quality or characteristics of the data is therefore known while the experiments take place. Building on these offline analysis methods, an online implementation has been developed that identifies and displays slow wave activations working alongside an existing recording system. This online system was developed by adapting existing and novel signal processing techniques and linking these to a new user interface to present the extracted information. The system was tested using high resolution porcine data, and will be applied in future high resolution mapping studies allowing researchers to respond in real time to experimental observations.	cns disorder;experiment;extraction;image resolution;numerous;occur (action);online and offline;porcine species;quantity;signal processing;user interface device component;on-line system	Simon H.

In case where EEG is one of the modalities, it is of interest to relate a nonlinear function of the raw EEG time-domain signal, say, EEG band power, to another modality such as the hemodynamic response, as measured with NIRS or fMRI. In this work we tackle exactly this problem defining a novel algorithm that we denote multimodal source power correlation analysis (mSPoC). The validity and high performance of the mSPoC framework is demonstrated for simulated and real-world multimodal data.	algorithm;electroencephalography;hemodynamics;modality (human–computer interaction);multimodal interaction;nonlinear system	Sven Dähne;Felix Bießmann;Frank C.

However, current encoding methods are not suitable to process complex temporal signal. Motivated by the modulation relationship found between afferent synaptic currents in biological neurons, this study proposes a spike phase encoding method for ASNN, which could perform wavelet trains. The spike delays in each synchronizing period represent the spectrum amplitudes. The encoding method was tested in two implementation examples: (a) encoding of human voice records for speech recognition propose; and (b) encoding of multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) records with the aim to detect interictal spikes in patients with epilepsy. Empirical evaluations confirm that encoded spike trains constitute a good representation of the continuous wavelet transform of the original signal, with the ability to capture interesting features from the input signal. & 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.	action potential;analog computer;analog signal;analogue electronics;application domain;clock signal;continuous wavelet;encode;electroencephalography;emoticon;feature extraction;frequency band;graph theory;information processing;integrated circuit;low insertion force;modulation;multidimensional transform;nest (neural simulation tool);neural networks;neurocomputing;neuromorphic engineering;neuron;organizing (structure);preprocessor;self-organization;self-organizing map;signal processing;speech recognition;spiking neural network;supervised learning;synaptic package manager;the spike (1997);very-large-scale integration;wavelet transform	Zhenzhong Wang;Lilin Guo;Malek Adjouadi	2016	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2015.08.078	speech recognition;computer science;digital signal processing;machine learning	ML	19.472380188319434	-92.66458873635713	139107

The actual mechanisms of the onset and termination of the seizure are still unclear. While medical therapies can suppress the symptoms of seizures, 30% of patients do not respond well. Temporal lobectomy is a common surgical treatment for medically refractory epilepsy. Part of the hippocampus is removed from the patient. In this study, we have developed an in vitro epileptic model in human hippocampal slices resected from patients suffering from intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Using a planar multielectrode array system, spatio-temporal inter-ictal activity can be consistently recorded in high-potassium (8 mM), low-magnesium (0.25 mM) aCSF with additional 100 μM 4-aminopyridine. The induced inter-ictal activity can be recorded in different regions including dentate, CA1 and Subiculum. We hope the experimental model built in this study will help us understand more about seizure generation, as well as providing insights into prevention and novel therapeutics.	acoustic lobing;ca1 field;drug resistant epilepsy;epilepsy, temporal lobe;hippocampus (brain);in vitro [publication type];magnesium;onset (audio);patients;potassium;seizures;therapeutic procedure;dalfampridine;lobectomy	Min-Chi Hsiao;Pen-Ning Yu;Dong Song;Charles Y.

The features used in the SVMs were extracted automatically based on morphological information. Three different features were extracted: RR interval, QRS slope, and QRS shape similarity. Then, the SVM was used to classify five different electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeat episodes. The Gaussian Radial Basis Function was utilized for the kernel function because the ECG beat episodes were treated as a non-linear pattern. The sensitivity of the classification used for the five beat episodes was 93.16%.	electrocardiography;extraction;nonlinear system;normal statistical distribution;radial basis function;rapid refresh;support vector machine;ventricular arrhythmia	Seung Hwan Lee;Hyun-Chul Ko;Young-Ro Yoon	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610866	support vector machine;speech recognition;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;neurophysiology	Robotics	17.32902262938431	-89.59164587120408	139142
c59158daf03cd814ef942b316b44b6059007ad80	optimal spatio-spectral variable size subbands filter for motor imagery brain computer interface		Abstract   Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a commonly used feature extraction technique for motor imagery brain computer interface. CSP provides poor performance when features are extracted from unfiltered or irrelevant frequency band filtered data. In order to overcome this problem, Subband CSP (SBCSP) and Filter Bank CSP (FBCSP) have been proposed in literature to extract features from several fixed size subbands. However, both SBCSP and FBCSP require manually fixing the size of subbands to obtain higher performance. In this paper, we propose a method that obtains features from many variable size subbands within a given frequency band using CSP. Further, Euclidean distance measure is used to obtain the relevant features. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of classification error on BCI Competition III dataset IVa and BCI competition IV dataset Ia. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance in comparison to CSP, SBCSP and FBCSP.	brain–computer interface	Jyoti Singh Kirar;R. K.

The authors propose support vector machine-based classifier with diverse time- and frequency-domain feature models to detect and classify these faults. Three different kernels, i.e., linear, polynomial, and radial-basis function, are employed separately to examine classifier's performance in each case. Furthermore, the respective kernel scales, δ and p of radial-basis function kernel and polynomial kernel, are varied manually to obtain the optimal values. Leave-one-out cross validation is adopted to overcome the overfitting problem. The dataset was acquired from a temperature-to-voltage converter through Matlab and Arduino Uno microcontroller. The efficiency in terms of percent accuracy of proposed time- and frequency-domain feature models can be seen in experimental results.	arduino;cross-validation (statistics);feature selection;matlab;microcontroller;overfitting;polynomial kernel;radial (radio);radial basis function kernel;sensor;support vector machine;uno;voltage converter;whole earth 'lectronic link	Sana Ullah Jan;Insoo Koo	2017	2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2017.8191044	support vector machine;overfitting;cross-validation;kernel (linear algebra);polynomial kernel;polynomial;feature extraction;fault detection and isolation;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;computer science	Robotics	14.202589526499644	-89.51803490902375	139177

Among them, the P300 speller allows participators to input characters to a computer directly from their own brains. Estimating available features of P300 from raw electroencephalogram(EEG) is a key step of implementing P300 speller. In this paper, a novel combination of Autoregressive model and sparse Wavelet representation is proposed to estimate the P300 features in raw EEG acquired from the P300 speller experiments. Instead of superposition, the P300 features are estimated from raw EEG of single trial in this way. By introducing this method to process signals for BCI, the number of repeated trials may be reduced so that the information transfer rate of P300 speller could be remarkably improved. The proposed approach was tested in off-line data. The results show that the number of repeated trials for a wanted character could be reduced to 4 in general when the feature estimation method is used together with the linear discriminant functions.	autoregressive model;discriminant;electroencephalography;experiment;online and offline;sparse matrix;wavelet	Zhihua Huang;Huiru Zheng	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)	10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359901	wavelet;brain–computer interface;estimation;speech recognition;electroencephalography;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;autoregressive model;electric potential;statistics	Robotics	14.65105593449073	-92.58269151445674	139374

But it is not a natural neuromuscular control scheme. On the other hand, there are two difficulties to control the prosthesis proportionally and simultaneously. First, human hand is high dimensional with more than 20 degrees-of-freedom (DOFs); Second, extracting such control information from EMG is hard due to signal crosstalk and noises. This paper is aimed at proposing a new method for proportional and simultaneous myoelectric control, taking advantage of synergy concept. The hand motion and corresponding forearm EMG signals were collected simultaneously. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce hand motion dimension. And support vector regression (SVR) is adopted to build the connection between hand posture and EMG. Offline analysis validated the effectiveness of this method, and preliminary and positive results have been obtained.	bang–bang control;body position;control theory;crosstalk;electromyographs;electromyography;entity name part qualifier - adopted;forearm;greater than;online and offline;poor posture;principal component analysis;prosthesis implantation;support vector machine;synergy;total peripheral resistance	Shunchong Li;Xingyu Chen;Xinjun Sheng;Xiangyang Zhu	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610969	control engineering;support vector machine;speech recognition;pose;computer science;engineering;biomechanics;proportional control;machine learning;pattern recognition;regression analysis;principal component analysis	Robotics	14.298633106393513	-91.42222453494307	139553

Twelve de novo brain tumor patients undergoing clinical fMRI exams (tbfMRI and rsfMRI) were included in this Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved study. Each patient displayed decreased/absent tbfMRI activation in the primary ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex in the absence of corresponding motor deficit or suboptimal task performance, consistent with NVU. Z-score maps for motor tasks were obtained from the general linear model (GLM) analysis (reflecting motor activation vs. rest). KCC-ReHo and Cohe-ReHo maps were calculated from rsfMRI data. Precentral and postcentral gyri in contralesional (CL) and ipsilesional (IL) hemispheres were parcellated using an automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template for each patient. Similar region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed on tbfMRI, KCC-ReHo, and Cohe-ReHo maps to allow direct comparison of results. Voxel values in CL and IL ROIs of each map were divided by the corresponding global mean of KCC-ReHo and Cohe-ReHo in bihemispheric cortical brain tissue. Group analysis revealed significantly decreased IL mean KCC-ReHo (p = 0.02) and Cohe-ReHo (p = 0.04) metrics compared with respective values in the CL ROIs, consistent with similar findings of significantly decreased ipsilesional BOLD signal for tbfMRI (p = 0.0005). Ipsilesional abnormalities in ReHo derived from rsfMRI may serve as potential indicators of NVU in patients with brain tumors and other resectable brain lesions; as such, ReHo findings may complement findings on tbfMRI used for presurgical planning.	atm adaptation layer;brain neoplasms;cell respiration;clinical use template;coefficient;complement system proteins;complex regional pain syndromes;concordance (publishing);congenital abnormality;de novo transcriptome assembly;futures studies;general linear model;generalized linear model;interphase cell;korea computer center;magnetic resonance imaging;map;medical records systems, computerized;patients;region of interest;rest;resting state fmri;review board;review of systems (procedure);scalability;sensorimotor cortex;voxel;brown adipose tissue uncoupling protein	Shruti Agarwal;Haris I.

Methods: Use TCM Constitution Scale to select participants who are in Moderate, Qi-Deficiency or Yang-Deficiency constitution. Use the Computer Aided Functional Scanning System to scan the participants and analyze their meridian scanning results. Results: 1) There are significant differences (P<0.05) in 12 pairs of the meridians of the three constitutions except Right Liver, Right Small Intestine, two sides of Bladder, two sides of Sanjiao and Left Stomach Meridians. Both of Yang deficiency and Qi deficiency show the function insufficiency, with Yang deficiency more obviously. Taking the Right Lung Meridian as an example, the function mean of Yang deficiency constitution group was −23.67±26.72, Qi deficiency's was −15.96±30.40, the Moderate's was −7.97±28.07. 2) The results of the pairwise comparison show the significant differences(P <0.05) between Yang deficiency and Qi deficiency groups for two sides of Spleen Meridians, Heart Meridians, Kidney Meridians, Pericardium Meridians, Liver Meridians, Bladder Meridians and Right Small Intestine Meridians. 3) There are significant differences (P <0.05) for the comparison between Yang deficiency and Moderate groups in all meridians except Right Liver Meridian, Right small intestine Meridian, two sides of Bladder Meridians and Left Sanjiao Meridian. Conclusions: People with different constitution have different meridian features. The Yang deficiency and Qi deficiency groups show functional insufficiency. The descending tendency is as follows: Yang deficiency > Qi deficiency > Moderate. The consequence gave the evidence of one of the Traditional Chinese Medical theory: Qi deficiency is the initial phase of Yang deficiency, Yang deficiency is the final phase of Qi deficiency.	angular defect;computer cooling;convergence insufficiency;nortel meridian;toolkit for conceptual modeling;yang	Yan-zhao Lin;Zhi-min Yang;Lei Guo;Zi-jian Wu;Ai-hua Ou;Zi-yi Ye	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshops (BIBMW)	10.1109/BIBMW.2011.6112482	meridian;anatomy	Visualization	15.938769439673813	-83.66815554794871	139890

Our first prototype is based on an 8×168×16 element fabric resistive pressure mapping matrix with 1 cm spacial resolution and 50 fps refresh rate. We evaluate the prototype by monitoring leg muscles during realistic leg workouts in a gym out of the lab. The sensor covers the lower part of quadriceps of the user. The shape and movement of the two major muscles (vastus lateralis and medialis) are visible from the data visualizing during various exercises. With features extracted from spacial and temporal domains out of the pressure force mapping information, with 4 different leg exercises plus non-workout activities (relaxing, adjusting machines and walking), we have reached 81.7% average recognition accuracy on a fine-grain sliding window basis, 93.3% on an event basis, and 85.6% spotting F1-score. We further investigate the relationships between people’s perception of the exercise quality/difficulty and the variation and consistency of the force pattern. A second prototype is also developed with tether-free to explore various placements including upper-arm, chest and lower back; a brief comparison with arm-worn EMG shows our approach is comparable on the signal quality level.	sensor	Bo Zhou;Mathias Sundholm;Jingyuan Cheng;Heber Cruz;Paul Lukowicz	2017	Pervasive and Mobile Computing	10.1016/j.pmcj.2016.08.015	sliding window protocol;compression garment;wearable computer;computer science;simulation;refresh rate;spotting;resistive touchscreen	HCI	13.303943987235574	-82.40719612856148	139939
46cb33e9829e56dbfef67ff3905454ca137b961f	epileptic focus localization based on bivariate empirical mode decomposition and entropy		Epilepsy is a neurological disorder which causes abnormal discharges in the brain. Epileptic focus localization is a important factor for successful epilepsy surgery. The intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) is the most used signal for detecting epileptic focus. The iEEG signals are obtained from a publicly available database that consists of 7,500 signal pairs. To this dataset, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has been successfully applied to detect the epileptic focus. However, the EMD method is not suitable for iEEG signal pairs. In this paper, a method for the classification of focal and non-focal iEEG signals using bivariate EMD (BEMD) is presented. The bivariate iEEG signals are decomposed the into signal components of the same frequency band. Various entropy measures calculated from the IMFs of the iEEG signals. Then, some or all of the entropies are chosen as features, which are discriminated into focal or non-focal iEEG by using the support vector machine (SVM). Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to differentiate the focal from non-focal iEEG signals with an average classification accuracy of 86.89%.	bivariate data;electroencephalography;focal (programming language);frequency band;hilbert–huang transform;sensor;support vector machine	Tatsunori Itakura;Toshihisa Tanaka	2017	2017 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA ASC)	10.1109/APSIPA.2017.8282255	hilbert–huang transform;time series;bivariate analysis;support vector machine;epilepsy surgery;feature extraction;epilepsy;mathematics;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition	Robotics	17.53508417304709	-90.3127144326439	140056

We study the effect of working with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and compare its performance with a reference detector based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). These classifications methods require two previous stages: preprocessing and feature extraction. Firstly, R instants are detected previous to the feature extraction phase thanks to a preprocessing over the ECG. Secondly, Cepstrum Coefficients over the RR signal is applied to extract the relevant characteristics specially those related to the system modelled by the filter-type elements concentrated in the low time lag region.	cepstrum;coefficient;feature extraction;linear discriminant analysis;preprocessor;rapid refresh;support vector machine	Antonio G.

383695fdcf5e459f3bb8397d77b2230386bde3bf	design and deployment of a contactless hand-shape identification system for smart spaces		This paper explores the feasibility of a contactless identification system based on hand features. The identification solution has been designed to be integrated with smart space applications and relies on a commercial 3D sensor (i.e., Leap Motion) for palm features capture. The first part of the paper is devoted to evaluate the significance of the different hand features and the performance of a set of classification algorithms. 21 users have contributed to build a testing dataset; for each user, the morphology of each hand has been gathered from 52 features, which include bones length and width, palm characteristics and relative distances among fingers, palm center and wrist. In order to get consistent samples and guarantee the best performance for Leap Motion device, the data collection system provides sweet spot control. This functionality guides the user to situate the hand in the best position and orientation with respect to the device. The selected classification strategies—nearest neighbor (NN), supported vector machine, multilayer perceptron, logistic regression and tree algorithms—have been evaluated on Weka. We have found that relative hand-pose distances are more significant than pure morphological features. On this feature set, the highest correct classified instances (CCI) rate is reached through the multilayer perceptron algorithm ([96 %), although all the evaluated classifiers provide a CCI rate above 90 %. The analysis also gather how these algorithms perform with a variable number of users in the database, and what the sensitivity to the number of training samples is for each algorithm. Results show that there are different alternatives that are accurate enough for non-critical, immediate response applications. The second part of the paper focuses on the implementation of application examples that are integrated with a real-time hand-based identification system using NN. In particular, the applications enable customization and gesture-based control of the smart space. A five-user study has provided insight into the system performance and user experience. Results confirm the viability of using in-air hand shape recognition in smart space settings, although also it is still needed to deal with aspects that hinder faster and more accurate recognition.	contactless smart card;embedded system;emoticon;f-spot;galaxy morphological classification;gesture recognition;home automation;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;logistic model tree;logistic regression;multilayer perceptron;online and offline;performance;radio-frequency identification;real-time clock;real-time locating system;scalability;sequential minimal optimization;situated cognition;software deployment;usability testing;user experience;weka	Ana M.

The aim is to locate heart beats in continuous long-term data. Methods: The beat detection system is build up of several parts. Preprocessing consists of high pass filtering followed by standardization. Extrema of a moving window were used to capture the heart beat impulse. A windowed approach led to dynamic thresholds. Valid parts of the channels were determined and the locations of beats were extracted. The beat locations of various channels were compared during the multichannel fusion procedure and dynamic delay correction. Doubtful locations were checked using RR distances. Results: The algorithm was tested on the training data set for this challenge (one hundred 10-minute recordings) and on several freely available PhysioNet databases which were annotated by physicians. The algorithm had the best score applied to the hidden Phase 1 dataset of the 2014 PhysioNetlCinC challenge. Conclusion: The developed algorithm presents a promising approach to detect heart beats in multivariate records.	algorithm;beat detection;database;filter (signal processing);microsoft windows;multimodal interaction;preprocessor;rapid refresh;test set;window function	Marcus Vollmer	2014	Computing in Cardiology 2014		electronic engineering;real-time computing;speech recognition;engineering	Vision	16.348987793438294	-88.0574969644767	140209
6036c82316fd9f154eebf39cc8db00eeee2cf21b	epilepsy seizure detection using eeg signals		Epilepsy is a neurological disease that is referred to as a disorder of the central nervous system characterized by the loss of consciousness and convulsions. Epileptic patients are subject to epileptic seizures caused by abnormal electrical discharges that lead to uncountable movements, convulsions and the loss of consciousness. Approximately 50 million people around the world are diagnosed with epilepsy, children and adults in the age range of 65–70 years old are effected the most. Although the main cause of this disease is unknown, however, most of the symptoms of the epilepsy seizure can be medically treated. Epileptic patients are subject to seizures that cause uncontrollable movements and loss of consciousness which can lead to serious injuries, and sometimes death. As a result, computerized seizure detection techniques are vital solutions for epileptic patients to protect them from dangers at the time of a seizure. In this paper, we propose an epilepsy seizures detecting method that can be implemented in a hardware device to help epileptic patients. The Electroencephalogram (EEG) is widely recognized for diagnosing and assessing brain activities and disorder. Our study utilized an EEG datasets that is used in various research regarding epilepsy detection. We processed the EEG signal in both time and frequency domains and applied a Chebyschev filter for preprocessing the signal, then, by using Wavelet Analysis, we decomposed the filtered signal into five sub-bands in both time and frequency domain. However, we only used the Delta sub-band for further processing. Discrete Wavelet Transform was used for feature extraction, then thresholding was implemented in order to determine the noisy part of the signal. Moreover, we applied some widely used classifiers for epilepsy seizure detection, and compared our results with other approches.	consciousness;discrete wavelet transform;electroencephalography;feature extraction;preprocessor;sensor;thresholding (image processing)	Zakareya Lasefr;Sai Shiva V.

Providing quantitive data about the movement is not only valid for characterising the courses of training processes, it will also help the athlete to improve the technique or to enhance learning in motor rehabilitation. In this regard, significant features are required to monitor and score the movement-pattern. We analyzed different rowing parameters including grip pull out, grip force, slinding seat position and foot-rest force to derive relevant rowing features. An indoor rower was used to record several movement parameters of elite and novice athletes. Different features were extracted for each rowing parameter by assessing the difference of each feature value on elite and novice athletes. The most relevant features as well as rowing parameters were selected based on the signal-to-noise-ratio ranking. The efficiency of Naive Bayes classifier to differentiate the rowing activity between elite and novice athletes was investigated. According to the results five features are sufficient to achieve a high classification rate of 100%. Using the proposed feature set a grading system was introduced enabling to rank and score the quality related to motor activity in rowing.	autonomous robot;indoor positioning system;naive bayes classifier;signal-to-noise ratio	Sanam Moghaddamnia;Jürgen Peissig;Gerd Schmitz;Alfred O.

One of the most prominent methods is to use the Pulse Transit Time (PTT). Although it is proven that PTT has a strong correlation with the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, this relation is highly dependent to each individuals physiological properties. Therefore, it requires per person calibration for accurate and reliable blood pressure estimation from PTT, which is a big drawback. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, a novel method is proposed for accurate and reliable estimation of blood pressure that is calibration-free. This goal is accomplished by extraction of several physiological parameters from Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal as well as utilizing signal processing and machine learning algorithms. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed method achieves grade B for the estimation of the diastolic blood pressure and grade C for the estimation of the mean arterial pressure under the standard British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol.	algorithm;digital back-propagation;machine learning;signal processing;unreachable memory	Mohamad Kachuee;Mohammad Mahdi Kiani;Hoda Mohammadzade;Mahdi Shabany	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2015.7168806	support vector machine;estimation;feature extraction;pressure measurement;computer science;engineering;blood pressure;machine learning;biological engineering	EDA	13.82327930506773	-86.6873595005095	140568
5774d064ca9031c54aa5d8eca82f08d42c20cb7f	mechanomyographic sensor - a triaxial accelerometry approach		Recently, accelerometers have been used to acquire mechanomyography signals. These signals are due to muscle lateral oscillations during contraction. In this study, a sensor acquired such vibrations in three directions. A triaxial accelerometer-based sensor was constructed and tested with a controlled mechanical vibrator and subwoofer speaker (both from 10Hz up to 40Hz) during isokinetic muscle contraction (3 volunteers, 50 extensions at 300 degrees/s). With triaxial accelerometry it was possible to compute the MMG modulus signal. For normalised and average values, MMG amplitude presented strong correlation coefficients (R=0,89) with RMS and peak torque. Below 80% of normalised data, MMG amplitude and torque values (RMS and peak) seem to converge.	araucaria;coefficient;contraction mapping;converge;database normalization;lateral thinking;modulus of continuity;neural oscillation;pc speaker;population;sensor;subwoofer;vibrator (electronic)	Guilherme Nunes Nogueira-Neto;Ronie Wesley Müller;Fábio Andrey Salles;Percy Nohama;Vera Lúcia da Silveira Nantes Button	2008			electronic engineering;engineering;accelerometer;smoke;mechanical engineering	AI	13.54075555488693	-85.423505184609	140625

However, many approaches usually require high complexity for reliable detection and result in achieving real time computation difficultly. This study proposes a real time low complexity BCI interface for stroke rehabilitation, which is based on Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) method. For reducing complexity purpose, EEG channels (electrodes) are reduced from 19 channels to 4 channels which are Fz, C3, Cz, and C4. Furthermore, the filter bank is reduced from five bands to three bands which are 4-7Hz, 8-12Hz, and 13-30Hz. We also develop a real time scheme by using one-second timing window for EEG analysis and adaptive algorithm to fit time-varying EEG. This approach not only reduces 87% computational complexity but also shows over 80% accuracy for offline analysis and 68% accuracy for online implementation within one-second response time.	adaptive algorithm;brain–computer interface;circuit restoration;common spatial pattern;computation;computational complexity theory;electroencephalography;filter bank;online and offline;response time (technology);via c3	Tsung-Pen Chou;Wan-Ru Wang;Tian Sheuan Chang	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)	10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251988	simulation;speech recognition;computer science;communication	Robotics	13.574368204685022	-92.41423013867711	140696
f4ee7b68b0dde855605b175b768a52c95fa0d2f9	automatic seizure detection by modified line length and mahalanobis distance function		Abstract Automatic seizure detection with high accuracy and in linear time has profound implications on therapeutic intervention mechanisms. In this work taking into account 12 popular seizure detection algorithms we have shown that line length is one feature that is extractable in linear time from EEG signals and capable of automatic seizure onset detection with highest accuracy among linear time extractable features. Also line length is less prone to give false positives. The detection accuracy has been ascertained by ROC curve analysis on Freiburg Seizure Prediction Project data containing intracranial EEG recordings of 87 seizures from 21 patients with sufficient interictal signals. Next, we have modified the classical line length feature extraction algorithm to improve its accuracy without any additional computational burden. Finally, we have applied both classical line length (LL) and modified line length (MLL) on all focal channels and detected seizures on multidimensional focal channel signals by Mahalanobis distance function (MDF). Both detected 73 out of 87 seizures. Area under the ROC curve (AUC), detection delay and false positive for LL and MLL are 0.951, 11.903 s, 0.201/h and 0.954, 11.698 s, 0.198/h respectively. Since LL has already been incorporated into an FDA approved commercially available closed loop intervention system, even this minute improvement may have significant healthcare implications.

Unfortunately there is no suitable technique to classify sEMG when the there are multiple active muscles such as during finger and wrist flexion due to cross-talk. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to decompose the signal into individual muscle activity has been demonstrated to be useful. However, ICA is an iterative technique that has inherent randomness during initialization. The average improvement in classification of sEMG that was separated using ICA was very small, from 60% to 65%. To overcome this problem associated with randomness of initialization, multi-run ICA (MICA) based sEMG classification system has been proposed and tested. MICA overcame the shortcoming and the results indicate that using MICA, the accuracy of identifying the finger and wrist actions using sEMG was 99%.	classification;cross-talk;electromyography;hepatitis b surface antigens;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;iterative method;muscle;ninety nine;numerous;prosthesis implantation;randomness	Ganesh R.

Typical detection of AF requires tedious and manual analysis of ECG which can often delay medical intervention. With the advent of wearable devices that can accurately record the time interval between two heartbeats (RR interval), automated and timely detection of AF is now possible. In this paper, we engineer novel heart rate variability features based on linear and non-linear dynamics of RR intervals. Unlike complex features extracted from ECG signals, these features can be easily obtained using wearable sensors. We propose automated classifiers to detect AF episodes and also compare the performance of different classifiers. Our proposed classifier has a very high sensitivity (98%) and specificity (95%) and outperforms prior published works.	anisotropic filtering;atrial fibrillation;domain analysis;dynamical system;extraction;frequency response;heart atrium;heart rate variability;nonlinear dynamics;nonlinear system;rapid refresh;scientific publication;sensitivity and specificity;ventricular fibrillation;wearable computer;wearable technology;windows 95;non-t, non-b, calla positive childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia;sensor (device)	Mehrin Gilani;J.

It is generally accepted that it must be positioned on electrically neutral tissues, such as tendons or bony prominences. The objective of this study is to analyze the characteristics of the electromyographic signal (EMG) for different positions of RE as well as at different levels of muscle contraction. Signals from the brachial biceps and triceps were recorded from 18 healthy women (BMI: 21.20 kg/m2 ± 1.72; mean age: 21.94 ± 1.98 years old) during 100 and 50% maximum flexion voluntary isometric contractions, as well as at rest. For each situation, the RE was randomly positioned in 4 different locations: a) homolateral acromion; b) homolateral brachial biceps; c) styloid process of the contralateral ulna; and d) lateral malleolus of the contralateral ankle. For statistical analysis, Shapiro-Wilk and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used, followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test, at a significance level of 5% (p < 0.05). RMS, normalized RMS, PSD, median frequency and levels of energy at 60 Hz, 120 Hz and 180 Hz were assessed for the different sites of RE. The results show that the positioning of the RE on the four experimental locations did not change important features of the electromyographic signals in the time and frequency domains, for the three levels of isometric contractions studied. Such findings compel us to re-think the current trend regarding the RE position followed by the great majority of the researches in areas such as physical therapy.	acromion;active directory rights management services;adobe photoshop;amendment;biceps brachii muscle structure;bluetooth;body tissue;bone structure of ulna;brain–computer interface;complex event processing;declaration (computer programming);electricity;electromyography;emoticon;hertz (hz);hoc (programming language);isometric contraction;isometric projection;kilogram per square meter;kruskal's algorithm;lateral thinking;muscle contraction;randomness;reference electrode;root mean square;signal detection (psychology);tendon structure;triceps brachii muscle structure;significance level;standards characteristics	Rinaldo Roberto de Jesus Guirro;Alcimar Barbosa Soares;Amanda Caldeira Guirro;Camila Simieli;Alessandra Vairo Peres Boratino;Gabriela de Carvalho;Aline Gobbi;Elaine Caldeira de Oliveira Guirro	2018	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-018-1028-0	orthodontics;data mining;lateral malleolus;biceps;ankle;isometric exercise;acromion;muscle contraction;medicine;electromyography;ulna	Metrics	14.45907489766477	-85.127503925176	141123
b4ed7aa806605ceca845882677bb35081a0c5cae	time-series discrimination using feature relevance analysis in motor imagery classification	eeg data preprocessing;short time parameters;feature relevance analysis;motor imagery	The use of motor imagery discrimination using feature relevance analysis (MIDFR) is investigated for classification tasks based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The method addresses the problem of a direct and automatic finding of the time-varying features influencing the most on distinguishing motor imagery tasks. The method introduces a stochastic relevance stage that is primarily used for properly handling the set of short-time features, which are extracted as to make prominent the nonstationary behavior of the EEG data. Furthermore, since it is widely accepted that the motor imagery information is concentrated in the  μ  and  β  neural activity bands, we make use of the empirical mode decomposition together with the common-spatial-patterns mapping. We test two different motor imagery databases, using a soft-margin support vector machine classifier that is validated by a 10-fold cross-validation methodology. Since the proposed MIDFR algorithm better encodes neural activity dynamics, experimental results carried out, which are also contrasted with other state-of-the art approaches, show that the proposed approach allows improving detection of MI classification tasks. Besides, the computed relevance on the EEG channels is in accordance with other clinical findings reported in the literature.	relevance	Andrés Marino Álvarez-Meza;Luisa F.

We applied a combination of advanced surface-based reconstruction and diffusion tensor imaging techniques to address this issue. We found significant relationships between white matter tract integrity indices and corresponding cortical structures. Our results suggest a direct link between damage in white and gray matter and contribute to the notion of gray matter loss relating to clinical disability. INTRODUCTION Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system in which nerve cells, in the brain and in the spinal cord, progressively lose their insulating myelin sheath. Symptoms include visual, motor and cognitive deficits and may appear during the acute phase, followed by relatively long recover periods, in a continuously progressive degeneration, or in a combination of the two patterns. In most individuals developing MS, the initial course of the disease is described by the first pattern, also known as relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. According to the World Health Organization, MS is among the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults worldwide and it is estimated that, currently, more than 2 million people suffer from MS [1]. The exact etiology of MS remains unknown and no cure currently exists. Although affecting axons, and thus being traditionally classified as a white matter (WM) disease, in most cases also the brain cortex and the deep gray matter (GM) reflect diffused abnormalities, such as atrophy [2]. GM atrophy, that is associated with physical disability, can be identified by surface reduction of a cortical region and/or by the decrease of cortical thickness. Neuroimaging techniques and anatomopathological studies can evidence and measure these occurrences [3, 4]. Nonconventional MRI techniques have greatly improved the knowledge of MS pathogenic mechanisms, revealing, for example, a diffuse damage of WM and GM occurring outside focal lesions. Moreover, the role of GM in determining disability from the early stages of the disease has been better understood. Despite these advances, there are still many unanswered questions, such as the relationship between GM and WM damage [5]. Some authors hypothesize independent processes affecting both of them in parallel while others suggest that GM axonal loss is secondary to Wallerian and retrograde axonal degeneration occurring in the WM. From the neuroimaging point of view, both the independence hypothesis and the trigger hypothesis require systematic studies and high-level signal processing of MR images. The study of the motor system in all its components, including the corticospinal tract (CST) WM pathway and the corresponding cortical GM area, would have a significant clinical impact especially considering that disability in MS is mainly related to motor deficits.

FreeSurfer provides a useful set of tools for automatic segmentation of brain structures, fine identification of cortical areas and estimation of cortical thickness and curvature [6]. We applied these two advanced techniques to the study of the CST and of the primary motor cortex in a group of patients affected by MS, with the aim to better understand the cross-sectional relationship between GM and WM damage in a clinically relevant system. METHODS Subjects. Thirty patients with established relapsing-remitting MS [7] and 25 age-matched healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. All patients were recruited by the MS Center of the Fondazione Don Gnocchi and were relapseand steroid-free for at least 3 months. Complete neurological examination with expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score rating was performed in all patients by a single neurologist. The HC had no history of neurological, cardiovascular or metabolic disorders and a normal neurological examination. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee and a written informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to study entry. MRI acquisition. Brain MRI was acquired from all subjects using a 1.5 Tesla scanner (Siemens Magnetom Avanto, Erlangen, Germany) with the following sequences (TR = repetition time, TE = echo time, ETL = echo train length, FOV = field of view, TI = inversion time): 1) Dual-echo turbo spin echo (TR = 2650 ms, TE = 28 ms / 113 ms, ETL = 5; flip angle = 150°, 50 axial slices, 256 x 256 pixels matrix, interpolated to 512 x 512 pixels, FOV = 250 x 250 mm, slice thickness = 2.5 mm) 2) 3D T1-weighted MP-RAGE (TR = 1900 ms, TE = 3.37 ms, TI = 1100 ms, flip angle = 15°, 176 axial slices, 192 x 256 pixels matrix, FOV = 250 x 250 mm, slice thickness = 1 mm) 3) Diffusion-weighted single shot spin-echo sequence (TR = 7100 ms, TE = 94 ms, 50 axial slices, 128 x 96 pixels matrix, FOV = 320 x 240 mm, slice thickness = 2.5 mm). The DTI protocol included two runs, each with: 12 non-collinear diffusion gradients (b = 900 s/mm) and 1 non-diffusionweighted (b = 0 s/mm). MRI data analysis and post-processing. MS lesions were identified on proton density-weighted scans, using the corresponding T2-weighted images to increase confidence in lesion identification. Lesion segmentation was performed with Jim software (Jim v5.0, Xinapse System, Leicester, UK). Diffusion Weighted Images (DWI) were pre-processed using eddy_correct, part of the FSL package (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/). The tensor was then calculated for each voxel and the DT-derived maps, i.e. mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA), were created using Diffusion Toolkit v0.4.3 (http://www.trackvis.org). We reconstructed left and right CST of the 25 healthy controls with TrackVis v0.4.3, using the brute force approach, an FA threshold of 0.2 and an angle threshold of 40°. We nonlinearly co-registered all the tracts to the MNI152 standard space, estimating the transformation from the subject FA map to the FMRIB58_FA, i.e. the FA map in the MNI152 space available in FSL. We binarized and averaged all the co-registered tracts, obtaining a probabilistic atlas. We coregistered the DT-derived maps of every MS patient to the atlas, with the same method used for the co-registration of the HC tracts. Then, the weighted averages of FA and MD in the left and right CST were computed using the probabilistic atlas [8]. Finally, we superimposed the co-registered lesion masks on the probabilistic atlases and obtained the CST specific lesion load (LL) for each patient. FreeSurfer reconstruction. Each MP-RAGE volume was processed using FreeSurfer to digitally reconstruct the outer WM surface and the external pial surface. Using FreeSurfer tools, a complete subject-specific labeling of cortical regions was performed, together with the computation of the pial surface area and the cortical thickness of the labeled cortical regions. This set of cortical features permits a thoroughly region-specific analysis. In order to compare different subjects the estimated Total Intracranial Volume (eTIV) was computed and its value was later used to correct area sizes. To test whether the anatomical relationship between a WM tract and the corresponding cortical area would be more significant than with a non-structurally connected cortical area, we included in our analysis the CST, the primary motor cortex (MC) and the auditory cortex (AC), the former directly connected to the CST, the latter belonging to a separate neuronal pathway (Fig. 1). According to the chosen cortical atlas, the MC is anatomically correspondent to the precentral gyrus; the AC is Proc. of SPIE Vol. 9034 90343V-2 Downloaded From: http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/ on 07/21/2015 Terms of Use: http://spiedl.org/terms correspondent to the anterior transverse temporal gyrus (of Heschl), to the lateral aspect of the superior temporal gyrus, to the planum polare of the superior temporal gyrus and to the planum temporale of the superior temporal gyrus [9]. On the CST probabilistic atlas, the anatomical pathway of the single CST tracts was checked, assessing their direct connection with the MC cortical areas. First, the CST reconstructed tracts and the digitally reconstructed pial surface were co-registered into the same space. The physical connection of the CST tracks into the primary motor cortex resulted, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig.1 – The motor cortex area (MC, images on the left) and the auditory cortex area (AC, images on the right), as labeled on a representative subject of the dataset. The cortical thickness and the surface area for each anatomical region of interest were extracted and then, for the cortical thickness, the average value and the standard deviation for the MC areas and the AC areas were calculated.

In this context, the leading idea is that motor functions of the affected arm during a reaching task may be improved if the unaffected arm has already reached the target. As part of this pilot study, one chronic post-stroke patient with weakness and spasticity on his right arm conducted reaching tasks to virtual targets arranged in a $5\times 3$ matrix located parallel to his frontal plane, in two different configurations: (1) affected arm only (without assistance from the exoskeleton); (2) unaffected arm first followed by the affected arm (2a) without, and (2b) with assistance. A force field attracting the wrist of the affected arm to the target was used in the assistive mode. The data post-processing and analysis included task completion time, reachable task space, joint range of motion, human-robot interaction force/torque and power exchange at multiple sensors along the arm - visualized in a series of interaction maps. The data validated the robotic system's basic functionality in facilitating post-stroke unilateral and asymmetric bilateral training. Future work would be expanded to clinical trials with more subjects to be recruited and additional features to be implemented.	angularjs;assistive technology;bilateral filter;c date and time functions;cerebrovascular accident;dual;emoticon;expanded memory;flow;force field (chemistry);human–robot interaction;hyperactive behavior;imagery;large;map;movement;muscle spasticity;muscle weakness;patients;ps (unix);robot;stroke rehabilitation;transformation matrix;velocity (software development);video post-processing;workspace;exoskeleton;positive regulation of exo-alpha-sialidase activity;sensor (device);sievert	Yang Shen;Ji Ma;Bruce Dobkin;Jacob Rosen	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512665	task analysis;computer vision;artificial intelligence;computer science;control theory;spasticity;stroke recovery;range of motion	Robotics	12.64928911790883	-82.19909280974429	141796

The Fugl-Meyer assessment (FM) and user experiences of therapists and patients were examined in both groups. An improvement of 10 and 8 points on the FM was found for respectively the CON and AS group. Both therapists and patients reported positive experiences on several aspects of user acceptance. These findings indicate that a low-tech system for arm support results in similar gains in arm function as conventional reach training in equal intensity, and is suitable for application in clinical practice.	arm architecture;cerebrovascular accident;experience;fm broadcasting;numerous;one-to-one (data model);patients;randomized algorithm;rehabilitation centers;stroke rehabilitation;technical support;training support;metabolic abnormality assessment	Gerdienke Prange;Anke I.

We have studied age-related modifications of the skeletal muscle by in vivo T2-relaxometry and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) at high field intensity (4.7 T). The aim of the work was to test the hypothesis that the ageing process involves microvessels in skeletal muscle. METHODS: The study was performed in 4-month-old (n = 6) and 20-month-old (n = 6) rats. RESULTS: At MRI examination, the relaxation time T2 of the gastrocnemius muscle showed no significant difference between these two groups. The kinetic of contrast penetration in the tissue showed that in 4-month-old rats the enhancement values of the signal intensity at different time-points were significantly higher than those found in senescent rats. CONCLUSION: The reported finding suggests that there is a modification of the microcirculatory function in skeletal muscle of aged rats. This work also demonstrates that CE-MRI allows for an in vivo quantification of the multiple biological processes involving the skeletal muscle during aging. Therefore, CE-MRI could represent a further tool for the follow up of tissue modification and therapeutic intervention both in patients with sarcopenia and in experimental models of this pathology.	aging;capillarity;conflict (psychology);contrast ratio;gastrocnemius muscle structure;kinetics;linear programming relaxation;magnetic resonance imaging;microcirculatory bed;microvessels;myocytes, smooth muscle;patients;quantitation;sarcopenia;skeletal muscle structure;video-in video-out	Elena Nicolato;Paolo Farace;Roberto M.

This preliminary study aims at investigating how the autonomic nervous system, in terms of electrodermal activity, responds to specific controlled emotional stimuli in bipolar patients. More specifically, we present here a method to deploy the analysis of ElectroDermal Activity (EDA) to discriminate clinical mood states. EDA was analyzed by using a deconvolution method to separate tonic from phasic components. The three subjects recruited and the experimental protocol used here is part of the European project PSYCHE. Preliminary results show that the bipolar mood states can be related to electrodermal tonic activity.	activity diagram;autonomic computing;autonomic nervous system;bipolar disorder;cns disorder;deconvolution;depressive disorder;handling (psychology);patients	Alberto Greco;Antonio Lanata;Gaetano Valenza;Giuseppina Rota;Nicola Vanello;Enzo Pasquale Scilingo	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347529	psychology;psychiatry;neuroscience;developmental psychology;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;skin;neurophysiology;clinical psychology;statistics	Robotics	17.636157782055964	-85.25416005858762	142034

SEMUL has eight software routines; however, these routines do not manage to combine quantitative evaluation with user amusement. To solve this problem, we developed training software in the form of coin-collecting software. In addition, we developed the coin-collecting software such that it was able to trigger movements for feedforward control and feedback control. We conducted experiments to verify the effectiveness of this software by young healthy subjects. Test subjects trained using the developed software for five days. Then, we carried out a questionnaire survey. The results show that the software includes quantitative evaluation. In addition, the survey results show that the training software provides high levels of user amusement when compared with the existing software.	experiment;feed forward (control);feedback	Kousuke Hata;Ken'ichi Koyanagi;Kensuke Nagata;Tatsuo Motoyoshi;Hiroyuki Masuta;Toru Oshima	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO 2014)	10.1109/ROBIO.2014.7090573	embedded system;real-time computing;erbium;simulation;computer science;feedback;accuracy and precision;tracking	SE	10.559217147521208	-83.89517319447276	142472

With C-means clustering, the SVM recognition rate of lateral features was usually above 90% while, with K-means clustering, the recognition rate was close to 85%. The best recognition rate was even reaching up to 97% for some individual subject. Then the samples from all subjects were processed together with the cross-validation. Our experimental results showed that the HRV signal could be used with fuzzy clustering and support vector machine to effectively classify the lateral features of lower limbs movement. It may provide a new choice for FES control signal. The optimizing of the algorism parameters can be introduced to get better control in the future.	fuzzy clustering;shin megami tensei: persona 3;support vector machine	Weixi Zhu;Dong Ming;Baikun Wan;Xiaoman Cheng;Hongzhi Qi;Yuanyuan Chen;Rui Xu;Weijie Wang	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21657-2_53	engineering;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining	ML	14.45847452984603	-90.96507236735695	142690

Eleven healthy subjects performed two visuo-spatial motor training tasks over 9 sessions (2-3 sessions per week). Subjects controlled a cursor with bilateral simultaneous movements of the shoulders and upper arms using a body machine interface. Before the start and within 2days of the completion of training, whole brain diffusion tensor MR imaging data were acquired. Motor training increased fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the posterior and anterior limbs of the internal capsule, the corona radiata, and the body of the corpus callosum by 4.19% on average indicating white matter microstructure changes induced by activity-dependent modulation of axon number, axon diameter, or myelin thickness. These changes may underlie the functional reorganization associated with motor skill learning.	axon;bilateral filter;body of uterus;brain–computer interface;coat of arms;corona radiata;cursor (databases);diameter (qualifier value);fractional anisotropy;gray matter;interface device component;internal capsule of brain;limb structure;modulation;motion;motor neuron disease;motor skills;movement;myelin;neuroimaging;patients;phase ii/iii trial;pointing device;ruby document format;shoulder;spinal cord injuries;spinal cord neoplasms;structure of body of corpus callosum;thickness (graph theory);white matter;physical rehabilitation	Xue Wang;Maura Casadio;Kenneth A.

The coherence mainly reflects movement-related proprioceptive afference to the cortex. Here we describe a novel MEG-compatible stimulator to generate computer-controlled passive finger and toe movements that can be used as stimuli in functional brain-imaging experiments. The movements are produced by pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM), elastic actuator that shortens with increasing air pressure. To test the applicability of the stimulator to functional brain-imaging, 4-min trains of passive repetitive 5-mm flexion-extension movements of the right and left index finger and the right hallux were produced at 3Hz while the subject's brain activity was measured with whole-scalp MEG and finger or toe kinematics with an accelerometer. In all ten subjects studied, statistically significant coherence (up to 0.78) occurred between the accelerometer and MEG signals at the movement frequency or its first harmonic. Sources of coherent activity were in the contralateral hand or foot SM1 cortices. Movement-evoked fields elicited with intermittent movements of the right index finger (once every 3.2-4.0s; mean±SD peak response latency 88±25ms) were co-located with the respective coherent sources. We further moved the right index finger at 3, 6, and 12Hz (movement ranges 5, 3, and 2mm, respectively), and analyzed the first 1, 2, and 4-min epochs of data. One minute of data was sufficient to locate the left hand area of the SM1 cortex at all movement frequencies. Sound-induced spurious coherence was reliably ruled out in a control experiment. Our novel movement stimulator thus provides a robust and reliable tool to track proprioceptive afference to the cortex and to locate the SM1 cortex.	air pressure;coherence (physics);electroencephalography;epoch (reference date);experiment;hallux structure;index finger;kinematics;magnetoencephalography;movement;muscle;pneumatic artificial muscles;proprioceptive disorders;accelerometers	Harri Piitulainen;Mathieu Bourguignon;Riitta Hari;Veikko Jousmäki	2015	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.006	kinematics;neuroscience;radiology;communication;accelerometer;anatomy;magnetoencephalography	ML	15.723375534093718	-81.02088985986913	142855
7b82ba0401605dfc6a2bbbcb7431e9f44ad12f16	fall prevention analysis during a fall stimulus using the differential velocity of a split belt treadmill		Amid trends toward population aging in many developed countries, the number of people requiring nursing care has increased markedly. Slips and falls during ordinary daily activities are a common cause of bone fracture and muscle injury. Several previous studies have analyzed the movements produced by artificially generated slip and fall stimuli, but few have investigated these stimuli directly. We analyzed lower limb motion following a slip and fall stimulus produced using a pulled free-walking system. This consisted of a controllable split belt treadmill, with which a speed difference between the belts could be applied to produce a slipping motion. In two male participants, we induced slip motion by immediately applying acceleration in the sagittal plane direction of the right leg upon contact with the treadmill. Each participant demonstrated a unique recovery method from falling. Additionally, we found that increased stimulation led to faster right foot motion during recovery or a stronger floor reaction force if recovery failed. The results indicated that the transition of the floor reaction force during a fall stimulus correlates with the location of the center of mass and the risk of fall.

Depression has become a disease, which may threaten millions of families’ well-being. The current method of screening depression is subjective, labor-consuming and costly. Study on Electroencephalogram (EEG) has become a new direction to explore an objective, low-cost and accurate method to detect depression. In this paper, three-electrode EEG data of 158 subjects (90 depressed and 68 normal control) in resting state, and under audio stimulation (positive and negative) were collected and processed. After feature selection using Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS), four popular classification methods were applied and classification accuracies were verified using 10-fold cross validation. Results have shown the accuracy of classification will be improved when male and female are classified separately. The highest accuracy of male and female classification are 91.98%, 79.76%, respectively, compare to 77.43% when the classification is processed as gender-free. The effective depressive features of male and female are also different, which may be caused by the differences of brain structure. This research suggests a possible pervasive method of depression classification for future clinical application.	electroencephalography;feature selection;pervasive informatics;resting state fmri;stepwise regression	Hanshu Cai;Yanhao Zhang;Xiaocong Sha;Bin Hu	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-70772-3_23	cross-validation;physical medicine and rehabilitation;electroencephalography;wearable technology;disease;resting state fmri;health care;feature selection;physical therapy;screening depression;medicine	ML	12.966995332140522	-89.9834480606052	143096
ea4db9d5c41d08a1e6ed01e5178428810a4ae43d	single-trial p300 classification using pca with lda, qda and neural networks		The P300 event-related potential (ERP), evoked in scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG) by external stimuli, has proven to be a reliable response for controlling a BCI. The P300 component of an event related potential is thus widely used in brain-computer interfaces to translate the subjects’ intent by mere thoughts into commands to control artificial devices. The main challenge in the classification of P300 trials in electroencephalographic (EEG) data is the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the P300 response. To overcome the low SNR of individual trials, it is common practice to average together many consecutive trials, which effectively diminishes the random noise. Unfortunately, when more repeated trials are required for applications such as the P300 speller, the communication rate is greatly reduced. This has resulted in a need for better methods to improve single-trial classification accuracy of P300 response. In this work, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a preprocessing method and use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)and neural networks for classification. The results show that a combination of PCA with these methods provided as high as 13% accuracy gain for single-trial classification while using only 3 to 4 principal components.

In a recently proposed non-parametric approach, the fetal and maternal ECG are modeled from their respective references using Gaussian processes. The reference signals for maternal ECG and fetal ECG are the thoracic ECG and abdominal PCG, respectively. In this paper, multiple kernels are used instead of a single kernel for the covariance function of the Gaussian process. The proposed methodology improves the results of fetal ECG extraction as confirmed by experimental results.	gaussian process;kernel (operating system);modal logic	Bharathi Surisetti;Richard M.

To the present date, there are no adequate tools to diagnose and help rehabilitation of subjects with tremor, but recently there is a tremendous surge of interest in the research in the field. We report on the use of fuzzy methods in applications for rehabilitation, namely in tremor diagnosing and control. We synthesize our results regarding the characterization of the tremor by means of nonlinear dynamics techniques and fuzzy logic, and the prediction of tremor movements in view of rehabilitation purposes. Based on linear and nonlinear analysis of tremor, and using fuzzy aggregation, the fusing of tremor parameters in global functional disabling factors is proposed. Nonlinear dynamic parameters, namely correlation dimension and Lyapunov exponent is used in order to improve the assessment of tremor. The benefits of the fuzzy fused tremor parameters rely on more complete and accurate assessment of the functional impairment and on improved feedback for rehabilitation, based on the fused parameters of the tremor. Further steps in rehabilitation may require external muscular control. In turn, the control of tremor by electrical stimulation requires movement prediction. Several neural and neuro-fuzzy predictors are compared and a neuro-fuzzy predictor is presented, allowing us five-step ahead prediction, with an RMS error of the order of 10%. The benefits of the neuro-fuzzy predictor are good prediction capability, versatility, and apparently a high robustness to individual variations of the tremor. The reported research, which extended over several years and included development of sensors, equipment, and software, has been aimed to development of products. The results may also open new ways in tremor rehabilitation.	correlation dimension;electric stimulation technique;functional electrical stimulation;fuzzy logic;kerrison predictor;lyapunov fractal;movement;muscle;neuro-fuzzy;nonlinear system;plateau dynamic:pres:pt:respiratory system:qn;population;sensor;tremor;benefit	Horia-Nicolai L.

a330524869b8359571e35ba1c2b94706d3687be2	an semg-based interface to give people with severe muscular atrophy control over assistive devices		Injuries, accidents, strokes, and other diseases can significantly degrade the capabilities to perform even the most simple activities in daily life. While assistive technology becomes more and more available to the people affected, there is still a big need for user interfaces suitable for people without functional hand movement. A large share of these cases involves neuromuscular diseases, which lead to severely reduced muscle function. However, even though affected people are no longer able to functionally move their limbs, residual muscle function can still be existent. Previous work has shown that this residual muscular activity can suffice, to create an EMG-based user interface, and e.g., allow for control of assistive devices. In this paper, we enhance this user interface with additional EMG-features and an improved training paradigm in order to increase information extraction from recordings of strongly atrophic muscles. The interface was tested and validated by subjects with severe spinal muscular atrophy. Results show that the used methods improve the decoding and thereby allow for a considerable increase in performance when controlling a robotic manipulator in a 3D reaching task.	assistive technology;atrophic;cerebrovascular accident;electromyography;information extraction;limb structure;muscle function;neuromuscular diseases;pointing device;programming paradigm;robot;sema5b gene;spinal muscular atrophy;user interface device component	Jörn Vogel;Annette Hagengruber	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512689	residual;computer vision;manipulator;spinal muscular atrophy;artificial intelligence;electromyography;computer science;user interface;atrophy	Robotics	12.740106817616184	-82.80566590012091	143531

To verify our proposed concept, ultrasonic power amplifiers with and without the linearizer were tested for HeLa cells proliferation in vitro. In general, ultrasonic stimulus initiates the process of cavitation which can cause cell lysis and disruption of cell attachment. The cavitation can also induce formation of free radicals so that a rigid membrane of malignant cancer cells have increased sensitivity to ultrasonic stimulus. The cell density of the control group increased up to almost 100% on Day 3. However, cell densities of the experimental group when using an isolated ultrasonic power amplifier, and ultrasonic power amplifiers integrated with the linearizer at 1 V and 5 V DC (direct current) bias could be suppressed more than that when using an ultrasonic power amplifier (90.7 ± 1.2%, 75.8 ± 3.5%, and 68.1 ± 1.1%, respectively). Additionally, the proliferation suppressing ratios of each experimental group confirmed that the cell density decrements of the experimental groups exhibited statistical significance compared to the control group (ultrasonic power amplifier = 8.87%, ultrasonic power amplifier with 1 V biased linearizer = 23.87%, and ultrasonic power amplifier with 5 V biased linearizer = 31.56%).

Its accuracy is significantly influenced by the selection of the photoplethysmography (PPG) feature points. In this paper, we designed an assessment function to calculate the quality of PPG. The quality index indicates the reliability of PPG and helps to determine proper feature points. Kalman filter is used to fuse different PPG feature points for blood pressure calculation. This method is evaluated by the multiparameter intelligent monitoring in intensive care (MIMIC) database. The evaluation shows that it can get more accurate blood pressure results than those methods using fixed PPG feature points, especially when serious motion artefacts exist.	alternating bit protocol;kalman filter;mimic;velocity (software development)	Lin Xu;Kunpeng Gao	2015	I.

90bccce228d90b44ae382afa02f2a7f864522310	evaluating the association between cardiac and peripheral resistance arms of the baroreflex		The study proposes an extension of cardiac baroreflex (cBR) sequence analysis, traditionally performed over spontaneous fluctuations of heart period and systolic arterial pressure, to typify peripheral resistance baroreflex (prBR) from spontaneous variations of peripheral resistances and diastolic arterial pressure. The prBR baroreflex sensitivity (BRS prBR ) and percentage of prBR sequences (SEQ% prBR ) were computed along with analogous quantities assessed over cBR (i.e. BRS cBR and SEQ% cBR ). The cBR and prBR were typified in healthy subjects at rest (REST) and during light bicycle ergometer exercise at 10 percent of the maximal effort (EXE). Both cBR and prBR were affected by EXE: indeed, BRS cBR and SEQ% prBR were significantly reduced. Moreover, while BRS cBR and BRS prBR were not significantly associated, SEQ% cBR and SEQ% prBR were, and the correlation coefficient was positive. This study suggests that prBR can be typified from spontaneous variabilities along with the more traditional cBR, thus enlarging the possibility of monitoring human cardiovascular control mechanisms.	alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma;autonomic computing;baroreflex;calibration;coat of arms;coefficient;complementarity theory;control system;description;diastole;hypothalamic hormones;maximal set;peripheral vascular diseases;quantity;rest;sequence analysis;sinoatrial node;skin (computing);spatial variability;spontaneous order;systolic pressure;total peripheral resistance	Alberto Porta;Vlasta Bari;Giovanni Ranuzzi;Beatrice De Maria;Mara Malacarne;Massimo Pagani;Daniela Lucini	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037516	computer vision;peripheral;baroreflex;artificial intelligence;computer science;diastolic arterial pressure;surgery;systolic arterial pressure;cardiology;internal medicine	Robotics	15.117317902950823	-84.16825689093604	144109
aa5bb9f0c62b6b205d80c90da90ee6633197a510	assessment of respiratory flow and efforts using upper-body acceleration		In this paper, an innovative method for estimating the respiratory flow and efforts is proposed and evaluated in various postures and flow rates. Three micro electro-mechanical system accelerometers were mounted on the suprasternal notch, thorax and abdomen of subjects in supine, prone and lateral positions to record the upper airway acceleration and the movements of the chest and abdomen wall. The respiratory flow and efforts were estimated from the recorded acceleration signals by applying machine learning methods. To assess the agreement of the estimated signals with the well-established measurement methods, standard error of measurement (SEM) was calculated and $$\rho = 1-{\rm SEM}$$ ρ = 1 - SEM was estimated for every condition. A significant agreement between the estimated and reference signals was found ( $$\rho = 0.83, 0.82$$ ρ = 0.83 , 0.82 and 0.89 for the estimated flow, thorax and abdomen efforts respectively). Additionally, the agreement of the estimated and reference flows was assessed by calculating the ratio of time at the tidal peak inspiration flow to the inspiration time ( $$t_{\rm PTIF}/t_{\rm I}$$ t PTIF / t I ) and the ratio of time at the tidal peak expiration flow to the expiration time ( $$t_{\rm PTEF}/t_{\rm E}$$ t PTEF / t E ). Overall mean and standard deviation of absolute value of differences between $${t}_{{\rm PTIF}}/{t}_{{\rm I}}$$ t PTIF / t I and $${t}_{{\rm PTEF}}/{t}_{{\rm E}}$$ t PTEF / t E ratios calculated for every breathing cycle of reference and estimated flow were 0.0035 (0.06) and 0.051 (0.032), respectively. The presented results demonstrate the feasibility of using the upper-body acceleration as a simple solution for long-term monitoring of respiratory features.	abdominal wall structure;body position;chest;estimated;expiration, function;flow;lateral thinking;machine learning;movement;standard deviation;whole earth 'lectronic link;accelerometers	Parastoo Dehkordi;Kouhyar Tavakolian;Marcin Marzencki;Marta Kaminska;Bozena Kaminska	2014	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-014-1168-4	simulation;engineering;electrical engineering;engineering drawing	ML	14.716004442036816	-85.10337695072609	144185

These sounds are usually associated with cardiopulmonary diseases such as the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In this work seven different features were tested with the objective to identify the best subset of features that allows a robust detection of coarse crackles. Some of the features used in this study are new, namely those based on the local entropy, on the Teager energy and on the residual fit of a Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity process. The best features as a function of the number of features used in classification were identified having into account the Matthews correlation coefficient. The best individual feature was based on the local entropy. A significant improvement in the performance was obtained by using the feature based on local entropy and the feature based on the wavelet packed stationary transform - no stationary transform. The addition of more features only allows a smaller improvement.	autoregressive model;cardiopulmonary;chronic obstructive airway disease;classification;cor pulmonale;lung diseases, obstructive;lung diseases;matthews correlation coefficient;pack unit;respiratory sounds;small;stationary process;subgroup;wavelet	Luis Mendes;Paulo Carvalho;César Alexandre Teixeira;Rui Pedro Paiva;Jorge Henriques	2014	2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2014.6943879	speech recognition;engineering;pattern recognition;statistics	Vision	16.818763513599787	-90.12205454463778	144325

The independent ECG leads were acquired simultaneously; the sampling rate was 500 Hz. A moving average bandpass filter and a notch filter were applied to the ECG. All the QRS-T complexes were detected and removed from de original signal. A new lead was constructed as the sum of the independent lead, sample by sample. The Teager Energy Operator was applied to the new constructed lead to get an auxiliary function where high energy zones were emphasized. A threshold was computed, based on the maximum value of the auxiliary function, to identify atrial activity. When this activity was detected, the onset and offset of the atrial wave were identified in the original leads using slope criterion. The proposed algorithm was tested with 300 ECGs from adults patients; the sensitivity for P wave detection reached 96,47 %; false positive were not produce.	electrocardiography;heart atrium;integer (number);microcontroller;microprocessor;onset (audio);patients;rest;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;algorithm;p wave	Rene Ivan Gonzalez-Fernandez;Martha Rivero-Varona;Gisela Montes de Oca-Colina	2013	Computing in Cardiology 2013		electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Vision	17.53480629625906	-87.91795488437448	144474

Automated measurement algorithms enable even general medical practitioners with little or no knowledge of vascular ultrasonography to measure vascular compliance parameters using this probe. The results of measurements performed on human volunteers by untrained personnel are reported to illustrate the practical utility of the system.

d2139578a929e8d8c8bf053b515623093a8b690e	assessment of robot interventions in a task-based rehabilitation: a case study		This study is aimed at assessing of a robot intervention in a task-based upper-arm rehabilitation procedure. Robotic devices have significantly been useful to help therapists do the training procedure. However, due to the lack of quantifiable feedback regarding the level of intervention, effectiveness of various parameters, such as timing, intensity, etc., the training and its efficacy varies remarkably between institution and therapists. In this study, Universal Robot 5 (UR5) has been utilized to move an arm of healthy subjects over a circular path while the muscle activities are recorded through surface electromyography (sEMG); at the same time, all components of the forces applied to the robot have also been measured using Robotiq force sensors (FT300 sensor). System identification (SI) is performed to relate the amount of force in the UR5 to the level of muscle activity in the upper-arm through model. This model has been identified through the data obtained from four healthy subjects, and has been tested and verified with data from a fifth subject. In order to visualize the robot intervention and its efficacy, muscle activities have also been recorded while the subjects perform the task with no robot assistance. The data from this test setting have shown a good agreement in terms of signal profile which suggests robot has not introduced any complications in terms of force or stiffness to the subjects. This preliminary study provides an insight for data driven intervention procedure while robots are used in facilitating the muscle recruitment to complete the desired rehabilitation task, as some patients may not complete the task properly due to muscle weakness in a certain direction and location.	inference;muscle weakness;patients;robot;surface electromyography;system identification;timing closure;universal precautions;sensor (device)	AmirHossein MajidRad;Visharath Adhikari;Yimesker Yihun	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512629	simulation;task analysis;computer vision;robot;rehabilitation;artificial intelligence;system identification;psychological intervention;motor unit recruitment;computer science;muscle weakness;electromyography	Robotics	12.974432440026192	-83.84406203386739	144589

In this work, we focus on feature selection, more precisely on optimal electrode selection and weighting, as an efficient tool to improve the BCI classification procedure. The proposed framework closely integrates spatial feature selection and weighting within the classification task itself. Spatial weights are considered as hyper-parameters to be learned by a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The resulting spatially weighted SVM (sw-SVM) is then designed to maximize the margin between classes whilst minimizing the generalization error.

However, there is no study confirming the physiological role of diastolic pressure of each chakras essential oil. Hence, the aim of this paper is to analyze the effect of the heart chakras essential oil blends for the subjects being middle-aged females with a lot of pressure. Here, the experimental method includes massage and direct sniffing. There are 30 examinees, including females who are above 30 years old and the pressure value is above 50. The research will observe examinees' heart rate variability and the physiological changes (observing the relaxation effect) in the body by the use of heart chakra. By measuring the heart rate variability, the physiological changes in the body before and after the aromatherapy are analyzed. Through the GM(0,N) in the grey system theory, the results are obtained that the heart chakras essential oil not only can get the best pressure-improvement result, but also can improve the overall activity of the autonomic nervous system. Hence, the result can be also provided as a reference in the use of the beauty aromatherapy.	autonomic computing;chakra;experiment;heart rate variability;linear programming relaxation;mcgurk effect;packet analyzer;systems theory	Ya-Ting Lee;Chii-Fang Hwang;Mei-Hui Chen;Ju-Zhen Luo;Hsin-I Chen	2013	Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration	10.1109/SII.2013.6776633	alternative medicine;medicine;biological engineering;surgery	SE	15.410929974953124	-83.50554371633825	144700

Recognition of the active local RATs allows the cognitive terminal to make informed decisions on which wireless technology to camp, and to adapt its transmission to the wireless environment. To this end, supervised classification of signals obtained from wide band spectrum power measurements with low temporal resolution is carried out. As a first step, generic features are extracted from the power spectrum measurements. Then several supervised classification algorithms, namely the support vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and C4.5 are tested. The effects of reducing the number of features on classification accuracy is also tested through feature selection methods. Finally, the impact of the signal duration on classification accuracy is investigated. The obtained results demonstrate that the tested supervised classification algorithms, combined with simple feature extraction and selection methods, are good candidates for RAT recognition from low temporal resolution spectrum power measurements.

When a large proportion of the null hypotheses are false, as in the case of widespread effects such as cortical thinning throughout much of the brain, adaptive FDR methods can surprisingly reject more null hypotheses than not accounting for multiple testing at all-i.e., using uncorrected p-values. A straightforward mathematical argument is presented to explain why this can occur with the q-value method of Storey and colleagues, and a simulation study shows that it can also occur, to a lesser extent, with a two-stage FDR procedure due to Benjamini and colleagues. We demonstrate the phenomenon with reference to a published data set documenting cortical thinning in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The paper concludes with recommendations for how to proceed when adaptive FDR results of this kind are encountered in practice.	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;chamaecyparis lawsoniana;documented;false discovery rate;hyperactive behavior;map;mathematics;mike lesser;neuroimaging;scientific publication;simulation;software documentation;thinning	Philip T.

The aim of this study was to test the possible relationship between anthropometric biomechanical parameters and disability during pregnancy. Anthropometric data were gathered using a stereophotogrammetric method described by Jensen. Data of interest were trunk mass and moments of inertia. The influences of total body mass, age and weight gain on level of disability were also investigated. The latter was quantified using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and painful regions were recorded on a pain drawing. Data were collected at mid- and late-pregnancy, 20 and 34 weeks respectively. Correlations between ODI and other parameters were assessed using the Spearman correlation for ranked data. This test was first performed on the whole mid-pregnancy and late pregnancy samples regardless of pain site. Correlation coefficients were then computed again for sub-samples stemming from the pain drawing data. A positive relationship was found between anthropometric parameters and ODI in the small mid-pregnancy sample, and a negative one has been found in the late pregnancy sample. More specific results appeared for the sub-samples with respect to pain regions. A strong relationship was observed between biomechanical parameters and ODI in the mid-pregnancy low back pain sub-sample. The upper back pain mid-pregnancy sub-sample showed no correlations and the sacroiliac pain group presented rather weak or no relationship with disability. Our findings suggest different etiologies for different kinds of back pain and underline the influence of anthropometric parameters in low back pain observed in pregnancy. Pregnant women suffering from low back pain should be advised to be aware of and control their weight gain as it may have a relationship to lower back pain symptoms. Samples studied here were rather small and further investigation is required to confirm these findings.	anthropometry	Julien A. Leboucher;Antonio Pinti;Geneviève A.

In this paper, we study disordered voices of people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we demonstrate that a simple logarithmic transformation of these dysphonia measures can significantly enhance their potential for identifying subtle changes in PD symptoms. The superiority of the log-transformed measures is reflected in feature selection results using Bayesian Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) linear regression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this enhancement in the emerging application of automated characterization of PD symptom progression from voice signals, rated on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the gold standard clinical metric for PD. Using least squares regression, we show that UPDRS can be accurately predicted to within six points of the clinicians' observations.	algorithm;color gradient;feature selection;lasso;least squares;rating scale;signal processing;sparse matrix	Athanasios Tsanas;Max A.

METHODS Thirty-one subjects (15 DLB and 16 controls) underwent (123)I-5IA-85380 and perfusion ((99m)Tc-exametazime) SPECT scanning. Patient scans were compared to scans of control subjects on a voxel-by-voxel basis using SPM2.   RESULTS Compared to controls, significant reductions in relative (123)I-5IA-85380 uptake were identified in frontal, striatal, temporal and cingulate regions in DLB. Elevation of scaled (123)I-5IA-85380 uptake in occipital cortex was observed in DLB relative to controls, as well as being associated with DLB subjects with a recent history of visual hallucinations. Changes in (123)I-5IA-85380 SPECT in DLB were different from perfusion.   CONCLUSION Reductions in normalised (123)I-5IA-85380 uptake in DLB were distinct from their perfusion deficits. Significant increase in occipital lobe uptake was present in DLB, a change most pronounced in subjects with a recent history of visual hallucinations. The findings directly link cholinergic changes in occipital lobe to visual hallucinations in DLB.	acoustic lobing;bodies - cell components;ct scan;dementia;gyrus cinguli;hallucinations;lewy body disease;ligands;occipital lobe;photons;pyridines;scanning;subtype (attribute);tomography, emission-computed, single-photon;video-in video-out;voxel;tomography	John T.

1edba58c8c28f0978ed065785c16ca8abb80791c	rescsrf: algorithm to automatically extract cheyne–stokes respiration features from respiratory signals		Objective: Cheyne–Stokes respiration (CSR) related features are significantly associated with cardiac dysfunction. Scoring of these features is labor intensive and time-consuming. To automate the scoring process, an algorithm (ResCSRF) has been developed to extract these features from nocturnal measurement of respiratory signals. Methods: ResCSRF takes four signals (nasal flow, thorax, abdomen, and finger oxygen saturation) as input. It first detects CSR cycles and then calculates the respiratory features (cycle length, lung-to-periphery circulation time, and time to peak flow). It outputs nightly statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles) of these features. It was developed and blindly tested on a group of 49 chronic heart failure patients undergoing overnight in-home unattended respiratory polygraphy recordings. Results: The performance of ResCSRF was evaluated against manual expert scoring (ES) (consensus between two independent sleep scorers). In terms of percentage of CSR per recording, the mean difference [reproducibility coefficient (RPC)] between ResCSRF and ES was $-$0.5(6.4) and 0.5(8.1) for development and test set, respectively. The nightly statistics of CSR-related features output by ResCSRF showed high correlation with ES on the blind test set with the mean difference of less than 3 s and RPC of less than 7 s. Conclusions:  These results indicate that ResCSRF is capable of automating the scoring of CSR-related features and could potentially be implemented into a remote monitoring system to regularly monitor patients’ cardiac function.	bonjour sleep proxy;cell respiration;chest;chronic lymphocytic leukemia;coefficient;expert system;forty nine;heart diseases;heart failure;jaccard index;navier–stokes equations;oxygen saturation test result;patients;score;structure of parenchyma of lung;test set;algorithm;percentile;polygraphy	Faizan Javed;Henrik Fox;Jeffery Armitstead	2018	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2017.2712102	cheyne–stokes respiration;standard deviation;sleep apnea;computer science;cardiac function curve;algorithm;respiratory system;heart failure;percentile;test set	Visualization	16.28903091471074	-86.55997527267753	145794

For small, closely spaced muscles, such as the muscles in the forearm, the detected MES often contains contributions from more than one muscle, the contribution from each specific muscle being modified by the dispersive propagation through the volume conductor between the muscle and the detection points. In this paper, the measured raw MES signals are rotated by class-specific principal component matrices to spatially decorrelate the measured data prior to feature extraction. This ldquotunesrdquo the data to allow a pattern recognition classifier to better discriminate the test motions. This processing technique was used to significantly (p<0.01) reduce pattern recognition classification error for both intact limbed and transradial amputee subjects.	amputees;auditory perceptual disorders;classification;control system;dispersive partial differential equation;feature extraction;forearm;limb prosthesis;manufacturing execution system;motion;muscle;pattern recognition;power (psychology);preprocessor;principal component analysis;processing (action);projections and predictions;real-time transcription;signal peptides;software propagation;transformation matrix;upper extremity;usability testing;algorithm	Levi J.

In this study, we aimed to develop a more convenient system, namely, the impedance pulmonary function measurement system (IPFS), for overcoming the restrictions posed by the prevalent spirometric PFT. IPFS employs tetra polar electrodes that can measure pulmonary function using the subjects' hands alone. The impedance measured by IPFS extracts AC values of pulmonary impedance from DC values of body impedance in respiration. This system yields changes in the impedance of volume and flow. In order to verify IPFS, we compared the continuous waveforms obtained from the PFT module and developed IPFS using Pearson linear correlation coefficients (p < 0.01) for volume and flow. Further, we evaluated the potential application of IPFS for detecting pulmonary functions such as volume (FEV1/FVC Ratio) and flow (PEF), and compared the measured parameters between IPFS and spirometric PFT. Our results demonstrate that the measurements obtained using IPFS reflect pulmonary function parameters.	cns disorder;characteristic impedance;coefficient;interplanetary file system;patients;pefloxacin;pulmonary function tests;quantitative impedance;respiratory insufficiency;sensor;system of measurement;electrode	Myeongheon Sim;Minyong Kim;Incheol Jeong;Chansol Yoon;Hyungro Yoon	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090234	pulmonary function testing;intensive care medicine;medicine;pathology	Visualization	14.92897420958399	-85.15717251265956	145840

In fMRI, hypotheses about how context modulates distributed patterns of information processing are often tested by comparing functional connectivity between neural regions A and B as a function of task conditions X and Y, which is termed context-modulated functional connectivity (FC). There exist two exploratory statistical approaches to testing context-modulated FC: the beta-series method and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis methods. While these approaches are commonly used, their relative power for detecting context-modulated FC is unknown, especially with respect to real-world experimental parameters (e.g., number of stimulus repetitions, inter-trial-interval, stimulus duration). Here, we use simulations to compare power for detecting context-modulated FC between the standard PPI formulation (sPPI), generalized PPI formulation (gPPI), and beta series methods. Simulation results demonstrate that gPPI and beta series methods are generally more powerful than sPPI. Whether gPPI or beta series methods performed more powerfully depended on experiment parameters: block designs favor the gPPI, whereas the beta series method was more powerful for designs with more trial repetitions and it also retained more power under conditions of hemodynamic response function variability. On a real dataset of adolescent girls, the PPI methods appeared to have greater sensitivity in detecting task-modulated FC when using a block design and the beta series method appeared to have greater sensitivity when using an event-related design with many trial repetitions. Implications of these performance results are discussed.	computational neuroscience;epilepsy, generalized;frequency response;functional gastrointestinal disorders;hemodynamics;information processing;modulation;neuroscience discipline;perseveration;pixel density;proton pump inhibitors;resting state fmri;sensor;simulation;spatial variability	Josh M.

It has been demonstrated with advantages of low temperature over traditional continuous radiofrequency (CRF) lesions with higher amplitude and mono polar electrode to treat pain in clinics (frequency 500 KHz, Pulse duration 20 msec, Amplitude 45 V, Treatment 2 min). We compare the effects of different pulse waveforms and PRF parameters (Pulse duration 25 ms, Treatment duration 5 min, low amplitude of 2.5/1.25 V) with a miniature bi-polar electrode on Dorsal root ganglion (DRG). The pain relief effect due to PRF is evaluated by using Von Frey method for the pain threshold index based on behavior response to mechanical stimulus of various strengths. Experimental results of Von Frey Score show that the sinusoidal group has higher responses than the square wave one. Both fast and secondary expressed proteins of c-fos and pp38 are measured from spinal cord tissue sectioning slides to characterize the pain associated inflammatory responses and their responses due to PRF stimulation.	chronic pain;cold temperature;conditional random field;digital raster graphic;drug allergy;electric stimulation technique;exhibits as topic;fos gene;functional electrical stimulation;ganglia, spinal;horns;isaacs syndrome;ligation;maxima and minima;microglia;neuralgia;paw;polyradiculoneuropathy, chronic inflammatory demyelinating;primitive recursive function;pulse duration;pulsed radiofrequency treatment;pulsed electromagnetic field therapy;sacral nerve stimulation;sectioning technique;stimulation (motivation);structure of posterior gray horn of spinal cord;tooth root structure;waveform	W.

58947fa09c0990e9908eaa734d9d67a53941e2ce	systematic comparison between a wireless eeg system with dry electrodes and a wired eeg system with wet electrodes	dry electrodes;electrophysiology;p3b;resting state eeg;single trial classification;wet electrodes	Recent advances in dry electrodes technology have facilitated the recording of EEG in situations not previously possible, thanks to the relatively swift electrode preparation and avoidance of applying gel to subject's hair. However, to become a true alternative, these systems should be compared to state-of-the-art wet EEG systems commonly used in clinical or research applications. In our study, we conducted a systematic comparison of electrodes application speed, subject comfort, and most critically electrophysiological signal quality between the conventional and wired Biosemi EEG system using wet active electrodes and the compact and wireless F1 EEG system consisting of dry passive electrodes. All subjects (n = 27) participated in two recording sessions on separate days, one with the wet EEG system and one with the dry EEG system, in which the session order was counterbalanced across subjects. In each session, we recorded their EEG during separate rest periods with eyes open and closed followed by two versions of a serial visual presentation target detection task. Each task component allows for a neural measure reflecting different characteristics of the data, including spectral power in canonical low frequency bands, event-related potential components (specifically, the P3b), and single trial classification based on machine learning. The performance across the two systems was similar in most measures, including the P3b amplitude and topography, as well as low frequency (theta, alpha, and beta) spectral power at rest. Both EEG systems performed well above chance in the classification analysis, with a marginal advantage of the wet system over the dry. Critically, all aforementioned electrophysiological metrics showed significant positive correlations (r = 0.54-0.89) between the two EEG systems. This multitude of measures provides a comprehensive comparison that captures different aspects of EEG data, including temporal precision, frequency domain as well as multivariate patterns of activity. Taken together, our results indicate that the dry EEG system used in this experiment can effectively record electrophysiological measures commonly used across the research and clinical contexts with comparable quality to the conventional wet EEG system.	ablepharon;bands;electroencephalography;eye;frequency band;machine learning;marginal model;swift (programming language);topography;version;alpha-mannosidosis;electrode	Julia W.

Thirteen individuals with knee injuries participated in the study. Among them, 8 individuals participated in 18 sessions of pivoting offaxis intensity-adjustable neuromuscular control training (POINT) (3 sessions/week for 6 weeks including 3 evaluation sessions) to improve offaxis neuromuscular control, specifically dynamic lower limb stability in pivoting. 5 individuals served as controls who only participated in the three evaluations. Following POINT patients in the training group reduced pivoting instability (p=0.024), while the control group did not (p=0.118). Individuals in the training group were able to hop farther in a single leg hop for distance task, take shorter in 12m hop time for time task, and reported reduced knee pain. The results suggest that subject-specific POINT utilizing the novel robotic elliptical trainer can be implemented as a rehabilitation protocol for patients with knee injuries to improve their lower limb functions and reduce knee symptoms.	apache axis;axis vertebra;evaluation;instability;knee injuries;neuromuscular manifestations;pain;patients;robot	Song Joo Lee;Yupeng Ren;Francois Geiger;Alison H.

In newborns and infants, however, conflicting results have appeared in the literature concerning the typical response, and there is little information on brain metabolism and functional activation. Measurement of all hemodynamic components and oxygen metabolism is critical for understanding neurovascular coupling in the developing brain. To this end, we combined multiple near infrared spectroscopy techniques to measure oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations, cerebral blood volume (CBV), and relative cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the somatosensory cortex of 6 preterm neonates during passive tactile stimulation of the hand. By combining these measures we estimated relative changes in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (rCMRO2). CBF starts increasing immediately after stimulus onset, and returns to baseline before blood volume. This is consistent with the model of pre-capillary arteriole active dilation driving the CBF response, with a subsequent CBV increase influenced by capillaries and veins dilating passively to accommodate the extra blood. rCMRO2 estimated using the steady-state formulation shows a biphasic pattern: an increase immediately after stimulus onset, followed by a post-stimulus undershoot due to blood flow returning faster to baseline than oxygenation. However, assuming a longer mean transit time from the arterial to the venous compartment, due to the immature vascular system of premature infants, reduces the post-stimulus undershoot and increases the flow/consumption ratio to values closer to adult values reported in the literature. We are the first to report changes in local rCBF and rCMRO2 during functional activation in preterm infants. The ability to measure these variables in addition to hemoglobin concentration changes is critical for understanding neurovascular coupling in the developing brain, and for using this coupling as a reliable functional imaging marker in neonates.	anatomical compartments;baseline (configuration management);blood vessel;blood capillaries;cns disorder;cell respiration;cerebral blood volume;cerebrovascular circulation;cognition;dilate procedure;dilation (morphology);ergodic theory;frequency response;functional imaging;functional response;hemodynamics;infant, newborn;infant, premature;multi-compartment model;neurovascular coupling;onset (audio);oxygen consumption;pathological dilatation;population parameter;preterm infant;sa node cell to atrial cardiac muscle cell communication by electrical coupling;somatosensory cortex;spectroscopy, near-infrared;steady state;structure of arteriole;veins;oxygen metabolic process;recurrent childhood brain stem glioma	Nadege Roche-Labarbe;Angela Fenoglio;Harsha Radhakrishnan;Marcia Kocienski-Filip;Stefan A.

The signals were initially segmented into two parts (Non-Fatigue and Transition-to-Fatigue) to enable the evolutionary process. A novel feature was evolved by selecting then using a combination of the eleven sEMG muscle fatigue features and six mathematical operators. The evolutionary program used the DB index in its fitness function to derive the best feature that best separate the two segments (Non-Fatigue and Transition-to-Fatigue), for both Maximum Dynamic Strength (MDS) percentage of 40 and 70 MDS.

Automatic classification of irregular heartbeats is therefore an important part of ECG analysis. We propose a tensor-based method for single- and multi-channel irregular heartbeat classification. The method tensorizes the ECG data matrix by segmenting each signal beat-by-beat and then stacking the result into a third-order tensor with dimensions channel × time × heartbeat. We use the multilinear singular value decomposition to model the obtained tensor. Next, we formulate the classification task as the computation of a Kronecker Product Equation. We apply our method on the INCART dataset, illustrating promising results.	artificial cardiac pacemaker;computation;dimensions;heart diseases;numerous;silo (dataset);singular value decomposition;stacking;sudden cardiac death	Martijn Bousse;Griet Goovaerts;Nico Vervliet;Otto Debals;Sabine Van Huffel;Lieven De Lathauwer	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036856	kronecker product;cardiac disorders;artificial intelligence;computer vision;tensor;multilinear map;computation;theoretical computer science;computer science;singular value decomposition;heartbeat;pattern recognition;communication channel	Vision	18.25165094045959	-90.37520923819586	146439

The Motor-Imagery based BCI (MI-BCI) efficiently decodes the brain signals from the imagination of movement but the performance is limited by the number of commands such as right and left hand motor imageries. However, other parameters of an actual voluntary movement, such as the direction of movement, speed and extent, are encoded in the brain signals. This paper investigates the EEG brain signals from directional changes in actual hand movement. The Wavelet-Common Spatial Pattern algorithm is proposed to extract discriminative features of the brain signals that carries the direction-related information. The experiment performed on two subjects yielded a mean classification accuracy of 87.85% in decoding two classes of the direction-related information.	algorithm;brain–computer interface;common spatial pattern;electroencephalography;peripheral;wavelet	Neethu Robinson;A.

WiiEMG is intended to assist with training and performance assessment of myoelectric control of upper arm prostheses. For this application, a player wears skin surface electrodes over myoelectric control sites. A real-time signal analysis system acquires amplified EMG signals and classifies the activity patterns associated with different motions. In addition, the amplitude of this pattern is used as a velocity signal, which is differentiated to give acceleration. Finally, a scaled version of this acceleration value is input as an analog voltage into a modified Wiimote™ in place of the normal accelerometer, and the Wiimote communicates the data to the console. To evaluate the system's performance, six able-bodied subjects were used to test the WiiEMG by playing the game Wii Tennis™ using myoelectric control. Results are reported that show how users develop improved EMG control after only a few brief trials. Improved muscle and EMG control has the potential to benefit myoelectric limb use as well as motor skills rehabilitation.	electromyography;real-time locating system;signal processing;unix signal;velocity (software development);wii	Harry Oppenheim;Robert S.

The study included both stable and unstable treatments. A known signal processing algorithm, Levenberg-Marquardt, and the newly developed SMART were utilized for the removal of disturbances not relevant for dialysis dose evaluation. Finally, the results were compared with the Kt/V values based on the blood samples. The new data processing algorithm, SMART, removes disturbances, helps estimate the online Kt/V with significant precision increase and without any time delay, and more effectively predicts the end Kt/V for the treatment than the known algorithms.	blood specimen;broadcast delay;cleaning (activity);control theory;extrapolation;hemodialysis;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;patients;smart;signal processing;unstable medical device problem	Ivo Fridolin;Deniss Karai;Sergei Kostin;Raimund Ubar	2013	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2012.2234458	intensive care medicine;medicine;remote patient monitoring;mathematics;biological engineering;extrapolation;surgery;statistics	Visualization	13.233510691892349	-86.00204131240699	146812

Understanding underlying brain network dysfunction can provide insight into their pathophysiology. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based functional connectivity contains high temporal information of brain network dynamics. We acquired EEG recordings in the resting state and during a series of emotion regulation tasks (ERT) from a sample of 20 subjects with anxiety disorders and 20 healthy controls. To generate EEG-based functional connectomes, we used the weighted phase lag index (WPLI), a phase based connectivity metric. Graph theory measures of clustering coefficient (CC) and characteristic path length (CPL) were computed to characterize properties of these complex functional networks. Results showed that in the theta band network integration measured using CPL increased as the cognitive load during the emotion regulation task increased, with a complementary trend in the CC. In summary, the EEG-based functional connectome is highly dynamic and task dependent, thus may serve as a promising non-invasive biomarker for diagnosis and treatment evaluation.	cpl;clustering coefficient;connectome;electroencephalography;graph theory;incident response team;resting state fmri	Mengqi Xing;Reza Tadayonnejad;Annmarie MacNamara;Olusola Ajilore;K.

It is a process that aims to select an optimal feature subset from the original set. Two significant advantages involved are: lowering the computational burden so as to speed up the learning procedure and removing redundant and irrelevant features so as to improve the classification performance. Therefore, feature selection is widely employed in the classification of EEG signals in practical brain-computer interface systems. In this paper, we present a novel statistical model to select the optimal feature subset based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure, and automatically select the optimal subject-specific time segment. The proposed method comprises four successive stages: a broad frequency band filtering and common spatial pattern enhancement as preprocessing, features extraction by autoregressive model and log-variance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence based optimal feature and time segment selection and linear discriminate analysis classification. More importantly, this paper provides a potential framework for combining other feature extraction models and classification algorithms with the proposed method for EEG signals classification. Experiments on single-trial EEG signals from two public competition datasets not only demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in selecting discriminative features and time segment, but also show that the proposed method yields relatively better classification results in comparison with other competitive methods.

53dd68f725cb4ffa8b5395d9c824fbd3ad1e023b	restoring proper task mechanics of the hand post-stroke by targeted assistance of hand muscles		Significant impairment in hand function is found prevalent among stroke survivors, but its effective restoration is challenging due to the complexity of the functional tasks of the hand. In this study, we proposed a novel approach to improve functionality of the hand post-stroke by providing ‘subject-specific’ patterns of targeted assistance to impaired musculotendon of the hand during functional task performance. Eleven chronic stroke survivors participated in the experiment in which a biomimetic device provided targeted assistance to the impaired hand musculotendons. The proposed subject-specific approach was found to restore proper mechanics of two functional tasks, hand open and palmar pinch, as quantified by the joint kinematics and fingertip force direction. The range of motion and joint coordination was improved for the hand open task, and the fingertip force was directed towards normal direction by the targeted assistance of impaired muscles. The assistance pattern was significantly different across subjects, indicating significant between-subject variability in the impairment characteristics that affect task performance. The proposed method could enable an effective ‘subject-specific’ training method that restores proper mechanics of functional hand tasks for stroke survivors.	biomimetic devices;biomimetics;cerebrovascular accident;circuit restoration;fingertip dosing unit;mechanics;muscle;normal (geometry);spatial variability;survivors;teaching method	Sang Wook Lee;Billy C.

Underdeveloped cardiovascular control due to an immature autonomic nervous system can lead to recurrent bradycardias that reduce blood flow and oxygen to critical organs, and result in long-term developmental disabilities or sudden death. In this study, we investigate the use of a novel point process framework to model heart rate dynamics in premature infants, including the full range of bradycardia severity. We find that the lognormal distribution accurately models the R-R interval time series, due to the long-tail nature of the distribution. We also find that the degree of bradycardia severity is correlated with distinct clustering features of the point-process indices in regions encompassing and adjacent to bradycardias. This underlying property in heart rate dynamics may provide valuable statistical information for quantifying the vulnerability of premature infants to develop bradycardia.	autonomic computing;autonomic nervous system;bradycardia;cns disorder;cluster analysis;developmental disabilities;infant, premature;long tail;organ;oxygen;point process;premature ventricular contractions;process modeling;qt interval feature (observable entity);recurrent neural network;sudden death;time series;statistical cluster	Alan H.

d31b4f8b88f5c939eb1c7267fda20f63de3cf6df	quantifying multiple sclerosis pathology in post mortem spinal cord using mri		Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common inflammatory, demyelinating and degenerative disease of the central nervous system. The majority of people with MS present with symptoms due to spinal cord damage, and in more advanced MS a clinical syndrome resembling that of progressive myelopathy is not uncommon. Significant efforts have been undertaken to predict MS-related disability based on short-term observations, for example, the spinal cord cross-sectional area measured using MRI. The histo-pathological correlates of spinal cord MRI changes in MS are incompletely understood, however a surge of interest in tissue microstructure has recently led to new approaches to improve the precision with which MRI indices relate to underlying tissue features, such as myelin content, neurite density and orientation, among others. Quantitative MRI techniques including T1 and T2, magnetisation transfer (MT) and a number of diffusion-derived indices have all been successfully applied to post mortem MS spinal cord. Combining advanced quantification of histological features with quantitative - particularly diffusion-based - MRI techniques provide a new platform for high-quality MR/pathology data generation. To more accurately quantify grey matter pathology in the MS spinal cord, a key driver of physical disability in advanced MS, remains an important challenge of microstructural imaging.	abnormal degeneration;cns disorder;cross-sectional data;gray matter;multiple sclerosis;myelin;progressive scan;quantitation;spinal cord diseases;spinal cord neoplasms;degenerative disorder	Klaus Schmierer;S A Vekovshinina;Natalia Petrova;D Carassiti;David L Thomas;Marc E.

Neuroimaging methods, in particular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have helped reveal alterations in the brain structure, metabolism, and function of patients and in groups at risk of developing AD, yet the nature of these alterations is poorly understood. Neuroimaging in mice is attractive for investigating mechanisms underlying functional and structural changes associated with AD pathology. Several preclinical murine models of AD have been generated based on transgenic insertion of human mutated APP genes. Depending on the specific mutations, mouse strains express different aspects of amyloid pathology, e.g. intracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates, parenchymal plaques, or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. We have applied multi-parametric MRI in three transgenic mouse lines to compare changes in brain function with resting-state fMRI and structure with diffusion tensor imaging and high resolution anatomical imaging. E22ΔAβ developing intracellular Aβ aggregates did not present functional or structural alterations compared to their wild-type littermates. PSAPP mice displaying parenchymal amyloid plaques displayed mild functional changes within the supplementary and barrel field cortices, and increased isocortical volume relative to controls. Extensive reduction in functional connectivity in the sensory-motor cortices and within the default mode network, as well as local volume increase in the midbrain relative to wild-type have been observed in ArcAβ mice bearing intracellular Aβ aggregates as well as parenchymal and vascular amyloid deposits. Patterns of functional and structural changes appear to be strain-specific and not directly related to amyloid deposition.	app gene;alzheimer's disease;amyloidosis;aortic diseases;brain;cerebral amyloid angiopathy;cerebral infarction;clinical act of insertion;default;diffusion tensor imaging;insertion mutation;magnetic resonance imaging;mice, transgenic;midbrain structure;neurodegenerative disorders;neuroimaging;numerous;patients;physical vapor deposition;plaque, amyloid;rest;resting state fmri;senile plaques;sensorimotor cortex	Joanes Grandjean;Rebecca Derungs;Luka Kulic;Tobias Welt;R.

Using transthoracic impedance and its first derivative, we attempted to determine if indexes computed on these waveforms could detect a positive outcome to a 70 degrees -45min HUTT with reliable sensitivity and specificity. The methods were evaluated retrospectively in a group of 70 patients and validated prospectively in a group of 59 patients. The best detector obtained used a neural network. It compares very favorably with published results for other syncope detectors.		D. Schang;E. Bellard;G. Plantier;J. M. Dupuis;J. Victor;G.

Higher patency rates and thrombosis rates are a concern to nephrology nurses and patients. These complications are complex events, including inflow stenosis, outflow stenosis, and coexistence of both. Therefore, a biophysical experimental model is employed to mimic the various combinations of stenoses and dialysis circulation circuits on a virtual adult hand. Considering the suggested signal preprocessing specifications, auscultation method and frequency analysis technique are used to extract the key frequency components from sufficient big spectral data. Key frequency components, depending on the degree of stenosis (DOS) (positive correlation), are validated using multiple regression models with multiple explanatory variables and response variables. A new machine learning method, radial-based colour relation analysis, is employed to identify the level of DOS at the inflow and outflow sites. In contrast to the multiple linear regression and traditional machine learning method, the experimental results indicated that the proposed screening model had higher accuracy (hit rate), true-positive rate, and true-negative rate in clinical indication.

Further, we considered a motion discrimination method using an EEG that was measured when a healthy subject executed an upper-arm bending and stretching exercise. As a result, we used the10 -- 14 Hz band overall intensity of an EEG measured at the right parietal region as a feature of motion discrimination and proposed a method that employed logistic regression to obtain the likelihood function of the discriminated motion.

be4e5e6f0bfc36a6213096bd8e02773d38c21594	flexible monitoring system for automated detection of bacterial growth in a commercial specimen processing platform		Diagnosing the presence of bacteria in a biological sample is a task to accomplish as early as possible, since bacterial infections still represent a serious threat to human health. In the market, there are commercial systems carrying out pre-analytical tests on biological specimens. An example is provided by the WASPLab, by COPAN Italia S.p.A., which monitors bacterial growth on Petri dishes that contain the samples, by taking and processing images of one dish at a time in a completely automated way. In this paper, we propose a newly monitoring sensor system for all the Petri dishes at the same time for the detection of bacterial growth with the aim of integrating it directly in the WASPLab. It could permit to obtain quantitative information about bacterial activity in real time directly inside the incubator, offering a more rapid and complete diagnosis response and avoiding the movement of the samples. In addition, the user can set measurement parameters according to his/her needs. This allows the system reaching a great level of flexibility. We tested our solution in two ways. First, we analyzed the behavior of the proposed solution comparing the output signals with the data obtained using an impedance analyzer (HP4194A) as reference. We obtained an average deviation equal to 0.768 Ω in magnitude and 0.059 ° in phase angle. Second, we carried out a 24-hour test to monitor the activity of Staphylococcus Aureus AT C 6538 in a climate chamber. We found that our system succeeded in observing bacterial growth, with an early detection time of 4 hours. Research is undergoing to integrate the proposed system in the WASPLab.	24-hour clock;antenna analyzer;biological specimen;ccir system a;characteristic impedance;embedded system;environmental chamber;image processing;in-phase and quadrature components;petri net;real-time clock;requirement;threat (computer)	Paolo Bellitti;Michele Bona;Michela Borghetti;Emilio Sardini;Mauro Serpelloni	2017	2017 IEEE 3rd International Forum on Research and Technologies for Society and Industry (RTSI)	10.1109/RTSI.2017.8065950	bacterial growth;spectrum analyzer;real-time computing;petri dish;absolute deviation;simulation;biological specimen;incubator;focused impedance measurement;engineering	Robotics	10.921125607329135	-88.50115667183002	147812

Among all techniques, data produced by functional magnetic resonance is encoded as sequences of 3D images of thousands of voxels. The main investigation performed on this data, termed brain mapping, aims at producing functional maps of the brain. Brain mapping aims at the detection of the portion of voxels concerned with specific perceptual or cognitive brain activities. This challenge can be shaped as a problem of feature selection. Excessive features-to-instances ratio characterizing this data is a major issue for the computation of statistically robust maps. We propose a solution based on a Random Subspace Method that extends the reference approach (Search Light) adopted by the neuroscientific community. A comparison of the two methods is supported by the results of an empirical evaluation.	brain mapping;computation;electroencephalography;feature selection;imaging technology;map;random subspace method;real-time clock;resonance;voxel	Diego Sona;Paolo Avesani	2010	2010 20th International Conference on Pattern Recognition	10.1109/ICPR.2010.631	random subspace method;stereoscopy;computer vision;visualization;functional neuroimaging;sensitivity;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;brain mapping;feature selection;neuroimaging;robustness	Robotics	21.688038194342496	-87.37955650382112	147963

775911672f01cf9e316465b40cf510f86c921f9d	detection of epilepsy with electroencephalogram using rule-based classifiers	ensemble learning approach;random forest;eeg;svm;seizure detection	Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, characterized by recurrent seizures. Electroencephalogram (EEG), a useful measure for analysing the brain's electrical activity, has been widely used for the detection of epileptic seizures. Most existing classification techniques are primarily aimed at increasing detection accuracy, while the interpretability of the methods have received relatively little attention. In this work, we concentrate on the epileptic classification of EEG signals with interpretability. We propose an epilepsy detection framework, followed by a comparative study under this framework to evaluate the accuracy and interpretability of four rule-based classifiers, namely, the decision tree algorithm C4.5, the random forest algorithm (RF), the support vector machine (SVM)-based decision tree algorithm (SVM+C4.5), and the SVM-based RF algorithm (SVM+RF), in two-group, three-group, and–the most challenging of all–five-group classifications of EEG signals. The experimental results showed that RF outperformed the other three rule-based classifiers, achieving average accuracies of 0.9896, 0.9600, and 0.8260 for the two-group, three-group, and five-group seizure classifications respectively, and exhibiting higher interpretability.	electroencephalography;logic programming	Guanjin Wang;Zhaohong Deng;Kup-Sze Choi	2017	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2016.09.080	random forest;support vector machine;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining	ML	16.360024357815114	-90.04066346927789	148119

Methods: A neural mass model (NMM) was used to simulate EEG data and test the performance of the permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC) in tracking the dynamical changes of signals against different white noise levels. Then, the PLZC was applied to real EEG data to investigate whether it was able to detect the different states of anesthesia and epileptic seizures. The Z-score model, two-way ANOVA and t-test were used to estimate the significance of the results. Results: PLZC could successfully track the dynamical changes of EEG series generated by the NMM. Compared with the other four classical LZC based methods, the PLZC was most robust against white noise. pileptic seizure In real data analysis, PLZC was effective in differentiating the different anesthesia states and sensitive in detecting epileptic seizures. Conclusions: PLZC is simple, robust and effective for quantifying the dynamical changes of EEG. Significance: We suggest that PLZC is a potential nonlinear method for characterizing the changes in EEG signal. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In vivo ~-amyloid imaging using [11 C) Pittsburgh compound S (PiB) positron emission tomography has made it possible to analyze the relationship between ~-amyloid deposition and different pathological markers involved in AD. PiB allows us to stratify the population between subjects which are likely to have prodromal AD, and those who don't. The comparison of the cortical thickness in these different groups is important to better understanding and detect the first symptoms of the disease which may lead to an earlier therapeutic care to reduce neurone loss. Several techniques have been developed to compare the cortical volume and/or thickness between AD and HC groups. However due to the noise introduced by the cortical thickness estimation and by the registration, these methods do not allow to unveil any major different when comparing prodromal AD groups with healthy control subjects group. To improve our understanding of where initial Alzheimer neurodegeneration occurs in the cortex we have developed a surface based technique, and have applied it to the discrimination between PIS-positive and PiS-negative HCs. We first identify the regions where AD patients show high cortical atrophy by using an AD/PiBHC vertex-wise T-test. In each of these discriminating regions, comparison between PiB+ HC, PiBHC and AD are performed. We found some significant differences between the two HC groups in the hippocampus and in the temporal lobe for both hemisphere and in the precuneus and occipital regions only for the left hemisphere.	acoustic lobing;povm;pebibyte;physical vapor deposition;thickness (graph theory);tomography;video-in video-out	Vincent Doré;Pierrick Bourgeat;Jurgen Fripp;Oscar Acosta;Gaël Chételat;Cassandra Szoeke;Kathryn A.

In this paper, we propose an IMU-based wearable sensing system for recognizing swimming strokes and motion analysis, focusing on lower-limb movements. The system measures 12 channels of posture signals from the shank, the thigh, and the foot of two legs. Three competitive swimmers were recruited in experiments. With a stroke-dependent quadratic discriminant analysis classifier and selected time-domain features, the proposed system can achieve a satisfactory classification accuracy of 98.63%±1.9%, 99.04%±0.91%, 99.10%±1.43%, 97.24%±1.71% for butterfly stroke, breaststroke, backstroke, front crawl, respectively. Besides, we carry out kinematics analysis of breaststroke. Preliminary results show that the IMU-based sensing system can be used for both swimming stroke classification and motion analysis.	bbn butterfly;brainfuck;competitive programming;experiment;linear discriminant analysis;poor posture;quadratic classifier;sensor;wearable computer	Zhendong Zhang;Dongfang Xu;Zhihao Zhou;Jingeng Mai;Zhongkai He;Qining Wang	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Cyborg and Bionic Systems (CBS)	10.1109/CBS.2017.8266113	motion analysis;kinematics;computer vision;inertial measurement unit;accelerometer;quadratic classifier;computer science;stroke;artificial intelligence;breaststroke;front crawl	Robotics	12.83756264768621	-91.3144440915391	149119

In this paper, the continuous long-term EEGs of three Wistar rats with spontaneous temporal lobe seizure were analyzed. We proposed the development of an energy efficient real-time seizure detection method that employs a hierarchical architecture. The first stage was used to fast detect the seizure-like EEG segment, and a classifier was utilized in the second stage for final confirmation. Only when a suspected seizure segment is found, the second stage is activated. With 2-staged architecture, it saved about 99.4% computation energy in the experiment. Therefore, it is useful to improve the longevity of the closed-loop seizure control system. Three classifiers, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and support vector machine (SVM), were applied for comparison. From the experimental results, three classifiers yielded the comparable performances. However, considering of the trade-off between detection performances and power consumption, LDA which yielded the 100% detection rate, 0.22 FP/hr, and 1.69 s detection latency is suggested for a portable closed-loop seizure controller.	acoustic lobing;computation;control system;electroencephalography;linear discriminant analysis;online and offline;performance;quadratic classifier;real-time clock;spontaneous order;statistical classification;support vector machine;the 100	Yu-Lin Wang;Sheng-Fu Liang;Fu-Zen Shaw;Yu-Shin Huang;Yin-Lin Chen	2013	2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence, Cognitive Algorithms, Mind, and Brain (CCMB)	10.1109/CCMB.2013.6609162	speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	Embedded	13.630759359861468	-89.75327042412093	149319

When the surface data is obtained, a proposed feature extraction method is used to extract the surface feature of the object. The extracted features are then used as the inputs for the classifier. This research studies eighteen household objects which are requisite to our daily life. Six commonly used neural-network-based classifiers, namely one-against-all, weighted one-against-all, binary coded, parallel-structured, weighted parallel structured and tree-structured, are investigated. The performance for the six neural-network-based classifiers is evaluated based on recognition accuracy for individual object. Also, two traditional classifiers, namely k-nearest neighbor classifier and naive Bayes classifier, are employed for the comparison purposes. To evaluate robustness property of the classifiers, the original clean data is contaminated with Gaussian white noise. Experimental results show that the parallel-structured, tree-structured and the naive Bayes classifiers outperform the others under the noise-free data. The tree-structured classifier demonstrates the best robustness property under the noisy data.

However, few, if any, previous investigations have studied disease-altered nonlinear dynamics in the spatiotemporal VCG signals. Most previous nonlinear dynamic methods considered the time-delay reconstructed state space from a single ECG trace. This paper presents a novel multiscale recurrence approach to not only explore VCG recurrence dynamics but also resolve the issue of recurrence computation for the large-scale datasets. As opposed to the traditional single-scale recurrence analysis, we characterize and quantify the recurrence behaviours in multiple wavelet scales. In addition, wavelet dyadic subsampling enables the large-scale recurrence analysis, but it is used to be highly expensive for a long-term time series. The classification experiments show that multiscale recurrence analysis detects the myocardial infarctions from 3-lead VCG with an average sensitivity of 96.8% and specificity of 92.8%, which show superior performance (i.e., 5.6% improvements) to the single-scale recurrence analysis.	chroma subsampling;computation;dyadic transformation;experiment;myocardial infarction;nonlinear dynamics;nonlinear system;packet analyzer;recurrence quantification analysis;relevance;sensitivity and specificity;state space;time series;vectorcardiogram;wavelet	Yun Chen;Hui Yang	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610071	signal reconstruction;econometrics;speech recognition;time series;mathematics;statistics;wavelet transform	Visualization	20.247641776456756	-85.82495743956294	149595

Therefore, the N170 responses of EEG signals were analyzed to detect face stimuli in real time. We also proposed an analytical method for feature extraction of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with the bag of features scheme to overcome the general difficulty in setting of kernel parameters of SVM. The proposed method resulted in a constantly high accuracy in the face classification; the SVM classifier based on image pattern recognition in the time frequency domain efficiently enables easier setting of the non-linear kernel parameter. Further studies will be required to apply the proposed method for feature extraction to practical devices.	electroencephalography;face detection;feature extraction;lateral thinking;nonlinear system;pattern recognition;smoothing;support vector machine;time–frequency analysis	Koji Kashihara;Momoyo Ito;Minoru Fukumi	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083637	facial recognition system;face;support vector machine;computer vision;speech recognition;visualization;electroencephalography;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;wavelet transform	Robotics	15.466958800655052	-91.72783534423397	149703

A super wavelet is a linear combination of wavelets that itself can be treated as a wavelet. Since unvoiced sounds are high frequency and noise like, we use Daubechies' wavelet of order three to generate the super wavelet. The parameters of the wavelet for representation and classification of unvoiced sounds are generated using neural networks. Even though this paper addresses the problems of both signal representation and classification, emphasis is on classification problem, since it is natural to adaptively tune wavelets in conjunction with training the classifier in order to select the wavelet coefficients which contain the most information for discriminating between the classes. We demonstrate the applicability of this method for the representation and classification of unvoiced sounds with representative examples.	adaptive grammar;artificial neural network;coefficient;daubechies wavelet	Shubha Kadambe;Pramila Srinivasan;Brian A.

However, when oxygen delivery (DO2) decreases below """"a critical"""" value, the consecutive decline of VO2 reflects a critical restriction of DO2 resulting in the onset of tissue hypoxia. Reliable bedside detection of a significant VO2 decline requires continuous measurement of in- and exspiratory O2 concentrations with a metabolic monitor as well as a standardized online analysis of the data obtained. However, for this purpose no standardized procedure was available yet. Therefore, the DeltaCrit-System (DCS) has been developed enabling online detection of a significant VO2 decline indicating critical restriction of DO2. After a reference period with stable VO2 values the DCS tests whether a subsequently measured VO2 value is significantly lower than the mean baseline VO2. A significant VO2 decrease should indicate the onset of O2 supply dependency of VO2 due to a critical restriction of DO2. The DCS has been validated with nine different, artificially generated data sets and has been tested in one animal experiment. DCS has proven consistency and may therefore be considered a new tool allowing clinicians to recognize restrictions in DO2 at an early time, and to start early therapeutic interventions."""

Current methods of monitoring of cigarette smoking habits rely on various forms of self-report that are prone to errors and under reporting. This paper presents a first step in the development of a methodology for accurate and objective assessment of smoking using noninvasive wearable sensors (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker - PACT) by demonstrating feasibility of automatic recognition of smoke inhalations from signals arising from continuous monitoring of breathing and hand-to-mouth gestures by support vector machine classifiers. The performance of subject-dependent (individually calibrated) models was compared to performance of subject-independent (group) classification models. The models were trained and validated on a dataset collected from 20 subjects performing 12 different activities representative of everyday living (total duration 19.5 h or 21411 breath cycles). Precision and recall were used as the accuracy metrics. Group models obtained 87% and 80% of average precision and recall, respectively. Individual models resulted in 90% of average precision and recall, indicating a significant presence of individual traits in signal patterns. These results suggest the feasibility of monitoring cigarette smoking by means of a wearable and noninvasive sensor system in free living conditions.	artifact (error);behaviorial habits;cigarette smoking behavior;deny (action);eighty;heart rate variability;information retrieval;inspiration function;lung diseases;neoplasms;precision and recall;rejection sampling;smoke;support vector machine;trait;wearable computer;wearable technology;sensor (device)	Paulo Lopez-Meyer;Stephen T Tiffany;Yogendra Patil;Edward S.

After the description of the experimental device, the position problem is then formally considered, and the different methods used are briefly recalled. Finally, the results observed on a large set of trials are shown to highlight the behaviour of each selected method before concluding on the opportunity to use them to characterize some neuropathies.	ibm 7030 stretch;response time (technology)	Philippe Poignet;Michel Guglielmi;B.

a03b4b00566bdf6f2b8a109564de29c8f3000f2a	multiscale entropy analysis of the differential rr interval time series signal and its application in detecting congestive heart failure	cardiovascular time series;heart rate variability;multiscale entropy;sample entropy;congestive heart failure	Cardiovascular systems essentially have multiscale control mechanisms. Multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis permits the dynamic characterization of the cardiovascular time series for both short-term and long-term processes, and thus can be more illuminating. The traditional MSE analysis for heart rate variability (HRV) is performed on the original RR interval time series (named as MSE_RR). In this study, we proposed an MSE analysis for the differential RR interval time series signal, named as MSE_dRR. The motivation of using the differential RR interval time series signal is that this signal has a direct link with the inherent non-linear property of electrical rhythm of the heart. The effectiveness of the MSE_RR and MSE_dRR were tested and compared on the long-term MIT-Boston’s Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) 54 normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and 29 congestive heart failure (CHF) RR interval recordings, aiming to explore which one is better for distinguishing the CHF patients from the NSR subjects. Four RR interval length for analysis were used (N = 500, N = 1000, N = 2000 and N = 5000). The results showed that MSE_RR did not report significant differences between the NSR and CHF groups at several scales for each RR segment length type (Scales 7, 8 and 10 for N = 500, Scales 3 and 10 for N = 1000, Scales 2 and 3 for both N = 2000 and N = 5000). However, the new MSE_dRR gave significant separation for the two groups for all RR segment length types except N = 500 at Scales 9 and 10. The area under curve (AUC) values from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to further quantify the performances. The mean AUC of the new MSE_dRR from Scales 1–10 are 79.5%, 83.1%, 83.5% and 83.1% for N = 500, N = 1000, N = 2000 and N = 5000, respectively, whereas the mean AUC of MSE_RR are only 68.6%, 69.8%, 69.6% and 67.1%, respectively. The five-fold cross validation support vector machine (SVM) classifier reports the classification Accuracy (Acc) of MSE_RR as 73.5%, 75.9% and 74.6% for N = 1000, N = 2000 and N = 5000, respectively, while for the new MSE_dRR analysis accuracy was 85.5%, 85.6% and 85.6%. Different biosignal editing methods (direct deletion and interpolation) did not change the analytical results. In summary, this study demonstrated that compared with MSE_RR, MSE_dRR reports better statistical stability and better discrimination ability for the NSR and CHF groups.	bounding interval hierarchy;control system;cross-validation (statistics);cryptographic hash function;evert willem beth;heart rate variability;inline linking;interpolation;nonlinear system;performance;rapid refresh;receiver operating characteristic;round-robin scheduling;sensor;support vector machine;time series	Chengyu Liu;Rui Gao	2017	Entropy	10.3390/e19060251	heart rate variability;speech recognition;mathematics;algorithm;statistics;sample entropy	ML	16.57953201492348	-89.84330554431453	150325

The method is a generalization to bivariate prediction of the univariate approach based on nearest neighbor local linear approximation. Given the input and output series x and y, the relationship between a pattern of samples of x and a synchronous sample of y was approximated with a linear polynomial whose coefficients were estimated from an equation system including the nearest neighbor patterns in x and the corresponding samples in y. To avoid overfitting and waste of data, the training and testing stages of the prediction were designed through a specific out-of-sample cross validation. The robustness of the method was assessed on short realizations of simulated processes interacting either linearly or nonlinearly. The predictor was then used to characterize the dynamical interaction between the short-term spontaneous fluctuations of heart period (RR interval) and systolic arterial pressure (SAP) in healthy young subjects. In the supine position, the predictability of RR given SAP was low and influenced by nonlinear dynamics. After head-up tilt the predictability increased significantly and was mostly due to linear dynamics. These findings were related to the larger involvement of the baroreflex regulation from SAP to RR in upright than in supine humans, and to the simplification of the RR–SAP coupling occurring with the tilt-induced alteration of the neural regulation of the cardiovascular rhythms.	approximation algorithm;baroreflex;bivariate data;coefficient;cross reactions;cross-validation (statistics);entity handling - upright;generalization (psychology);heart rate variability;input/output;interaction;interdependence;kerrison predictor;large;level of detail;linear approximation;nonlinear system;overfitting;polynomial;rapid refresh;single linkage cluster analysis;spontaneous order;systolic pressure;time series;neural control	Luca Faes;Giandomenico Nollo	2006	Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing	10.1007/s11517-006-0043-3	heart rate variability;simulation;complex dynamics;nonlinear system;machine learning;time series;control theory;mathematics;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;cross-validation;statistics;linear approximation	ML	19.654212250354195	-84.0877523284233	150339

Classification algorithms to detect eye movement and the focus of foveal attention are proposed and evaluated on data from a matched dataset of VOG and 16-channel EEG. The algorithms utilise EOG artefacts and the brain's steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) response while viewing flickering stimulus. We demonstrate improved performance by extracting features from source signals estimated by Independent Component Analysis (ICA) rather than the traditional band-pass preprocessed EEG channels.

The preprocessed MMG signal was decomposed by 6-scale discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to acquire the coefficients of each scale. The coefficients of low frequency of scale 3, 4, 5 (A3, A4, A5) were used to reconstruct signals respectively. Frequency-domain features were extracted, and linear regression equations were established to make comparisons, which indicated that 15–62Hz frequency bands play a major role in that frequency spectrum shifting to lower frequencies. To learn more information, the MMG signal was processed by 6-layer wavelet packet decomposition (WPD), and the coefficients of each node were acquired. The coefficients of 6 nodes (ADAAAA6, DDAAAA6, AADAAA6, DADAAA6, ADDAAA6, DDDAAA6) were selected to reconstruct signals. The change of power of reconstructed signals during muscle fatigue were calculated and compared. The results suggested that power of MMG was decreasing and 31–54 Hz frequency band showed more sensitivity to muscle fatigue induced by static exertion.	coefficient;discrete wavelet transform;frequency band;network packet;spectral density;wavelet packet decomposition	Yue Zhang;Chun-Ming Xia;Hao Zhong;Xiao-Lin Gu;Tao Xie	2016	2016 9th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)	10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2016.7852849	speech recognition;telecommunications;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;wavelet packet decomposition;frequency domain		16.99115777049437	-91.05752667190687	150499

However with respect to the signal character, the developed approach is suitable for analysis of sleep and newborn EEG too. EEG signal can be analysed both in time and frequency domains. In time domain the basic descriptive quantities are general and central moments of lower orders, in frequency domain the most frequently used method is Fourier transform. For segmentation, combination of non-adaptive and adaptive segmentation has been used. The approach has been tested on real sleep EEG recording for which the classification has been known. The core of the developed system is the training set on which practically depends the quality of classification. The training set containing 319 segments classified into 10 classes has been used for classification of the 2hour sleep EEG recording. For classification, algorithm of nearest neighbour has been used. In the paper, the issues of development of the training set and experimental results are discussed.	adaptive filter;algorithm;electroencephalography;signal processing;sleep mode;test set;time series	Josef Rieger;Lenka Lhotská;Vladimir Krajca;Milos Matousek	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30547-7_34	multidimensional signal processing;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	AI	16.94832723123952	-90.57770083059545	150598
5504ec653f7fee05178f9c70636c585558769a05	investigation on inter-limb coordination and motion stability, intensity and complexity of trunk and limbs during hands-knees crawling in human adults	hands knees crawling;motion stability;motion complexity;accelerometer;inter limb coordination	This study aimed to investigate the inter-limb coordination pattern and the stability, intensity, and complexity of the trunk and limbs motions in human crawling under different speeds. Thirty healthy human adults finished hands-knees crawling trials on a treadmill at six different speeds (from 1 km/h to 2.5 km/h). A home-made multi-channel acquisition system consisting of five 3-axis accelerometers (ACC) and four force sensors was used for the data collection. Ipsilateral phase lag was used to represent inter-limb coordination pattern during crawling and power, harmonic ratio, and sample entropy of acceleration signals were adopted to depict the motion intensity, stability, and complexity of trunk and limbs respectively. Our results revealed some relationships between inter-limb coordination patterns and the stability and complexity of trunk movement. Trot-like crawling pattern was found to be the most stable and regular one at low speed in the view of trunk movement, and no-limb-pairing pattern showed the lowest stability and the greatest complexity at high speed. These relationships could be used to explain why subjects tended to avoid no-limb-pairing pattern when speed was over 2 km/h no matter which coordination type they used at low speeds. This also provided the evidence that the central nervous system (CNS) chose a stable inter-limb coordination pattern to keep the body safe and avoid tumbling. Although considerable progress has been made in the study of four-limb locomotion, much less is known about the reasons for the variety of inter-limb coordination.

Evolutionary alternatives to conventional dimension reduction methods exhibit the advantage of not requiring the entire recording sessions for operation. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an Evolutionary method that achieves performance through evaluation of several generations of possible solutions. This study investigates the feasibility of a 2 layer PSO structure for synchronous reduction of both electrode and task period dimensions using 4 motor imagery EEG data. The results indicate the potential of the proposed PSO paradigm for dimension reduction with insignificant losses in classification and the practical uses in subject transfer applications.	dimensionality reduction;electroencephalography;particle swarm optimization	Adham Atyabi;Martin H.

In this study, a new feature called amplitude difference was investigated using the random forest classifier. Evaluations conducted against the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database before and after adding the amplitude difference features obtained heartbeat classification accuracies of 98.51% and 98.68%, respectively. To validate the significance of the increased performance, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was extensively employed. By the absolute preponderance of plus ranks, we confirmed that applying an amplitude difference feature for heartbeat classification improves their performance.	basal ganglia diseases;bounding interval hierarchy;categorization;class;electrocardiography;random forest;receptors, monoiodotyrosine;signature;statistical classification	Juyoung Park;Seunghan Lee;Kyungtae Kang	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319561	speech recognition;computer science;pattern recognition;statistics	SE	16.277275381757935	-89.96239506035471	151249

The slow varying baseline drift at the voxel timeseries is initially estimated via empirical mode decomposition (EMD). This estimation is refined by two-stage optimization that estimates HRF and slow-varying noise iteratively. In addition, this paper proposes a novel method of finding voxel activation via projection of voxel timeseries on signal subspace constructed using the prior estimates of HRF. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on both synthetic and real fMRI data.

Various methods have been proposed for the development of inexpensive screening methods to detect SDB to reduce the need for costly nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG). In this paper, a description of the ultrasonic transducer design and characterization is presented, followed by the results of a full night sleep study. The findings show a significant difference in the temporal features extracted from the received ultrasonic waveform during apneic breathing, compared to the hyperventilation that follows. Therefore, the findings indicate the feasibility of developing an ultrasonic detection device for low cost diagnosis of SDB.	carpal tunnel syndrome;extraction;paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria;polysomnography;reactive airway disease;sdb (debugger);sleep apnea syndromes;sleep apnea, obstructive;sleep mode;transducer;ultrasonics (sound);video-in video-out;waveform	Mohammad A.

However, the interaction of BP and RR is bidirectional—RR also influences BP. Novel methods based on the concept of Granger causality were recently developed for separate analysis of feedback (baroreflex) and feedforward (mechanical) interactions between RR and BP. We aimed at assessing the proportion of the two causal directions of the interactions between RR and systolic BP (SBP) oscillations during various conditions, and at comparing causality measures from SBP to RR with baroreflex gain indexes. Arterial BP and ECG signals were noninvasively recorded in 16 young healthy volunteers during supine rest, mental arithmetics, and head-up tilt test, as well as during the combined administration of these stressors. The causal interactions between beat-to-beat RR and SBP signals were analyzed in time, frequency, and information domains. The baroreflex gain was assessed in the frequency domain using non-causal and causal measures of the transfer function from SBP to RR. We found a consistent increase in the baroreflex coupling strength from SBP to RR during head-up tilt, an insensitivity of the coupling strength along the non-baroreflex direction to both stressors, and no significant effect of mental arithmetics on the feedback coupling strength. It indicates that the proportion of causal interactions between SBP and RR significantly varies during different conditions. The increase in the coupling from SBP to RR with tilt was not accompanied by concomitant variations of the transfer function gain, suggesting that causality and gain analyses are complementary and assess different aspects of the baroreflex regulation of heart rate.	baroreflex;cardiac chronotropy;causality;control system;coupling constant;feedforward neural network;heart failure, systolic;heart rate variability;index;interaction;rapid refresh;round-robin scheduling;sbp;spatial variability;spontaneous order;systolic pressure;systolic array;transfer function	Michal Javorka;Barbora Czippelova;Zuzana Turianikova;Zuzana Lazarova;Ingrid Tonhajzerova;Luca Faes	2016	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-016-1492-y	control engineering;engineering;control theory;communication	HCI	18.409525836668845	-83.39122917093006	151525

Using conventional classification methods, every boundary between inspiratory and expiratory phases in successive respiratory sounds are detected manually prior to automatic classification. However, manual segmentation must be performed accurately and has therefore created significant obstacles in achieving automatic classification. In our proposed method, adequate boundaries are detected automatically in the classification process, based on the criterion of maximizing the difference between the acoustic likelihoods for a candidate with abnormal respiration and one with normal respiration. The proposed method achieved a classification rate of 83.9% between healthy subjects and patients. The reported rate was 1.3% greater than the rate achieved using the conventional method, which required manual phase-wise segmentation. Furthermore, the resulting rate was 2.2% higher than the rate obtained by the classification in which a lung sound sample was divided into phases of equal duration, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed method.	acoustic cryptanalysis;classification;expectation–maximization algorithm;expiration, function;inspiration function;lung diseases;patients;pulmonary emphysema;respiratory sounds;segmentation action;structure of parenchyma of lung;biologic segmentation	Takanori Okubo;Naoki Nakamura;Masaru Yamashita;Shoichi Matsunaga	2014	2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2014.6943531	speech recognition;medicine;pathology;communication	Visualization	17.530914304421948	-88.36198526443694	151760

95845b3014f9a313a4757ad3131d7c984bc7b3b4	relationship between deceleration areas in the second stage of labor and neonatal acidemia		Understanding the fetal heart rate (FHR) in the second stage of labor is important to recognize critical clinical outcomes. During this time, fetus is subject to head compression that activate baroreceptor reflexes that cause FHR deceleration. Large deceleration areas (DA: measured as duration by depth), have been associated to critical fetal outcomes. A preliminary study on 33 pregnant women reported a significant inverse correlation between DA in the last 60 minutes before delivery and umbilical pH at birth (fetal-distress measure when < 7.1). The aim of this study is to further characterize the relationship between DA in the last 60 minutes before delivery and pH at birth on a larger population. Thus, 433 FHR recordings from the “CTU-CHB Intrapartum Cardiotocography Database” of Physionet were used. Signals were classified as Cases (pH < 7.1) and Controls (pH > 7.1). Results confirmed that Cases have significantly higher DA than Controls (5.32 cm2 vs 1.44 cm2; P < 0.05). The inverse correlation between DA in the last 60 minutes before delivery and pH at birth, was weak but significant (ρ=-0.23, P<10−6). Thus, results confirm that critical fetal outcomes increase with increasing acidemia; however, such relationship may not be strictly linear. Future studies are focused on discrimination of fetal distress using DA.	coding tree unit;computers in human behavior;distress (novel);inventory	Angela Agostinelli;Flavio Palmieri;Alessandra Biagini;Agnese Sbrollini;Luca Burattini;Francesco Di Nardo;Sandro Fioretti;Laura Burattini	2016	2016 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)		medicine;anesthesia;diabetes mellitus;surgery	ML	16.432253083026175	-83.33902525630317	151870

To achieve this target, EMG signals received from normal, neuropathy, and myopathy subjects were recorded. To represent the signals adequately, matching feature parameters were obtained using Autoregressive (AR) and Cepstral analysis; executing principal component analysis was used to reduce the number of data obtained from the AR and Cepstral analysis. Following these data was used to train the ANN. Multilayer perceptron- (MLP) and radial basis function-based networks were used in the training sessions. According to our results, the combination of AR with 4-6-3 MLP topology yielded the area below the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.954303, which is considered to be within the limits of the acceptable range.	artificial neural network;autoregressive model;cepstrum;electromyography;memory-level parallelism;multilayer perceptron;principal component analysis;quad flat no-leads package;radial (radio);radial basis function;real-time clock;receiver operating characteristic;statistical classification	Sabri Koçer;Abdullah Erdal Tümer	2016	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-016-2383-8	speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	ML	16.240894101570753	-90.50092177479186	151891

The subjects were ten healthy college students (male). The experiment was divided into two periods. The first was the baseline period of 5 minutes during which the students merely remained seated. During the second period the students continued to remain seated but immersed their feet in a footbath for 11 minutes. At the same time the students were exposed to different odors. Lemon was used for the odor termed ‘pleasant’ and Hinoki was used for the odor termed ‘Japanese bath’. The results of our experiments showed that the use of both lemon and Hinoki odors significantly increased body temperature (36 degree). Using Graphical modeling we found a correlation between the use of different odors and subjects' impressions of the heat of the water in the footbath. Use of both the pleasant and Japanese bath odors showed a notable effect on the subjects' physiological and psychological performance. Especially at 36 degree Hinoki odor has a lot of relationship to physiological parameter, at 40degree lemon odor has a lot of relationship to physiological parameter. Based on the results of this experiment, we designed a preliminary graphical model of the effects of the different odors on the human body.	baseline (configuration management);experiment;graphical model;graphical user interface;while	Hironobu Kamimura;Noriaki Kaneki;Takayuki Koike;Hiroshi Y Yamada	2010	2010 International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications (CISIM)	10.1109/CISIM.2010.5643687	human body temperature;human body;computer science;artificial intelligence;human factors and ergonomics;machine learning;graphical model;metabolism	HCI	15.70007766744864	-82.68553664282118	151906

Amongst the various available techniques, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are well established in BCI research and have numerous successful applications. However, one of the drawbacks of conventional ANNs is the lack of an explicit input optimization mechanism. In addition, results of ANN learning are usually not easily interpretable. In this paper, we have applied an ANN-based method, the genetic neural mathematic method (GNMM), to two EEG channel selection and classification problems, aiming to address the issues above.   METHODS AND MATERIALS Pre-processing steps include: least-square (LS) approximation to determine the overall signal increase/decrease rate; locally weighted polynomial regression (Loess) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) to smooth the signals to determine the signal strength and variations. The GNMM method consists of three successive steps: (1) a genetic algorithm-based (GA-based) input selection process; (2) multi-layer perceptron-based (MLP-based) modelling; and (3) rule extraction based upon successful training. The fitness function used in the GA is the training error when an MLP is trained for a limited number of epochs. By averaging the appearance of a particular channel in the winning chromosome over several runs, we were able to minimize the error due to randomness and to obtain an energy distribution around the scalp. In the second step, a threshold was used to select a subset of channels to be fed into an MLP, which performed modelling with a large number of iterations, thus fine-tuning the input/output relationship. Upon successful training, neurons in the input layer are divided into four sub-spaces to produce if-then rules (step 3). Two datasets were used as case studies to perform three classifications. The first data were electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings that have been used in the BCI competition III. The data belonged to two categories, imagined movements of either a finger or the tongue. The data were recorded using an 8 × 8 ECoG platinum electrode grid at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz for a total of 378 trials. The second dataset consisted of a 32-channel, 256 Hz EEG recording of 960 trials where participants had to execute a left- or right-hand button-press in response to left- or right-pointing arrow stimuli. The data were used to classify correct/incorrect responses and left/right hand movements.   RESULTS For the first dataset, 100 samples were reserved for testing, and those remaining were for training and validation with a ratio of 90%:10% using K-fold cross-validation. Using the top 10 channels selected by GNMM, we achieved a classification accuracy of 0.80 ± 0.04 for the testing dataset, which compares favourably with results reported in the literature. For the second case, we performed multi-time-windows pre-processing over a single trial. By selecting 6 channels out of 32, we were able to achieve a classification accuracy of about 0.86 for the response correctness classification and 0.82 for the actual responding hand classification, respectively. Furthermore, 139 regression rules were identified after training was completed.   CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that GNMM is able to perform effective channel selections/reductions, which not only reduces the difficulty of data collection, but also greatly improves the generalization of the classifier. An important step that affects the effectiveness of GNMM is the pre-processing method. In this paper, we also highlight the importance of choosing an appropriate time window position.	approximation;artificial neural network;brain neoplasms;brain–computer interface;categories;channel (communications);choose (action);classification;communications media;correctness (computer science);cross reactions;cross-validation (statistics);data collection;diffusion weighted imaging;electrocorticography;electroencephalography;epoch (reference date);fast fourier transform;feature selection;fitness function;generalization (psychology);genetic algorithm;hertz (hz);input/output;interface device component;ion-selective electrodes;iteration;least squares;least-squares analysis;mathematical optimization;mathematics;memory-level parallelism;microsoft windows;movement;multilayer perceptron;numerous;one thousand;optimization mechanism;platinum;polynomial;preprocessor;randomness;rule (guideline);rule induction;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;silo (dataset);software release life cycle;subgroup	Jianhua Yang;Harsimrat Singh;Evor L.

This technique makes use of the redundancy between the different frequency subbands present in EEG segments of one channel. It uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and dynamic reference lists to compute and send the decorrelated subband coefficients. Set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) is also used as source coder. Experimental results showed that the proposed method can not only compress EEG channels in one dimension (1-D), but also detect seizure-like activity. A diagnostics-oriented performance assessment was performed to evaluate the performance of both the compression and detection capabilities of the proposed method. In this paper, we show that the algorithm can positively detect seizure sections in the recordings at bitrates down to 2 bits per sample.	algorithm;biologic preservation;coder device component;coefficient;color depth;compresses (device);compression;critical section;dictionary;discrete wavelet transform;electroencephalography phase synchronization;linked list;real-time clock;reference implementation;seizures;sensor;set partitioning in hierarchical trees;trees (plant)	Hoda Daou;Fabrice Labeau	2014	IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/JBHI.2013.2263198	speech recognition;decorrelation;electroencephalography;computer science;pattern recognition;neurophysiology;source code	Visualization	13.5494348708232	-89.19482614001818	152275
6c6f154630c20dfd3f19bac0a3189628dc6c1239	instance-based genre-specific music emotion prediction with an eeg setup		This paper explores a novel direction in music-induced emotion (music emotion) analysis - the effects of different genres on the prediction of music emotion. We aim to compare the performance of various classifiers in the prediction of the emotion induced by music, as well as to investigate the adaptation of advanced features (such as asymmetries) in improving classification accuracy. The study is supported by real-world experiments where 10 subjects listened to 20 musical pieces from 5 genres- classical, heavy metal, electronic dance music, pop and rap, during which electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected. A maximum 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 98.4% for subject-independent and 99.0% for subject-dependent data were obtained for the classification of short instances of each song. The emotion of popular music was shown to have been most accurately predicted, with a classification accuracy of 99.6%. Further examination was conducted to investigate the effect of music emotion on the relaxation of subjects while listening.	acclimatization;arousal;auditory perception;cross-validation (statistics);electroencephalography phase synchronization;experiment;lrpap1 gene;linear programming relaxation;metals, heavy;preparation;rap music;biologic segmentation;triangulation	Xiaoyu Liu;Aung Aung Phyo Wai;Shastikk Kumaran;Yukesh Ragavendar Saravanan;Zhiping Lin	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512630	musical;computer vision;speech recognition;artificial intelligence;feature extraction;electronic dance music;computer science;active listening;electroencephalography;popular music	SE	10.413946215752235	-93.94850419814604	152486

This test was made to know; 1) if LED-LCD panel might be used for the visual stimulation under scotopic vision, and 2) the minimum trials for ensemble average to get visually evoked potential (VEP). Green, Blue, and Red colors were tested in the darkroom. Electroencephalogram electrodes were used. The brightness of each color was degraded into 255 steps. All participants were asked to watch a circle with red, green, and blue color on the LED-LCD panel. As a result, VEP showed a well-known response pattern when the signals were ensemble averaged for 50 trials. The peak of VEP was not much changed after 25 trials. LED-LCD panel was simple and useful for the simple visual stimulation to test VEP.	backlight;color;diode;electroencephalography;liquid-crystal display;oled	Wuon-Shik Kim;Hye-Rim Oh;Hyoung-Min Choi;Ji Soo Hwang;Seong Nam Park;Hyun Kyoon Lim	2011	2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation	10.1109/IV.2011.110	psychology;computer vision;optics;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	13.451976806304483	-94.15286408204727	152547

A number of recent exploratory studies have evaluated the feasibility of detecting voice disorders by applying data mining tools to acoustic features extracted from speech recordings of patients. Selection of a minimal yet descriptive set of features is crucial for improving the classifier generalisation capability and interpretability of the classification model as well as for reducing the burden of data preprocessing. We propose a hybrid of feature selection and cross-validation procedures to lower the bias in the assessment of classifier accuracy.		Olcay Kursun;Ergun Gumus;Ahmet Sertbas;Oleg V.

An alternative method based on the probability density function of the zero-crossing intervals is shown to achieve 78% sensitivity to probable Alzheimer's disease and an estimated sensitivity to probable Vascular (or mixed) dementia of 35% (as suggested by clinical psychometric testing and EEG findings) with a specificity of 99.9%.

This approach gives a good prediction of the usefulness of the methods, as they would be used in practice. A total of 39 patients (30 probable Alzheimer's Disease, six Vascular Dementia and three mixed dementia) and 42 healthy volunteers were involved in the study.

Most existing methods choose key channels based on spatial information without optimization of time segment for classification. This paper proposes a novel subject-specific channel selection method based on a criterion called F score to realize the parameterization of both time segment and channel positions. The F score is a novel simplified measure derived from Fisher’s discriminant analysis for evaluating the discriminative power of a group of features. The experimental results on a standard dataset (BCI competition III dataset IVa) show that our method can efficiently reduce the number of channels (from 118 channels to 9 in average) without a decrease in mean classification accuracy. Compared to two state-of-the-art methods in channel selection, our method leads to comparable or even better classification results with less selected channels.	brain–computer interface;f1 score;linear discriminant analysis;mathematical optimization;selection (genetic algorithm)	Yuan Yang;Isabelle Bloch;Sylvain Chevallier;Joe Wiart	2015	Cognitive Computation	10.1007/s12559-015-9379-z	psychology;brain–computer interface;neuroscience;speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;pattern recognition;statistics	AI	15.608819702405494	-93.19358650950021	152968

The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the interactions and causality of different parts of a brain using EEG signals recorded during a performance subjects of verbal fluency tasks. Subjects who have Parkinson's Disease (PD) have difficulties with mental tasks, such as switching between one behavior task and another. The behavior tasks include motor and phonemic fluency. This method uses verbal generation skills, activating different Broca's areas of the Brodmann's areas (BA44 and BA45). Advanced signal processing techniques are used in order to determine the activated frequency bands in the granger causality for verbal fluency tasks. The graph learning technique for channel strength is used to characterize the complex graph of Granger causality. Also, the support vector machine (SVM) method is used for training a classifier between two subjects with PD and two healthy controls.

ff8969f8a5546b1acd6cfe9a6404d8be11f97fe9	is statistical learning affected by sleep apnoea?		It is thought that sleep is important for learning yet we know strikingly little about the relationship between sleep and a form of implicit learning known as statistical learning (SL). SL can be assessed using a distinct familiarisation phase in which participants are exposed to a stream of stimuli that contains statistical regularities but are not given any instruction to learn or any form of reinforcement. This is followed by a surprise test phase some time later where implicit learning of those statistical regularities is assessed. In the current study we investigated the relationship between sleep and SL across a period that included night time sleep with polysomnography (PSG) monitoring. Participants were 47 adults (mean age = 48.79 years, sd = 8.76 years) known to have impaired sleep due to obstructive sleep apnea. They were exposed to familiarisation in the evening prior to going to sleep and undertook the surprise test phase the following evening, approximately 24 hours later (mean overnight sleep time = 399.60 mins). Results revealed that, as a group, participants showed statistically significant SL despite the substantial delay between familiarisation and test phases. Although we found no relationship between individual differences in SL and clinical measures of sleep apnea severity, our findings revealed that SL is positively correlated with non rapid eye movement sleep (NREM).	machine learning;programmable sound generator;reinforcement learning;sl (complexity);sleep mode;universal quantification	Joanne Arciuli;Andrew Vakulin;Angela D'Rozario;Hannah Openshaw;David J.

def59ef74bb531c6a6c5b83c4e205eaaf2bd7be8	airexglove — a novel pneumatic exoskeleton glove for adaptive hand rehabilitation in post-stroke patients		Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide: post-stroke disabilities affect the upper and lower limbs, significantly undermining a subject's autonomy in the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Among post-stroke disabilities, one of the most impairing and widespread conditions is the clenched fist deformity: the subject experiences a permanent contraction of the hand, resulting in a closed hand rest pose. In this paper, the authors propose a novel light-weight inflatable soft exoskeleton device, called the AirExGlove, to deliver high-dosage, adaptive and gradual rehabilitation therapy to patients affected by clenched fist deformity. Our system is lightweight, low-cost, adaptable to any hand size and unobtrusive. The system has been extensively tested to assess the hand-opening range in which it can operate according to the severity of the patient condition, which is typically ranked on the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) scale. Experimental analysis demonstrates the suitability of the glove for patients affected by post-stroke muscle spasticity scoring up to 3 out of 4 in the MAS scale. Preliminary testing with clenched-fist patient confirmed a higher level of ergonomics of the system in comparison with rigid-linked robotic systems.	autonomy;experience;human factors and ergonomics;interaction;lopes (exoskeleton);mathematical model;robot;thickness (graph theory);unobtrusive javascript	Agostino Stilli;Arianna Cremoni;Matteo Bianchi;Alessandro Ridolfi;Filippo Gerii;Federica Vannetti;Helge A.

Methods: Sensors are based on a membrane containing immobilized glucose oxidase and catalase coupled to oxygen electrodes and a telemetry system, integrated as an implant. The devices remained implanted for up to 180 days, with signals transmitted every 2 min to external receivers. Results: The data include signal recordings from glucose clamps and spontaneous glucose excursions, matched, respectively, to reference blood glucose and finger-stick values. The sensor signals indicate dynamic tissue glucose, for which there is no independent standard, and a model describing the relationship between blood glucose and the signal is, therefore, included. The values of all model parameters have been estimated, including the permeability of adjacent tissues to glucose, and equated to conventional mass transfer parameters. As a group, the sensor calibration varied randomly at an average rate of −2.6%/week. Statistical correlation indicated strong association between the sensor signals and reference glucose values. Conclusion: Continuous long-term glucose monitoring in individuals with diabetes is feasible with this system. Significance: All therapies for diabetes are based on glucose control, and therefore, require glucose monitoring. This fully implanted long-term sensor/telemetry system may facilitate a new era of management of the disease.	blood glucose;body tissue;catalase;calibration;clamp (device);diabetes mellitus;glucose oxidase;hematological disease;implants;maxima and minima;oxygen;prototype;randomness;sensor;spontaneous order;subcutaneous tissue;telemetry;tissue membrane;disease transmission;electrode	Joseph Y.

For affordable cardiac health monitoring, it is required to ensure accurate cardiac condition detection from smartphone or wearable-extracted photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals through precise identification, and removal of signal corruption. Presence of noise particularly due to motion artifacts strongly impacts the outcome of analysis. We establish that denoising of PPG signal would pave ways for better clinical prediction than analyzing the signal in presence of noise. In this paper, we prove that analyzing on cleaned (denoised) PPG signal yields significant performance efficacy improvement while performing Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) identification. The proposed method is independent on the clinical analytics and CAD detection is considered to be a use case to justify our claim that physiological signal pre-processing, specifically denoising can substantially improve the overall performance effectiveness and clinical utility.	computer-aided design;noise reduction;norm (social);preprocessor;sensor;smartphone;wearable computer	Arijit Ukil;Soma Bandyoapdhyay;Chetanya Puri;Arpan Pal;Kayapanda M.

SSVEP interface consisted of 2-8 stimuli and 2 channel EEG amplifier was presented in this paper. The observed stimulus is recognized based on a canonical correlation calculated in 1 second window, ensuring high interface responsiveness. A threshold classifier with hysteresis (T-H) was proposed for recognition purposes. Obtained results suggest that T-H classifier enables to significantly increase classifier performance (resulting in accuracy of 76%, while maintaining average false positive detection rate of stimulus different then observed one between 2-13%, depending on stimulus frequency). It was shown that the parameters of T-H classifier, maximizing true positive rate, can be estimated by gradient-based search since the single maximum was observed. Moreover the preliminary results, performed on a test group (N=4), suggest that for T-H classifier exists a certain set of parameters for which the system accuracy is similar to accuracy obtained for user-trained classifier.	amplifier;brain–computer interface;electroencephalography;gradient;hysteresis;interface device component;responsiveness;sensitivity and specificity;statistical classification;recurrent childhood brain stem glioma	Piotr Kaczmarek;Pawel Salomon	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318556	text mining;medical research;speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining	Robotics	13.997698860272271	-92.67935786283097	153296

Also we have extracted the feature data of event related resynchronization/synchronization that could be used to identify different classes, and then use the support vector machine to establish classifiers, and have completed a higher accuracy rate of classification for multi-motor patterns. The result shows that the identification accuracy could basically satisfy the requirements of BCI systems under the circumstances that the subjects are better trained.	brain–computer interface;electroencephalography;entity–relationship model;feature data;feature recognition;frequency analysis;imaginary time;linear separability;pattern recognition;requirement;short-time fourier transform;support vector machine;time–frequency analysis	Baikun Wan;Yan'gang Liu;Dong Ming;Hongzhi Qi;Yizhong Wang;Rui Zhang	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Virtual Environments, Human-Computer Interfaces and Measurements Systems	10.1109/VECIMS.2009.5068903	brain–computer interface;support vector machine;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	Robotics	15.573073443620011	-91.82801824272191	153440
214f607adbd602196a0f7b3e3ffcaaff373622ee	sparse linear models applied to power quality disturbance classification		Power quality (PQ) analysis describes the non-pure electric signals that are usually present in electric power systems. The automatic recognition of PQ disturbances can be seen as a pattern recognition problem, in which different types of waveform distortion are differentiated based on their features. Similar to other quasi-stationary signals, PQ disturbances can be decomposed into time-frequency dependent components by using time-frequency or time-scale transforms, also known as dictionaries. These dictionaries are used in the feature extraction step in pattern recognition systems. Short-time Fourier, Wavelets and Stockwell transforms are some of the most common dictionaries used in the PQ community, aiming to achieve a better signal representation. To the best of our knowledge, previous works about PQ disturbance classification have been restricted to the use of one among several available dictionaries. Taking advantage of the theory behind sparse linear models (SLM), we introduce a sparse method for PQ representation, starting from overcomplete dictionaries. In particular, we apply Group Lasso. We employ different types of time-frequency (or time-scale) dictionaries to characterize the PQ disturbances, and evaluate their performance under different pattern recognition algorithms. We show that the SLM reduce the PQ classification complexity promoting sparse basis selection, and improving the classification accuracy.	electric power quality;linear model;sparse	Andrés F.

Our goal is to understand the behavior of the average experimental Instantaneous Frequencies (IF) for various frequency bands and their probability distributions, as well as to analyze the relationship between the frequency bands and their associated amplitudes. We conduct Hilbert analysis of the data following FIR band-pass filters over a broad-range of frequencies, including gamma, beta, alpha, and theta bands. We conduct our analysis using simulated and experimental data to establish solid mathematical and methodological foundations for the applied approach. This study builds on previous work by W. J. Freeman and collaborators with rabbit ECoG, to understand brain dynamics better by detecting synchronization-desynchronization transitions of neural activity across large cortical areas during higher cognitive functions and awareness experience.	analytic signal;anisotropic filtering;cognition;electrocorticography;finite impulse response;frequency band;hilbert transform;sensor;theta model	Jeffery Jonathan Davis;Robert Kozma	2017	2017 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)	10.1109/SSCI.2017.8285234	probability distribution;experimental data;mathematical analysis;finite impulse response;instantaneous phase;amplitude;mathematics;hilbert transform	Embedded	20.02909864895411	-84.72756654761243	153781

However, their relative weights are subjective and depend on the perceived benefit (or cost) associated to successful movement completion. A deeper knowledge on how this trade-off affects motor behavior may suggest ways to manipulate it in pathologies, like Parkinson's disease, in which the mechanisms underlying the selection of motor response are believed to be defective. In this preliminary study, we associate a monetary incentive to successful completion of a full-body reaching task and look at the determinants of motor performance. Our preliminary results suggest that motor performance (measured as the absolute average acceleration of hand movements) increases with movement amplitude/target elevation. Overall, performance also increases with the amount of monetary incentive and with the average reward experienced in previous trials. In addition, subjects with a greater sensitivity to incentive exhibit a low sensitivity to the average reward. In contrast, subjects with a negative sensitivity to incentive exhibit a smaller sensitivity to the average reward. These results suggest that motor performance has a complex relation with its perceived benefits, and this relation is probably subject-dependent.	modulation;money;movement;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;requirement;weight;benefit	Susanna Summa;Irene Tamagnone;Giulia Asprea;Clelia Capurro;Vittorio Sanguineti	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318344	psychology;simulation;developmental psychology;communication	Robotics	13.822596864547899	-81.13334752907001	153867
7d15f66d94dc4dd01235862193a8d73b070b5fc4	hand gesture recognition with inertial sensors		Dyscalculia is a learning difficulty hindering fundamental arithmetical competence. Children with dyscalculia often have difficulties in engaging in lessons taught with traditional teaching methods. In contrast, an educational game is an attractive alternative. Recent educational studies have shown that gestures could have a positive impact in learning. With the recent development of low cost wearable sensors, a gesture based educational game could be used as a tool to improve the learning outcomes particularly for children with dyscalculia. In this paper, two generic gesture recognition methods are proposed for developing an interactive educational game with wearable inertial sensors. The first method is a multilayered perceptron classifier based on the accelerometer and gyroscope readings to recognize hand gestures. As gyroscope is more power demanding and not all low-cost wearable device has a gyroscope, we have simplified the method using a nearest centroid classifier for classifying hand gestures with only the accelerometer readings. The method has been integrated into open-source educational games. Experimental results based on 5 subjects have demonstrated the accuracy of inertial sensor based hand gesture recognitions. The results have shown that both methods can recognize 15 different hand gestures with the accuracy over 93%.	class;classification;developmental arithmetic disorder;gesture recognition;gyroscope;immunocompetence;nearest centroid classifier;open-source software;perceptron;reading (activity);teaching method;wearable computer;wearable technology;accelerometers;sensor (device)	Krittameth Teachasrisaksakul;Liqun Wu;Guang-Zhong Yang;Benny P.

Our objective was to develop a robust generic algorithm for automatic detection of tonic-clonic seizures, based on surface electromyography (sEMG) signals suitable for a portable device. Twenty-two seizures were analyzed from 11 consecutive patients. Our method is based on a high-pass filtering with a cutoff at 150 Hz, and monitoring a count of zero crossings with a hysteresis of ±50 μV . Based on data from one sEMG electrode (on the deltoid muscle), we achieved a sensitivity of 100% with a mean detection latency of 13.7 s, while the rate of false detection was limited to 1 false alarm per 24 h. The overall performance of the presented generic algorithm is adequate for clinical implementation.	arabic numeral 0;chamaecyparis lawsoniana;cross reactions;false discovery rate;generic drugs;generic programming;google forms;hertz (hz);hysteresis;mobile device;myalgia;onset (audio);patients;seizures, clonic;structure of deltoid muscle;surface electromyography;tonic - clonic seizures;tonic-clonic epilepsy;zero-crossing rate;algorithm	Isa Conradsen;Sándor Beniczky;Karsten Hoppe;Peter Wolf;Helge B.

769b3e5f31a116fc94c5e524ed326cfe98849fa9	separating the effect of respiration on the heart rate variability using granger's causality and linear filtering	coupling;ecg;granger s causality;heart rate variability;armax filter;00 01;respiration;99 00	Heart rate variability (HRV) plays an important role in medicine and psychology because it is used to quantify imbalances of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). An important manifestations of the ANS on HRV is also directly related to respiration and it is called respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). This is a controlled phenomenon that leads to a synchronized coupling between respiration and instantaneous heart rate. Thus, the portion of HRV that is not related to respiration, and could potentially contain undiscovered diagnostic value, is overlapped and remains hidden in a standard HRV analysis. In such cases, a decoupling procedure would deliver a discriminated HRV analysis and possible new insights about the regulation of the cardiovascular system. In this work, we propose an algorithm based on Granger’s causality to measure coupling between respiration and HRV. In the case of significant coupling, we estimate and cancel the respiration driven HRV component using a linear filtering approach. We tested the method using synthetic signals and prove it to deliver a reliable coupling measurement in 96.3% of the cases and reconstruct respiration free signals with a median correlation coefficient of 0.992. Afterwards, we applied our method to signals recorded during paced respiration and during natural breathing. We demonstrated that coupling is dependent on respiratory frequency and that it maximizes at 0.3 Hz. Furthermore, the HRV parameters measured during paced respiration tend to level among subjects after decoupling. The intersubject variability of HRV parameter is also decreased after the separation process. During natural breathing, coupling is notoriously lower to non-existing and decoupling has little impact on HRV. We conclude that the method proposed here can be used to investigate the diagnostic value of respiration independent HRV parameters.	algorithm;autonomic computing;causality;coefficient;coupling (computer programming);heart rate variability;synthetic intelligence;trigonometric tables	Gustavo Lenis;Michael Kircher;Jesús Lázaro;Raquel Bailón;Eduardo Gil;Olaf Dössel	2017	Biomed.

Independent Component Analysis has been demonstrated to be very successful at signal-to-noise ratio enhancement and artefact suppression, but mainly on a large set of EEG channels (20 or more) and typically on signals from healthy young subjects. In this paper, we assess the artefact suppression performance of five different ICA methods (AMUSE, FASTICA, RUNICA, SOBI and THINICA) combined with four different spatial filters on reduced sets of EEG channels from elderly tremor patients. Results demonstrate that a suitable combination of ICA and spatial filtering can effectively suppress artefacts in clinical EEG signals, even on very small sets with only three EEG channels.	antibody to islet cells of pancreas measurement;electroencephalography;embedded system;embedding;fastica;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;morphologic artifacts;patients;signal-to-noise ratio;tremor;zero suppression	Matjaz Divjak;Damjan Zazula;Ales Holobar	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091097	independent component analysis;computer vision;electronic engineering;speech recognition;electroencephalography;computer science;machine learning;signal processing;communication;geriatrics;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial filter;laplace's equation	Visualization	20.53414935142177	-88.62568344037618	154628

One of the successful applications is neurobiological data analysis such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, many problems remain. In most cases, neurobiological data contain a lot of sensor noise, and the number of independent components is unknown. In this article, we discuss an approach to separate noise-contaminated data without knowing the number of independent components. A well-known two stage approach to ICA is to pre-process the data by principal component analysis (PCA), and then the necessary rotation matrix is estimated. Since PCA does not work well for noisy data, we implement a factor analysis model for pre-processing. In the new pre-processing, the number of sources and the amount of sensor noise are estimated. After the preprocessing, the rotation matrix is estimated using an ICA method. Through the experiments with MEG data, we show this approach is effective.	electroencephalography phase synchronization;experiment;factor analysis;image noise;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;magnetic resonance imaging;magnetoencephalography;megalanecephaly polymicrogyria-polydactyly hydrocephalus syndrome;numerous;preprocessor;principal component analysis;signal-to-noise ratio	Shiro Ikeda;Keisuke Toyama	2000	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/S0893-6080(00)00071-X	speech recognition;computer science;magnetic resonance imaging;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics;magnetoencephalography;principal component analysis	ML	21.57518036465618	-91.32466617075264	154639

It has been primarily attributed to the body's inflammatory response to submicron polyethylene particles worn from the hip implant, and it leads to bone loss and structural deterioration in the surrounding bone. It was previously demonstrated that radiographic texture analysis (RTA) has the ability to distinguish between osteolysis and normal cases at the time of clinical detection of the disease; however, that analysis did not take into account the changes in texture over time. The goal of this preliminary analysis, however, is to assess the ability of temporal radiographic texture analysis (tRTA) to distinguish between patients who develop osteolysis and normal cases. Two tRTA methods were used in the study: the RTA feature change from baseline at various follow-up intervals and the slope of the best-fit line to the RTA data series. These tRTA methods included Fourier-based and fractal-based features calculated from digitized images of 202 total hip replacement cases, including 70 that developed osteolysis. Results show that separation between the osteolysis and normal groups increased over time for the feature difference method, as the disease progressed, with area under the curve (AUC) values from receiver operating characteristic analysis of 0.65 to 0.72 at 15 years postsurgery. Separation for the slope method was also evident, with AUC values ranging from 0.65 to 0.76 for the task of distinguishing between osteolysis and normal cases. The results suggest that tRTA methods have the ability to measure changes in trabecular structure, and may be useful in the early detection of periprosthetic osteolysis.	area under curve;baseline (configuration management);bone tissue;curve fitting;early diagnosis;fractal;geo-imputation;hip joint implantable prostheses (device);hip replacement arthroplasty (procedure);hypothalamic area, lateral;lytic lesion;osteopenia;patients;polyethylene;radiography;receiver operating characteristic;torg-winchester syndrome;hip arthroplasty	Joel R.

The system monitors gait metrics and applies appropriate electrical stimulus to peripheral sensory nerves to change the gait metrics in the desired direction. Stimulation parameters are determined by the stimulation controller in real-time based on the measured gait metric, the target gait metric, and the relationship between the stimulus parameters and gait metric found in experiments in the walking cat. As a proof of concept, we controlled the spatial step symmetry as a gait metric by modulating stimulation amplitude during cat walking on a split-belt treadmill. The results demonstrated that the developed system could reliably maintain the spatial step symmetry of the cat in the vicinity of a set target value in real-time.	control system;control theory;d-pad;experiment;functional electrical stimulation;peripheral;real-time clock;real-time computing;sacral nerve stimulation	Hangue Park;Kyunggeune Oh;Boris I.

Although in vitro analytical and diagnostic tools have been the focus of such technologies, in vivo therapeutic and sensing applications have received significant attention in the past few years. Novel implantable drug delivery devices, which can precisely control key therapy parameters, have the potential to increase the efficacy of drug therapy [1]. This paper presents an implantable CMOS drug delivery SoC, in which a wireless controller/actuation circuitry and a drug delivery array are monolithically integrated. Compared with current technologies, the advantages of the proposed device include lower system cost, smaller device size and lower power consumption. This device can be implanted by minimally invasive surgery and is suitable for the localized diagnosis/therapy of cancers, or the immediate treatment of unpredictable heart attacks [2] by releasing drugs such as nonapeptide leuprolide acetate or nitroglycerin.

d1eddbbf48fe33977f273a974b39b80e8be139ad	fluctuation analysis of respiratory impedance waveform in asthmatic patients: effect of airway obstruction		Fluctuation analysis has great potential to contribute to pulmonary clinical science and practice. We evaluated the relationship between asthma and the respiratory impedance recurrence period density entropy (RPDEnZrs) and the variability (SDZrs). A non-invasive and simple protocol for assessing respiratory mechanics during spontaneous breathing was used in a group of 74 subjects with various levels of airway obstruction. Airway obstruction resulted in a reduction in the RPDEnZrs that was significantly correlated with both spirometric indices of airway obstruction (R = 0.48, p < 0.0001) and mean respiratory impedance (R = −0.83, p < 0.0001). These results suggest that the impedance pattern becomes less complex in asthmatic patients, which may explain the reduction in respiratory systems’ adaptability to daily life activities. Preliminary evaluations indicate that RPDEnZrs may contribute to the asthma diagnosis, presenting accuracies of 82 and 87 % in patients with moderate and severe airway obstruction, respectively. On the other hand, SDZrs increased with obstruction (p < 0.0001) and was inversely correlated with spirometric indices of obstruction (R = −0.42, p = 0.0003) and directly associated with mean impedance (R = 0.88, p < 0.0001). This analysis contributes to elucidate previous studies and identified respiratory changes in patients with moderate and severe obstruction with an adequate accuracy (85 and 87 %, respectively).	airway obstruction;asthma;characteristic impedance;evaluation;heart rate variability;patients;quantitative impedance;quantum fluctuation;recurrence period density entropy;respiratory insufficiency;respiratory mechanics;spontaneous order;waveform	Juliana Veiga;Agnaldo José Lopes;José M.

However, only stimulus-locked emotion recognition systems have been proposed by now. fNRIS signals of eight subjects at eight prefrontal locations have been recorded in response to three different classes of affect induction by emotional audio-visual stimuli and a neutral class. Our system evaluates short windows of five seconds length to continuously recognize affective states.

The proposed algorithm consists of five compression procedures and four reconstruction procedures. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, the algorithm was applied to all 48 recordings of MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, and the compress ratio (CR), percent root mean square difference (PRD), percent root mean square difference normalized (PRDN), rms, SNR, and quality score (QS) values were obtained. The result showed that the CR was 27.9:1 and the PRD was 2.93 on average for all 48 data instances with a 15% window size. In addition, the performance of the algorithm was compared to those of similar algorithms introduced recently by others. It was found that the proposed algorithm showed clearly superior performance in all 48 data instances at a compression ratio lower than 15:1, whereas it showed similar or slightly inferior PRD performance for a data compression ratio higher than 20:1. In light of the fact that the similarity with the original data becomes meaningless when the PRD is higher than 2, the proposed algorithm shows significantly better performance compared to the performance levels of other algorithms. Moreover, because the algorithm can compress and transmit data in real time, it can be served as an optimal biosignal data transmission method for limited bandwidth communication between e-health devices.	algorithm;bounding interval hierarchy;compresses (device);data collection;data compression ratio;database;discrete cosine transform;holter electrocardiography;huffman coding;mean squared error;microsoft windows;product requirements document;rms;real-time data;real-time transcription;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;signal-to-noise ratio;tooth root structure;window function	SangJoon Lee;Jungkuk Kim;Myoungho Lee	2011	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2011.2156794	electronic engineering;speech recognition;computer science;electrical engineering;theoretical computer science;signal processing;biological engineering;geriatrics;statistics;huffman coding	Visualization	18.68190032242324	-88.34743245247711	155372

The majority of investigations in this field focused on the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In consideration of the high temporal resolution of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a causality analysis based on the partial directed coherence (PDC) algorithms was applied to explore the cerebral functional connectivity of EEG signals from the perspective of the direction and the intensity of information flow. First of all, the multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model was established for a moving analysis window. The PDC intensity was then calculated. According to the pathological features of epileptic seizure, the outflow information was regarded as the features of the cerebral functional connectivity based on scalp EEG. At last, the brain electrical activity mapping (BEAM) of outflow information was obtained to compare the physiological features corresponding to different moving windows. The results demonstrated that the intensity and the direction of information flow would be changed before and after the epilepsy seizure onset. The intensity of outflow information was obviously enhanced during seizure onsets and the strongest area was focused on seizure onset zone, which conforms to the clinical prediction and has clear physiological significance. The good intuitive nature and accuracy of the experimental results can provide the basis for the subsequent investigations of seizure detection based on the EEG signals.	algorithm;autoregressive model;brain mapping;causality;electroencephalography;microsoft windows;multivariate interpolation;onset (audio);programme delivery control;randomness;resonance;resting state fmri	Zhongjiang Sun;Gang Wang;Kuo Li;Zhonglin Zhang;Gang Bao	2014	2014 7th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/BMEI.2014.7002786	electroencephalography	ML	19.180984144175945	-84.08867517387584	155408

A variety of robots have been developed to address this challenge. Although there are many technical problems to be solved, the lack of objective evaluation indexes for evaluating the benefit to the users is one of the important problems to be addressed before the commercialization of the assistive robots can be realized. The ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) is a classification of the health components of functioning and disability, and is being utilized in medical, healthcare, and welfare fields. The ICF has a basic framework to evaluate healthcare and welfare equipment, including robots, and it will be the basis of the evaluation indexes for assistive robots. In this paper, we present the development of evaluation indexes, and provide the results of preliminary experiments which were conducted using iARM and RAPUDA robots performing a certain lifting task. The experiments illustrate the issues involved in the development of ICF-based indexes for assitive robots.	assistive technology;experiment;lambda lifting;lifting scheme;robot;statistical classification;windows firewall	Eimei Oyama;Woo-Keun Yoon;Yujin Wakita;Hideyuki Tanaka;Masahiro Yoshikawa;Takeshi Sakaguchi;Yoshio Matsumoto	2012	2012 IEEE RO-MAN: The 21st IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication	10.1109/ROMAN.2012.6343757	process performance index;simulation;health care	Robotics	10.969462059953576	-84.25330735806736	155559

The reachable workspace can be used to track an individuals’ ability to perform activities of daily living, such as feeding and grooming. There are few methods for quantifying upper limb performance, none of which are able to generate a reachable workspace volume from motion capture data. We introduce a method to estimate the reachable workspace volume for an individual by capturing their observed joint limits using a low cost depth camera. This method is then tested on seven individuals with varying upper limb performance. Based on these initial trials, we found that the reachable workspace volume decreased as muscular impairment increased. This shows the potential for this method to be used as a quantitative clinical assessment tool.	color gradient;motion capture;workspace	Robert Peter Matthew;Gregorij Kurillo;Jay J.

6c620a81a6f861e73ab7bfccaf8d910ea1e90501	longitudinal monitoring of metabolic alterations in cuprizone mouse model of multiple sclerosis using 1h-magnetic resonance spectroscopy		Non-invasive measures of well-known pathological hallmarks of multiple sclerosis (MS) such as demyelination, inflammation and axonal injury would serve as useful markers to monitor disease progression and evaluate potential therapies. To this end, in vivo localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) provides a powerful means to monitor metabolic changes in the brain and may be sensitive to these pathological hallmarks. In our study, we used the cuprizone mouse model to study pathological features of MS, such as inflammation, de- and remyelination, in a highly reproducible manner. C57BL/6J mice were challenged with a 0.2% cuprizone diet for 6-weeks to induce demyelination, thereafter the mice were put on a cuprizone free diet for another 6weeks to induce spontaneous remyelination. We employed in vivo (1)H-MRS to longitudinally monitor metabolic changes in the corpus callosum of cuprizone-fed mice during the demyelination (weeks 4 and 6) and spontaneous remyelination (week 12) phases. The MRS spectra were quantified with LCModel and since the total creatine (tCr) levels did not change over time or between groups, metabolite concentrations were expressed as ratios relative to tCr. After 4 and 6weeks of cuprizone treatment a significant increase in taurine/tCr and a significant reduction in total N-acetylaspartate/tCr, total choline-containing compounds/tCr and glutamate/tCr could be observed compared to mice under normal diet. At week 12, when almost full remyelination was established, no statistically significant metabolic differences were present between the control and cuprizone group. Our results suggest that these metabolic changes may represent sensitive markers for cuprizone induced demyelination, axonal injury and inflammation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal in vivo (1)H-MRS study that monitored biochemical changes in the corpus callosum of cuprizone fed mice.	basal ganglia diseases;body of uterus;choline;color gradient;corpus callosum;creatine kinase;cuprizone;demyelination;glutamic acid;metabolic process, cellular;minimal recursion semantics;multiple sclerosis;n-acetylaspartate;progressive disease;proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy;protons;spontaneous order;taurine;video-in video-out;remyelination	Jasmien Orije;Firat Kara;Caroline Guglielmetti;Jelle Praet;Annemarie van der Linden;Peter Ponsaerts;Marleen Verhoye	2015	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.012	neuroscience;immunology;diabetes mellitus	HCI	20.35197364659988	-80.46611941186329	156006

In turn, NREM is further divided into three stages denoted here by S1, S2, and S3. Six electroencephalographic (EEG) and two electro-oculographic (EOG) channels were used in this study. The maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) with the multi-resolution Analysis is applied to extract relevant features from EEG and EOG signals. The extracted feature set is transformed and normalized to reduce the effect of extreme values of features. A set of significant features are selected by mRMR which is a powerful feature selection method. Finally the selected feature set is classified using support vector machines (SVMs). The system achieved 95.0% of average accuracy for sleep/awake detection. As concerns the multiclass case, the average accuracy of sleep stages classification was 93.0%.	algorithm;classification;cross-validation (statistics);discrete wavelet transform;disk staging;electroencephalography;electroencephalography;electrooculography;electrooculography;extraction;eye movements;feature extraction;feature selection;heuristic;heuristics;large;maximal set;micro-electrical-mechanical systems;multiclass classification;multiresolution analysis;numerous;rule (guideline);score;singular value decomposition;sleep apnea syndromes;sleep stages;support vector machine;support vector machine;algorithm	Sirvan Khalighi;Teresa Sousa;Dulce Oliveira;Gabriel Pires;Urbano Nunes	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090897	psychology;support vector machine;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;feature selection;neurophysiology	Visualization	16.269097029597756	-91.26049796558178	156028

An interferometric sensor encapsulated into a thin circular layer of material polyurethane (code PU430 – PH30). This used material is immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI). The sensor is primarily designed for use in electromagnetic interference environments (MRI). The monitored vital parameters of the human body are respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate (HR). The sensor was tested in a laboratory environment on the ten volunteers upon their written consent, when the subjects tested were monitored in the supine and sitting position of the body. Testing was performed towards the reference ECG and the piezoelectric respiratory belt. Based on the objective Bland-Altman analysis (for respiratory rate averaging 96.49 % and for heart rate averaging 95.64 %), the sensor may be acceptable to clinicians.

4c256b73e8cba7107a6828c9a74dcb991c0159ed	maximally reliable spatial filtering of steady state visual evoked potentials		"""Due to their high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and robustness to artifacts, steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are a popular technique for studying neural processing in the human visual system. SSVEPs are conventionally analyzed at individual electrodes or linear combinations of electrodes which maximize some variant of the SNR. Here we exploit the fundamental assumption of evoked responses--reproducibility across trials--to develop a technique that extracts a small number of high SNR, maximally reliable SSVEP components. This novel spatial filtering method operates on an array of Fourier coefficients and projects the data into a low-dimensional space in which the trial-to-trial spectral covariance is maximized. When applied to two sample data sets, the resulting technique recovers physiologically plausible components (i.e., the recovered topographies match the lead fields of the underlying sources) while drastically reducing the dimensionality of the data (i.e., more than 90% of the trial-to-trial reliability is captured in the first four components). Moreover, the proposed technique achieves a higher SNR than that of the single-best electrode or the Principal Components.

Three groups of rabbits were used. Gl: control (sedentary rabbits), G2: trained (rabbits submitted to a running program) and G3: drugged (sedentary rabbits treated with Glibenclamide). VF was induced during each experiment, and two recordings were acquired: maintained perfusion and ischemic damage. The recordings were analysed in consecutive 4-second segments and Regularity Index (RJ) was obtained for every segment and lead. RJ quantifies the morphological regularity among local activation waves found in a lead. A map with the RI value in each electrode was computed for each segment. In order to analyse the spatial distribution of RL Regions Of Interest (ROI) were obtained. Two parameters were calculated: ROI spatial number (ROlsn, a measure of spatial fragmentation), and ROI spatial area (ROlsa, the percentage of area map occupied by ROI). Control group has shown higher values of ROlsn than trained and drugged groups (p<;0.05) in both conditions (maintained perfusion or ischemic damage). Regarding ROlsa, control group had the lowest values (p<;0.05) in maintained perfusion, while these diferences where less marked with the presence of ischemic damage. On the contrary, no diferences were found between drugged and trained groups in any of the analysed parameters. The performed ROI analysis has shown that physical exercise and Glibenclamide decrease the fragmentation of VF cardiac response, increasing its spatial uniformity.	circuit complexity;control groups;exercise;fragmentation (computing);glyburide;old world rabbit;reln gene;region of interest;registered jack;ventricular fibrillation;volkmann contracture	Juan Caravaca;Antonio J.

Approximate entropy (ApEn) is believed to provide quantitative information about the complexity of experimental data that are often corrupted with noise and short data length. However, the similarity definition of vectors is based on Heaviside function, of which the boundary is discontinuous and hard and may cause some problems in the validity and accuracy of ApEn. To overcome the problems ApEn encountered, an improved approximate entropy (iApEn) based on fuzzy membership function was proposed. Tests were conducted on independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform and Gaussian noises, chirp signal, MIX process, Rossler map, and Henon map. Compared with the standard ApEn, the iApEn showed better relative consistency and more robustness to noise when characterizing signals with different complexities. The proposed method was then applied to the VF and VT signals selected from MIT/BIH data sets. It is shown that, as a criteria for detecting between VF and VT, iApEn provides one with significantly higher (p = 0.0017) accuracy rate (97.5%) than that of the standard ApEn method. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Also, an optimization process for the signal preprocessing stage has been done. Finally we characterize the error produced when we use the best cutoff frequencies and fiducial point for smartphones and photopletysmograph and compare if the error of smartphones can be reasonably be explained by variations in pulse transit time. The results have revealed that the peak of the first derivative and the minimum of the second derivative of the pulse wave have the lowest error. Moreover, for these points, high pass filtering the signal between 0.1 to 0.8 Hz and low pass around 2.7 Hz or 3.5 Hz are the best cutoff frequencies. Finally, the error in smartphones is slightly higher than in a photoplethysmograph.	activated partial thromboplastin time measurement;canonical account;d-wave two;fiducial marker;heart rate variability;hertz (hz);index;mathematical optimization;morphologic artifacts;photoplethysmography;preprocessor;rapid refresh;round-robin scheduling;sampling - surgical action;smartphone;standard deviation;time series	V.

An electronic stethoscope with a digital signal processing unit could be a low cost and easily applied method for diagnosis of CAD. The current study is a search for heart sound features which might identify CAD. Methods: Nine different types of features from five overlapping frequency bands were obtained and analyzed using 435 recordings from 133 subjects. Results: New features describing an increase in low-frequency power in CAD patients were identified. The features of the different types were relatively strongly correlated. Using a quadratic discriminant function, multiple features were combined into a CAD-score. The area under the receiving operating characteristic for the CAD score was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.69-0.78). Conclusion: The result confirms that there is a potential in heart sounds for the diagnosis of CAD, but that further improvements are necessary to gain clinical relevance.	acoustic cryptanalysis;arteriopathic disease;bands;computer-aided design;coronary artery disease;digital signal processing;discriminant;document completion status - documented;frequency band;heart sounds;patients;relevance;stethoscopes	Samuel Emil Schmidt;Claus Holst-Hansen;John Hansen;Egon Toft;Johannes J.

However, the optimal mechanical ventilation parameters are almost certainly different for each patient, and will vary with time as the injury status of the lung changes. In order to optimize mechanical ventilation in an individual ARDS patient, therefore, it is necessary to track the manner in which injury status is reflected in the mechanical properties of the lungs. Accordingly, we developed an algorithm for assessing the time-dependent manner in which different lung regions open (recruit) and close (derecruit) as a function of the pressure waveform that is applied to the airways during mechanical ventilation. We used this algorithm to test the notion that variable ventilation provides the dynamic perturbations in lung volume necessary to accurately identify recruitment/derecruitment dynamics in the injured lung. We performed this test on synthetic pressure and flow data generated with established numerical models of lung function corresponding to both healthy mice and mice with lung injury. The data were generated by subjecting the models to a variety of mechanical ventilation regimens including variable ventilation. Our results support the hypothesis that variable ventilation can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify the injury status of the lung in ARDS.	computer simulation;distress (novel);expiration, function;intermittent positive-pressure ventilation;lung injury;mechanical ventilation;numerical analysis;patients;respiration;respiratory distress syndrome, adult;respiratory physiology;structure of parenchyma of lung;synthetic intelligence;ventilator - respiratory equipment;waveform;algorithm;life support	Bradford J.

In this study, we present a methodological application describing a novel system based on wearable textile technology and instantaneous nonlinear heart rate variability assessment, able to characterize the autonomic status of bipolar patients by considering only electrocardiogram recordings. As a proof of this concept, our study presents results obtained from eight bipolar patients during their normal daily activities and being elicited according to a specific emotional protocol through the presentation of emotionally relevant pictures. Linear and nonlinear features were computed using a novel point-process-based nonlinear autoregressive integrative model and compared with traditional algorithmic methods. The estimated indices were used as the input of a multilayer perceptron to discriminate the depressive from the euthymic status.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the development of specific cortical structures between early age (around 30weeks postmenstrual age) and term-equivalent age (TEA, around 40weeks postmenstrual age) in 71 extremely preterm infants, and to associate this to clinical characteristics and neurodevelopmental outcome at two years of age. First, analysis showed that the central sulcus (CS), lateral fissure (LF) and insula (INS) were present at early MRI in all infants, whereas the other sulci (post-central sulcus [PCS], superior temporal sulcus [STS], superior [SFS] and inferior [IFS] frontal sulcus) were only seen in part of the infants. Relative growth from early to TEA examination was largest in the SFS. A rightward asymmetry of the surface area was seen in development between both examinations except for the LF, which showed a leftward asymmetry at both time points. Second, lower birth weight z-score, multiple pregnancy and prolonged mechanical ventilation showed negative effects on cortical folding of the CS, LF, INS, STS and PCS, mainly on the first examination, suggesting that sulci developing the earliest were the most affected by clinical factors. Finally, in this cohort, a clear association between cortical folding and neurodevelopmental outcome at two years corrected age was found, particularly for receptive language.	birth injuries;birth weight;cns disorder;clustered file system;frontal sulcus;groove;infant, extremely premature;insula of reil;largest;lateral computing;lateral thinking;mechanical ventilation;preterm infant;respiration;risk factor (computing);structure of central sulcus;structure of fissure of sylvius;structure of superior temporal sulcus;tea;temporal lobe;dinoflagellate sulcus;sodium thiosulfate	Karina J.

Here, we propose a method to identify a section of the upper-limb motor area representation (FS_M1) by means of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded during a completely passive condition (FS_M1bySS). We delivered a galvanic stimulation to the median nerve and we applied to EEG the semi-Blind Source Separation (s-BSS) algorithm named Functional Source Separation (FSS). In order to prove that FS_M1bySS is part of FS_M1, we also collected EEG in a motor condition, i.e. during a voluntary movement task (isometric handgrip) and in a rest condition, i.e. at rest with eyes open and closed. In motor condition, we show that the cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) of FS_M1bySS does not differ from FS_ M1 CMC (0.04 for both sources). Moreover, we show that the FS_M1bySS's ongoing whole band activity during Motor and both rest conditions displays high mutual information and time correlation with FS_M1 (above 0.900 and 0.800, respectively) whereas much smaller ones with the primary somatosensory cortex [Formula: see text] (about 0.300 and 0.500, [Formula: see text]). FS_M1bySS as a marker of the upper-limb FS_M1 representation obtainable without the execution of an active motor task is a great achievement of the FSS algorithm, relevant in most experimental, neurological and psychiatric protocols.	ablepharon;blind signal separation;cache coherence;electroencephalography;epilepsy, partial, motor;flying-spot scanner;galvanic isolation;hmn (hereditary motor neuropathy) proximal type i;isometric projection;mental disorders;motor cortex;motor neuron disease;muscle;mutual information;name;protocols documentation;semiconductor industry;separation anxiety disorder;small;somatosensory cortex;source separation;structure of median nerve;visually impaired persons;algorithm	Camillo Porcaro;Carlo Cottone;Andrea Cancelli;Carlo Salustri;Franca Tecchio	2018	International journal of neural systems	10.1142/S0129065717500472	computer science;electroencephalography;blind signal separation;real-time computing;source separation	ML	17.183187887883502	-80.55013518370517	156874

In this paper, optimized spatial filters that enhance separation properties of EMG signals are investigated. In particular, different multiclass extensions of the common spatial patterns algorithm are applied to high-density surface EMG signals acquired from the forearms of ten healthy subjects. Visualization of the obtained filter coefficients provides insight into the physiology of the muscles related to the performed contractions. The CSP methods are compared with a commonly used pattern recognition approach in a six-class classification task. Cross-validation results show a significant improvement in performance and a higher robustness against noise than commonly used pattern recognition methods.	amputees;bipolar disorder;coefficient;contraction mapping;cross reactions;electromyography;experiment;forearm;image noise;muscle;pattern recognition;physiological processes;power (psychology);prosthesis;sample variance;spondias purpurea;algorithm;electrode;physiological aspects	Janne Mathias Hahne;Bernhard Graimann;Klaus-Robert Müller	2012	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2012.2188799	robust control;control engineering;covariance matrix;electronic engineering;common spatial pattern;speech recognition;electric power;feature extraction;computer science;engineering;noise;electrode;machine learning;mathematics;physics;cross-validation;spatial filter;statistics	Vision	14.89359405156546	-92.29027282901782	156943
1ff565cf58051ec094a005e2c07a7a1e7be50c51	analysis of epileptic events using wavelet packets	wavelet packet	Many studies have focused on the nonlinear analysis of electroencephalography mainly for the characterization of epileptic brain states. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the epileptogenic process is still not clear completely especially the most challenging aspects of epileptology which is the anticipation of the seizure. Despite all the efforts we still don’t know how and when and why the seizure occurs. However actual studies bring strong evidence that the interictal-ictal state transition is not an abrupt phenomena. Findings also indicate that it is possible to detect a preseizure phase. We will study the patients admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for the purpose of recording their seizures. These patients have their EEG signal recorded 24 hours a day for several days until they have enough number of seizures to determine eligibility for seizure surgery. Thus, preictal, ictal, and post ictal electroencephalography recordings are available on such patients for analysis. We propose to use wavelet analysis in order to investigate a case study of the electroencephalography signal and determine the localization of the seizure and its characteristics.	algorithm;electroencephalography;filter bank;frequency band;network packet;nonlinear system;state transition table;the spike (1997);tree structure;verification and validation;wavelet packet decomposition	Nisrine Sinno;Kifah R.

In the analysis performed, in addition to the standard HRV measures, wavelet entropy measures are also used. A genetic algorithm is used to select the best ones from among all possible combinations of these measures. A k-nearest neighbor classifier is used to evaluate the performance of the feature combinations in classifying these two groups. The results imply that two combinations of all HRV measures, both of which include wavelet entropy measures, have the highest discrimination power in terms of sensitivity and specificity values.

In the field of camera-based photoplethysmography, blind source separation (BSS) techniques have been extensively applied to cope with artifacts and noise. Despite their wide usage, there is no consensus that common BSS approaches contribute to an improved analysis of camera-based photoplethysmograms (cbPPG). This contribution compares previously proposed multispectral BSS techniques to a novel spatial BSS approach for heart rate extraction from cbPPG. Our analysis indicates that the application of BSS techniques not necessarily improves cbPPG's analysis but signal properities like the signal-to-noise-ratio should be considered before i applying BSS techniques.	blind signal separation;contactless smart card;multispectral image;signal-to-noise ratio;source separation	Daniel Wedekind;Alexander Trumpp;Fernando Andreotti;Frederik Gaetjen;Stefan Rasche;Klaus Matschke;Hagen Malberg;Sebastian Zaunseder	2015	2015 23rd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.1109/EUSIPCO.2015.7362420	speech recognition;telecommunications;engineering;communication	Visualization	19.34125783056233	-88.81177198942095	157441

While the motion of ankle joint would be limited and changed with taping, there are quite a few reports about the change. In order to clarify effects of the taping and to examine characteristics of the ankle taping, we had constructed a system to measure the distance between the metatarsus first head and the floor with a 3D motion analysis system, and to measure planter pressure pattern during the ankle inversion with pressure monitoring system.

There is evidence from other solid organ cancers and metastases that DWI may be used as a biomarker of prognosis and treatment response. We therefore investigated DWI characteristics of cerebral metastases and their peritumoral region recorded pre-operatively and related these to patient outcomes.   METHODS Retrospective analysis of 76 cases operated upon at a single institution with DWI performed pre-operatively at 1.5T. Maps of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were generated using standard protocols. Readings were taken from the tumor, peritumoral region and across the brain-tumor interface. Patient outcomes were overall survival and time to local recurrence.   RESULTS A minimum ADC greater than 919.4 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s within a metastasis predicted longer overall survival regardless of adjuvant therapies. This was not simply due to differences between the types of primary cancer because the effect was observed even in a subgroup of 36 patients with the same primary, non-small cell lung cancer. The change in diffusion across the tumor border and into peritumoral brain was measured by the """"ADC transition coefficient"""" or ATC and this was more strongly predictive than ADC readings alone. Metastases with a sharp change in diffusion across their border (ATC >0.279) showed shorter overall survival compared to those with a more diffuse edge. The ATC was the only imaging measurement which independently predicted overall survival in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.3 - 0.97, p = 0.04).   CONCLUSIONS DWI demonstrates changes in the tumor, across the tumor edge and in the peritumoral region which may not be visible on conventional MRI and this may be useful in predicting patient outcomes for operated cerebral metastases."""	advanced transportation controller;biological markers;cerebral metastasis;coefficient;diffusion weighted imaging;forecast of outcome;glioma;hazard ratio;malignant neoplasms;metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain;multiple organ failure;non-small cell lung carcinoma;overall survival;patients;pharmaceutical adjuvants;primary malignant neoplasm;protocols documentation;small cell carcinoma of lung;solid organ;subgroup a nepoviruses;therapeutic procedure;windows 95	Rasheed Zakaria;Kumar Gourav Das;Mark Radon;Maneesh Bhojak;Philip R.

HR and RR are routinely monitored in patients recovered in hospitals and eventual variations of these quantities need to be measured and reported. Today HR and RR are measured with standard methods: electrocardiography (ECG) and spirometry (SP). Both this methods need to be in contact with the subject and require the presence of expert personnel to be correctly operated. Consequently, their use is limited to hospitals or ambulatory environments and their diffusion in domestic environments is rare. In this paper we present a novel method for the measurement of HR and RR without contact on a subject. The proposed method is realized by means of a Kinect™ Device (KD). The KD is a widely-diffused multi-sensors device based on a depth-sensor, a camera-sensor and 4 microphones. In our work it has been used in conjunction with a special processing algorithm to calculate the HR and RR values. In order to measure HP and RR 10 healthy subjects were observed with the proposed method and with reference methods (ECG and a SP). Results from tests show that the standard deviation of the residuals (difference between the ECG or SP data and the corresponding measurements obtained by KD) are 6% and 9.7% for HR and RR values respectively. Therefore the proposed measurement method, based on the use of KD, could be used for the home-monitoring of HR and RR values in healthy subject without the presence of experts or clinicians.	algorithm;kinect;microphone;rapid refresh;round-robin scheduling;sensor	Natascia Bernacchia;Lorenzo Scalise;Luigi Casacanditella;Ilaria Ercoli;Paolo Marchionni;Enrico Primo Tomasini	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA)	10.1109/MeMeA.2014.6860065	electronic engineering;medicine;electrical engineering;biological engineering	Embedded	11.894938405948924	-87.50162632058371	158066

Behavioral measures show this through improved accuracy and decreased trial-to-trial variability. The question remains whether the supporting brain dynamics show a similar decrease in variability. We examined the relation between variability in single trial evoked electrical activity of the brain (measured with EEG) and performance of a face memory task in children (8-15 y) and young adults (20-33 y). Behaviorally, children showed slower, more variable response times (RT), and less accurate recognition than adults. However, brain signal variability increased with age, and showed strong negative correlations with intrasubject RT variability and positive correlations with accuracy. Thus, maturation appears to lead to a brain with greater functional variability, which is indicative of enhanced neural complexity. This variability may reflect a broader repertoire of metastable brain states and more fluid transitions among them that enable optimum responses. Our results suggest that the moment-to-moment variability in brain activity may be a critical index of the cognitive capacity of the brain.	electroencephalography;heart rate variability;spatial variability;windows rt;electrical activity	Anthony Randal McIntosh;Natasa Kovacevic;Roxane J.

The first experiment was to test the perception of the vibration at different frequencies and at different locations of the upper leg. The second experiment tested the ability of subjects to estimate location and number of stimuli in an array. In addition it was evaluated whether simultaneous or sequential stimulation is better interpretable. Thirdly the habituation of the vibration was determined. The experiments showed that vibrotactile stimulation is well perceived and can be useful in providing feedback on the upper leg. Further experiments are needed to determine the effectiveness of vibrotactile stimulation for feedback in trans-femoral prostheses.	array data structure;drug habituation;experiment;pagers;prosthesis;sacral nerve stimulation;source-to-source compiler;transcranial magnetic stimulation;usability	E.

However, the extent to which these results can be generalized to human subjects is not known. We have recorded simultaneous electrocorticographic (ECoG) and hand kinematics in a human subject performing reach-grasp-hold of objects varying in shape and size. All Spectral features in various gamma bands (30–50 Hz, 70–100 Hz and 100–150 Hz frequency bands) were able to predict the time course of grasp aperture with high correlation (max r = 0.80) using as few as one ECoG feature from a single electrode (max r for single feature = 0.75) in single trials without prior knowledge of task timing. These results suggest that the population activity captured with ECoG contains information about coordinated finger movements that potentially can be exploited to control advanced upper limb neuroprosthetics.	bands;electrocorticography;frequency band;hearing loss, high-frequency;hertz (hz);movement;neuroprosthetics;numerous;physical object;primates;science of neurophysiology;upper extremity	Matthew S.

8e037261904e9d4949d13b52cfb3068ff70f18ff	combining the benefits of cca and svms for ssvep-based bcis in real-world conditions		In this paper we propose a novel method for SSVEP classification that combines the benefits of the inherently multi-channel CCA, the state-of-the-art method for detecting SSVEPs, with the robust SVMs, one of the most popular machine learning algorithms. The employment of SVMs, except for the benefit of robustness, provides us also with a confidence score allowing to dynamically trade-off the trial length with the accuracy of the classifier, and vice versa. By balancing this trade-off we are able to offer personalized self-paced BCIs that maximize the ITR of the system. Furthermore, we propose to perturb the template frequencies of CCA so as to accommodate with real world BCI applications requirements, where the environmental conditions may not be ideal compared to existing methods that rely on the assumption of soundproof and distraction-free environments.	algorithm;annual bci research award;brain–computer interface;early stopping;experiment;machine learning;personalization;perturbation theory;requirement;sensor;support vector machine	Elisavet Chatzilari;Georgios Liaros;Kostas Georgiadis;Spiros Nikolopoulos;Yiannis Kompatsiaris	2017		10.1145/3132635.3132636	brain–computer interface;support vector machine;robustness (computer science);machine learning;classifier (linguistics);computer science;artificial intelligence	ML	14.15520260193682	-94.1545299036543	158644

Miniature inertial sensors are increasingly becoming a viable option for human movement measurement, given their small size, low cost and relatively good accuracy compared with traditional optical measurements. A system capable of measuring tibia angle using a shank mounted wireless inertial sensor is proposed. The system employs a simple setup with only one skin-mounted triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope module attached to the tibia segment, and an algorithm to estimate the tibia angle. The accuracy of the system was assessed by an optical tracking system (Optotrak Certus) during dynamic movements performed by three subjects by evaluating Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) of tibia-flexion and tibia-adduction angles over the period of motion. We achieve an RMSE of 1.6±1.1 and2.5±1.6 degrees in tibia-flexion and tibia-adduction angles, respectively. It is argued that tibia angle can be reliably used to detect valgus or varus movement of the knee and hence the proposed system provides a simple and useful assessment tool for performance enhancement and rehabilitation.	algorithm;angularjs;gyroscope;low-power broadcasting;motion capture;peripheral;sensor;tibia;tracking system	Wenzheng Hu;Edgar Charry;Muhammad Umer;Andrew Ronchi;Simon Taylor	2014	2014 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing (ISSNIP)	10.1109/ISSNIP.2014.6827603	engineering;physical therapy;anatomy;surgery	Robotics	11.897845940188645	-85.14917901279051	159014
236655903f4578b3aa6bc244d92cc5c0ef6b262d	application of multiscale entropy in assessing plantar skin blood flow dynamics in diabetics with peripheral neuropathy		Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, while tissue ischemia caused by impaired vasodilatory response to plantar pressure is thought to be a major factor of the development of DFUs, which has been assessed using various measures of skin blood flow (SBF) in the time or frequency domain. These measures, however, are incapable of characterizing nonlinear dynamics of SBF, which is an indicator of pathologic alterations of microcirculation in the diabetic foot. This study recruited 18 type 2 diabetics with peripheral neuropathy and eight healthy controls. SBF at the first metatarsal head in response to locally applied pressure and heating was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry. A multiscale entropy algorithm was utilized to quantify the regularity degree of the SBF responses. The results showed that during reactive hyperemia and thermally induced biphasic response, the regularity degree of SBF in diabetics underwent only small changes compared to baseline and significantly differed from that in controls at multiple scales (p < 0.05). On the other hand, the transition of regularity degree of SBF in diabetics distinctively differed from that in controls (p < 0.05). These findings indicated that multiscale entropy could provide a more comprehensive assessment of impaired microvascular reactivity in the diabetic foot compared to other entropy measures based on only a single scale, which strengthens the use of plantar SBF dynamics to assess the risk for DFU.

We describe the development of customized hardware for the wearable discrimination of human sleep and wake based on cardio-respiratory signals. The device was designed for efficient and low-power computation of Fast Fourier Transforms and artificial neural networks required for the on-line classification. We discuss methods for reducing computational load and consequently power requirements. The SleePic prototype was tested for autonomy and comfort on eight healthy subjects. SleePic showed an energetic autonomy of more than 36 hours. The SleePic device will require further integration for increased comfort and improved user interaction.	artificial neural network;computation;fast fourier transform;low-power broadcasting;online and offline;prototype;requirement;wearable computer	Walter Karlen;Dario Floreano	2011			simulation	HCI	12.533485987779473	-92.35348094808593	159049
6737b1009a0cbe36ab9aabf7bf9a2607d7191a5e	rapid cerebrovascular reactivity mapping: enabling vascular reactivity information to be routinely acquired	bold;cerebrovascular reactivity;hypercapnia challenge;magnetic resonance imaging	Cerebrovascular reactivity mapping (CVR), using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and carbon dioxide as a stimulus, provides useful information on how cerebral blood vessels react under stress. This information has proven to be useful in the study of vascular disorders, dementia and healthy ageing. However, clinical adoption of this form of CVR mapping has been hindered by relatively long scan durations of 7-12 min. By replacing the conventional block presentation of carbon dioxide enriched air with a sinusoidally modulated stimulus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether more clinically acceptable scan durations are possible. Firstly, the conventional block protocol was compared with a sinusoidal protocol of the same duration of 7 min. Estimates of the magnitude of the CVR signal (CVR magnitude) were found to be in good agreement between the stimulus protocols, but estimates of the relative timing of the CVR response (CVR phase) were not. Secondly, data from the sinusoidal protocol was reanalysed using decreasing amounts of data in the range 1-6 min. The CVR magnitude was found to tolerate this reduction in scan duration better than CVR phase. However, these analyses indicate that scan durations in the range of 3-5 min produce robust data.	aging;blood vessel;carbon dioxide;cerebrovascular disorders;dementia;estimated;magnetic resonance imaging;maxima and minima;modulation;protocols documentation;vascular diseases	Nicholas P.

005f0765908fea19773119699b4309f26d8f2151	spatially weighted bold signal for comparison of functional magnetic resonance imaging and near-infrared imaging of the brain	temporal correlation;spatial dependence;blood oxygen level dependent;functional magnetic resonance images;near infrared spectroscopy;brain activation;photon migration;near infrared imaging;density functional	We introduce a weighted spatial average of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) BOLD signal (blood oxygen level-dependent) that is appropriate for comparison with the changes in oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during brain activation. Because the BOLD signal shows a spatial dependence (both in shape and amplitude) within the region of activation, the location of the optical probe with respect to the region of BOLD activation should be taken into account for comparison of the BOLD and NIRS signals. Our new method is based on combining weighted contributions of the BOLD signal from each activated voxel, with a weight given by a hitting density function for photons migrating between a given pair of illumination and collection points. We present a case study where we have found that the new spatially weighted BOLD signal shows a high spatial and temporal correlation with the oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentration changes measured with NIRS during a hand-tapping protocol. These findings reinforce the idea that fMRI and NIRS are sensitive to similar underlying hemodynamic changes, and indicate that the proposed weighted BOLD signal is needed for a quantitative comparison of BOLD and NIRS signals.	hemodynamics;magnetic resonance imaging;opiate addiction;oxygen;photons;spectroscopy, near-infrared;voxel;fmri	Angelo Sassaroli;Blaise deB.

The aim of the present work has been the application of the generalized Hurst Exponent of order 2, H(2), to study AF organization from the surface ECG. H(2) relates to the behavior of the autocorrelation function of a time series, thus measuring long-term statistical dependencies that could be used to estimate AF organization. Since the spontaneous termination of paroxysmal AF is related to the arrhythmia organization, the AF Termination Database available at Physionet has been analyzed to test the method's ability in the discrimination of organization-related events. The performance of H(2) was compared with two noninvasive established AF organization metrics, the dominant atrial frequency (DAF) and Sample Entropy (SampEn). H(2) yielded better classification accuracy results (95.0%) than DAF and SampEn (both 88.3%). Moreover, statistically significant differences were found between non-terminating and terminating groups and also between soon terminating and terminating groups. As conclusion, H(2) can be considered as a promising tool for the non-invasive study of AF organization.	anisotropic filtering;atrial septal defects;autocorrelation;decentralized autonomous organization;delayed auditory feedback;divergence (computer science);heart atrium;hurst exponent;linear algebra;newman's lemma;paroxysmal atrial fibrillation;rewriting;sample entropy;spontaneous order;supraventricular tachycardia;time series;ventricular fibrillation	M.

The goal of the method is to discard automatically the effect of the fast phase-saccades and consequently calculate the response of vestibular system in the form of phase shift and amplitude. The comparison of threshold detection and inductive models trained on saccades is carried out. After saccades detection we are left with discontinuous signal segments. This paper presents an approach to align them to form a smooth signal with the same frequencies that were originally present in the source signal. The approach is based on a direct estimation of the signal component parameters using the evolutionary strategy with covariance matrix adaptation. The performance of evolutionary approach is compared to least-square multimodal sinus fit. The experimental evaluation on real-world signals revealed that threshold saccades detection with combination of the evolutionary strategy is robust, scalable and reliable method.	algorithm;align (company);cma-es;experiment;interpolation;iterative and incremental development;multimodal interaction;scalability;signal processing;vhf omnidirectional range	Daniel Novák;Ales Pilný;Pavel Kordík;Stefan Holiga;Petr Posík;R.

In particular, muscle synergies during grasping and in graded-force tasks are of great interest for the control of dexterous hand prostheses. To this end, we have designed and tested a novel device to accurately and simultaneously measure fingertip forces. The device, called FFLS (Finger-Force Linear Sensor), measures the forces applied by the human fingertips in both directions (flexion and extension of index, middle, ring and little finger plus thumb rotation and abduction/adduction). It is suited for several different hand sizes, enforces high accuracy in the measurement and its signal is guaranteed to be linear in a high range of forces (100N in both directions for each finger). It outputs six analog voltages (±10V), suited for processing with a DAQ card.	analog;community;contraction mapping;fifth finger;fingertip dosing unit;morphologic artifacts;muscle;neurology speciality;programming paradigm;prosthesis;rehabilitation robotics;sound quality;synergy;physiological aspects	Risto Kõiva;Barbara Hilsenbeck;Claudio Castellini	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6345985	muscle;computer science;engineering;physical therapy;biological engineering;surgery	Robotics	13.533382521411504	-82.56160910108605	159155

The torque exerted by a cable-driven joint is the cross product of the line of action of the cable, known as the moment arm, and its tension. The subject of this article delves into this latter, less-studied quantity associated with torque. The concept of moment arm manipulation of a cable-driven joint is introduced, developed, formalized, and then examined with experiments on a physical, single-joint device. This method of moment arm manipulation, referred to as the moment arm manipulation for remote induction of net effective torque (MARIONET), is found to have distinct advantages that make it feasible for home rehabilitation as well as potential outside of the field.	cerebrovascular accident;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;experiment;torque;tension;nervous system disorder;physical hard work	James S.

A new feature, called IMF-VoE, is proposed to predict the occurrence of seizures. The IMF-VoE feature combines three intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) from the empirical mode decomposition of a EEG signal and the variance of the range between the upper and lower envelopes (VoE) of the signal. These multiple cues encode the intrinsic characteristics of seizure states, thus are able to distinguish them from the background. The feature is tested on 80.4 hours of EEG data with 10 seizures of 4 patients. The sensitivity of 100% is obtained with a low false detection rate of 0.16 per hour. Average time delays are 19.4s, 13.2s, and 10.7s at the false detection rates of 0.16 per hour, 0.27 per hour, and 0.41 per hour respectively, when different thresholds are used. The result is competitive among recent studies. In addition, since the IMF-VoE is compact, the detection system is of high computational efficiency and able to run in real time.	antibody to islet cells of pancreas measurement;computation;computational complexity theory;encode;electroencephalography phase synchronization;electromyography;embedded system;embedding;epilepsy;hilbert–huang transform;independent computing architecture;large;morphologic artifacts;patients;sample variance;seizures;algorithm;interfibrillar mitochondrion;per hour	Yu Qi;Yueming Wang;Xiaoxiang Zheng;Jian-Min Zhang;Junming Zhu;Jianping Guo	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347158	neuroscience;speech recognition;electroencephalography;sensitivity;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;communication;neurophysiology	Vision	16.892602308376578	-88.46530570880701	159252

The objective is to propose a model-based approach to estimate the autonomic modulation during a pharmacological challenge. A recursive parameter identification method is proposed and applied to a mathematical model of the baroreflex, in order to estimate the time-varying vagal and sympathetic contributions to heart rate modulation during autonomic maneuvers. The model-based method was evaluated with data from five newborn lambs, which were acquired during injection of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor drugs, on normal conditions and under beta-blockers, so as to quantify the effect of the pharmacological sympathetic blockade on the estimated parameters. After parameter identification, results show a close match between experimental and simulated signals for the five lambs, as the mean relative root mean squared error is equal to 0.0026 (± 0.003). The error, between simulated and experimental signals, is significantly reduced compared to a batch identification of parameters. The model-based estimation of vagal and sympathetic contributions were consistent with physiological knowledge and, as expected, it was possible to observe an alteration of the sympathetic response under beta-blockers. The simulated vagal modulation illustrates a response similar to traditional heart rate variability markers during the pharmacological maneuver. The model-based method, proposed in the paper, highlights the advantages of using a recursive identification method for the estimation of vagal and sympathetic modulation.

7e13eb6c86985d8a553ba25c5357f890f6d00850	parafac2 and its block term decomposition analog for blind fmri source unmixing		Tensor-based analysis of brain imaging data, in particular functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), has proved to be quite effective in exploiting their inherently multidimensional nature. It commonly relies on a trilinear model generating the analyzed data. This assumption, however, may prove to be quite strict in practice; for example, due to the natural intra-subject and inter-subject variability of the Haemodynamic Response Function (HRF). This paper investigates the possible gains from the adoption of a less strict trilinear model, such as PARAFAC2, which allows a more flexible representation of the fMRI data in the temporal domain. In this context, and inspired by a recently reported successful application of the Block Term Decomposition (BTD) model to a 4-way tensorization of the fMRI signal, a PARAFAC2-like extension of BTD (called here BTD2) is proposed. Simulation results are presented, that reveal the pros and cons of these tensorial methods, demonstrating BTD2's enhanced robustness to noise.	heart rate variability;hemodynamics;resonance;simulation	Christos Chatzichristos;Eleftherios Kofidis;Sergios Theodoridis	2017	2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081576	robustness (computer science);tensor;data modeling;stress (mechanics);cons;machine learning;matrix decomposition;neuroimaging;functional magnetic resonance imaging;computer science;artificial intelligence	ML	22.36735893614166	-88.60846445815925	159753

The measurements are however prone to movement artifacts or poor skin-electrode contact, often making some parts of the recorded signals useless since important information might be hidden by these artifacts. In this paper a special ECG sensor node with active electrodes is used to record the 12-channel ECG during movement. Several methods for detection of degraded signal quality are combined and adapted to identify leads that have been compromised on a beat-to-beat level. A PCA-based reconstruction algorithm is then used to reconstruct leads with insufficient signal quality using only undisturbed leads. Furthermore this approach enables an estimation of the quality of reconstruction even in absence of an undisturbed reference.	algorithm;poor posture;principal component analysis;sensor node	Steffen A.

All disciplines have developed their respective sets of analytic tools to fuse the information that is available in all measured modalities. In this paper, we provide a review of classical as well as recent machine learning methods (specifically factor models) for fusing information from functional neuroimaging techniques such as: LFP, EEG, MEG, fNIRS, and fMRI. Early and late fusion scenarios are distinguished, and appropriate factor models for the respective scenarios are presented along with example applications from selected multimodal neuroimaging studies. Further emphasis is given to the interpretability of the resulting model parameters, in particular by highlighting how factor models relate to physical models needed for source localization. The methods we discuss allow for the extraction of information from neural data, which ultimately contributes to 1) better neuroscientific understanding; 2) enhance diagnostic performance; and 3) discover neural signals of interest that correlate maximally with a given cognitive paradigm. While we clearly study the multimodal functional neuroimaging challenge, the discussed machine learning techniques have a wide applicability, i.e., in general data fusion, and may thus be informative to the general interested reader.	computer vision;electroencephalography;information;international conference on functional programming;machine learning;magnetoencephalography;multimodal interaction;programming paradigm;robotics	Sven Dähne;Felix Bießmann;Wojciech Samek;Stefan Haufe;Dominique Goltz;Christopher Gundlach;Arno Villringer;Siamac Fazli;Klaus-Robert Müller	2015	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2015.2425807	data modeling;computer vision;speech recognition;functional near-infrared spectroscopy;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;sensor fusion;neuroimaging	ML	22.001593966800247	-88.17620677344169	160694

By combining these patterns with presence or absence of movements, a fetal behavioral state (fBS) was determined. The expert scores were used as the gold standard and objective thresholds for the detection procedure were obtained using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis. To assess the performance, intraclass correlation was computed between the proposed approach and the mutually agreed expert scores. The detected fHRPs were then associated to their corresponding fBS based on the fetal movement obtained from fetal magnetocardiogaphic (fMCG) signals. This approach may aid clinicians in objectively assessing the fBS and monitoring fetal wellbeing.		Srinivasan Vairavan;Umit D. Ulusar;Hari Eswaran;Hubert Preissl;James D. Wilson;S. S.

RSV often causes increased airway resistance, clinically detected as wheezing by chest auscultation. In this disease, expiratory flows are significantly reduced due to the high resistance in patient's airway passages. A quantitative method for measuring resistance can have a great benefit to diagnosis and management of children with RSV infections as well as with other lung diseases. Airway resistance is defined as the lung pressure divided by the airflow. In this paper, we propose a method to quantify resistance through a simple, non-contact measurement of chest volume that can act as a surrogate measure of the lung pressure and volumetric airflow. We used depth data collected by a Microsoft Kinect camera for the measurement of the lung volume over time. In our experimentation, breathing through a number of plastic straws induced different airway resistances. For a standard spirometry test, our volume/flow estimation using Kinect showed strong correlation with the flow data collected by a commercially-available spirometer (five subjects, each performing 20 breathing trials, correlation coefficient = 0.88, with 95% confidence interval). As the number of straws decreased, emulating a higher airway obstruction, our algorithm was sufficient to distinguish between several levels of airway resistance.	accident and emergency department;acute illness;airway obstruction;auscultation;coefficient;confidence intervals;emulator;expiration, function;flow;kinect;lung diseases;parasitic element (electrical networks);patients;respiratory tract diseases;respiratory tract infections;respiratory tract structure;spirometer device component;spirometry;tract (literature);algorithm	Sarah Ostadabbas;Christoph Bulach;David N.

Providing robotic assistance is a potential solution yet the effects of this assistance are unclear. We combined a novel exoskeleton and exercise video game (exergame) to create a new rehabilitation paradigm for children with CP. We incorporated high density electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cortical activity. Movement to targets in the game was controlled by knee extension while standing. The distance between targets was the same with and without the exoskeleton to isolate the effect of robotic assistance. Our results show that children with CP maintain or increase knee extensor muscle activity during knee extension in the presence of synergistic robotic assistance. Our EEG findings also demonstrate that participants remained engaged in the exercise with robotic assistance. Interestingly we observed a developmental trajectory of sensorimotor mu rhythm in children with CP similar, though delayed, to those reported in typically developing children. While not the goal here, the exoskeleton significantly increased knee extension in 3/6 participants during use. Future work will focus on utilizing the exoskeleton to enhance volitional knee extension capability and in combination with EMG and EEG to study sensorimotor cortex response to progressive exercise in children with CP.	cerebral palsy;cerebral cortex;electroencephalography phase synchronization;electromyography;programming paradigm;robot;synergy;video games;exoskeleton	Thomas C.

However, this integration comes with artifacts that directly interfere in the signal quality. Independent component analysis has been one of the most used tools to remove biological artifacts and more recently it has been used to the removal of BCG artifact present when simultaneous EEG and fMRI is acquired. Although widely adopted some questions regarding the reliability of the estimated sources are still unanswered. The efficiency of the removal depends on the correct identification and selection of the artifact-related independent components. This selection is not obvious since different strategies give different results. Considering that no real BCG artifact-free data can be collected inside an MR scanner it is a difficult task to select the best criteria or best algorithm. In this paper we contribute to the solution of this problem proposing an automatic component selection method based on maximum absolute magnitude squared coherence function between the independent components and the ECG signal.	aitken's delta-squared process;algorithm;electroencephalography;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;mean squared error;visual inspection	Ana Claudia Silva de Souza;Gustavo Fernandes Rodrigues;Daniel E.

Target identification is the ongoing core task in BCI researches, and plays a significant role in practical applications. In order to improve the performance of SSVEP-based BCI system, we proposed a partial least squares (PLS)-based stimulus frequency recognition model for SSVEP detection. Moreover, we compared the proposed method with canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method, respectively. The experiment results showed that PLS can not only extract the SSVEP features effectively, but also can increase the classification accuracies of SSVEP-based BCI systems.	brain–computer interface;experiment;feature extraction;lasso;partial least squares regression;sensor;steady state	Ruimin Wang;Yue Leng;Yuankui Yang;Wen Wu;Keiji Iramina;Sheng Ge	2014	2014 7th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/BMEI.2014.7002863	computer vision;speech recognition;visualization;electroencephalography;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;accuracy and precision;correlation;statistics	Robotics	14.35927454402124	-92.75558685500548	161093
f73c77fb916f09956ea7fdfd464ceef59443499c	assessing discontinuous data using ensemble empirical mode decomposition	ensemble empirical mode decomposition;end effect error;discontinuous data	This investigation presents an improved ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) algorithm that can be applied to discontinuous data. The quality of the algorithm is assessed by creating artificial data gaps in continuous data, then comparing the extracted intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) from both data sets. The results show that errors increase as the gap length increases. In addition, errors in the high-frequency IMFs are less than the low-frequency IMFs. The majority of the errors in the high-frequency IMFs are due to end-effect errors associated with under-defined interpolation functions near the gap endpoints. A method that utilizes a mirroring technique is presented to reduce the errors in the discontinuous decomposition. The improved algorithm provides a more locally accurate decomposition of the data amidst data gaps. Overall, this simple but powerful algorithm expands EEMD's ability to locally extract periodic components from discontinuous data.	hilbert–huang transform	Bradley Lee Barnhart;Honda Kahindo Wa Nandage;William Eichinger	2011	Advances in Adaptive Data Analysis	10.1142/S179353691100091X	mathematical optimization;computer science;machine learning;statistics	AI	20.64372684617618	-86.17158809220307	161123

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an important method adopted in epilepsy diagnosis. The detection of the epileptic activity requires a time-consuming analysis of the entire MRI data by an expert. Hence there is a need to generate an efficient prediction model for making a correct diagnosis of epileptic seizure and accurate prediction of its type. This paper deals with modeling of epileptic seizure prediction as classification task and a kind of support vector machine namely fast single shot proximal support vector machine with vector output has been employed to solve multiclass classification problem. The efficiency in terms of prediction accuracy and time consumption in classifying the MRI images is reported.	algorithm;experiment;resonance;solver;support vector machine	V. Sujitha;P. Sivagami;M.

64431cf1336e1986b5de1cacae02dcd199203d8f	upper limb prosthesis control: a hybrid eeg-emg scheme for motion estimation in transhumeral subjects		This study described the use of Kernel Least Square Tracker based estimation for 3-dimensional shoulder, elbow motion kinematics from surface Electromyogram (EMG) and a two-stage multiclass Support Vector Machine based classification of different wrist, grip and finger motions from Electroencephalogram (EEG). The advantage of employing hybrid EEG-EMG strategy for upper limb motion estimation was demonstrated for a transhumeral subject. The method utilized EMG from upper arm muscles for elbow motion (and shoulder motion in case of higher degree amputation scenario) and used EEG for discerning basic wrist, grip and finger motions. The results showed that the hybrid scheme could estimate shoulder, elbow motion with more than 90% accuracy and wrist, grip and finger motion with 65%-70% accuracy. This strategy of using hybrid EEG-EMG motion estimation, thus, could be employed in developing a more intuitive upper limb prosthesis controller with multiple degrees of freedom.	amputation;electroencephalography;electromyography;influenza;least-squares analysis;limb prosthesis;motion estimation;phantom limb syndrome;prosthesis implantation;support vector machine;upper extremity;upper arm	Koushik Bakshi;Rajesh Pramanik;M.

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, as an important part of preimplantation evaluation for children with SNHL, could provide the detailed information about the inner ear, the vestibulocochlear nerve, and the brain, so as to select suitable candidate for cochlear implantation (CI). Brain abnormalities were not rare in the brain MR imaging of SNHL children; however, its influence on the effect of CI has not been clarified. After retrospectively analyzing the CT and MR imaging of 157 children with SNHL that accepted preoperative evaluation from June 2011 to February 2013 in our hospital and following them during a period of 14.09 ± 5.08 months, we found that the white matter change, which might be associated with the history of medical condition, was the most common brain abnormality. Usually CI was still beneficial to the children with brain abnormalities, and the short-term hearing improvement could be achieved. Further study with more patients and longer follow-up time was needed to confirm our results.	acoustic nerve;brain neoplasms;ct scan;cochlear implant procedure;cochlear structure;congenital abnormality;follow-up report;ginkgo biloba extract;ginseng preparation;high-resolution computed tomography;incidence matrix;ion implantation;labyrinth;patients;pregnancy;resonance;sensorineural hearing loss (disorder);uptime;white matter;hearing impairment;interest;qing-fei-tang	Xiao-Quan Xu;Fei-Yun Wu;Hao Hu;Guo-Yi Su;Jie Shen	2015		10.1155/2015/275786	text mining;medical research;medicine;pathology;computer science;bioinformatics;audiology	Vision	19.40077971946417	-82.40665420754513	161706
38744e07b1f576c8cd7ee3a27232e9c414ad71fe	morphological determination of pathological pcg signals by time and frequency domain analysis		With the development of diagnostic devices over the past few decades, the algorithmic classification of heart sound recordings has become possible. Although this field has been under research for a relatively long time, the classification of such recordings is not yet straightforward. We were given a large manually classified database of heart sounds with the challenge [1]. We worked together with an experienced cardiologist to find the aspects affecting the classifications. To algorithmically classify a heart sound recording as normal or abnormal, it is necessary in most cases to accurately locate both the fundamental heart sounds and the systolic and diastolic regions. For this purpose we used the method provided in the example entry [2][3]. Minor modifications were made, such as tuning some of the parameters to match the database parameters. In the classification of the heart sounds, we were looking for the morphological features of the abnormal signals, for example, mitral stenosis, mitral insufficiency, aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency, tricuspid stenosis and tricuspid insufficiency. We extracted several features from both time and frequency domains, for example, the frequency properties of systolic and diastolic segments and resampled wavelet envelope features. The extracted features were classified by the help of a support vector machine. In order to train the classifier, we used a reduced, sorted dataset with a more balanced ratio of abnormal and normal signals. During the official phase, our best scores on a random subset were 77.2% sensitivity, 85.2% specificity and 81.2% final modified accuracy (MAcc). Our scores for the entire test dataset are 83.77% sensitivity, 76.8% specificity and 80.28% MAcc. Our scores for the entire training dataset are 93.08% sensitivity, 84.70% specificity and 88.70% MAcc.	algorithm;convergence insufficiency;database;domain analysis;machine learning;sensitivity and specificity;support vector machine;test set;wavelet	Márton Áron Goda;Peter Hajas	2016	2016 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)		simulation;speech recognition;engineering;communication	ML	16.38512060363324	-89.10831512074955	161892

There is another class of seizures called psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES) that mimics epilepsy, but is caused due to underlying psychology. The diagnosis of PNES is done using video-electroencephalography monitoring (VEM), which is a resource intensive process. Recently, accelerometers have been shown to be effective in classification of epileptic and non-epileptic seizures. In this work, we propose a novel feature called histogram of oriented motion (HOOM) extracted from accelerometer signals for classification of convulsive PNES. An automated algorithm based on HOOM is proposed. The algorithm showed a high sensitivity of (93.33%) and an overall accuracy of (80%) in classifying convulsive PNES.	accelerometry;bin;childhood absence epilepsy;classification;coefficient;encode;eighty;electroencephalography phase synchronization;extraction;feature vector;histogram;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;sema5b gene;seizures;sensitivity and specificity;short-time fourier transform;accelerometers;algorithm;electrical activity	Shitanshu Kusmakar;Jayavardhana Gubbi;Aravinda S.

The aim of this research is to measure the performance of the proposed method and determine its usefulness as a signal pre-processing solution.

MIMIC comprises an Expert Module (EM) and a Trainee Module (TM); both modules include six-degree-of-freedom inertial measurement units, microcontrollers, and batteries. The TM also includes actuators that provide the trainee with vibrotactile instructional cues. The estimated expert body motion information is transmitted wirelessly to the trainee; based on the computed difference between the motions of the expert and trainee, directional instructions are displayed to the trainee's skin via vibrotactile stimulation. This study examined anterior-posterior trunk movements using a simplified version of the MIMIC system in which only two actuators were used to provide feedback and pre-recorded target trajectories were used to represent ideal expert movements. The study was designed to investigate the effects of attractive versus repulsive vibrotactile instructional cues when the motion speed and task complexity were varied. Preliminary results (n = 12) suggest that repulsive vibrotactile instructional cues lead to the greatest correlation between expert and subject motion, the least time delay, and the least tilt error.	broadcast delay;dna replication;fermat's principle;gene modules;mimic;microcontroller;motion;movement;patients;transmission process	Beom-Chan Lee;Kathleen H.

Here we introduce a trial system that records and assesses the relationship between mental health and lifestyle habits. Our goal was to develop a system that allows individuals to decide which steps to take for recovery when they develop worrying mental health symptoms, by making comparisons to their past lifestyle habits. This system also allows records of multiple individuals to be entered into a database and analyzed. Such analysis should allow for the creation of indicators for general levels of mental health that may require intervention, as well as the creation of more concrete, practical advice to aid recovery when worrying symptoms appear.	advice (programming);database;nonlinear system	Takahiro Miyagi;Yasuo Shirai;Kazuyoshi Tanaka;Fumiyasu Yamada;Kazuo Sato;Mayumi Oyama-Higa	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811751	mental health;simulation;cybernetics;behavioural sciences;computer science;artificial intelligence;time series;biocybernetics;lyapunov exponent;divergence;neurophysiology;pulse wave;health care;statistics;time	Robotics	17.799757685086288	-85.30866572377569	162668
28231868f5e21dfe76627baa283f7fc63e1f4ca7	a probabilistic neural network approach for prediction of movement and its laterality from deep brain local field potential		Prediction of neural activity relating to movement is essential to understanding and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and cybernetic interfaces. Here we had shown that it is possible to decode deep brain local field potentials (LFPs) related to movements and its laterality, left or right sided visually cued movements using Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) classifier. The frequency related components of LFPs were extracted using the wavelet packet transform (WPT). Then the signal features were computed as the instantaneous power of each band using the Hilbert Transform (HT) with defined windows for motor response. Based on the extracted feature, PNN classifier was designed and evaluated using 10-fold cross validation method to identify the robustness for predicting movements. The Classification accuracy 82.72 ± 7.2 % achieved for distinguishing movement condition from the rest. While for subsequent discrimination of left and right movement, the accuracy reached up to 74.96 ± 10.5 %. Considering the classification performance (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC) curve), PNN classifier successfully achieved better than chance level. The proposed modality and computational process may promisingly effective and powerful method to open up several possibilities for improving BMI applications, diagnosis of chronic neurological disorders and robust monitoring system with propitious result.

While abnormal cardiovascular patterns commonly occur during ictal events, putative patterns of autonomic cardiac effects during pre-ictal (PRE) periods (i.e. periods preceding seizures) are still unknown. In this study, we investigated TLE-related heart rate variability (HRV) through instantaneous, nonlinear estimates of cardiovascular oscillations during inter-ictal (INT) and PRE periods. ECG recordings from 12 patients with TLE were processed to extract standard HRV indices, as well as indices of instantaneous HRV complexity (dominant Lyapunov exponent and entropy) and higher-order statistics (bispectra) obtained through definition of inhomogeneous point-process nonlinear models, employing Volterra-Laguerre expansions of linear, quadratic, and cubic kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that the best INT vs. PRE classification performance (balanced accuracy: 73.91%) was achieved only when retaining the time-varying, nonlinear, and non-stationary structure of heartbeat dynamical features. The proposed approach opens novel important avenues in predicting ictal events using information gathered from cardiovascular signals exclusively.	acoustic lobing;autonomic computing;autonomic nervous system disorders;cessation of life;cubic function;epilepsy;epilepsy, temporal lobe;estimated;heart rate variability;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;patients;point process;quadratic function;seizures;stationary process	Gaetano Valenza;Andrea Romigi;Luca Citi;Fabio Placidi;Francesca Izzi;Maria Albanese;Enzo Pasquale Scilingo;Maria Grazia Marciani;Andrea Duggento;Maria Guerrisi;Nicola Toschi;Riccardo Barbieri	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590867	psychology;neuroscience;heart rate variability;resonance;artificial intelligence;anesthesia;communication;physics;quantum mechanics	Visualization	19.644101539050375	-85.1070878324371	163029
6ed0bf5aedf4d617ddeb890fda77b38f46a2575c	feature extraction method for clock drawing test		Recently, the number of elderly persons with dementia has been increasing. In the past, we proposed a dementia evaluation system using daily conversations and developed the system with a conversational robot. However, the current system is not ready for practical use because it can only evaluate time/geographical orientation and short-term memory, and some methods to evaluate other orientations and functions is required as well. In this paper, we discuss a new dementia evaluation system using not only daily conversations but also drawing tests. The authors employed a Clock Drawing Test (CDT) as a new dementia evaluation test and implemented it in a tablet device. This paper discusses a feature extraction and recognition method to distinguish normal cases from dementia cases. After evaluation experiments, the proposed method could recognize 87.6% of the clock drawing images.	feature extraction	Tomoaki Shigemori;Zainab Harbi;Hiroharu Kawanaka;Yulia Hicks;Rossitza Setchi;Haruhiko Takase;Shinji Tsuruoka	2015		10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.280	simulation;artificial intelligence	EDA	10.415614201132222	-90.67547044621948	163187

A number of commonly-carried genetic variants are associated with obesity. Here we aim to see whether variants in obesity-associated genes--NEGR1, FTO, MTCH2, MC4R, LRRN6C, MAP2K5, FAIM2, SEC16B, ETV5, BDNF-AS, ATXN2L, ATP2A1, KCTD15, and TNN13K--are associated with white matter microstructural properties, assessed by high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) in young healthy adults between 20 and 30 years of age from the Queensland Twin Imaging study (QTIM). We began with a multi-locus approach testing how a number of common genetic risk factors for obesity at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level may jointly influence white matter integrity throughout the brain and found a wide spread genetic effect. Risk allele rs2815752 in NEGR1 was most associated with lower white matter integrity across a substantial portion of the brain. Across the area of significance in the bilateral posterior corona radiata, each additional copy of the risk allele was associated with a 2.2% lower average FA. This is the first study to find an association between an obesity risk gene and differences in white matter integrity. As our subjects were young and healthy, our results suggest that NEGR1 has effects on brain structure independent of its effect on obesity.	angularjs;bilateral filter;brain;diffusion anisotropy;etv5 gene;faim2 gene;fto gene;folic acid;locus;mtch2 gene;negr1 gene;numerous;obesity;single nucleotide polymorphism;white matter	Emily L.

cb4c905bcba6527ef959ba13e33c712c23560a13	high performance wearable two-channel hybrid bci system with eye closure assist	support vector machines;turning;training;electrodes;feature extraction;electroencephalography;switches	Generally, eye closure (EC) and eye opening (EO)-based alpha blocking has widely recognized advantages, such as being easy to use, requiring little user training, while motor imagery (MI) is difficult for some users to have concrete feelings. This study presents a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) combining MI and EC strategies - such an approach aims to overcome some disadvantages of MI-based BCI, improve the performance and universality of the BCI. The EC/EO is employed to control the machine to switch in different states including forward, stop, changing direction motions, while the MI is used to control the machine to turn left or right for 90° by imagining the hands grasp motions when the system is switched into “changing direction” state. Additionally, a wearable two-channel EEG device is utilized in order to increase the efficiency of EEG processing and improving the practical utility. Results show that proposed hybrid system can generate four control commands with the average accuracy of 87.72%, which is higher than only using MI. Besides, it is possible to reach the same good accuracy using two-channel EEG as with usual multi-channel EEG.	blocking (computing);brain neoplasms;brain-computer interfaces;brain–computer interface;cdisc adas-cog - commands summary score;electroencephalography;eye abnormalities;guided imagery;hybrid system;interface device component;motion;numerous;universal turing machine;wearable computer;eye closure	Yubing Jiang;Hyeon-Seok Lee;Gang Li;Nguyen Trung Hau	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7592063	support vector machine;simulation;electroencephalography;feature extraction;network switch;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;electrode;artificial intelligence;machine learning;communication	Robotics	12.11091654567391	-92.28637364364405	163738

It is based on a radial-basis function neural network with Gaussian activations. In order to improve its tracking capabilities, the radial-basis functions location is partially learnt sweep-by-sweep; the training algorithm is effective, though consistent with real-time applications. This new detection method has been tested on simulated data so as to set the network parameters. Moreover, it has been applied to real recordings obtained from a new neuromonitoring technique which is based on the simultaneous observation of the SEP and of the evoked H-reflex elicited by the same electric stimulus. The SEPs have been extracted using the neural network and the results have then been compared to those obtained by ARX filtering and correlated with the spinal cord integrity information obtained by the H-reflex. The proposed algorithm has been proved to be particularly effective and suitable for single-sweep detection. It is able to track both sudden and smooth signal changes of both amplitude and latency and the needed computational time is moderate.	accidental falls;acoustic evoked brain stem potentials;algorithm;arx;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;computation;content-control software;cross reactions;cross-validation (statistics);extraction;galaxy morphological classification;h-reflex;mathematical morphology;normal statistical distribution;online and offline;radial (radio);radial basis function;real-time clock;recovery - action;reflex action;scoliosis, unspecified;simulation;spinal cord;symantec endpoint protection;time complexity;urinary bladder;waveform	Anna C.

47c0e854f31a45b50acbfffb114f14c373099817	epileptic state segmentation with temporal-constrained clustering		Automatic seizure identification plays an important role in epilepsy evaluation. Most existing methods regard seizure identification as a classification problem and rely on labelled training set. However, labelling seizure onset is very expensive and seizure data for each individual is especially limited, classifier-based methods are usually impractical in use. Clustering methods could learn useful information from unlabelled data, while they may lead to unstable results given epileptic signals with high noises. In this paper, we propose to use Gaussian temporal-constrained k-medoids method for seizure state segmentation. Using temporal information, the noises could be effectively suppressed and robust clustering performance is achieved. Besides, a new criterion called signed total variation (STV) which describes temporal integrity and consistency is proposed for temporal-constrained clustering evaluation. Experimental results show that, compared with the existing methods, the k-medoids method with Gaussian temporal constraint achieves the best results on both F1-score and STV.	cluster analysis;constrained clustering;control theory;f1 score;k-medoids;list of sega arcade system boards;medoid;onset (audio);test set	Kang Lin;Yu Qi;Shouhua Feng;Qi Lian;Gang Pan;Yueming Wang	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462070	task analysis;robustness (computer science);constrained clustering;cluster analysis;feature extraction;computer science;gaussian;training set;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;segmentation	Robotics	19.208954180768824	-90.86951017937102	164179

Little is known about the rate of atrophy in specific brain regions in relation to specific clinical deficits. We determined the displacement of the brain surface between two T1-weighted MRI images obtained at baseline and after a median follow-up time of 2.2 years for 79 recently diagnosed, mildly disabled MS patients. Voxel- and cluster-wise permutation-based statistics were used to identify brain regions in which atrophy development was significantly related to Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Timed Walk Test (TWT), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) and 9-Hole Peg Test (HPT). Clusters were considered significant at a corrected cluster-wise p-value of 0.05. Worse EDSS change-score and worse follow-up EDSS were related to atrophy development of periventricular and brainstem regions and right-sided parietal, occipital and temporal regions. Worse PASAT at follow-up was significantly related to atrophy of the ventricles. A worse TWT change-score and worse follow-up TWT were exclusively related to atrophy around the ventricles and of the brainstem. Worse HPT change-score and worse follow-up HPT of either arm were significantly related to the atrophy of widely distributed peripheral regions, as well as atrophy of periventricular and brainstem regions. Our findings suggest that decline in ambulatory function is related to atrophy of central brain regions exclusively, whereas decline in neurologically more complex tasks for coordinated hand function is related to atrophy of both central and peripheral brain regions.	atrophic;baseline (configuration management);brain stem;cerebral ventricles;cerebral atrophy;disabled persons;displacement mapping;hearing problem;kurtzke multiple sclerosis rating scale;p-value;paced auditory serial addition functional test;patients;peripheral;psychologic displacement;seventy nine;status epilepticus;temporal lobe;test case;uptime;voxel;worse is better	Bas Jasperse;Hugo Vrenken;Ernesto J.

This paper proposes a multivariate approach for the discrimination of Normal and Intra Uterine Growth Restricted (IUGR) fetuses based on a small set of parameters computed on the FHR signal. We collected FHR recordings in a population of 120 fetuses (60 normals and 60 IUGRs) at approximately the same gestational week through a standard CTG non-stress test. A set of 8 linear and non-linear indices were selected and computed on each recording, on the basis of their “stand-alone” discriminative properties, demonstrated in previous studies. By using the Orange® data mining suite we checked various multivariate discrimination models. The results show that a Logistic Regression performed on a limited set of only 4 parameters can reach 92.5% accuracy in the correct identification of fetuses, with 93% sensitivity and 91.5% specificity.	arousal;checking (action);data mining;exercise stress test;fetal growth retardation;fetal heart;fetus;logistic regression;nonlinear system;sensitivity and specificity;trusted computer system evaluation criteria;uterus;non stress testing	Giovanni Magenes;Riccardo Bellazzi;Andrea Fanelli;Maria G.

In this paper we propose a new and an efficient framework to recognize pulse signal in nonlinear angle. Firstly the EEMD (ensemble empirical mode decomposition) method is used to filter out baseline drifting noise, and the result is proved to be effective. Then the MFDFA(multi-fractal detrended fluctuation analysis) method is used to get Hurst index, Renyi index and multi-fractal spectrum. Hurst index is related with the long-range correlations, Renyi index is related with the multi-fractal characteristics, and multi-fractal spectrum contains Δa and Δƒ characteristics. Finally, four kinds of pulse signals are recognized by PSO-SVM after extract multi-fractal spectrum feature. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.	baseline (configuration management);detrended fluctuation analysis;feature extraction;fractal;hilbert–huang transform;hurst exponent;nonlinear system;particle swarm optimization;pulse;quantum fluctuation;signal processing	Nan Zhang;Guangqin Hu;Xinfeng Zhang;Wenming Yu;Zheng Yang;Mengru Guo	2016	2016 9th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)	10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2016.7852860	database index;computer vision;speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;fractal;low-pass filter;feature extraction;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;time series;mathematics;quantum mechanics;statistics	Robotics	17.964511554862263	-89.87256465536092	164465

The progression of atherosclerosis is not homogeneous. There must be difference of PWV between sites by site. Therefore we designed a multi-channel instrument to measure PWV at different sites of the body simultaneously. We measured PWV at six different regions simultaneously. Thirty four healthy adults received the measurement. We found that PWVs were higher in the large vessels, by measuring from the heart to toes and heart to fingers as compared with the measurement from the heart to the earlobes (4.76 ± 0.46 m/s; 4.67 ± 0.41 m/s; 1.10 ± 0.16 m/s). The PWV of the left and right sides were the same. Although there were statistically significances, the correlation of PWV between foot and hand is better than those between ear and foot and between ear and hand. Herein we presented a novel and reliable measurement of PWV. The changes of PWV in different regions may be used in predicting disease processes such as stroke, coronary artery diseases and renal diseases, respectively.	arteriopathic disease;atherosclerosis;blood vessel;cerebrovascular accident;color gradient;coronary arteriosclerosis;fingers, unit of measurement;kidney diseases;meter per second;numerous;photoplethysmography;pulse wave velocity;toes;velocity (software development)	An-Bang Liu;Po-chun Hsu;Zong-Li Chen;Hsien-Tsai Wu	2010	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-010-9469-0	medicine;photoplethysmogram;diabetes mellitus;surgery;cardiology	HCI	14.761288389371233	-84.62506960043272	164558

This lack of transparency poses a challenge for comparison of historical accelerometer data in counts with data collected using raw accelerometry in S.I. units — m/s2. The purpose of this study was to develop a method that facilitates the compatibility between both methods through conversion of raw accelerometer output data collected with inertial acceleration sensors into Actigraph counts — the most widely used (de facto standard) device brand in epidemiological studies. The basics of the conversion algorithm were captured from the technical specifications of the Actigraph GT1M. Fine-tuning of the algorithm was achieved empirically under controlled conditions using a mechanical shaker device. A pilot evaluation was carried out through physical activity monitoring in free-living scenarios of 19 adult participants (age: 47 ± 11 yrs, BMI: 25.2 ± 4.1 kg-m−2) wearing both devices. The results show that Actigraph counts estimated by the proposed method explain 94.2% of the variation in Actigraph counts (p < 0.001). The concordance correlation coefficient was 0.93 (p < 0.05). The sensitivity for classifying intensity ranged from 93.4% for light physical activity to 70.7% for moderate physical activity.	algorithm;brain–computer interface;coefficient;concordance (publishing);sensor;signal processing	Vincent T. van Hees;Marcelo Pias;Salman Taherian;Ulf Ekelund;Søren Brage	2010	"""2010 IEEE International Symposium on """"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks"""" (WoWMoM)"""	10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5534986	acceleration;embedded system;data processing;computer science;sensor;biomechanics;signal processing;remote patient monitoring;band-pass filter;physical fitness;accelerometer;statistics;data collection	Mobile	11.509838193568541	-86.58669501669155	164771

Eight developmental stages are proposed: Infant I, II and III, Juvenile I and II, Sub adult, Young adult and Older adult. This classification is consistent with the first appearance of several behavioural and physiological characteristics and thus may have generality in defining critical developmental periods. It also reveals differences in male and female development and establishes a stage for the onset of the final adult life cycle. This classification is also important to understanding the biology of the ontogenetic development of common marmosets, providing new insights for the management and care of captive animals and improving age estimate indicators when specimens are captured in long term monitoring of free ranging groups.	algorithm;artificial neural network;callithrix jacchus x penicillata;captive portal;care-of address;k-means clustering;onset (audio);organizing (structure);scheuermann's disease;self-organization;self-organizing map;specimen	Adriano de Castro Leão;Adrião Duarte Dória Neto;Maria Bernardete Cordeiro de Sousa	2009	Computers in biology and medicine	10.1016/j.compbiomed.2009.05.009	biological life cycle;young adult;biological classification;computer science;artificial intelligence;ontogeny;machine learning;weight;artificial neural network;k-means clustering	ML	23.09482467605631	-87.37787160740787	164953
05881d76facde21bf2cab6a9fe95a8b37705f8a7	effects of age, bmi, anxiety and stress on the parameters of a stochastic model for heart rate variability including respiratory information		Recent studies have focused on investigating different factors that may affect heart rate variability (HRV), pointing especially to the effects of age, gender and stress level. Other findings raise the importance of considering the respiratory frequency in the analysis of HRV signals. In this study, we evaluate the effect of several covariates on the parameters of a stochastic model for HRV. The data was recorded from 47 test participants, whose breathing was controlled by following a metronome with increasing frequency. This setup allows for a controlled acquisition of respiratory related HRV data covering the frequency range in which adults breathe in different everyday situations. A stochastic model, known as Locally Stationary Chirp Process, accounts for the respiratory signal information and models the HRV data. The model parameters are estimated with a novel inference method based on the separability features possessed by the process covariance function. Least square regression analysis using several available covariates is used to investigate the correlation with the stochastic model parameters. The results show statistically significant correlation of the model parameters with age, BMI, State and Trait Anxiety as well as stress level.	brain–computer interface;chirp;declaration (computer programming);frequency band;heart rate variability;kerrison predictor;linear separability;review board;stationary process	Rachele Anderson;Peter Jönsson;Maria Sandsten	2018		10.5220/0006512900170025	computer science;regression analysis;metronome;statistics;stochastic modelling;artificial intelligence;logistic regression;heart rate variability;pattern recognition;covariance function;correlation;covariate	HCI	13.38604065830153	-88.09180662915185	165016

Cross-sample entropy (C-SampEn) has been used to quantify their synchronization. However, traditional C-SampEn has a poor statistical stability because a rigid decision rule is applied to define the similarity between two vectors. In this study, a fuzzy membership function was implemented to redefine the decision rule in C-SampEn with its performance evaluated using simulated and real cardiovascular coupling signals (RR interval and pulse transit time sequences from 10 normal subjects and 10 heart failure patients). Simulation results verified the decrease of both C-SampEn with increasing coupling degree. The analysis of cardiovascular coupling signals demonstrated a significant difference between normal and heart failure patients (normal 1.17 ± 0.09 vs. heart failure 1.02 ± 0.10, P<;0.01) with the improved C-SampEn, but not the traditional C-SampEn. Our improved C-SampEn provides a better understanding of the different cardiovascular coupling between normal subjects and heart failure patients.	bivariate data;heart failure;muscle rigidity;patients;rapid refresh;round-robin scheduling;sample entropy;simulation	Chengyu Liu;Dingchang Zheng;Peng Kai Li;Lina Zhao;Alan Murray	2013	Computing in Cardiology 2013		electronic engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics	PL	18.731307397193817	-84.98255035747013	165132

One night sleep PSG and sleep macro- micro structure annotations were available per subject. The statistical properties and the dynamics of CAP events are in focus. Multiscale and non-linear methods are presented for the analysis of the microstructure event time series, applied for each type of CAP events, and their combination. The results suggest that a) both types of insomnia present CAP differences from normal sleep related to hyperarousal, b) sleep misperception presents more extensive differences from normal, potentially reflecting multiple sleep mechanisms, c) there are differences between the two types of insomnia as regard to the intertwining of events of different subtypes. The analysis constitutes a contribution towards new markers for the quantitative characterization of insomnia, and its subtypes.	emoticon;nonlinear system;phrase structure grammar;psychophysiologic disorders;sleep apnea syndromes;sleeplessness;subtype (attribute);time series;wake-sleep algorithm	Ioanna Chouvarda;Andrea Grassi;Martin O.

Different human's emotional states are recognizable by measuring and interpreting of human physiological signals. Bio-sensors possess a number of advantages against other emotion recognition methods as they are relatively more consistent across cultures and nations. Emotions have a serious effect on driving. Human beings in negative and sometimes positive emotional states can be distracted which will increase the risk of driving. This paper presents an EEG-based emotion recognition system. Mutual information and magnitude squared coherence are applied to investigate the interconnectivity between 8 scalp regions. A study was performed to collect 8 channels of EEG data from 26 healthy right-handed subjects in experiencing 4 emotional states while exposed to audio-visual emotional stimuli. After feature extraction, 5-fold cross-validation was then performed using the KNN and SVM classifier. The results showed existence of different kind of functional brain connectivity in different emotional states.	cross-validation (statistics);driving simulator;electroencephalography;emotion markup language;emotion recognition;feature extraction;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;mutual information;resting state fmri;sensor	Reza Khosrowabadi;Michel J H Heijnen;Abdul Wahab;Hiok Chai Quek	2010	2010 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium	10.1109/IVS.2010.5548102	psychology;computer vision;speech recognition;communication	AI	17.59436113099344	-92.43906532155121	165546

a61c8fb1347e98f52da04c053e84a67faba8f68d	detection of generalized synchronization using echo state networks		Generalized synchronization between coupled dynamical systems is a phenomenon of relevance in applications that range from secure communications to physiological modelling. Here, we test the capabilities of reservoir computing and, in particular, echo state networks for the detection of generalized synchronization. A nonlinear dynamical system consisting of two coupled Rössler chaotic attractors is used to generate temporal series consisting of time-locked generalized synchronized sequences interleaved with unsynchronized ones. Correctly tuned, echo state networks are able to efficiently discriminate between unsynchronized and synchronized sequences even in the presence of relatively high levels of noise. Compared to other state-of-the-art techniques of synchronization detection, the online capabilities of the proposed Echo State Network based methodology make it a promising choice for real-time applications aiming to monitor dynamical synchronization changes in continuous signals.	dynamical system;echo state network;nonlinear system;real-time transcription;relevance;reservoir device component;reservoir computing;rössler attractor;secure communication	David Ibanez-Soria;Jordi García-Ojalvo;Aureli Soria-Frisch;Giulio Ruffini	2018	Chaos	10.1063/1.5010285	dynamical system;control theory;dynamical systems theory;nonlinear system;synchronization;reservoir computing;mathematics;attractor;echo state network;phenomenon	Metrics	21.497059640685645	-86.15042312052546	165838

In this study, differences in muscle activities and joint force patterns between knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients and normal subjects during walking were investigated using the inverse dynamic analysis with a lower extremity musculoskeletal model. Extensor/flexor muscle activations and torque ratios and the joint contact forces were compared between the OA and normal groups. The OA patients had higher extensor muscle forces and lateral component of the knee joint force than normal subjects as well as force and torque ratios of extensor and flexor muscles, while the other parameters had little differences. The results explained that OA patients increased the level of antagonistic cocontraction and the adduction moment on the knee joint. The presented findings and technologies provide insight into biomechanical changes in OA patients and can also be used to evaluate the postoperative functional outcomes of the OA treatments.	computation;degenerative polyarthritis;knee joint;lateral thinking;limb structure;lower extremity;mathematical optimization;motion capture;muscle;osteoarthritis, knee;patients	Kyung Wook Nha;Ariunzaya Dorj;Jun Feng;Jun Ho Shin;Jong In Kim;Jae Ho Kwon;Kyungsoo Kim;Yoon Hyuk Kim	2013		10.1155/2013/314280	case-control study;medicine;physical therapy;gait;anatomy;surgery	HCI	13.702666297847212	-83.54325015214351	165849

Most works employed spike sorting to obtain the single units (SUs) for decoding from the extracellular electrode recordings. However, spike sorting is difficult, computational demanding, and is often limited by the spike waveform variability especially in low SNR and high neuronal density conditions. To address these issues, we proposed a decoding method using unsorted spike trains from recording electrodes based on the maximal likelihood (ML) estimation approach. An experiment was performed to test neuronal data recorded from a rhesus monkey performing the center-out movement task of eight targets. The results showed that the proposed method yielded average correct decoding rate of 98.5% compared to the SU based method that yielded correct decoding rate of 96.3%. The results also showed that the proposed method yielded improved computational efficiency. Thus the proposed method showed potential for real time BCI applications with large scale of neuronal recordings.	action potential;brain–computer interface;computation;heart rate variability;maximal set;neural decoding;signal-to-noise ratio;sorting;the spike (1997);waveform	Zhiming Xu;Kai Keng Ang;Cuntai Guan	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6637790	brain–computer interface;speech recognition;neural decoding;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;maximum likelihood;artificial neural network;statistics	ML	13.714401217468312	-92.21657430023393	165988

Several methods to enhance the SNR are known from literature, e.g. wavelet-based enhancement methods, but most of these methods require a priori information on the recorded signals and are only applicable in specific situations. In this paper a generic method is presented that uses latency variable source separation (LVSS) to derive a matched filter for enhancement of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Besides its use on ECG signals, the LVSS method has the potential capability to enhance any kind of (quasi-) periodical signal. The LVSS method is evaluated by comparing its performance in SNR enhancement to the performance of a wavelet-based enhancement method. This performance demonstrates that for low-SNR ECG signals, the LVSS method outperforms the wavelet-based method.	common variable immunodeficiency;electrocardiography;generic drugs;interrupt latency;matched filter;periodicals;signal-to-noise ratio;source separation;wavelet	Rik Vullings;Michael Johannes Rooijakkers;Massimo Mischi	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091753	electronic engineering;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;matched filter;statistics	Robotics	18.964002270058614	-88.5291293852457	165989

The Kinect is a low cost ($100) sensor that does not require any markers to be placed on the user. Integration of this sensor into currently used therapy systems can provide feedback about the user's movement quality, and the use of compensatory strategies to complete tasks. This paper presents a novel technique of adding the Kinect to an end effector robot to limit compensation strategies and to train normal joint coordination during movements with an end effector robot. This methodology has wider implications for other robotic and passively actuated end effector rehabilitation devices.	inverse kinematics;kinect;movement;robot (device);robot end effector	Elizabeth B.

In principle, EMG signals and the position information are merged with each other based on the distance-threshold relationship. The merged information can be used to control the power of active surgical instruments intelligently or to improve the surgeon's orientation in operating field during challenging interventions on temporal bones. One part of the described method for stimulation modeling was also verified in an experiment under simplified laboratory conditions. The results show an approximate agreement between the modeled and the measured “distance-threshold” relationship till 2 mm. The curve fitting of the measured and modeled data indicates that a quadratic relationship fits better in the data than a cubic.	approximation algorithm;artificial intelligence;cubic function;curve fitting;electromyography;experiment;fits;transcranial magnetic stimulation	Jiaxi Shi;Tim Lüth	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)	10.1109/MFI.2012.6343028	computer vision;engineering;biological engineering;surgery	Robotics	12.919261684715645	-85.28490609972691	166234

Inhalation Breath Length (IBL) was 1.35 s without HME and 1.05 s with HME (P < 0.0001). With HME, end-inspiratory (minimum) humidity values increased 5.8 mg H2O/L (P < 0.0001) and minimum temperature values decreased 1.6°C (P < 0.0001). For the temperature and humidity minimums, the inter-patient variability was much smaller than the short- and long-term intra-patient variability. For exhalation breath length and full breath length, the opposite was the case. Conclusions: (1) Because inter-patient variability is smaller than intra-patient variability, investigating endotracheal climate in a limited number of laryngectomized subjects is justified, provided repeated measurements per patient are accomplished; (2) main contributor to intra-patient variability is the positioning of the catheter tip in the trachea; (3) an HME leads to a shortened IBL which enhances the HME effect.	doppler effect;dyspnea;expiration, function;exposure to humidity;futures studies;gradient;halitosis;heart rate variability;inspiration function;patients;perseveration;protocols documentation;repositioning (procedure);small;spatial variability;trachea;turbulence;water;elliptinium;observers	R.

95a3a365e4ff5017d27b336cfc19b6f6e7fb4e72	short- and long-term quantitation reproducibility of brain metabolites in the medial wall using proton echo planar spectroscopic imaging	sagittal 2d mrsi;pepsi;glutamine;te averaging;glutamate;cingulate	Proton echo planar spectroscopic imaging (PEPSI) is a fast magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) technique that allows mapping spatial metabolite distributions in the brain. Although the medial wall of the cortex is involved in a wide range of pathological conditions, previous MRSI studies have not focused on this region. To decide the magnitude of metabolic changes to be considered significant in this region, the reproducibility of the method needs to be established. The study aims were to establish the short- and long-term reproducibility of metabolites in the right medial wall and to compare regional differences using a constant short-echo time (TE30) and TE averaging (TEavg) optimized to yield glutamatergic information. 2D sagittal PEPSI was implemented at 3T using a 32 channel head coil. Acquisitions were repeated immediately and after approximately 2 weeks to assess the coefficients of variation (COV). COVs were obtained from eight regions-of-interest (ROIs) of varying size and location. TE30 resulted in better spectral quality and similar or lower quantitation uncertainty for all metabolites except glutamate (Glu). When Glu and glutamine (Gln) were quantified together (Glx) reduced quantitation uncertainty and increased reproducibility was observed for TE30. TEavg resulted in lowered quantitation uncertainty for Glu but in less reliable quantification of several other metabolites. TEavg did not result in a systematically improved short- or long-term reproducibility for Glu. The ROI volume was a major factor influencing reproducibility. For both short- and long-term repetitions, the Glu COVs obtained with TEavg were 5-8% for the large ROIs, 12-17% for the medium sized ROIs and 16-26% for the smaller cingulate ROIs. COVs obtained with TE30 for the less specific Glx were 3-5%, 8-10% and 10-15%. COVs for N-acetyl aspartate, creatine and choline using TE30 with long-term repetition were between 2-10%. Our results show that the cost of more specific glutamatergic information (Glu versus Glx) is the requirement of an increased effect size especially with increasing anatomical specificity. This comes in addition to the loss of sensitivity for other metabolites. Encouraging results were obtained with TE30 compared to other previously reported MRSI studies. The protocols implemented here are reliable and may be used to study disease progression and intervention mechanisms.	aspartate transaminase;aspartic acid;averaging argument;cdisc sdtm anatomical location terminology;choline;coefficient;coil device component;color gradient;creatine;echo-planar imaging;glx;glutamic acid;glutamine;gyrus cinguli;heart rate variability;medial graph;metabolic process, cellular;metabolite;n-acetylaspartate;other toxicity studies: metabolites;perseveration;progressive disease;protocols documentation;protons;quantitation;ray (optics);region of interest;sagittal plane;sampling - surgical action;sensitivity and specificity;tellurium;test engineer;the wall street journal;magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging	Shang-Yueh Tsai;Yi-Ru Lin;Woan-Chyi Wang;David M.

366099e3cc5edd527c84d07bf767ea284b3fd576	analysis of an electrocardiographic multilead system by means of artificial neural networks - study of repolarization during premature ventricular stimulation		The ventricular repolarization dispersion (VRD) has been shown to increase with premature stimulation. Moreover, several differences between left ventricular and right ventricular, such as the anatomic properties and fibrillation threshold have been reported. However, few data exist regarding the influence of the site of stimulation on modulation of VRD measure by electrocardiographic. In the present work, several ECG indices of VRD, as a function of the coupling interval and the site of stimulation, were studied in an isolated heart rabbit preparation (n=18), using ECG multilead (5 rows x 8 columns) system with Artificial Neural Networks. In both ventricles, results have shown significant decreases in early repolarization duration, while in the left ventricle we have found significant increases of transmural dispersion. Also, we have observed that when the premature stimuli were applied to the left ventricle, the ventricular repolarization dispersion changes were detected using only one preferential electrode (row1-column3). When stimuli were elicited at the right ventricle, changes of VRD were detected by three electrodes (row3-column1, row2-column1 and row3-column8). Finally, a different ventricular repolarization dispersion was found as a function of the site of stimulation.	artificial neural network;atmospheric dispersion modeling;column (database);douady rabbit;modulation;neural networks;neurotrophic electrode;signal processing;virtual retinal display	Drago Torkar;Pedro David Arini	2016		10.5220/0005663200340041		ML	18.766693023774604	-82.50643298720058	166522

Identification of a recurrent electrical ladder network model of the lungs, which incorporates their specific morphology and anatomical structure, is performed on 31 healthy subjects. The data for identification has been gathered using the forced oscillation lung function test, which delivers a non-parametric model of the impedance. On the measured frequency response, the ladder network parameters have been identified and a fractional order has been calculated from the recurrent ratios of the respiratory mechanics (resistance and compliance). The paper includes also a comparison of our recurrent parameter model with another parametric model for high frequency range. The results suggest that the two models can equally well characterize the respiratory impedance over a long range of frequencies. Additionally, we have shown that the fractional order resulting from the recurrent properties of resistance and compliance in the ladder network model is independent of frequency and is not biased by the nose clip wore by the patients during measurements. An illustrative example shows that our re-visited model is sensitive to changes in respiratory mechanics and the fractional order value is a reliable parameter to capture these changes.	anatomic structures;apriori algorithm;clip, nose;characteristic impedance;electronic filter topology;frequency band;frequency response;galaxy morphological classification;mandibular right second molar tooth;mathematical morphology;network model;nominal impedance;parametric model;patients;population parameter;quantitative impedance;respiratory insufficiency;respiratory mechanics;respiratory physiology;scientific publication;structure of parenchyma of lung	Clara M.

However, the relevance of white matter (WM) diffusion properties of the ventral and dorsal frontostriatal tracts for behaviors associated with smoking remains relatively unknown, especially in young adulthood, a critical time period for the development and maintenance of addiction. Here, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and probabilistic tractography were used to investigate the WM tracts of the ventral and dorsal frontostriatal circuits in two independent studies (Study1: 36 male smokers (21.3 ± 1.3 years) vs. 35 male nonsmokers (21.2 ± 1.3 years); Study2: 29 male smokers (21.4 ± 1.1 years) vs. 25 male nonsmokers (21.0 ± 1.4 years)). Subjective craving was measured by the Questionnaire on Smoking Urges (QSU) and cognitive control ability was assessed with the Stroop task. In both studies, smokers committed more response errors than nonsmokers during the incongruent condition of the Stroop task. Relative to controls, smokers showed lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher radial diffusivity in left medial orbitofrontal cortex-to-nucleus accumbens fiber tracts (ventral frontostriatal path) and also lower FA in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-to-caudate fiber tracts (dorsal frontostriatal path). The FA values of the right dorsal fibers were negatively correlated with incongruent response Stroop errors in smokers, whereas the mean diffusivity values of the left ventral fibers were positively correlated with craving in smokers. Thus, WM diffusion properties of the dorsal and ventral frontostriatal tracts were associated with cognitive control and craving, respectively, in young male tobacco smokers. These data highlight the importance of studying WM in relation to neuropsychological changes underlying smoking.	addictive behavior;cell nucleus;craving;diffusion tensor imaging;fractional anisotropy;medial graph;nucleus accumbens;prefrontal cortex;radial (radio);relevance;smoke;teratozoospermia;tissue fiber;white matter	Kai Yuan;Dahua Yu;Meng Zhao;Min Li;Ruonan Wang;Yangding Li;Peter Manza;Ehsan Shokri-Kojori;Corinde E.

Recently, acute interventions have also been demonstrated in human patients. Our previous work on a vestibular implant for humans used predefined stimulation patterns; here we present a research tool that facilitates motion-modulated stimulation. This requires a system that can process gyroscope measurements and send stimulation parameters to a hybrid vestibular-cochlear implant in real-time. To match natural vestibular latencies, the time from sensor input to stimulation output should not exceed 6.5 ms. We describe a system based on National Instrument's CompactRIO platform that can meet this requirement and also offers floating point precision for advanced transfer functions. It is designed for acute clinical interventions, and is sufficiently powerful and flexible to serve as a development platform for evaluating prosthetic control strategies. Amplitude and pulse frequency modulation to predetermined functions or sensor inputs have been validated. The system has been connected to human patients, who each have received a modified MED-EL cochlear implant for vestibular stimulation, and patient tests are ongoing.	am antigen;am broadcasting;angularjs;animal model;brain implant;cochlear implant;compactrio;computation;experiment;eye movements;fm broadcasting;fetal measurements domain;float;gyro;graphical user interface;gyroscope;interface device component;nystagmus;patients;programming paradigm;prosthesis implantation;pulse-width modulation;real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;transfer function;wearable computer	T.

6047fe134182ea2fc3cbaab2af5116b855bfb9f8	spiking-neural-network based fugl-meyer hand gesture recognition for wearable hand rehabilitation robot		Hand rehabilitation robot can assist the patients in completing rehabilitation exercises. Usually these rehabilitation exercises are designed according to Fugl-Meyer Assessment(FMA). Surface electromyography(sEMG) signal is the most commonly used physiological signal to identify the patient’s movement intention. However, recognizing the hand gesture based on the sEMG signal is still a challenging problem due to the low amplitude and non-stationary characteristics of the sEMG signal. In this paper, eight standard hand movements in FMA are selected for the active exercises by hand rehabilitation robots. A total of 15 volunteers’ sEMG signals are collected in the course of the experiment. Four time domain features, integral EMG(IEGM), root mean square(RMS), zero crossings(ZC) and energy percentage(EP), are used to identify hand gestures. A feedforward spiking neural network receives the above time domain feature data, and combines the population coding with the Spikeprop learning algorithm to realize the accurate recognition of hand gestures. The experimental results show that: (1) the spiking neural network can achieve a satisfactory classification accuracy by using only 15 neurons; (2) the classification accuracy using all four features are highest with an accuracy of 96.5%; (3) under the same number of neurons, the classification accuracy of the spiking neural network is higher than that of the multilayer perceptron, radial basis function network and support vector machine. This demonstrates the fact that spiking neural networks can achieve a satisfactory classification accuracy with a smaller network size.	algorithm;artificial neural network;fma instruction set;feature data;feedforward neural network;gesture recognition;meyer wavelet;multilayer perceptron;neural coding;radial (radio);radial basis function network;robot;spiking neural network;stationary process;support vector machine;turbulence kinetic energy;zero crossing	Nabila Farabi;Med Ahmed Sidi Ahmed	2018	2018 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489141	artificial intelligence;support vector machine;gesture recognition;spiking neural network;rehabilitation robotics;machine learning;pattern recognition;neural coding;time domain;computer science;multilayer perceptron;radial basis function network	AI	12.848026882961081	-92.12409483797664	167099

The structure of a feed forward neural network with two layers and a learning rule designed for the task of Blind Signal Separation (BSS) is used to separate temporarily overlapping neuron activities in the brain. Based on the separated signals, the task of the second type of neural network is to determine the position and strength of the different, underlying magnetic dipoles.

TMS can be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) to visualize regional brain activity in response to direct cortical stimulation, making it a promising tool for studying brain function. A technical drawback of EEG/TMS coregistrations is that the TMS impulse generates high amplitude and long-lasting artifacts that corrupt the EEG trace. In this brief, an offline Kalman filter approach to remove TMS-induced artifacts from EEG recordings is proposed. The Kalman filter is applied to the linear system arising from the combination of the dynamic models describing EEG and TMS signals generation. Time-varying covariance matrices suitably tuned on the physical parameters of the problem allow us to model the non-stationary components of the EEG/TMS signal, (neglected by conventional stationary filters). Experimental results show that the proposed approach guarantees an efficient deletion of TMS-induced artifacts while preserving the integrity of EEG signals around TMS impulses.	algorithm;ar (unix);artifact (software development);autoregressive model;effective method;electroencephalography;information engineering;kalman filter;linear system;nonlinear system;online and offline;state space;stationary process;transcranial magnetic stimulation	Fabio Morbidi;Andrea Garulli;Domenico Prattichizzo;Cristiano Rizzo;Simone Rossi	2008	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2008.921814	kalman filter;magnetic field;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics;linear system	ML	22.31107136049706	-91.65313229097158	168228

The extraction of such stimulus-unlocked components has been difficult owing to the unknown delays. Here, we propose a novel method to extract both of the two components from single-channel EEG epochs. In this method, we initially set random values for the delays and extract uncontaminated stimulus-locked and -unlocked components using the preset delays and a discrete Fourier transform. Then, we reconstruct the EEG by overlapping the extracted components with the preset delays, and calculate the residual errors between the reconstructed and original EEG. This procedure is repeated by updating the delays until the residual errors become adequately small. After verifying the performance of this method by two kinds of simulations with artificial and EEG data, we apply the method to EEG during NoGo trials of a Go/NoGo task, and obtain the stimulus-unlocked components, the magnitudes of which are comparable with those of the stimulus-locked components. By applying this method, it is possible to study internal and subjective brain activity, which occurs with variable delays.	cognition disorders;discrete fourier transform;electroencephalography;extraction;onset (audio);simulation;verification and validation;verifying specimen	Yusuke Takeda;Kentaro Yamanaka;Daichi Nozaki;Yoshiharu Yamamoto	2008	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.03.012	psychology;mental chronometry;neuroscience;speech recognition;radiology;electroencephalography;artificial intelligence;discrete fourier transform;communication	ML	17.832472204076986	-87.25524225052324	168392

Five min of the resting spontaneous EEG and the ERP in an auditory oddball task were recorded at P4 site in 16 early AD patients and 16 age-matched normal subjects. EEG and ERP were analyzed to compute their 28 statistical and 2 nonlinear features as well as 88 spectral features and 10 ERP features, to make a feature pool for each 30-s segment of the recording data. The combined GA/ANN was applied to find the minimal set of the dominant features from the feature pool that are most efficient to classify into two groups automatically. The effective 35 features were found and used as inputs of the artificial neural network. The recognition rate of ANN fed by these input was 81.9% for untrained data set. These results suggest that the combined GA/ANN approach may be useful for early detection of AD and that single channel EEG data might be enough to recognize AD. This approach could be extended to a reliable classification system using EEG recording that can discriminate between groups.	artificial neural network;electroencephalography;genetic algorithm	Hyun Taek Kim;Bo Yeon Kim;Eun Hye Park;Jong Woo Kim;Eui Whan Hwang;Seung Kee Han;Sunyoung Cho	2005	Future Generation Comp.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the neuroelectrical correlates of brain activity of the observation of real paintings showed in a national fine arts gallery (Scuderie del Quirinale) in Rome, Italy. In fact, the present study was designed to examine how motivational factors as indexed by EEG asymmetry over the prefrontal cortex (relative activity of the left and right hemispheres) could be related to the experience of viewing a series of figurative paintings. The fine arts gallery was visited by a group of 25 subjects during an exhibition of the XVII century Dutch painters. Results suggested a strict correlation of the estimated EEG asymmetry with the verbal pleasantness scores reported by the subjects (p<;0,05) and an inverse correlation of the perceived pleasantness with the observed painting's surface dimensions (d<;0,002).	base;cerebral cortex;chromosome deletion;dimensions;electroencephalography;index	Francesca Babiloni;Patrizia Cherubino;Ilenia Graziani;Arianna Trettel;Francesco Infarinato;Daniela Picconi;Gianluca Borghini;Anton Giulio Maglione;Donatella Mattia;Giovanni Vecchiato	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610964	psychology;computer vision;neuroscience;medicine;electroencephalography;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;neurophysiology	Visualization	15.497998468780773	-80.83821781211385	169115
eb89720a32ebef2bcf7f3e298886a39b61ab6bde	classification of voluntary coughs applied to the screening of respiratory disease		Pulmonary and respiratory diseases (e.g. asthma, COPD, allergies, pneumonia, tuberculosis, etc.) represent a large proportion of the global disease burden, mortality, and disability. In this context of creating automated diagnostic tools, we explore how the analysis of voluntary cough sounds may be used to screen for pulmonary disease. As a clinical study, voluntary coughs were recorded using a custom mobile phone stethoscope from 54 patients, of which 7 had COPD, 15 had asthma, 11 had allergic rhinitis, 17 had both asthma and allergic rhinitis, and four had both COPD and allergic rhinitis. Data were also collected from 33 healthy subjects. These patients also received full auscultation at 11 sites, given a clinical questionnaire, and underwent full pulmonary function testing (spirometer, body plethysmograph, DLCO) which culminated in a diagnosis provided by an experienced pulmonologist. From machine learning analysis of these data, we show that it is possible to achieve good classification of cough sounds in terms of Wet vs Dry, yielding an ROC curve with AUC of 0.94, and show that voluntary coughs can serve as an effective test for determining Healthy vs Unhealthy (sensitivity=35.7% specificity=100%). We also show that the use of cough sounds can enhance the performance of other diagnostic tools such as a patient questionnaire and peak flow meter; however voluntary coughs alone provide relatively little value in determining specific disease diagnosis.	allergic rhinitis (disorder);area under curve;auscultation;carbon monoxide diffusing capability test;chronic obstructive airway disease;classification;coughing;drug allergy;hypersensitivity;lung diseases;machine learning;mobile phone;patients;peak flow meter (device);pneumonia;receiver operating characteristic;respiration disorders;respiratory tract diseases;sensor;spirometer device component;stethoscopes	Christian Infante;Daniel B.

In this work, the benefit of accelerometer signals is demonstrated on a large scale movement classification task, consisting of 40 hand and wrist movements obtained from 20 subjects. The results demonstrate that the accelerometer modality is indeed highly informative and even outperforms surface electromyography in terms of classification accuracy. The highest accuracy, however, is obtained when both modalities are integrated in a multi-modal classifier.	electromyography;information;modal logic;modality (human–computer interaction);movement;numerous;prosthesis;accelerometers	Arjan Gijsberts;Barbara Caputo	2013	2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR)	10.1109/ICORR.2013.6650476	computer vision;speech recognition;engineering;artificial intelligence	Robotics	12.467032503819198	-92.4945008815982	169857

Motor function over a twenty-nine year period of selective stimulation of the CPN with an implantable stimulator to correct drop-foot in a 56 year old patient with left-sided hemiplegia, was evaluated. Partial restoration of dorsal flexion and well balanced eversion of the affected foot was achieved by selective stimulation of superficial region of the CPN innervating mostly the tibialis anterior and partly peroneus longus and peroneus brevis muscles. It was shown that the system is suitable for very long-term FES providing improved muscle function. Namely, even after 29 years of daily FES of the CPN, a functional and reliable recruitment of fibres within the CPN was still achieved, thus providing an appropriate dorsal flexion and eversion of the affected foot. It was found that the stimulation-associated-mechanical trauma to the CPN elicited some minor non-age-related loss of the larger myelinated nerve fibres. Electrophysiological and biomechanical measurements however, have not revealed any functional signs which could be attributed to the damage of the CPN.	circuit restoration;coloured petri net;common criteria;eversion;functional electrical stimulation;shin megami tensei: persona 3;the superficial	Polona Pečlin;J.

Because if its high sampling frequency requirement, wireless transmission of sEMG data is a challenge. In this article a wireless sEMG measurement system with a sampling frequency of 2 KHz is developed based upon a MSP 430 microcontroller and Bluetooth transmission. Standard isotonic and isometric muscle contraction are clearly represented in the receiving user interface. Muscle fatigue detection is an important application of sEMG. Traditional muscle fatigue is detected from the median frequency of the sEMG power spectrum. The regression slope of the linear regression of median frequency is an important muscle fatigue index. A more negative slope value represents a higher muscle fatigue condition. To test the system performance, muscle fatigue detection was examined by having subjects run on a pedaled-multifunctional elliptical trainer for approximately 30 minutes at three loading levels. Ten subjects underwent a total of 60 exercise sessions to provide the experimental data. Results showed that the regression slope gradually decreases as expected, and there is a significant gender difference.	bluetooth;cns disorder;chronic fatigue syndrome;coefficient;exercise;frequency response;isometric contraction;isometric projection;isotonic regression;kilohertz;linear iga bullous dermatosis;max;microcontroller;multi-function printer;muscle contraction;myalgia;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;sex characteristics;spectral density;surface electromyography;system of measurement;user interface device component;value (computer science)	Kang-Ming Chang;Shing-Hong Liu;Xuan-Han Wu	2012		10.3390/s120100489	electronic engineering;simulation;young adult;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;bluetooth;regression analysis	Mobile	14.245832927412438	-85.3064859697213	170044

Two components of spectral entropy are calculated: state entropy (SE) and response entropy (RE). Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a less invasive treatment for patients suffering from symptomatic aortic stenosis with contraindications for open heart surgery. The goal of hemodynamic management during the procedure is to achieve hemodynamic stability with exact blood pressure control and use of rapid ventricular pacing (RVP) that result in severe hypotension. The objective of this study was to examine how the spectral entropy values respond to RVP and other critical events during the TAVI procedure. Twenty one patients undergoing general anesthesia for TAVI were evaluated. The RVP was used twice during the procedure at a rate of 185 ± 9/min with durations of 16 ± 4 s (range 8–22 s) and 24 ± 6 s (range 18–39 s). The systolic blood pressure during RVP was under 50 ± 5 mmHg. Spectral entropy values SE were significantly declined during the RVP procedure, from 28 ± 13 to 23 ± 13 (p < 0.003) and from 29 ± 12 to 24 ± 10 (p < 0.001). The corresponding values for RE were 29 ± 13 vs. 24 ± 13 (p < 0.006) and 30 ± 12 vs. 25 ± 10 (p < 0.001). Both SE and RE values returned to the pre-RVP values after 1 min. Ultra-short hypotension during RVP changed the spectral entropy parameters, however these indices reverted rapidly to the same value before application of RVP.	electroencephalography;entropy (information theory);fleming valve;hemodynamics;ion implantation;maxima and minima	Tadeusz Musialowicz;Antti Valtola;Mikko Hippeläinen;Jari Halonen;Pasi Lahtinen	2017	Entropy	10.3390/e19030133	hemodynamics;signal processing;mathematics;heart	HCI	16.71456784751599	-84.79958761040908	170371

Bicoherence changes were most prominent in the gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency band, and allowed for the differentiation between seizure and non-seizure states in all patients studied (n=3). While gamma band BIC values increased during seizure activity, this trend was only observed in a select number of electrode(s) located on the implanted patient subdural grids. Several studies have suggested that fast frequencies may play a role in the process of seizure genesis. While the small patient numbers limit the significance of our study, our results highlight the bicoherence of the gamma frequency band (30-80 Hz) as an ictal identifier, and suggest an active role of this fast frequency during seizures.	bayesian information criterion;eighty;epilepsy;frequency band;genesis;hl7 defined rose property - identifier;hertz (hz);implants;interaction;nonlinear system;patients;seizures;subdural space;wavelet	Marija Cotic;Yotin Chinvarun;Mirna Guirgis;Peter L.

ed7e7d57e9ad0882a904072d91f4895e443ac4e0	combined eeg-gyroscope-tdcs brain machine interface system for early management of driver drowsiness		In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a wireless, wearable brain machine interface (BMI) system dedicated to signal sensing and processing for driver drowsiness detection (DDD). Owing to the importance of driver drowsiness and the possibility for brainwaves-based DDD, many electroencephalogram (EEG)-based approaches have been proposed. However, few studies focus on the early detection of driver drowsiness and on the early management of driver drowsiness using a closed-loop algorithm. The reported wireless and wearable BMI system is used for 1) simultaneous EEG and gyroscope-based head movement measurement for the early detection of driver drowsiness and 2) simultaneous EEG and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for the early management of driver drowsiness. To achieve the purposes of easy-to-use and distraction-free driving, a Bluetooth low-energy module is embedded in this BMI system and used to communicate with a fully wearable consumer device, a smartwatch, which coordinates the work of drowsiness monitoring and brain stimulation with its embedded closed-loop algorithm. The proposed system offers a 128 Hz sampling rate per channel, 12-bit and 16-bit resolution for a single-channel EEG and a three-channel gyroscope, and a maximum 2 mA current for the tDCS. The current consumption of the whole headset system is 56 mA. The battery life of the smartwatch is 9 h. The DDD experimental results show that the proposed system obtained a 93.67% five-level overall accuracy, a 96.15% two-level (alert versus slightly drowsy) accuracy, and maximum 16- to 23-min wakefulness maintenance.	12-bit;16-bit;algorithm;bluetooth;brain–computer interface;deep brain stimulation;electroencephalography;embedded system;gyroscope;headset (audio);neural oscillation;sampling (signal processing);smartwatch;wearable computer	Gang Li;Nguyen Trung Hau	2018	IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems	10.1109/THMS.2017.2759808	brain–computer interface;computer science;electroencephalography;simulation;wearable computer;transcranial direct-current stimulation;headset;smartwatch;bluetooth;gyroscope	Mobile	10.312656982453282	-89.71362465051668	170609

Assessment of current mental fitness for executing a task at hand might avoid unnecessary risks. To obtain this knowledge, two physiological measurements were recorded in this work using customized non-invasive wearable instrumentation that measures electrocardiogram (ECG) and thoracic electrical bioimpedance (TEB) signals. The relevant information from each measurement is extracted via evaluation of a reduced set of selected features. These features are primarily obtained from filtered and processed versions of the raw time measurements with calculations of certain statistical and descriptive parameters. Selection of the reduced set of features was performed using genetic algorithms, thus constraining the computational cost of the real-time implementation. Different classification approaches have been studied, but neural networks were chosen for this investigation because they represent a good tradeoff between the intelligence of the solution and computational complexity. Three different application scenarios were considered. In the first scenario, the proposed system is capable of distinguishing among different types of activity with a 21.2% probability error, for activities coded as neutral, emotional, mental and physical. In the second scenario, the proposed solution distinguishes among the three different emotional states of neutral, sadness and disgust, with a probability error of 4.8%. In the third scenario, the system is able to distinguish between low mental load and mental overload with a probability error of 32.3%. The computational cost was calculated, and the solution was implemented in commercially available Android-based smartphones. The results indicate that execution of such a monitoring solution is negligible compared to the nominal computational load of current smartphones.	algorithmic efficiency;android;artificial neural network;chest;computation;computational complexity theory;customize;description;electrocardiography;extraction;genetic selection;genetic algorithm;instrument - device;neural network simulation;real-time clock;real-time computing;sadness;smartphone;tebibyte;version;wearable computer;executing - querystatuscode;thoracic electrical bioimpedance	Inma Mohino-Herranz;Roberto Gil-Pita;Javier Ferreira;Manuel Rosa-Zurera;Fernando Seoane	2015		10.3390/s151025607	embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;human factors and ergonomics;textile	HCI	10.748076240118818	-88.99437674034495	170926

Model-based denoising has attracted initial studies since the ECG dynamical model was established in 2003 and been demonstrated to outperform most model-less denoising methods. The focus of this paper is robust denoising of abnormal ECG signals, which do not satisfy the assumption in previous model-based studies that morphological or physiological variations are small from one beat to another. A mean shift based initializer is proposed to provide a much more robust estimation of initial model parameters for each heart beat. Together with physiological knowledge based wave subsegmentation and enhanced strategies, the novel initializer has been demonstrated to achieve satisfactory performance for both normal and abnormal heart beats under both white and pink noises. Utilizing records from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-Beth Israel Hospital (BIH) database, this paper also applies various filters to denoise noisy signals and the denoising performances verify the availability and efficacy of the proposed denoising method. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study: firstly, we employ statistical methods to determine the non-stationary behavior of focal interictal epileptiform series within very short time intervals; secondly, for such intervals that are deemed non-stationary we suggest the concept of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) process modelling, well known in time series analysis. We finally address the queries of causal relationships between epileptic states and between brain areas during epileptiform activity. We estimate the interaction between different EEG series (channels) in short time intervals by performing Granger-causality analysis and also estimate such interaction in long time intervals by employing Cointegration analysis, both analysis methods are well-known in econometrics. Here we find: first, that the causal relationship between neuronal assemblies can be identified according to the duration and the direction of their possible mutual influences; second, that although the estimated bidirectional causality in short time intervals yields that the neuronal ensembles positively affect each other, in long time intervals neither of them is affected (increasing amplitudes) from this relationship. Moreover, Cointegration analysis of the EEG series enables us to identify whether there is a causal link from the interictal state to ictal state.	autoregressive integrated moving average;autoregressive model;causal filter;causality;electroencephalography phase synchronization;epilepsy;estimated;focal (programming language);patients;process modeling;seizures;stationary process;time series analysis;trigeminal neuralgia	Ata Özkaya;Mehmet Korürek	2009	Journal of Computational Neuroscience	10.1007/s10827-009-0198-7	psychology;granger causality;econometrics;autoregressive integrated moving average;machine learning;time series;process modeling;mathematics;moving average;statistics;affect;cointegration	ML	20.404759334545176	-84.62915349397656	171181
a2216bc75256be30a4e1589ca701eb69bca763f9	development of a \upmu ct-based patient-specific model of the electrically stimulated cochlea		Cochlear implants (CIs) are neural prosthetics that are used to treat sensory-based hearing loss. There are over 320,000 recipients worldwide. After implantation, each CI recipient goes through a sequence of programming sessions where audiologists determine several CI processor settings to attempt to optimize hearing outcomes. However, this process is difficult because there are no objective measures available to indicate what setting changes will lead to better hearing outcomes. It has been shown that a simplified model of electrically induced neural activation patterns within the cochlea can be created using patient CT images, and that audiologists can use this information to determine settings that lead to better hearing performance. A more comprehensive physics-based patient-specific model of neural activation has the potential to lead to even greater improvement in outcomes. In this paper, we propose a method to create such customized electro-anatomical models of the electrically stimulated cochlea. We compare the accuracy of our patient-specific models to the accuracy of generic models. Our results show that the patient-specific models are on average more accurate than the generic models, which motivates the use of a patient-specific modeling approach for cochlear implant patients.

For example, analyzing neural recordings from neurostimulators implanted in patients with neurological disorders can be used by a physician to adjust detrimental stimulation parameters to improve treatment. This work proposes advanced statistical signal processing and machine learning methodologies to assess neurostimulation from neural recordings. This is done using adaptive processing and unsupervised clustering methods applied to neural recordings to suppress neurostimulation artifacts and classify between various behavior tasks to assess the level of neurostimulation in patients.	cluster analysis;electroencephalography;machine learning;neurostimulation;statistical signal processing;zero suppression	Alexander Maurer;Sara J.

These deaths could be avoided if a previous monitoring of these arrhythmias were carried out, using the Electrocardiogram (ECG) exam. The continuous monitoring and the automatic detection of arrhythmias of the heart may help specialists to perform a faster diagnostic. The main contribution of this work is to show that self-organized artificial neural networks (ANNs), as the ART2, can be applied in arrhythmias automatic detection, working with Wavelet transforms for feature extraction. The self-organized ANN allows, at any time, the inclusion of other groups of arrhythmias, without the need of a new complete training phase.

929b4c7906c9238f76a883b9ea3119fc6c78c9e6	the use of a thermal camera and eulerian enhancement in the examination of pedal pulse and microvascular health	band pass filters;arteries;ultrasonic imaging;transducers;doppler effect;blood flow;cameras	Early detection of impaired blood flow and microvascular functioning is important to prevent ulceration in diabetic patients. This paper aims to first determine if thermal video in conjunction with Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) can be used to find the pedal pulse rate, and reveal patterns indicative of the foot's microvascular health. Thermal video was captured of a healthy adult's foot while a Doppler ultrasound captured pedal pulse. Another thermal video was captured of a patient's heels. These videos were subjected to EVM, areas of interest were defined and the mean intensity signal was calculated temporally, within each defined area. The healthy adult signals were compared to Doppler data to determine the signal best representative of pedal pulse. The patient signals were examined for patterns. The mean intensity signals best representing pedal pulse in the healthy adult resulted from areas containing an artery close to the skin. The most significant pattern in the patient data was a large difference in signal amplitude from areas containing the left posterior tibial artery and the right; the left, colder heel had a weaker signal amplitude. These results suggest that thermal video subjected to EVM can reveal the pedal pulse rate by extracting intensity signals from areas in which arteries are close to the skin, and may reveal differences in the microvascular health of the left versus right foot. The ability to detect pedal pulse and differences in microvascular health using an inexpensive and non-intrusive thermal camera would of great value to a podiatric clinic.	2d doppler echocardiography;diabetes mellitus;doppler effect;foot;heel;patients;pulse;signal-to-noise ratio;structure of posterior tibial artery;temporal logic;thoracic surgery, video-assisted;tibial arteries;ulcer;videocassette	Stephanie L.

The interrelationship of cilia and the directional disorder of the ciliary metachronal wave were analyzed using digital microscopic images. The degree of synchronization between ciliary beats was determined by the correlation factor between two different spots. To find out the uniphase directions of beating cilia, principal axes of inertia were applied to the two-dimensional correlation map calculated from sequential ciliary images. The standard deviation of determined wave directions in a region of interest (ROI) was defined as a measure of metachronal wave disorder. The pooled mean of metachronal wave disorder was 23.4 /spl plusmn/ 8.79/spl deg/ in ROIs of 8 /spl mu/m /spl times/ 8 /spl mu/m and 25.4 /spl plusmn/ 6.46/spl deg/ in 32 /spl mu/m /spl times/ 24 /spl mu/m from the sphenoid sinus mucosa of five normal subjects. Our result shows that there is a considerable variation in metachronal wave directions of cilia beating on the epithelium.	atrial premature complexes;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;binaural beats;cilia;mood disorders;nasal sinus;pooled sample;region of interest;respiratory tract structure;sphenoidal sinus;tract (literature)	Won-Jin Yi;Kwang-Suk Park;Chu-Hee Lee;Chae-Seo Rhee;Sang-Won Nam	2002	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/10.983462	synchronization;computer vision;telecommunications;image processing;computer science;engineering;microscopy;optics	Visualization	24.557790202816037	-85.66223044571254	172355

Patients with AD may show anomalous behaviors such as sleeping disorders. Due to the increasing attention focused on these kinds of behaviors, activities like monitoring and identification are becoming critical. In order to meet these requirements, we propose a cognitive approach based on a combination of machine learning algorithms and a prior knowledge base for the identification of anomalous behaviors during sleep. The results show an improvement in the identification of sleeping disorders of more than 10%.

Many advanced techniques have been proposed to characterize this relationship, but in practice simple techniques such as cross-correlation analysis are used. Unfortunately, the traditional cross-correlation analysis is influenced by the autocorrelation of the signals as much as it is by the relationship between the signals. Practically, this results in the cross correlation suggesting that the signals are correlated over a broad range of lags. Prewhitening the signals overcomes this limitation and reveals the essentially causal relationship between the signals. This is a simple method that can also easily generalize cross-correlation analysis to nonstationary signals, which are frequently encountered in biomedical applications. This technique has been used in other fields, but remains mostly undiscovered in biomedical research. In the case of a purely causal relationship, we show that whitened cross-correlation analysis is equivalent to directly estimating the all-pass component of the transfer function that relates the signals. We give examples of this type of analysis applied to several biomedical applications to demonstrate some of the new insights and information that can be produced by this type of analysis.	autocorrelation;causality;cross-correlation;estimated;microsoft customer care framework;stochastic process;transfer function	Mahmoud El-Gohary;James McNames	2007	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2007.906519	adaptive filter;kalman filter;stochastic process;econometrics;electronic engineering;causality;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;statistics	Metrics	19.867962497828106	-86.75841714928421	172594

Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is utilized for parameter estimation of the Poincaré map. Bifurcation analyses of the iterated map reveal that as the neuronal activity progresses from preictal state toward the ictal event, the parameter values of the Poincaré map move toward the bifurcation points. However, following the seizure occurrence and in the postictal period, these parameter values move away from the bifurcation points. Both flip and fold bifurcations are analyzed and it is demonstrated that in some cases the flip bifurcation and in other cases the fold bifurcation are the dynamical regime underlying epileptiform events. This information can offer insights into the dynamical nature and variability of the brain signals and consequently could help to predict and control seizure events. © 2011 IMACS.

As a kind of phenotypic data, plant action potential (AP) evoked by external stimuli—e.g., electrical stimulation, environmental stress—may be associated with inhibition of gene expression related to stress tolerance. However, plant AP is a response to environment changes and full of variability. It is an aperiodic signal with refractory period, discontinuity, noise, and artifacts. In consequence, there are still challenges to automatically recognize and classify plant AP; (2) Methods: Therefore, we proposed an AP recognition algorithm based on dynamic difference threshold to extract all waveforms similar to AP. Next, an incremental template matching algorithm was used to classify the AP and non-AP waveforms; (3) Results: Experiment results indicated that the template matching algorithm achieved a classification rate of 96.0%, and it was superior to backpropagation artificial neural networks (BP-ANNs), supported vector machine (SVM) and deep learning method; (4) Conclusion: These findings imply that the proposed methods are likely to expand possibilities for rapidly recognizing and classifying plant action potentials in the database in the future.	action potential;algorithm;artifact (error);artificial neural network;backpropagation;deep learning;functional electrical stimulation;heart rate variability;reflections of signals on conducting lines;template matching;waveform	Yang Chen;Dongjie Zhao;Zi-Yang Wang;Zhongyi Wang;Guiliang Tang;Lan Huang	2016	Algorithms	10.3390/a9040070	just-noticeable difference;computer vision;template matching;computer science;machine learning;data mining	ML	23.04133684832635	-87.51151679428271	172732

Recent advances in data collection facilitate continuously monitoring this behavior. Previous work demonstrates the importance of this data in driving safety but does not extended beyond the driving domain. One potential extension of this data is to identify driver states related to health conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We collected driving data and medication adherence from a sample of 75 OSA patients over 3.5 months. We converted speed and acceleration behaviors to symbols using symbolic aggregate approximation and converted these symbols to pattern frequencies using a sliding window. The resulting frequency data was matched with treatment adherence information. A random forest model was trained on the data and evaluated using a held-aside test dataset. The random forest model detects lapses in treatment adherence. An assessment of variable importance suggests that the important patterns of driving in classification correspond to route decisions and patterns that may be associated with drowsy driving. The success of this approach suggests driving data may be valuable for evaluating new treatments, analyzing side effects of medications, and that the approach may benefit other drowsiness detection algorithms.	aggregate data;approximation;behavior;chimeric antigen receptor;data collection;feel drowsy;patients;random forest;silo (dataset);sleep apnea syndromes;sleep apnea, obstructive;sleep mode;algorithm	Anthony D.

Similarly, sonar systems based on piezoelectric polymers process ultrasounds in air which, properly elaborated and codified by an artificial neural network, are suitable for stimulating the central nervous system, exactly the same as the ultrasonic information carried along the acoustic nerve in mammals. Our experiments aim at investigating, measuring and characterizing, the reaction of mammals to an external stimulus perceivable by artificial sense organs and not forced by a standard electrical instrumentation. Electroencephalography recordings were performed in order to analyze the cortical effects of the received ultrasonic signal. Preliminary measurements of brain activity demonstrated that electrical information elaborated from ultrasound can be transferred to the brain in order to obtain a response related to both signal characteristics and the stimulated area.	acoustic cryptanalysis;artificial neural network;electroencephalography;experiment;piezoelectricity;preclinical imaging;sonar (symantec)	Antonino S.

Despite this flow velocity variation, most current methods set forth for the analysis of arterial spin labeling (ASL) data have assumed that the tagged blood is delivered from the tagging region to the imaging region via simple plug flow, i.e., a single transit delay (deltat). In this study, we used a pulse oximeter to synchronize image acquisition at systole and diastole separately. The deltat dispersion was modeled with a Gaussian distribution and the effect of cardiac pulsation upon the ASL signal was evaluated on five healthy volunteers. ASL signals were collected at a series of inflow times (TI) using PICORE QUIPSS II: TR/TE/TI1=2400/3.2/700 ms, TI={300,500,700,900,1100,1300,1500} ms, matrix size=64times64,repetition=100. Transit delay was found significantly shorter in systolic tag than diastolic tag (paired student's t-test, p<0.001; mean difference across subjects=54 ms). When the tag was applied in late systole, the ASL signal arrived in the target brain slice earlier, and was higher by 16% with TI=700 ms. Intervoxel dispersion (~350 ms) dominated over intravoxel dispersion (<200 ms). The disparity of ASL signals found between systolic and diastolic tags indicated that ASL imaging was sensitive to cardiac pulsations. We conclude that both flow dispersion and fluctuations in the ASL signal due to cardiac pulsations are significant	arrival - action;arterial occlusive diseases;arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging;assumed;binocular disparity;carotid arteries;diastole;exhibits as topic;plug (physical object);tellurium;times;tracer;velocity (software development);t test	W.-C.

Visual field abnormalities (decreased visual sensitivity on psychophysical tests) are the primary means of glaucoma diagnosis. One form of visual field testing is Frequency Doubling Technology (FDT) that tests sensitivity at 52 points within the visual field. Like other psychophysical tests used in clinical practice, FDT results yield specific patterns of defect indicative of the disease. We used Gaussian Mixture Model with Expectation Maximization (GEM), (EM is used to estimate the model parameters) to automatically separate FDT data into clusters of normal and abnormal eyes. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to decompose each cluster into different axes (patterns). FDT measurements were obtained from 1,190 eyes with normal FDT results and 786 eyes with abnormal (i.e., glaucomatous) FDT results, recruited from a university-based, longitudinal, multi-center, clinical study on glaucoma. The GEM input was the 52-point FDT threshold sensitivities for all eyes. The optimal GEM model separated the FDT fields into 3 clusters. Cluster 1 contained 94% normal fields (94% specificity) and clusters 2 and 3 combined, contained 77% abnormal fields (77% sensitivity). For clusters 1, 2 and 3 the optimal number of PCA-identified axes were 2, 2 and 5, respectively.

Three nonlinear seizure predictive features were extracted from a patient's data obtained from the European Epilepsy Database, one of the most comprehensive EEG database for epilepsy research. A total of 36 hours of recordings including 7 seizures was used for analysis. The nonlinear features used in this study were similarity index, phase synchronization, and nonlinear interdependence. We designed an ANFIS classifier constructed based on these features as input. Fuzzy if-then rules were generated by the ANFIS classifier using the complex relationship of feature space provided during training. The membership function optimization was conducted based on a hybrid learning algorithm. The proposed method achieved highest sensitivity of 80% with false prediction rate as low as 0.46 per hour.	adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;cns disorder;eighty;electroencephalography phase synchronization;epilepsy;extraction;feature vector;fuzzy logic;inference engine;interdependence;mathematical optimization;neuro-fuzzy;nonlinear system;patients;rule (guideline);seizures;synchronization (computer science);algorithm;per hour	Ahmed Fazle Rabbi;Leila Azinfar;Reza Fazel-Rezai	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609947	synchronization;neuroscience;electroencephalography;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;feature extraction;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;pattern recognition;neurophysiology	DB	16.99648455844444	-89.77503317681669	173446

The examinations were conducted both with eyes open and closed, and the perturbations were evoked by a pseudorandomly applied vibration stimulation to the calf muscles. The evoked anteroposterior responses were analyzed with a method considering adaptation in the slow changes in posture and in the stimulus–response relationship. Repetition of examinations on a daily basis revealed a gradual improvement of postural-control performance. The body sway induced by the stimulation was significantly reduced and the dynamical properties changed. Most of the improvements remained after 90 days, but some parameters such as the complexity of the control system used were increased to the initial level. The results confirm previous observations that postural control contains several partially independent adaptive processes, observed in terms of alteration of posture and as a progressive reduction of body sway induced by stimulation. The method used for the adaptation analysis in this study could be applied to analyze biological systems with multiple individual adaptive processes with different time courses or characteristics, or where the adaptation processes are related to multiple internal or external factors.	ablepharon;acclimatization;biological system;body position;control system;eye;poor posture	Per-Anders Fransson;F.

Today, it is an emerging research area of analyzing these big data to make decision support for physicians. This paper presents a parallelized web-based tool with cloud computing service architecture to analyze the epilepsy. There are many modern analytic functions which are wavelet transform, genetic algorithm (GA), and support vector machine (SVM) cascaded in the system. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, it has been verified by two kinds of electroencephalography (EEG) data, which are short term EEG and long term EEG. The results reveal that our approach achieves the total classification accuracy higher than 90%.

However, HRV is related to other factors as well, among which the activity is the major one. A novel activity-aware HRV analysis method is proposed to improve its performance on daily life ECG data. First, activity types and intensity are obtained by processing 3-axis acceleration signals. Then heart rate data extracted from ECG signal are segmented according to the activity types and intensity. The heart rate segments are evaluated to determine its suitability for HRV analysis. The suitable segments are further processed to remove outliers and slow non-stationary trends caused by activity instability and other factors. Finally, HRV analysis is conducted on these suitable and processed segments, and the results are labeled with activity context information. Thus, HRV s under different activity contexts are obtained. The advantages of activity-aware HRV are: First, affection of activity on HRV stability is reduced. Second, we have gained HRV dynamics measure against activity types and intensity.	heart rate variability;instability;stationary process	Lianying Ji;Jian-Kang Wu;Yuanjing Yang;Shaofeng Wang;Aiguang Li	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083830	acceleration;database index;heart rate variability;simulation;speech recognition;computer science;ubiquitous computing	Robotics	10.490611300229302	-85.9437305608993	173760
0b1b133d0eef210c100640b28f5c24fb5a1a0d5b	regular expressions for irregular rhythms		Motivated by the desire to verify the correctness of algorithms for arrhythmia discrimination used in cardiac medical devices, we present a general wavelet-based characterization of peaks (local maxima and minima) that occur in cardiac electrograms, along with two peak-detection algorithms based on this characterization. Peak detection (PD) is a common signal-processing task, as peaks indicate events of interest, such as heartbeats (in the cardiac setting). The performance of PD thereby directly influences the correctness of the algorithms that depend on its output. We show that our wavelet-based PD algorithms (peakWPM and peakWPB) and a commercial PD algorithm from Medtronic Inc. (peakMDT ) are easily expressible in Quantitative Regular Expressions (QREs), a formal language based on regular expressions for specifying complex numerical queries over data streams. We then study the accuracy and sensitivity of the resulting QRE-based PD algorithms on real patient data, and show that the wavelet-based peakWPM algorithm outperforms the other two PD algorithms, yielding results that are on par with those provided by a cardiologist.	algorithm;correctness (computer science);formal language;maxima and minima;numerical analysis;quick response engine;regular expression;signal processing;wavelet	Houssam Abbas;Alena Rodionova;Ezio Bartocci;Scott A.

Clinically , it is difficult for physician to identify neonatal seizures visually, while EEG seizures can be recognized by t he trained experts. Usually, in NICUs, EEG monitoring systems are used in stead of the expensive on-sit e supervision. However, it is a waste of time to review an overnight recording, which motivates the resea rchers to develop automated seizure detection algorithms. Although, there are few detection algorithms existed in the li erature, it is difficult to evaluate these mathematical model based algorithm since their performances vary si gnificantly on different data sets. By extending our previous results on multichannel information fusion, w e propose a distributed detection system consisting of the existing detectors and a fusion center to detect the se izure activities in the newborn EEG. The advantage of this proposed technique is that it does not require any pri ori knowledge of the hypotheses and the detector performances, which are often unknown in real applicati ons. Therefore, this proposed technique has the potential to improve the performances of the existing neona tal seizure detectors. In this paper, we first review two newborn EEG models, one of wh ich is used to generate neonatal EEG signals. The synthetic data is used later for testing purpose. We also review three existing algorithms on this topic and implement them to work as the local detectors of the system. T hen, we introduce the fusion algorithms applied in the fusion center for two different scenarios: large samp le size and small sample size. We finally provide some numerical results to show the applicability, effectiv eness, and the adaptability of the blind algorithms in the seizure detection problem. We also provide the testin g results obtained using the synthetic to show the improvement of the detection system.	algorithm;dhrystone;electroencephalography;i/o controller hub;mathematical model;numerical analysis;performance;sensor;synthetic data	Huaying Li;Aleksandar Jeremic	2011			speech recognition;engineering;machine learning;pattern recognition	ML	19.16307236089698	-90.72173060258164	174182
3436ecb6a614aea07948d062dbb6f9f6416fed0d	indirect measurement of the carotid arterial pressure from vibrocardiographic signal: calibration of the waveform and comparison with photoplethysmographic signal	atmospheric measurements;measurement by laser beam;sensors;particle measurements;arteries;blood pressure;pressure measurement	The detection of arterial Blood Pressure waveform provides important information about the subject health status. Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) is a non-contact technique with high sensitivity able to detect mechanical movements of the arterial wall; several previous studies have shown that LDV is able to characterize cardiac activity. Photoplethysmogram (PPG) quantifies the digital volume artery pulse, which has been demonstrated to be closely related to the pressure signal measured by an arterial tonometer. In this paper, an indirect measurement of carotid arterial pressure by means of LDV is presented. Moreover, a comparison between LDV and PPG is conducted in order to estimate the time interval between opening and closing of the aortic valve, that is the Left Ventricular Ejection Time (LVET). Results show an average reduction of around 20% of the systolic pressure derived from LDV signal measured over the carotid artery with respect to the systolic pressure measured at brachial level (i.e. peripheral pressure value). Finally, the comparison between LDV and PPG in the estimation of LVET shows a mean percentage deviation <;10%. So, in conclusion, it can be stated that LDV technique has the potential of providing a displacement waveform that, adequately calibrated, can furnish significant information about pressure waveform.	aortic valve structure;carotid arteries;closing (morphology);displacement mapping;heart ventricle;intracranial hypertension;movement;peripheral;psychologic displacement;srgn gene;systolic pressure;tonometer;ultrasonography, doppler, transcranial;waveform	Luigi Casacanditella;Gloria Cosoli;Sara Casaccia;Enrico Primo Tomasini;Lorenzo Scalise	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591499	electronic engineering;pressure measurement;engineering;sensor;blood pressure;physics;quantum mechanics;surgery	EDA	14.543123606729807	-85.23248837785549	174207

An optimization protocol has been designed to choose the main parameters of the classifier in order to increase the accuracy on the classification. This protocol has been tested with the registers provided by IDIAP Research Institute for BCI Competition 2003. Three different mental tasks based on motor imagery are performed in these sessions. The data have been processed and tested with the classifier to obtain the optimal success rate and reliability. To that end, the optimization protocol has been applied to select the suitable parameters for the classification. The results are very satisfactory and prove that this kind of classification can be successfully introduced in a real time BCI. & 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Seven classification and prediction methods, namely PCA, LDA, PLS, KNN, SVM, LASSO and RF, were used to analyze the e-nose data. The classification accuracy and MAUC were employed to evaluate the performance of these methods. The results indicated that sesame oils processed with different methods resulted in different sensor responses, with cold-pressed sesame oil producing the strongest sensor signals, followed by the hot-pressed sesame oil. The blends of pressed sesame oils with refined sesame oil were more difficult to be distinguished than the blends of pressed sesame oils and refined soybean oil. LDA, KNN, and SVM outperformed the other classification methods in distinguishing sesame oil blends. KNN, LASSO, PLS, and SVM (with linear kernel), and RF models could adequately predict the adulteration level (% of added soybean oil) in the sesame oil blends. Among the prediction models, KNN with k = 1 and 2 yielded the best prediction results.	anterior descending branch of left coronary artery;electronic nose;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;lasso;local-density approximation;partial least squares regression;principal component analysis;radio frequency;sesame oil;soybean oil;support vector machine;sesame seed allergenic extract 50 mg/ml injectable solution	Xiaolong Shao;Hui Li;Nan Wang;Qiang Zhang	2015		10.3390/s151026726	electronic nose;support vector machine;speech recognition;computer science;engineering;data science;lasso;data mining;partial least squares regression;linear discriminant analysis;least squares	ML	16.36115718902614	-93.35117079643719	174348

The cross-correlation between two time-domain signals gives a measure of similarity between two waveforms. The application of the continuous wavelet transform to two time series and the cross examination of the two decompositions reveal localized similarities in time and frequency. Application of the XWT to a pair of data yields wavelet cross spectrum (WCS) and wavelet coherence (WCOH). The proposed algorithm analyzes ECG data utilizing XWT and explores the resulting spectral differences. A pathologically varying pattern from the normal pattern in the QT zone of the inferior leads shows the presence of inferior myocardial infarction. A normal beat ensemble is selected as the absolute normal ECG pattern template, and the coherence between various other normal and abnormal subjects is computed. The WCS and WCOH of various ECG patterns show distinguishing characteristics over two specific regions R1 and R2, where R1 is the QRS complex area and R2 is the T-wave region. The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt diagnostic ECG database is used for evaluation of the methods. A heuristically determined mathematical formula extracts the parameter(s) from the WCS and WCOH. Empirical tests establish that the parameter(s) are relevant for classification of normal and abnormal cardiac patterns. The overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity after combining the three leads are obtained as 97.6%, 97.3%, and 98.8%, respectively.	algorithm;cache coherence;complex wavelet transform;continuous wavelet;cross-correlation;heuristic;morlet wavelet;sensitivity and specificity;spectrogram;time series;web coverage service	Swati Banerjee;Madhuchhanda Mitra	2014	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2013.2279001	wavelet;electronic engineering;speech recognition;continuous wavelet transform;feature extraction;time series;pattern recognition;mathematics;data analysis;discrete wavelet transform;statistics;wavelet transform	Visualization	17.583210729960786	-89.09576964008552	174374

Near-infrared spectroscopy has recently been investigated as a non-invasive brain imaging method for developing BCI. Previous research has shown that task related hemodynamic signal recorded by NIRS from the cortex can be distinguished. However, the hemodynamic signal is a slow response for building a BCI. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can detect two different kinds of signals from the human brain: the hemodynamic (slow) optical response, and the neuronal (fast) optical response. In this paper, we conducted a pilot study on investigating the feasibility of using fast optical response for building a NIRS-BCI. We explore the nonlinear aspects of the tactile-stimulus-evoked neuronal optical response (fast optical response) over a NIRS time series (light intensity variation). The fast optical responses (FORs) over time series recorded in stimulus sessions are confirmed by event-related averaging. The chaos levels of NIRS time series recorded both in stimulus and in rest sessions are then identified according to the estimated largest Lyapunov exponent. The obtained results strongly suggest that the chaos level can be used to recognize the FORs in NIRS time series and, thereby, the state of the pertinent brain activity.	brain–computer interface;electroencephalography;hemodynamics;lateral computing;lateral thinking;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;relevance;time series	Xiao-Su Hu;Keum Shik Hong;Shuzhi Sam Ge	2011	2011 IEEE 5th International Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics (RAM)	10.1109/RAMECH.2011.6070486	brain–computer interface;infrared spectroscopy;functional near-infrared spectroscopy;time series;biological engineering;statistics	Robotics	18.586741229342053	-82.8377104249392	174440

This paper presents the combination of two non-invasive methods for studying the extensor muscle architecture using ultrasound simultaneously with finger extension force measurements.   METHODS M. extensor digitorum communis (EDC) was examined in 40 healthy subjects, 20 women and 20 men, aged 35-73 years. Ultrasound measurements were made in a relaxed position of the hand as well as in full contraction. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), pennation angle and contraction patterns were measured with ultrasound, and muscle volume and fascicle length were also estimated. Finger extension force was measured using a newly developed finger force measurement device.   RESULTS The following muscle parameters were determined: CSA, circumference, thickness, pennation angles and changes in shape of the muscle CSA. The mean EDC volume in men was 28.3 cm3 and in women 16.6 cm3. The mean CSA was 2.54 cm2 for men and 1.84 cm2 for women. The mean pennation angle for men was 6.5 degrees and for women 5.5 degrees . The mean muscle thickness for men was 1.2 cm and for women 0.76 cm. The mean fascicle length for men was 7.3 cm and for women 5.0 cm. Significant differences were found between men and women regarding EDC volume (p < 0.001), CSA (p < 0.001), pennation angle (p < 0.05), muscle thickness (p < 0.001), fascicle length (p < 0.001) and finger force (p < 0.001). Changes in the shape of muscle architecture during contraction were more pronounced in men than women (p < 0.01). The mean finger extension force for men was 96.7 N and for women 39.6 N. Muscle parameters related to the extension force differed between men and women. For men the muscle volume and muscle CSA were related to extension force, while for women muscle thickness was related to the extension force.   CONCLUSION Ultrasound is a useful tool for studying muscle architectures in EDC. Muscle parameters of importance for force development were identified. Knowledge concerning the correlation between muscle dynamics and force is of importance for the development of new hand training programmes and rehabilitation after surgery.	circumference;cross-sectional data;error detection and correction;extensor digitorum communis;fascicle - nerve fibers;forearm;muscle;myalgia;relaxation;thickness (graph theory);ethylene dichloride;milliliter	Sofia Brorsson;Anna Nilsdotter;Marita Hilliges;Christer Sollerman;Ylva Aurell	2008	BMC Medical Imaging	10.1186/1471-2342-8-6	nonparametric statistics;medicine;physical therapy;histology;anatomy;surgery;statistics	Robotics	14.31779233411391	-84.02626498809744	174598

However, this technique suffers from limitations. For example, if the physician is not well trained, this may lead to a wrong diagnosis. Moreover, lung sounds are non-stationary, complicating the tasks of analysis, recognition, and distinction. This is why developing automatic recognition systems can help to deal with these limitations. In this paper, we compare three machine learning approaches for lung sounds classification. The first two approaches are based on the extraction of a set of handcrafted features trained by three different classifiers (support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor, and Gaussian mixture models) while the third approach is based on the design of convolutional neural networks (CNN). In the first approach, we extracted the 12 MFCC coefficients from the audio files then calculated six MFCCs statistics. We also experimented normalization using zero mean and unity variance to enhance accuracy. In the second approach, the local binary pattern (LBP) features are extracted from the visual representation of the audio files (spectrograms). The features are normalized using whitening. The dataset used in this work consists of seven classes (normal, coarse crackle, fine crackle, monophonic wheeze, polyphonic wheeze, squawk, and stridor). We have also experimentally tested dataset augmentation techniques on the spectrograms to enhance the ultimate accuracy of the CNN. The results show that CNN outperformed the handcrafted feature based classifiers.

Currently, interpretation of the distribution, pattern and extent of language activation can be heavily dependent on the chosen statistical threshold. The aim of the present study was to 1) test the robustness of adaptive thresholding of fMRI data to yield a fixed number of active voxels, and to 2) develop a largely threshold-independent method of assessing when individual patients have statistically atypical language lateralization. Simulated data and real fMRI data in 34 healthy controls and 4 selected epilepsy patients performing a verbal fluency language fMRI task were used. Dependence of laterality on the thresholding method is demonstrated for simulated and real data. Simulated data were used to test the hypothesis that thresholding based upon a fixed number of active voxels would yield a laterality index that was more stable across a range of signal strengths (study power) compared to thresholding at a fixed p value. This stability allowed development of a method comparing an individual to a group of controls across a wide range of thresholds, providing a robust indication of atypical lateralization that is more objective than conventional methods. Thirty healthy controls were used as normative data for the threshold-independent method, and the remaining subjects were used as illustrative examples. The method could also be used more generally to assess relative regional distribution of activity in other neuroimaging paradigms (for example, one could apply it to the assessment of lateralization of activation in a memory task, or to the assessment of anterior-posterior distribution rather than laterality).	epilepsy;handedness;language localisation;lithium;matlab;neuroimaging;p-value;patients;recurrence plot;resonance;thresholding (image processing);voxel;fmri	David F.

483cf0c22d0c0b5d240567275885a27b28133516	gait symmetry measures: a review of current and prospective methods		Abstract Gait symmetry is important in measuring gait pattern alterations for establishing the level of functional limitation due to pathology, observing its changes over time and evaluating rehabilitative intervention effects. The aim of this topical review is twofold: 1) to present used symmetry measures and summarize their application to a diverse range of gait data and to demonstrate their capabilities in their utilization in research and practice, 2) to expose newly developed symmetry measures and highlight their perspectives. We divided symmetry measures into four subgroups: symmetry indices, complete gait cycle symmetry measures, statistically-based measures and approaches, and nonlinear measures. For each, we will discuss their advantages and limitations and raise new questions and recommendations about their development and clinical use.	prospective search	Slavka Viteckova;Patrik Kutilek;Zdenek Svoboda;Radim Krupicka;Jan Kauler;Zoltán Szabó	2018	Biomed.

In this model, the AV junction (AVJ) is treated as a lumped structure characterized by refractoriness and automaticity. Bombarded by random AF impulses, the AVJ can also be invaded by the VP-induced retrograde wave. The model includes bidirectional conduction delays in the AVJ and ventricle. Both refractory period and conduction delay of the AVJ are dependent upon its recovery time. The electrotonic modulation by blocked impulses is also considered in the model. Our simulations show that, with proper parameter settings, the present model can account for most principal statistical properties of the RR intervals during AF. We further demonstrate that the AV conduction property and the ventricular rate in AF depend on both AF rate and the degree of electrotonic modulation in the AVJ. Finally, we show that multilevel interactions between AF and VP can generate various patterns of ventricular rhythm that are consistent with previous experimental observations	anisotropic filtering;atrial fibrillation;computer simulation;etoposide;heart atrium;heart ventricle;interaction;modulation;population parameter;p–n junction;rapid refresh;ventricular fibrillation	Jie Lian;Dirk Müssig;Volker Lang	2006	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2006.876627	computer simulation;endocrinology;medicine;mathematics;anesthesia;statistics;cardiology;refractory period	ML	18.024752659679198	-83.17225840720293	174970

The intention to perform a motor action can be detected from brain signals and used to control robotic devices. Most previous studies have focused on the starting of movements from a resting state, while in daily life activities, motions occur continuously and the neural activities correlated to the evolving movements are yet to be investigated.   METHOD First we investigate the existence of neural correlates of intention to replace an object on the table during a holding phase. Next, we present a new method to extract the movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) from a single-trial EEG. A novel method called Global optimal constrained ICA (GocICA) is proposed to overcome the limitations of cICA which is implemented based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Charged System Search (CSS) techniques. GocICA is then utilized for decoding the intention to grasp and lift and intention to replace movements where the results were compared.   RESULTS It was found that GocICA significantly improves the intention detection performance. Best results in offline detection were obtained with CSS-cICA for both kinds of intentions. Furthermore, pseudo-online decoding showed that GocICA was able to predict both intentions before the onset of related movements with the highest probability.   CONCLUSIONS Decoding of the next movement intention during current movement is possible, which can be used to create more natural neuroprostheses. The results demonstrate that GocICA is a promising new algorithm for single-trial MRCP detection which can be used for detecting other types of ERPs such as P300.

EEG signals corresponding to various types of mental tasks performed by human subjects are decomposed using the variation of EMD, called Empirical Mode Decomposition-Modified Peak Selection (EMD-MPS), which allows direct separation of the signals into a de-trended component, and a trend, according to a frequency separation criterion. Teager energy operator is then applied to calculate the average energy values of both components obtained after signal decomposition using EMD-MPS. These energy values are used to construct feature vectors, and one-versus-one classification of mental tasks is performed using a simple classifier, namely the 1-NN classifier. An average correct classification rate of 87% is obtained, improving on previous results and thereby also demonstrating the effectiveness of the methodology.	algorithm;dimensions;effective method;electroencephalography phase synchronization;electromechanical dissociation;energy operator;feature vector;genetic selection;hilbert–huang transform;statistical classification	Muhammad Kaleem;Aziz Guergachi;Sridhar Krishnan	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609663	neuroscience;speech recognition;electroencephalography;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	SE	16.192281264092355	-91.970888492976	175501
fa5eceb9957a3395ec81a94d29ea55443023114c	validation of a new model-free signal processing method for gait feature extraction using inertial measurement units to diagnose and quantify the severity of parkinson's disease		Gait analysis is important in diagnosing and quantifying the severity of Parkinsonu0027s disease. Different motion tracking systems such as inertial measurement units (IMU) are widely used to detect gait parameters associated with the severity of Parkinsonu0027s disease. Although these systems are accurate enough to measure different gait parameters, they utilize a predefined model of human gait to measure these parameters. Model- based signal processing, that takes into account the kinematics of human body, enforces that sensors be placed in a certain configuration in terms of orientation and location which introduces a burden at the signal processing development phase. In addition, it affects the accuracy and robustness of the system when the user does not place the sensors at their pre-defined locations and with a pre-define orientation. In this paper, we introduce a set of model-free features to estimate gait parameters for the applications of diagnosing and quantifying the severity of Parkinsonu0027s disease. A model-free signal processing technique does not limit sensor placement, in addition, it does not require the knowledge on the kinematics of the users and the human subjects. We show that our proposed features, using a model-free signal processing technique, are highly correlated (R-value up to 0.96 for suitable locations) with gait parameters obtained from model-based sophisticated algorithms. Therefore, these simple model-free features may be suitable for ongoing assessment of Parkinsonu0027s disease and they can be an alternative for conventional gait parameters used for rapid application development.	algorithm;estimation theory;feature extraction;gait analysis;rapid application development;scalability;sensor;signal processing;tracking system	Ali Akbari;Richard B.

Many laboratory-based studies have described various gait detection systems with different wearable inertial sensors, but only limited number of papers addressed the issues by using some non-wearable sensors. A practical method of gait information detection and gait analysis is proposed in the paper using an inexpensive Microsoft Kinect fixed on the midpoint of lower extremity rehabilitation robot. The horizontal distances between Kinect plane and every mark pasted on lower extremity are acquired. Taken the characteristics of gait distance series into consideration, the Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model is established to reflect the changing rule of gait status. Combined with the Kalman filter, gait information reflecting rehabilitation status at next moment is predicted accurately. The method regarding the gait detection and gait analysis is verified by amounts of gait experiments finally.	autoregressive model;experiment;gait analysis;kalman filter;kinect;real-time transcription;sensor;wearable computer	Baiqing Sun;Xiaogang Liu;Xuetang Wu;Haiyang Wang	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907315	computer vision;simulation;engineering	Robotics	10.614076880635155	-85.5083451596011	176164

Mixed states, i.e., a combination of depression and mania symptoms at the same time, can also be present. The diagnosis of this disorder in the current clinical practice is based only on subjective interviews and questionnaires, while no reliable objective psycho-physiological markers are available. Furthermore, there are no biological markers predicting BD outcomes, or providing information about the future clinical course of the phenomenon. To overcome this limitation, here we propose a methodology predicting mood changes in BD using heartbeat nonlinear dynamics exclusively, derived from the ECG. Mood changes are here intended as transitioning between two mental states: euthymic state (EUT), i.e., the good affective balance, and non-euthymic (non-EUT) states. Heart rate variability (HRV) series from 14 bipolar spectrum patients (age: 33.43 ± 9.76, age range: 23-54; six females) involved in the European project PSYCHE, undergoing whole night electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring were analyzed. Data were gathered from a wearable system comprised of a comfortable t-shirt with integrated fabric electrodes and sensors able to acquire ECGs. Each patient was monitored twice a week, for 14 weeks, being able to perform normal (unstructured) activities. From each acquisition, the longest artifact-free segment of heartbeat dynamics was selected for further analyses. Sub-segments of 5 min of this segment were used to estimate trends of HRV linear and nonlinear dynamics. Considering data from a current observation at day t0, and past observations at days (t-1, t-2,...,), personalized prediction accuracies in forecasting a mood state (EUT/non-EUT) at day t+1 were 69% on average, reaching values as high as 83.3%. This approach opens to the possibility of predicting mood states in bipolar patients through heartbeat nonlinear dynamics exclusively.	biomarkers, tumor;bipolar disorder;blu-ray;depressive disorder;electrocardiography;heart rate variability;heartbeat (computing);maxima and minima;mental state;mood swings;nonlinear dynamics;patients;personalization;projections and predictions;quantum state;wearable computer;electrode;sensor (device)	Gaetano Valenza;Mimma Nardelli;Antonio Lanata;Claudio Gentili;Gilles Bertschy;Markus Kosel;Enzo Pasquale Scilingo	2015	IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/JBHI.2016.2554546	psychiatry;heart rate variability;simulation;informatics	Networks	13.264037953664365	-86.15030343306024	176784

This study had an interrupted time series design. The adherence to the guideline was assessed at fortnightly (two weeks) intervals from January 2016 to January 2017, 6 months before and 6 months after intervention. Newly diagnosed patients with AF were included in the offices of ten cardiologists. Stroke and major bleeding risks were calculated by the CDSS which was implemented via a mobile application. Treatment recommendations based on the guideline were shown to cardiologists. The segmented regression model was used to evaluate the effect of CDSS on level and trend of guideline adherence for the treatment of AF. In our analysis, 373 patients were included. The trend of adherence to the anticoagulation guideline for the treatment of AF was stable in the pre-intervention phase. After the CDSS intervention, mean of the adherence to the guideline significantly increased from 48% to 65.5% (P-value < 0.0001). The trend of adherence to the guideline was stable in the post-intervention phase. Our results showed that the CDSS can improve adherence to the anticoagulation guideline for the treatment of AF.

Two stroke subjects participated in this study. A sensor array was used to record surface EMG signals from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle during voluntary isometric contraction at varying force levels. The recording was performed in both paretic and contralateral muscles using a matched force protocol. Single motor unit activity was extracted using the surface EMG decomposition software from Delsys Inc. The results from the two stroke subjects indicate a reduction in the mean motor unit firing rate and a compression of motor unit recruitment range in paretic muscle as compared with the contralateral muscles. These findings provide further evidence of spinal motoneuron involvement after a hemispheric brain lesion, and help us to understand the complex origins of stroke induced muscle weakness.	auditory recruitment;cerebrovascular accident;compression;electromyography;extraction;fault detection and isolation;isometric contraction;isometric projection;motor neurons;motor unit;muscle weakness;national origin;survivors	Nina L.

Optimization of electrode channels is a key problem in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). BCI experiments generate large feature spaces compared to the sample size due to time limitations in EEG sessions. It is essential to understand the importance of the features in terms of physical electrode channels in order to design a high performance yet realistic BCI. The VSS produces a ranked list of original variables (electrode channels or features), according to their ability to discriminate between tasks. A linear discrimination analysis (LDA) classifier is applied to the selected variable subset. Evaluation of the VSS method using synthetic datasets selected more than 83% of relevant variables.

Research Methods: 24 male 3-month-old SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 8), namely, a none weight-bearing running group, a 35% maximum load weight-bearing running group, a 75% maximum load weight-bearing running group. After weight-bearing running training for 6 weeks, the maximum weight-bearing capacity, the blood lactic acid value and serum CK value of rats were tested and compared. Research Results: 30m/min speed running and 45m/min speed running respectively enabled the lactic acid value to generate first and second inflection points; weight-bearing running increased the serum CK-M value with the increase of bearing weight and load, and the blood lactic acid value and the serum CK value were significantly increased. Conclusion: 30m/min is the anaerobic threshold intensity of rat running; maximum load capacity of rats is about 65% of sole weight; weight-bearing running with appropriate load can not damage muscle fibers and can effectively mobilize II type muscle fiber, 75% maximum load weight-bearing running can mobilize II type muscle fiber to be fully raised, but can cause muscle fiber damage.	emoticon;experiment;maxima and minima;multistage interconnection networks;randomness;slope number;speedrun	Huaping Shang	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-18336-2_27	biochemistry;engineering;biological engineering;forensic engineering	Metrics	23.67072196295922	-85.37492714086157	177314

In order to reduce the deterioration of sEMG information, the present paper proposes an efficient ECG removal method based first on ECG localization and secondly on ECG cancellation only where cardiac pulses have been localized. The main contribution of the proposed method consists in employing a combination of discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) and independent component analysis (ICA) to detect ECG position even if sEMG is strongly overlapped with ECG. Simulations realized from real data demonstrate that the proposed structure is significantly better than others simulated methods to remove ECG in term of relative error and coherence.	approximation error;computer simulation;discrete wavelet transform;electromyography;futures and promises;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;loss of significance	François Nougarou;Daniel Massicotte;Martin Descarreaux	2013	2013 18th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)	10.1109/ICDSP.2013.6622713	computer vision;electronic engineering;speech recognition;engineering	Robotics	19.4077789401213	-89.41668235786939	177555

Empirical mode decomposition (EMD), as a fully adaptive and data-driven method for analyzing nonlinear and nonstationary time series, is presented for measuring the synchronization of the brain rhythms from different brain lobes. The EMD algorithm is applied to a desired channel and each time one of the extracted intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) is considered as one of the brain rhythms. This IMF can be filtered by an adaptive line enhancement (ALE) algorithm. The superiority of using ALE to conventional filtering has been tested using simulated signals. Then, by applying Hilbert transform to several enhanced IMFs from different parts of the brain, the changes in linear and non linear synchronization levels are estimated for determination of the fatigue state.	algorithm;hilbert transform;hilbert–huang transform;neural oscillation;nonlinear system;time series	Delaram Jarchi;Bahador Makkiabadi;Saeid Sanei	2010	2010 2nd International Workshop on Cognitive Information Processing	10.1109/CIP.2010.5604127	electronic engineering;speech recognition;computer science;communication	ML	20.623270776712253	-86.58572362784136	177592

One reason why the pathogenesis of DCAN is unclear is that non-invasive assessment of DCAN in humans and animals has been problematic. To overcome this limitation, we utilized a sensitive and non-invasive method to assess cardiac autonomic dysregulation from ECG records. The method, which could be easily applied to humans, is based on principal dynamic mode (PDM) analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). The method is unique, in that is able to separately identify the activities of the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems without pharmacological intervention. In our study, ECG was measured via telemetry in ten sex- and age-matched (4 month old male) C57 (n=5) and Akita (n=5) mice, a model of insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes. The results indicate significant reduced cardiac autonomic function in the diabetic mice in comparison to the controls. Further, both immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses show a reduction in nerve density in Akita mice as compared to the control mice, thus, corroborating our PDM data analysis of HRV records.	akita;autonomic computing;autonomic networking;computer mouse;dependent type;diabetes mellitus;diabetes mellitus, insulin-dependent;diabetic neuropathies;heart diseases;heart rate variability;high-throughput computing;patients;pharmacology;telemetry;throughput;western blot;nervous system disorder	Bufan Yang;Ki H.

99b9f9c08f47730c2f180d7cc4ecee566ac90414	a modified common spatial pattern algorithm customized for feature dimensionality reduction in fnirs-based bcis		Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive multi-channel imaging tool for assessing brain activities, which has shown its high potential in brain-computer interface (BCI) technique. Most previous studies have focused on constructing high dimensional features from whole channels, adding to the complexity of their classifiers. Another multi-channel source for BCI is electroencephalograph (EEG), which possesses different spatial and temporal features from fNIRS. In EEG field, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm is widely used aimed at dimensionality reduction. In our article, we modified it based on the characteristics of fNIRS and evaluated its effectiveness in discriminating Mental Arithmetic (MA) against resting status in an open-access dataset. The Modified Common Spatial Pattern algorithm significantly outperforms CSP algorithm in fNIRS-based BCI and shows its potential in further BCI related explorations.	anterior descending branch of left coronary artery;brain neoplasms;brain-computer interfaces;brain–computer interface;cspg4 wt allele;common spatial pattern;customize;dimensionality reduction;electroencephalograph;electroencephalography;extraction;imaging device;interface device component;large;mathematical optimization;mental disorders;numerous;rest;sample variance;sigmoid colon;sigmoid function;silo (dataset);spectroscopy, near-infrared;algorithm	Xinyu Jiang;Xiao Gu;Zhenning Mei;Haoran Ren;Wei Chen	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513454	brain–computer interface;common spatial pattern;feature extraction;imaging tool;dimensionality reduction;algorithm;statistical classification;electroencephalography;computer science	Visualization	15.711864489416657	-93.11241326765668	177662

In order to achieve a quantification of mental load, different load levels that occur during a workday have to be discriminated. In this work, we present how mental workload levels in everyday life scenarios can be discriminated with data from a mobile ECG logger by incorporating individual calibration measures. We present an experiment design to induce three different levels of mental workload in calibration sessions and to monitor mental workload levels in everyday life scenarios of seven healthy male subjects. Besides the recording of ECG data, we collect subjective ratings of the perceived workload with the NASA Task Load Index (TLX), whereas objective measures are assessed by collecting salivary cortisol. According to the subjective ratings, we show that all participants perceived the induced load levels as intended from the experiment design. The heart rate variability (HRV) features under investigation can be classified into two distinct groups. Features in the first group, representing markers associated with parasympathetic nervous system activity, show a decrease in their values with increased workload. Features in the second group, representing markers associated with sympathetic nervous system activity or predominance, show an increase in their values with increased workload. We employ multiple regression analysis to model the relationship between relevant HRV features and the subjective ratings of NASA-TLX in order to predict the mental workload levels during office-work. The resulting predictions were correct for six out of the seven subjects. In addition, we compare the performance of three classification methods to identify the mental workload level during office-work. The best results were obtained with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) that yielded a correct classification for six out of the seven subjects. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) and the support vector machine (SVM) resulted in a correct classification of the mental workload level during office-work for five out of the seven subjects.	data logger;design of experiments;heart rate variability;just-in-time compilation;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;linear discriminant analysis;support vector machine	Burcu Cinaz;Bert Arnrich;Roberto La Marca;Gerhard Tröster	2011	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-011-0466-1	real-time computing;heart rate variability;simulation;stress	HCI	10.729884977870224	-91.05229203628417	177922

Respiratory and motion artifacts cause baseline drift in the sensed impedance waveform, particularly during or after exercise. This paper presents an LMS-based adaptive filtering technique for suppression of respiratory artifact for improving the estimation of the indices without smearing the beat-to-beat variations. It uses a reference signal, closely related to the respiratory artifact, obtained by a least-squares approximation based B-spline fitting on the contaminated impedance cardiogram in synchronism with the respiratory phases. The technique is evaluated on signals with simulated artifacts and on signals from nine healthy subjects and five patients with cardiovascular disorders. The values of the stroke volume, estimated on beat-to-beat basis, after suppression of respiratory artifact showed a good agreement with those from Doppler echocardiography.	adaptive filter;approximation;artifact (software development);b-spline;baseline (configuration management);blood volume;cardiography, impedance;cardiovascular diseases;cerebrovascular accident;characteristic impedance;chest;doppler echocardiography;least squares;morphologic artifacts;nominal impedance;output impedance;patients;quantitative impedance;smoothing spline;stroke volume;waveform;zero suppression;cardiography;electric impedance	Vinod K.

We analyzed specimens of the human cerebellum and described the central vein of the nucleus dentatus as the main venous outflow of the nucleus. The central vein of the nucleus dentatus is formed by a network of smaller vessels draining the sinuosities of the gray matter; it emerges from the hilum of the nucleus and runs along the superior cerebellar peduncle, opening in the anterior vermian vein. We looked for this structure and for the surrounding veins on ultra-high-field (7 Tesla) MR, using susceptibility-weighted imaging. An anatomical and radiological description of the veins of the dentate nucleus is provided, with some remarks on the future clinical applications that these findings could provide.	blood vessel;cns disorder;cell nucleus;cerebellar peduncle;cerebellum;dentate nucleus;gray matter;hilum;peduncle - plant part;published comment;small;specimen;tesla - unit;veins;dorsal raphe nucleus	Antonio Di Ieva;Manfred Tschabitscher;Renato Juan Galzio;Günther Grabner;Claudia Kronnerwetter;Georg Widhalm;Christian Matula;Siegfried Trattnig	2011	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.07.045	susceptibility weighted imaging;pathology;anatomy;surgery	Visualization	21.65755946640826	-80.64274987633135	178722

The feature extraction procedure (FEP) extracts frequency domain information to form features whilst time-frequency resolution is attained by localising the fast Fourier transformations (FFTs) of the signals to specific windows localised in time. All features are extracted at the rate of the signal sampling interval from a main feature extraction (FE) window through which all data passes. Subject-specific frequency bands are selected for optimal feature extraction and intraclass variations are reduced by smoothing the spectra for each signal by an interpolation (IP) process. The TF features are classified using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The FE window has potential advantages for the FEP to be applied in an online brain-computer interface (BCI). The approach achieves good performance when quantified by classification accuracy (CA) rate, information transfer (IT) rate, and mutual information (MI). The information that these performance measures provide about a BCI system is analysed and the importance of this is demonstrated through the results.	automated theorem proving;brain–computer interface;digital signal processing;electroencephalography;fast fourier transform;feature extraction;frequency band;interpolation;linear discriminant analysis;mathematical optimization;microsoft windows;mutual information;quantifier (logic);sampling (signal processing);smoothing;software performance testing;while;on-line system	Damien Coyle;Girijesh Prasad;T.

Evaluating cerebral hemodynamics by using traditional statistic- and linear-based methods would underestimate or miss important information. Complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) has great capability of adaptive feature extraction from non-linear and non-stationary data without distortion. This study applied CEEMD for assessment of cerebral hemodynamics in response to physiologic challenges including paced 6-cycle breathing, hyperventilation, 7% CO2 breathing and head-up tilting test in twelve healthy subjects. Intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) were extracted from arterial blood pressure (ABP) and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) signals, and was quantified by logarithmic averaged period and logarithmic energy density. The IMFs were able to show characteristics of ABP and CBFV waveform morphology in beat-to-beat timescale and in long-term trend scale. The changes in averaged period and energy density derived from IMFs were helpful for qualitative and quantitative assessment of ABP and CBFV responses to physiologic challenges. CEEMD is a promising method for assessing non-stationary components of systemic and cerebral hemodynamics.	hemodynamics;hilbert–huang transform;stationary process;velocity (software development)	Chi-Ching Chang;Hung-Yi Hsu;Tzu-Chien Hsiao	2013	Advances in Adaptive Data Analysis	10.1142/S1793536913500027	hilbert–huang transform;cerebral blood flow;blood pressure;mathematics;statistics;hyperventilation;breathing;hemodynamics;flow velocity;cerebral circulation;cardiology;internal medicine	AI	18.6909173288066	-84.23330947938716	179056

Machine learning techniques have been applied to ambulatory recordings of wrist actigraphy, light exposure, electrocardiograms (ECG), and distal and proximal skin temperature to develop ARMAX models capturing the main signal dependencies on circadian phase and evaluating them versus melatonin onset times. The most accurate models extracted heart rate variability features from an ECG coupled with wrist activity information to produce phase estimations with prediction errors of ~30 minutes. Replacing the ECG features with skin temperature from the upper leg led to a slight degradation, while less accurate results, in the order of 1 hour, were obtained from wrist activity and light measurements. The trade-off between highest precision and least obtrusive configuration is discussed for applications to sleep and mood disorders caused by a misalignment of the internal phase with the external solar and social times.	actigraphy;activity tracker;dermatologic disorders;elegant degradation;estimated;extraction;heart rate variability;machine learning;melatonin;mood disorders;onset (audio);protocols documentation;quantum phase estimation algorithm;real life;sensor;skin temperature;solutions;standard deviation	Enrique A.

The glove incorporates local heating and cooling of the hand using multi-point skin temperature measurements as feedback, and thereby induces local and central mechanisms involved in thermoregulation. Electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG) and non-invasive finger-cuff based blood pressure (BP) measurements were used to monitor electrophysiology and hemodynamic changes in response to temperature modulation. Then, the triggered neuro-vascular mechanisms associated with thermoregulation were quantified by extracting parameters from the measured waveforms, specifically heart rate variability (HRV), vascular tone, and BP. The system was tested on six young, healthy individuals with no history of microvascular diseases. During heating, vasodilation, decrease in systolic BP, and a decrease in parasympathetic tone were observed, while during cooling, vasoconstriction and increased BP were observed. While such changes are expected physiologically using passive experiments, the ability to modulate the physiology non-invasively with a controlled, quantitative, and inexpensive instrument can potentially enable serial assessments of neuro-vascular control outside of clinical settings.	cerebrovascular disorders;computer cooling;cool - action;electrocardiography;evaluation procedure;experiment;finger joint structure;heart rate variability;heating;hematological disease;hemodynamics;modulation;numerous;physiologic thermoregulation;srgn gene;skin temperature;vascular diseases;vascular constriction (function);vasodilation disorder;physiological aspects	Andrew M.

For heart rate variability (HRV) analysis to be successful in prenatal diagnosis the selection of appropriate HRV indices is required. Those indices were organized according to universal principles of developmental biology. Key characteristics of evolution and self-organization are increasing fluctuation amplitude, increasing complexity and pattern formation. Related HRV indices were used to propose a fetal autonomic brain age score (fABAS). We estimated fABAS from magnetocardiographic recordings (21.4-40.3 weeks of gestation) preclassified in quiet (n=113, 63 females) and active sleep (n=286, 145 females) by cross-validated multivariate linear regression models in a cross-sectional study. fABAS explained 66/63% (training / validation set) of the variance by age in quiet and 51/50% in active sleep. We conclude that functional autonomic brain age can be assessed based on universal developmental indices obtained from fetal heart rate patterns.	autonomic computing;cross-sectional data;fetal heart;general linear model;heart failure;heart rate variability;language development disorders;pregnancy;quantum fluctuation;sample variance;self-organization;sleep, rem;pattern formation during regionalization	Dirk Hoyer;Uwe Schneider	2013	Computing in Cardiology 2013		psychology;endocrinology;developmental psychology;pathology	AI	18.749706148421012	-85.18207708332633	179269

Physiological signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG), temperature and electrocardiogram (ECG), to name a few, have been used to assess emotions like happiness, sadness or anger, or to assess levels of arousal or valence. Research efforts in this field so far have mainly focused on building pattern recognition systems with an emphasis on feature extraction and classifier design. A different set of features is extracted over each type of physiological signal, and then all these sets of features are combined, and used to feed a particular classifier. An important stage of a pattern recognition system that has received less attention within this literature is the feature selection stage. Feature selection is particularly useful for uncovering the discriminant abilities of particular physiological signals. The main objective of this paper is to study the discriminant power of different features associated to several physiological signals used for multimodal emotion recognition. To this end, we apply recursive feature elimination and margin-maximizing feature elimination over two well known multimodal databases, namely, DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI. Results show that EEG-related features show the highest discrimination ability. For the arousal index, EEG features are accompanied by Galvanic skin response features in achieving the highest discrimination power, whereas for the valence index, EEG features are accompanied by the heart rate features in achieving the highest discrimination power.	affective computing;database;electroencephalography;emotion recognition;feature extraction;feature selection;galvanic isolation;human–computer interaction;linear discriminant analysis;multimodal interaction;pattern recognition;recursion;sadness;statistical classification	Cristian A.

042e50e95d89a517081c445d4fc2dd115ac13a0d	a hybrid brain-machine interface based on eeg and emg activity for the motor rehabilitation of stroke patients		Including supplementary information from the brain or other body parts in the control of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has been recently proposed and investigated. Such enriched interfaces are referred to as hybrid BMIs (hBMIs) and have been proven to be more robust and accurate than regular BMIs for assistive and rehabilitative applications. Electromyographic (EMG) activity is one of the most widely utilized biosignals in hBMIs, as it provides a quite direct measurement of the motion intention of the user. Whereas most of the existing non-invasive EEG-EMG-hBMIs have only been subjected to offline testings or are limited to one degree of freedom (DoF), we present an EEG-EMG-hBMI that allows the simultaneous control of 7-DoFs of the upper limb with a robotic exoskeleton. Moreover, it establishes a biologically-inspired hierarchical control flow, requiring the active participation of central and peripheral structures of the nervous system. Contingent visual and proprioceptive feedback about the user's EEG and EMG activity is provided in the form of velocity modulation during functional task training. We believe that training with this closed-loop system may facilitate functional neuroplastic processes and eventually elicit a joint brain and muscle motor rehabilitation. Its usability is validated during a real-time operation session in a healthy participant and a chronic stroke patient, showing encouraging results for its application to a clinical rehabilitation scenario.	beckwith-wiedemann syndrome;body part;brain neoplasms;brain–computer interface;cns disorder;cerebrovascular accident;contingency (philosophy);control flow;control theory;electroencephalography;electroencephalography;electromyography;experiment;inspiration function;interface device component;modulation;muscle;muscular dystrophies, limb-girdle;online and offline;patients;peripheral;radiology information systems;real-time transcription;rehabilitation therapy;robot;two-hybrid system techniques;upper extremity;usability;velocity (software development);video game rehabilitation	Andrea Sarasola-Sanz;Nerea Irastorza-Landa;Eduardo Lopez-Larraz;Carlos Bibian;Florian Helmhold;Doris Broetz;Niels Birbaumer;Ander Ramos-Murguialday	2017	2017 International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR)	10.1109/ICORR.2017.8009362	brain–computer interface;control engineering;rehabilitation;usability;powered exoskeleton;electroencephalography;electromyography;stroke;engineering	Robotics	12.012347850651002	-92.88435064854329	179572
052ae8b496c95785ecdf5a11678296e7db477eec	a fuzzy human model for blood pressure estimation		The paper describes a blood pressure prediction model. The model predicts blood pressure of the subject based on trend of the blood pressure, body weight and number of steps. To predict it, we make autoregressive (AR) model, liner prediction model, body weight based prediction model and steps based prediction model. These models are boosted by fuzzy logic. The fuzzy degrees are calculated from mean absolute prediction error, correlation coeffi- cient and variation amount for the learning data. In our experiment, we col- lected blood pressure, body weight and number of steps of 453 subjects from WellnessLINK which is an internet life-log service. Our proposed model pre- dicted their blood pressures. The mean correlation coefficient between the pre- dicted values and measurement systolic blood pressures was 0.895.

METHODS Chronic subdural electrodes were employed for functional mapping during a routine invasive evaluation for intractable epilepsy. After the fibers originating from the dorsal PMC were plotted into the tractography-integrated functional neuronavigation, subcortical MEPs and clinical symptoms were examined during resection of the epileptogenic dorsal PMC.   RESULTS During removal of the epileptogenic area, MEPs were elicited by electrical stimulation of the fibers originating from the dorsal PMC, which were separated from the pyramidal tracts from the precentral gyrus. Resection of the dorsal PMC and its fibers caused a transient dysmetric movement of the left toe without motor weakness.   CONCLUSION Functional corticospinal tract fibers originating from the dorsal PMC can be defined and removed safely under local anesthesia with the aid of integration of functional neuronavigation and subcortical electrical stimulation.

90384e8bd3785ceee447435896c8e708d3666585	optimal configuration of multilayer perceptron neural network classifier for recognition of intracranial epileptic seizures		Background: This paper presents optimized configuration of multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) as a pattern classifier for recognition of intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) epileptic seizures. Though qualitative analysis of intracranial recordings from the patients involves cumbersome procedure, it provides significant neuronal activities of the brain that is essential for clinical decision making. Methods: This study considered three epileptic seizures stages, namely, pre-ictal (set C), post-ictal (set D) and epileptic (set E) iEEG from the University of Bonn, Germany database. Four entropies, Shannon, log energy, spectral and Renyi entropies were considered as features to evaluate MLP-NN network. Four classification tasks with the dataset were formed, namely CE, DE, CDE, and CD. In order to identify the optimal configuration of MLP-NN for classification, network parameters such as input-hidden layer activation/transfer functions, hidden-output layer activation/transfer functions, network training/learning functions, the number of hidden neurons were considered and the optimality was arrived based on the mean square error (MSE), classification accuracy (CA). The efficiency of the entropy features was exploited by the parameters, mutual range of coefficient ( γ ), p-value, and z-score, which showed the band discrimination for various classification tasks. Results: Simulations results showed that the tan sigmoid, pure linear were found to be optimal inputhidden, hidden-output transfer function and Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm as optimal training function for all the four classification tasks. It was inferred from the proposed study that the CA indirectly varies with γ value, p value, and MSE, and directly varies with z-score. From the experimental study, the best CA of 97.68%, 94.56%, 84.58%, and 57.8% was obtained for case CE, DE, CDE, and CD respectively. It can be concluded that proposed features with optimally configured MLP-NN found to be helpful for real-time iEEG classification. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The main feature of such masqueraders is that they have knowledge about the behavior profile of legitimate users. The dataset provided by Schonlau et al [4] (SEA) has been modified for including synthetic sessions created by masqueraders using the behavior profile of the users intented to impersonate. It is proposed an hybrid method for detection of masqueraders based on the compression of the users sessions and Hidden Markov Models. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using ROC curves and compared against other known methods. As is shown in results of the experiments, the proposed detection mechanism is the best of the methods here considered.	experiment;hidden markov model;markov chain;receiver operating characteristic;sensor;synthetic intelligence;unix;unix-like;user profile	Román Posadas;J.

1e9db58ebac13a2ecf3795396b619bbd63ef6289	parkinson's disease monitoring by biomechanical instability of phonation		Patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) may be successfully treated pharmacologically and surgically to preserve and even improve their life quality and health conditions. Although the progress of the disease cannot be stopped, at least mitigation of the most handicapping symptoms can be achieved. But both pharmacological and surgical treatments require the adequate monitoring of the disease stage of progress and the effects of treatment. Several techniques have been proposed for PD evolution monitoring, ranging from subjective auto-evaluation by questionnaires, or from gait and handwriting examination by specialists. Nevertheless, these techniques present certain difficulties, which make frequent evaluation impractical. On the other hand, it is known that speech acoustic analysis may estimate indicators of patient's conditions, and can be implemented for a frequent evaluation protocol; and under minimal help, it can be carried out at distance using communication technologies. The acoustic analysis, may be based on mel-cepstral coefficients, distortion features as  jitter, shimmer , harmonic-to-noise contents, or pitch-perturbation estimates, among others. Phonation biomechanical parameter and tremor estimates are also good markers of PD. The present work proposes a combination of biomechanical features to predict PD progress using Bayesian likelihood estimation. This methodology proves to be very sensitive and allows a three-band based comparison: pre-treatment versus post-treatment in reference to a control subject or a normative population. Results from a study are presented, including eight patients recorded on a 4-week separation interval, meanwhile they were treated with medication, physical exercising and speech therapy. The conclusions show that certain distortion, biomechanical and tremor features are of special relevance to monitor PD phonation, and that they can be used as evolution markers.	instability	Pedro Gómez Vilda;Daniel Palacios-Alonso;María Victoria Rodellar Biarge;Agustín Álvarez Marquina;Victor Nieto Lluis;Rafael Martínez	2017	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2016.06.092	physical medicine and rehabilitation;artificial intelligence;parkinson's disease;machine learning;gait;mathematics;phonation;handwriting;disease;speech processing;population	Logic	15.885900881419529	-86.07285629734801	180798

We compared the temporal and spatial binary classification accuracy as well as the grand-averaged classification accuracies over repetitions. Results show that long delays may cause better performance in early time intervals corresponding to negative ERP components, but better overall performance is achieved with short visual-to-auditory delays.	acoustic evoked brain stem potentials;acoustic stimulation;binary classification;brain neoplasms;brain–computer interface;combined modality therapy;erp;gain;multimodal interaction;optimizing compiler;perseveration;programming paradigm;explanation;recurrent childhood brain stem glioma;spelling	Xingwei An;Dong Ming;Douglas Sterling;Hongzhi Qi;Benjamin Blankertz	2014	2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2014.6943818	computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;communication	Visualization	13.297778404835318	-92.36223859576917	180813

It is an open issue to remove the ocular artifact as completely as possible without losing the useful EEG information. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has been one of the correction approaches to correct the ocular artifact in practice. However, ICA based approach may overly or less remove the artifacts when the EEG sources and ocular sources cannot be represented in different independent components (ICs). In this paper, a new approach combining ICA and Auto-Regressive eXogenous (ARX) (ICA-ARX) is proposed for a more robust removal of ocular artifact. In the proposed approach, to lower the negative effect induced by ICA, ARX is used to build the multi-models based on the ICA corrected signals and the reference EEG selected before contamination period for each channel, and then the optimal model will be selected for further artifact removal. The results applied to both the simulated signals and actual EEG recordings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for ocular artifact removal, and its potential to be used in the EEG related studies.	independent component analysis;system identification	Zhenyu Wang;Peng Xu;Tiejun Liu;Yin Tian;Xu Lei;Dezhong Yao	2014	Biomed.

5022669e1ad5424ab22b6d83fcccff0655fefdf6	driver’s modeling with system identification algorithm to aim reducing drowsiness		The purpose of this study is to develop a biological model between skin temperature change and cooling stimulation to prevent drivers from becoming drowsiness. The traffic accident by an operation mistake or aimless operation has occurred. A factor of these accidents has a driver’s nap. In recent years, many researchers have studied eagerly this theme. The purpose of their studies is to detect a driver’s drowsiness. On the other hand, the aim of our study is to contribute to development of technology for safe drive assistance to maintain a driver’s arousal levels. This technology may give a technical innovation in the relevant area. In general, a change in blood volume in nasal part depends on the vasoconstrictive effect of the sympathetic nervous system along with changes in physiological and psychological conditions. The nasal skin temperature changes depending on the blood flow, thus, the temperature reflects the physiological state. The temperature also decreases as the blood flow in the nasal area decreases during sympathetic hyperactivity. The temperature increases as the blood flow in the nasal area increases due to sympathetic suppression. Previous studies have showed a relationship between nasal skin temperature reflecting autonomic nervous system activity and arousal level. The experiment was conducted to gather data for constructing a biological model of a driver and the relationship between cooling stimulation and nasal skin temperature was modeled with system identification. And the usefulness of models was examined with time response simulation and nyquist diagram. In summary, it is possible to construct biological model based on relationship between thermal stimulation and nasal skin temperature by using ARX, ARMAX and BJ of low order.

26ee2749ebb944de58ad4b8d7b6520a8b08fcede	real-time blood pressure estimation from force-measured ultrasound		Objective: Our objective is to create a blood pressure measurement device, which may provide a way to easily acquire frequent measurements. Common techniques to measure blood pressure include an arterial catheter, an oscillometric pressure cuff, or an auscultatory pressure cuff. Methods: The approach takes as input ultrasound images of an artery and contact force between the ultrasound array and subject. A subject may perform the self-measurements. Image and force data is analyzed for its quality and used to provide guidance or reject poor measurements. Tissue motions, due to probe contact forces and pulsing blood pressure, are estimated from the ultrasound image. Tissues elasticities and blood pressure are found by optimally fitting the observed tissue motion versus applied forces to a table of predicted motion–pre-generated with a finite element tissue deformation model. The output of the optimization is an estimate of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and surrounding tissue stiffness. Results: The real-time implementation of the algorithm was validated on a cohort of 21 single-visit volunteers and on four volunteers self-monitored longitudinally. The systolic and diastolic pressures were compared to oscillometric cuff readings. Regression and Bland–Altman analyses were performed. Conclusion: Systolic pressure and diastolic pressure can be estimated in real-time and by the subject using this novel non-invasive ultrasound-based method (systolic accuracy/precision: −5.2 mmHg/10.7 mmHg; diastolic accuracy/precision: −3.9/8.0 mmHg). Significance:  The method occupies a middle ground between the arterial catheter and cuff-based techniques. It has the potential to give calibration-free results.	arterial stiffness;body tissue;calibration;diastole;diastolic blood pressure;finite element method;mathematical optimization;motion;real-time clock;real-time transcription;systolic pressure;algorithm;arterial catheter;torr	Aaron M.

Several algorithms have been developed to detect atrial fibrillation, which either rely on atrial activity analysis or are based on the irregularity of RR intervals. This paper is addressed to study the latter type of algorithms. The main question is whether there is sufficient information in the sequence of RR intervals for reliable detection of atrial fibrillation and whether the atrial fibrillation can be diferentiatedfrom other significant ECG arrhythmias. We have tested various types of algorithms existing in the technical papers utilizing MIT-BIH databases. Except the atrial fibrillation all other arrhythmias have some regularity, self-similarity and some degree of predictability. Consequently, algorithms utilizing only the values of RR intervals without their order may misclassifY other irregular rhythms as atrial fibrillation. The best algorithms use the scatter plot of successive RR diferences or Sample Entropy. The error rate was about 5%. It is possible to create a robust atrial fibrillation detection algorithm relying only on RR intervals considering their places in the sequence.	algorithm;bounding interval hierarchy;database;rapid refresh;round-robin scheduling;sample entropy;self-similarity	Sándor Hargittai	2014	Computing in Cardiology 2014			ML	16.50836254140175	-87.45628334811384	181132

The near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was employed to measure the absolute quantity of brain tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) in newborn neonates and the changes of concentrations of deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) and oxygenation hemoglobin (HbO2) with time relative to initial values to further obtain the changes of total hemoglobin (tHb) and cerebral perfusion (denoted by HbD). In normal neonates at 2–5 min post-birth, rSO2 increased while tHb remained relatively stable and HbD increased. In neonates born of PIH mothers at 3–5 min post-birth, the changes of tHb were markedly higher than those in the normal infants, p<0.05; at 2–5 min post-birth, the changes were markedly lower than the normal term infants. We concluded that NIRS can detect the changes of cerebral oxygenation and blood flow in a non-invasive and effective way.	% total hemoglobin;benign childhood cerebral neoplasm;cell respiration;cerebral infarction;deoxyhemoglobin measurement;hbb gene;hypophosphatemic bone disease;hemodynamics;hypertensive disease;infant, newborn;maxima and minima;oxygen saturation test result;oxyhemoglobin;pre-eclampsia;pregnancy associated hypertension;prolactin release-inhibiting hormone;spectroscopy, near-infrared	Xinlin Hou;Haiyan Ding;Yichao Teng;Congle Zhou;Dandan Zhang	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090289	infrared spectroscopy;medicine;pathology;spectroscopy;hemodynamics;anesthesia;physiology;quantum mechanics;surgery	Visualization	17.069685117168508	-84.08042938110661	181168

In order to obtain the complete emulation of a standard mouse, the single-click and double-click actions are desirable functionalities. In this study, the implementation of such actions is executed by the analysis of the electromyographic signal recorded from the Frontalis muscle. Muscle activity is discriminated from noise and this information is used to feed a state-machine that in turn decides which action is intended. The method uses an adaptive threshold, which offers freedom for the selection of the parameters of the system. The rate of successfully detected commands found was up to 100% for the single-click and 92% for the double-click. Even though good results were found for double-clicks, the experiment indicate muscle fatigue in the short term. The time response found was below 300 ms suggesting real-time implementation is feasible. Also, other devices can be operated with this approach, if it is accepted as a two symbols system generator.	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;cdisc adas-cog - commands summary score;cerebrovascular accident;chronic fatigue syndrome;double-click;electromyography;emulator;execution;finite-state machine;lateral thinking;motor neuron disease;myalgia;point and click;real-time clock;real-time computing;simulation;spinal cord injuries;spinal cord neoplasms	Carlos G.

Four male subjects were asked to do voluntary elbow flexion and extension. An inertial sensor and surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors were attached to subject's forearm. Joint angle calculated by fusion of acceleration and angular rate using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and muscle activations obtained from the sEMG signals were taken as the inputs of the proposed NMS model to determine individual muscle force. The result shows that our NMS model can predict individual muscle force accurately, with the ability to reflect subject-specific joint dynamics and neural control solutions.

Previous studies have indicated that changes in biomechanical gait stability parameters provide substantial safety gait metrics for assessing workers’ fall risks. However, scant research has been conducted on changes in biomechanical gait stability parameters based on foot plantar pressure patterns to assess workers’ fall risks. This research examined the changes in spatial foot regions and loss of balance events associated with biomechanical gait stability parameters based on foot plantar pressure patterns measured by wearable insole pressure system. To test the hypotheses of this study, ten asymptomatic participants conducted laboratory simulated loss of balance events which are often initiated by extrinsic fall risk factors. Our results found: (1) statistically significant differences in biomechanical gait stability parameters between spatial foot regions, especially with the peak pressure parameter; and (2) statistically significant differences in biomechanical gait stability parameters between loss of balance events when compared to normal gait (baseline), especially with the pressure-time integral parameter. Overall, the findings of this study not only provide useful safety gait metrics for early detection of specific spatial foot regions but also allow safety managers to understand the mechanism of loss of balance events in order to implement proactive fall-prevention strategies.

The study of the autonomic regulation during sleep allowed developing methods for automatic detection and classification of some sleep characteristics, both in physiological and pathological conditions. The main problems which require to be faced are the presence of frequent non-stationarities in the signal and the need of dealing with long term analysis, in order to provide reliable indices able to describe the whole night of sleep. In the present paper we are presenting some of the methodologies we recently employed in the study of the heart rate variability during sleep, ranging from time-frequency analysis to long time correlation.

Linear BCI control can be achieved if two motor imagery classes can be discriminated with a reliability over 80% in single trial. The results presented in this work show that there was no significant loss of performance using the neuroproshesis in comparison to MI where no stimulation was present. However, it is remarkable how different the experience of the users was in the same experiment.

Lame cows produce less milk and have other costs associated such as the loss of reproductive performance and the need for veterinary treatment. The earlier a lame cow is detected, the more effectively it can be treated. Currently, lame cows are detected by visual inspection performed by herdsmen. However, visual inspection is subjective and time consuming. We present an approach to automatically detect lameness based on a wearable motion sensor attached to a cow's hind left leg and a pressure plate.	motion detector;visual inspection;wearable computer	Juan Haladjian;Bernd Brügge;Stefan Nüske	2017		10.1145/3123024.3123152	artificial intelligence;computer vision;dairy cattle;computer science;wearable computer;gait analysis;visual inspection;lameness	Vision	10.232511140683854	-84.5349951165964	181887

This paper presents an approach to predict weight of individual bites taken. We utilize a pattern recognition procedure to spot chewing cycles and food type in continuous data from an ear-pad chewing sound sensor. The recognized information is used to predict bite weight. We present our recognition procedure and demonstrate its operation on a set of three selected foods of different bite weights. Our evaluation is based on chewing sensor data of eight healthy study participants performing 504 habitual bites in total. The sound-based chewing recognition achieved recalls of 80% at 60%-70% precision. Food classification of chewing sequences resulted in an average accuracy of 94%. In total, 50 variables were derived from the chewing microstructure, and were analyzed for correlations between chewing behavior and bite weight. A subset of four variables was selected to predict bite weight using linear food-specific models. Mean weight prediction error was lowest for apples (19.4%) and largest for lettuce (31%) using the sound-based recognition. We conclude that bite weight prediction using acoustic chewing recordings is a feasible approach for solid foods, and should be further investigated.	acoustic cryptanalysis;cep70 gene;chewing;dental occlusion;eating disorders;evaluation procedure;expect;feeding behaviors;human bite;largest;lettuce - dietary;modality (human–computer interaction);pattern recognition;specimen source codes - bite;subgroup;surgical replantation;weight;bite injury;type of food	Oliver Amft;Martin Kusserow;Gerhard Tröster	2009	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2009.2015873	computer vision;simulation;speech recognition;microstructure;computer science;engineering;signal processing;communication;statistics	Vision	11.873852941915208	-86.29607726374823	181919

The temporal distribution of the energy of wavelet coefficients is quantified by wavelet entropy at each ventricular beat. More effective ventricular activity suppression yields increased entropies at scales dominated by the ventricular and atrial components of the ECG. Two studies are undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy of the method: first, using synthesised ECGs with controlled levels of residual ventricular activity, and second, using patient recordings with ventricular activity suppressed by an average beat template subtraction algorithm. In both cases wavelet entropy is shown to be a good measure of the effectiveness of ventricular beat suppression.	algorithm;coefficient;entropy (information theory);rényi entropy;wavelet;zero suppression	Philip Langley	2015	Entropy	10.3390/e17096397	beat (music);residual;wavelet;statistics;mathematics;atrial fibrillation;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence	ML	19.830171621687104	-88.61687553566274	181973

Such data sets routinely arise while working with neuroscience data, EEG and spike trains would perhaps be the most obvious example. In this paper, we discuss the modeling of a hybrid time series, with the continuous component being the physiological tremors in the distal phalanx of the middle finger, and motor unit firings in the middle finger portion of the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) muscle. We employ a model for the two components based on Auto-regressive Moving Average (ARMA) type models. Another major issue to arise in the modeling of such data is to assess the goodness of fit. We suggest a visual procedure based on mutual information towards assessing the dependence pattern of hybrid data. The goodness of fit is also verified by standard model fitting diagnostic techniques for univariate data.

8f349835f9a3d76a00c13492051603f9c880baae	feasibility of noninvasive blood pressure measurement using a chest-worn patch sensor		Pulse arrival time (PAT) and pulse transit time (PTT) derived from the finger have been widely investigated for noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement. The study investigates the feasibility of BP measurement using a chestworn patch sensor derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing measurements. Healthy volunteers (N=14, 38 ± 13 years) carried out a protocol including deep breathing test, sustained hand grip test and modified Valsalva test with continuous physiological measurements from a patch sensor attached on left chest and intermittent BP measurements from an automated oscillometric monitor as a reference. The efficacy of chest derived PAT and PTT for univariate BP prediction is assessed using correlation and regression slope. The cross validation performance of predicting BP using multivariate regression model with chest derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing features were also evaluated. The results suggest that the chest derived PAT and PTT had modest correlations (-0.52 and -0.31) and regression slopes (-0.21 and -0.14) with automated oscillometric systolic and diastolic BP references, respectively. On the other hand, a multivariate regression approach for prediction of mean blood pressure (MBP) using patch sensor measurements showed a correlation of 0.72, mean error of 0.1 mmHg and RMSE error of 5.1 mmHg compared to the oscillometric MBP values. The study demonstrated the feasibility of BP measurement using a wearable chest-worn patch sensor in healthy control subjects.	activated partial thromboplastin time measurement;breath tests;cross-sectional studies;diastole;general linear model;intravascular mean:pressure:point in time:arterial system:quantitative;million book project;pulse transit time;sensor;time of arrival;wearable computer;slope;torr	Nandakumar Selvaraj;Hitesh Reddivari	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513211	computer vision;blood pressure;cross-validation;diaphragmatic breathing;diastole;artificial intelligence;multivariate statistics;cardiology;univariate;pulse (signal processing);internal medicine;mean squared error;computer science	SE	12.661935696687397	-86.36709728911951	182194

The free running electromyography (EMG) and the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) are monitored by the neurophysiologist for surgical intervention to avoid neurophysiologic deficit. However, there is a variation of surgical intervention in different neurophysiologist. 50% decrease in amplitude of CMAP response is considered as nerve damage compared with the baseline which may vary in particular case. These would make the nerve function estimation qualitative evaluated by neurophysiologist. This study aimed to investigate the quantitative method of nerve function prediction. Instead of applying one pulse stimulus, the varied current amplitude pulse train was applied to the nerve to obtain the variation of the CMAP responses. The varied CMAP responses were used as an input of artificial neuron network (ANN) for estimating the remaining nerve function. The results revealed that the estimated nerve damage level was linearly correlated with the measured nerve damage.	action potential;artificial neuron;baseline (configuration management);cmap (font);constant current;electromyography;graphical user interface;power supply;sampling (signal processing)	Dilok Puanhvuan;Sarawin Khemmachotikun;Sorayouth Chumnanvej;Yodchanan Wongsawat	2014	2014 Joint 7th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems (SCIS) and 15th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligent Systems (ISIS)	10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2014.7044851	artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;amplitude;pulse wave;stimulus (physiology);compound muscle action potential;control theory;electromyography;pulse (signal processing);artificial neuron	Robotics	15.394955030338165	-85.62676741398012	182272
0bc5c066103f21eb08e04f12df9b6c2d9d1e876e	classification of normal and epileptic seizure eeg signals based on empirical mode decomposition		Epileptic seizure occurs as a result of abnormal transient disturbance in the electrical activities of the brain. The electrical activities of brain fluctuate frequently and can be analyzed using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Therefore, the EEG signals are commonly used signals for obtaining the information related to the pathological states of brain. The EEG recordings of an epileptic patient contain a large amount of EEG data which may require time-consuming manual interpretations. Thus, automatic EEG signal analysis using advanced signal processing techniques plays a significant role to recognize epilepsy in EEG recordings. In this work, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has been applied for analysis of normal and epileptic seizure EEG signals. The EMD generates the set of amplitude and frequency modulated components known as intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Two area measures have been computed, one for the graph obtained as the analytic signal representation of IMFs in complex plane and another for second-order difference plot (SODP) of IMFs of EEG signals. Both of these area measures have been computed for first four IMFs of the normal and epileptic seizure EEG signals. These eight features obtained from both area measures of first four IMFs have been used as input feature set for classification of normal and epileptic seizure EEG signals using least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier. Among all three kernel functions namely, linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) used for classification, the RBF kernel has provided best classification accuracy in the classification of normal and epileptic seizure EEG signals. The proposed method based on the two area measures of IMFs obtained using EMD process, together with LS-SVM classifier has been studied on EEG dataset publicly available by the University of Bonn, Germany. Experimental results have been included to show the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to other existing methods.	electroencephalography;hilbert–huang transform	Ram Bilas Pachori;Rajeev Sharma;Shivnarayan Patidar	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-12883-2_13	kernel (statistics);hilbert–huang transform;signal processing;support vector machine;electroencephalography;epileptic seizure;mathematics;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;analytic signal;radial basis function kernel	AI	17.793468066519132	-90.19503678716612	182431

This study introduces a modification of Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) for subject transfer BCIs, where similar characteristics are considered to transfer knowledge from other subjects׳ data. With this aim, we proposed a new approach based on Composite Local Temporal Correlation CSP, namely Composite LTCCSP with selected subjects, which considers the similarity between subjects using Frobenius distance. The performance of the proposed method is compared with different methods like traditional CSP, Composite CSP, LTCCSP and Composite LTCCSP. Experimental results have shown that our proposed method has increased the performance compared to all these different methods. Furthermore, our results suggest that it is worth emphasizing the data of subjects with similar characteristics in a subject transfer diagram. The suggested framework, as demonstrated by experimental results, can obtain a positive knowledge transfer for enhancing the performance of BCIs.

The artifacts may contain eye-blinking, muscle noise, heart signal, line noise, and environmental effect. Such noises often make the raw EEG signals not very useful for extraction/identification of physiological phenomena from EEG. The independent component analysis (ICA) is a popular technique for artifact removal in brain research and some reports demonstrate that ICA can remove the artifacts with lower (acceptable) loss of information. But, these reports select useful independent components manually, primarily by looking at the scalp-plots. This is of great inconvenience and is a barrier for BCI or real-time applications of EEG. In this paper, we demonstrate that machine learning methods could be quite effective to discriminate useful independent components from artifacts and our findings suggests the possibility of developing a “universal” machine for artifact removal in EEG.	artifact (software development);automatic identification and data capture;electroencephalography;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;machine learning;noise (electronics);real-time clock	Hwa-Shan Huang;Nikhil R.

When stimulated by different acupuncture manipulations, the neural system can evoke different electrical signals, because the excited receptors and nerve fiber types are different. As to nervous system, information encoding is in the time mode and frequency mode of spike trains. Power spectrum analysis, histogram statistic and some other traditional analysis methods might miss a lot of important information. In order to extract characteristics and analyze regularities of electrical signals evoked by different acupuncture manipulations, and explore new methods for the objectification and quantization study of acupuncture manipulations, wavelet-entropy combined method and interspace intervals (ISI) series were employed to analyze the characteristics of electrical signals of spinal dorsal root fine nerve bundle evoked by stimulating Zusanli point (ST36) on normal rats with different acupuncture manipulation methods, which were rotate-twirl methods (Rt), including rotate-twirl reinforcing method (Rtf) and rotate-twirl reducing method (Rtd), lift-thrust methods (Lt), mainly as lift-thrust reinforcing method (Ltf) and lift-thrust reducing method (Ltd).

The high pressures seen can be a significant source of pain, as well as result in deep tissue damage. The compensation of the sound limbs causes an asymmetrical gait which can be a contributor of early onset osteoarthritis in the sound limbs. It has been shown that the moment transferred with conventional passive prostheses can be lowered in magnitude by aligning the tibia with ground reaction forces, but this limits the effectiveness of the device. With recent powered prosthetics designed to mimic the missing limb, power can be injected into the gait cycle, but can also be limited by this pressure threshold. This paper shows the results of calculations that suggest that altering the prosthetic ankle mechanism can reduce the socket interface moments by as much as 50%. This supports the development of an active non-anthropomorphic ankle prosthesis which reduces socket interface moments while still injecting substantial power levels into the gait cycle.	amputees;bone structure of tibia;definition;degenerative polyarthritis;interface device component;limb structure;mechanics;onset (audio);pain;power (psychology);prosthesis implantation;socket device component;soft tissue injuries	Andrew K.

Unfortunately, as the bispectrum is timeshift invariant, the initial phase of the signal can't be recovered. When studying somatosensory evoked potentials (neuroelectric signals) this phase is generally the major information, especially when it characterizes pathologies. We show that some informations about this phase can be extracted from the averaged signal. An attempt to include this knowledge in the magnitude and phase recovery algorithms is made. We illustrate the bene ts of this approach on a simulation and a real application leading to a details enhancement of the analyzed signal.	algorithm;bispectrum;carrier recovery;signal averaging;simulation;timeshift	Olivier Meste	1997		10.1109/ICASSP.1997.598915	signal reconstruction;somatosensory evoked potential;speech recognition;signal transfer function;feature extraction;analog signal;computer science;group delay and phase delay;signal averaging;shift-invariant system;statistics	Metrics	19.70136921091322	-87.4323937434718	182683

Here we analyzed the EMG waveforms recorded from 16 shoulder and elbow muscles in six subjects during catching of balls projected frontally from a distance of 6 m and arriving at two different heights and with three different flight times (550, 650, 750 ms). We found that a large fraction of the variation in the muscle patterns was captured by two time-varying muscle synergies, coordinated recruitment of groups of muscles with specific activation waveforms, modulated in amplitude and shifted in time according to the ball's arrival height and flight duration. One synergy was recruited with a short and fixed delay from launch time. Remarkably, a second synergy was recruited at a fixed time before impact, suggesting that it is timed according to an accurate time-to-contact estimation. These results suggest that the control of interceptive movements relies on a combination of reactive and predictive processes through the intermittent recruitment of time-varying muscle synergies. Knowledge of the dynamic effect of gravity and drag on the ball may be then implicitly incorporated in a direct mapping of visual information into a small number of synergy recruitment parameters.	auditory recruitment;cns disorder;electromyography;launch time;modulation;movement;muscle;projections and predictions;star height;synergy	Mattia D'Andola;Benedetta Cesqui;Alessandro Portone;Laure Fernandes;Francesco Lacquaniti;Andrea d'Avella	2013		10.3389/fncom.2013.00107	simulation;bioinformatics;interception;operations research;intermittent energy source	HCI	15.426779819243203	-80.54405890550842	182733
00f4c2c3d509f3f51b1f9e8d3b8a13ba15acac09	an adaptive pattern analysis system for isolating emi	pattern analysis	-Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is any unwanted signal which interferes with the normal function of electronic devices. The EMI characteristics of these devices govern their ability to co-exist with other machines in an electromagnetically complex environment. Identification and removal of an EMI source is often necessary and represents a formidable pattern analysis problem. This paper presents generalizations of manual tests, which are usually done with single devices, to computerized testing of complex assemblies of devices. The procedures developed are adaptive in nature and suitable for use in extremely noisy environments.

The representation space is based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) of each recorded EMG signal using unconstrained parameterization of the mother wavelet. The classification is performed with a support vector machine (SVM) approach in a multichannel representation space. The mother wavelet is optimized with the criterion of minimum classification error, as estimated from the learning signal set. The method was applied to the classification of six hand movements with recording of the surface EMG from eight locations over the forearm. Misclassification rate in six subjects using the eight channels was (mean S.D.) 4.7 3.7% with the proposed approach while it was 11.1 10.0% without wavelet optimization (Daubechies wavelet). The DWT and SVM can be implemented with fast algorithms, thus, the method is suitable for real-time implementation. # 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

07336f202dd82a6d9e6bf5594e3b4b5253e59bf4	classification of focal and nonfocal eeg signals using anfis classifier for epilepsy detection		The electroencephalogram EEG is the frequently used signal to detect epileptic seizures in the brain. For a successful epilepsy surgery, it is very essential to localize epileptogenic area in the brain. The signals from the epileptogenic area are focal signals and signals from other area of the brain region nonfocal signals. Hence, the classification of focal and nonfocal signals is important for locating the epileptogenic area for epilepsy surgery. In this article, we present a computer aided automatic detection and classification method for focal and nonfocal EEG signal. The EEG signal is decomposed by Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform DT-CWT and the features are computed from the decomposed coefficients. These features are trained and classified using Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System ANFIS classifier. The proposed system achieves 98% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 99% accuracy for EEG signal classification. The experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed classification method to classify the focal and nonfocal EEG signals. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The method is based on the analysis of selected resolution levels (a subspace) in the translation invariant wavelet transform (TIWT) domain. Using a priori knowledge about the activation signal and trends, we analyze their power in different resolution levels in the TIWT domain and select an optimal set of resolution levels. A randomization-based statistical test is then applied in the wavelet domain for activation detection. This approach suppresses the effects of trends and enhances the detection sensitivity. In addition, since TIWT is insensitive to signal translations, the power analysis is robust with respect to signal shifts. The randomization test alleviates the need for assumptions about fMRI noise. The method has been applied to simulated and experimental fMRI datasets. Comparisons have been made between the results of the proposed method, a similar method in the time domain and the cross-correlation method. The proposed method has shown superior sensitivity compared to the other methods.	cross-correlation;genetic translation process;language translations;magnetic resonance imaging;resampling (statistics);stationary wavelet transform;fmri	Gholam-Ali Hossein-Zadeh;Hamid Soltanian-Zadeh;Babak A.

457ab3221527e89f296c862a696a2138aed416f8	a variable state dimension approach to meal detection and meal size estimation: in silico evaluation through basal-bolus insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes	kalman filters;diabetes;kalman filter artificial pancreas type 1 diabetes meal detection meal estimation;finite impulse response filters;artificial pancreas ap kalman filter meal detection meal estimation type 1 diabetes;heuristic algorithms;blood;insulin;sugar;sugar insulin blood diabetes heuristic algorithms kalman filters finite impulse response filters	Objective: This paper aims to develop an algorithm that can detect unannounced meals and estimate meal sizes to achieve a robust glucose control. Methods: A variable state dimension (VSD) algorithm is developed to detect unannounced meals and estimate meal sizes, where a Kalman filter operates on a quiescent state model when no meal is detected, and switches to a maneuvering state model to estimate meal information once the meal-induced glucose variability is statistically significant. Results: Through evaluation using 30 subjects of the UVa/Padova simulator, a basal-bolus (BB) control using the VSD-estimated meal size for each meal can achieve mean blood glucose (BG) of 142 mg/dl with an average 17.7% of time in hypoglycemia. In terms of 20 Monte–Carlo simulations for each subject over a two-day scenario, where each meal/snack has a probability of 0.5 not to be announced, the BB control using VSD for unannounced meals can achieve an average mean BG of 143 mg/dl with 8% of time in hypoglycemia, in contrast to mean BG of 180 mg/dl with 8% of time in hypoglycemia obtained by BB with missing boluses. Additionally, VSD is able to detect a meal within 45 (±14) min since its start with a 76% success rate and 16% false alarm rate. Conclusion: The addition of VSD to the BB control improves glucose control when meal announcements are missed. Significance: The VSD can be used as a complementary tool to detect meal and estimate meal size in absence of a meal announcement.	basal (phylogenetics);basal ganglia diseases;blood glucose;bolus tracking;common variable immunodeficiency;diabetes mellitus;diabetes mellitus, non-insulin-dependent;heart rate variability;hypoglycemia;insulin;job control (unix);kalman filter;maxima and minima;meal (occasion for eating);microsoft visio;monte carlo method;network switch;simulation;switch device component;ventricular septal defects;algorithm;mg/dl	Jinyu Xie;Qian Wang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2016.2599073	kalman filter;endocrinology;simulation;medicine;computer science;engineering;diabetes mellitus;proinsulin	Mobile	16.14837743189322	-86.91341906193408	183990

As the nervous system controls the muscle activity, the electromyography (EMG) signals can be viewed and examined in order to detect the vital features of the ALS disease in individuals. In this paper, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based features, which are extracted from a frame of EMG data, are introduced to classify the normal person and the ALS patients. From each frame of EMG data, instead of using a large number of DWT coefficients, the DWT coefficients with higher values as well as their mean and maxima are proposed to be used, which drastically reduces the feature dimension. It is shown that the proposed feature vector offers a high within class compactness and between class separations. For the purpose of classification, the K-nearest neighborhood classifier is employed. In order to demonstrate the classification performance, an EMG database consisted of 5 normal subjects and 5 ALS patients is considered and it is found that the proposed method is capable of distinctly separating the ALS patients from the normal persons.	coefficient;discrete wavelet transform;electromyography;feature vector;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;lateral computing;lateral thinking;maxima;neuron	Shaikh Anowarul Fattah;A.

47e897ab82eff4937a071b09aa13db3f67a9d2fc	a preliminary study of a running speed based heart rate prediction during an incremental treadmill exercise	analytical models;testing;heart rate;mathematical model;predictive models;regression analysis;correlation	This preliminary study investigates feasibility of a running speed based heart rate (HR) prediction. It is basically motivated from the assumption that there is a significant relationship between HR and the running speed. In order to verify the assumption, HR and running speed data from 217 subjects of varying aerobic capabilities were simultaneously collected during an incremental treadmill exercise. A running speed was defined as a treadmill speed and its corresponding heart rate was calculated by averaging the last one minute HR values of each session. The feasibility was investigated by assessing a correlation between the heart rate and the running speed using inter-subject (between-subject) and intra-subject (within-subject) datasets with regression orders of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Furthermore, HR differences between actual and predicted HRs were also employed to investigate the feasibility of the running speed in predicting heart rate. In the inter-subject analysis, a strong positive correlation and a reasonable HR difference (r = 0.866, 16.55±11.24 bpm @ 1st order; r = 0.871, 15.93±11.49 bpm @ 2nd order; r = 0.897, 13.98±10.80 bpm @ 3rd order; and r = 0.899, 13.93±10.64 bpm @ 4th order) were obtained, and a very high positive correlation and a very low HR difference (r = 0.978, 6.46±3.89 bpm @ 1st order; r = 0.987, 5.14±2.87 bpm @ 2nd order; r = 0.996, 2.61±2.03 bpm @ 3rd order; and r = 0.997, 2.04±1.73 bpm @ 4th order) were obtained in the intra-subject analysis. It can therefore be concluded that 1) heart rate is highly correlated with a running speed; 2) heart rate can be approximately estimated by a running speed with a proper statistical model (e.g., 3rd-order regression); and 3) an individual HR-speed calibration process may improve the prediction accuracy.	increment;statistical model;subject indexing;treadmill, device	Dae-Geun Jang;Byung-Hoon Ko;Sub Sunoo;Sang-Seok Nam;Hun-Young Park;Sang-Kon Bae	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591929	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;engineering;machine learning;mathematical model;mathematics;predictive modelling;software testing;engineering drawing;correlation;regression analysis;statistics	Robotics	14.747308103515682	-84.93538233724568	184396
43d041dc5ea32304ff36045c121b8f558e69d8f2	eeg-based person identification using rhythmic brain activity during sleep		In this paper we present a novel approach to the person identification problem using rhythmic brain activity of spindles from whole night EEG recordings. The proposed system consists of a feature extraction module and a K-NN based classifier. Different types of features from time, frequency and wavelet domain are used to highlight the topographic, temporal, morphological, spectral and statistical discriminative information of sleep spindles. The feature set’s efficacy is exhaustively tested in order to find the most significant descriptors that maximize intra-subject separability. Extensive experiments resulted in the optimal number of sensors and features that must be used to form the subject-specific unique descriptors. The proposed system showed significant identification accuracy of 99% ~ 90% for 2–20 subjects, and not lower than 86% when identifying 28 persons, indicating that this new type of modality should be further investigated to be used in EEG based identification applications.	electroencephalography	Athanasios Koutras;George K.

c072b710e815fe28dbc3e0b6b3d12c0bfe7087b2	gross motor activity patterns in depression and anxiety		Lower physical activity and sleep problems are linked to depressive and anxiety disorders and can be assessed objectively with wrist-worn actigraphy devices that measure gross motor activity. Standard methods to model 24-h actigraphy are often based on summary measures such as activity counts per day or parametric functional curves (e.g., cosinor functions), losing important information that may be a hallmark of the circadian impairment in psychiatric disorders. Functional Principal Component Analysis (fPCA), a powerful data-driven technique, may better describe daily activity patterns and provide a greater insight into the relationship with depression and anxiety. We assessed patterns of daily activity extracted with fPCA and will evaluate how they are associated with DSM-IV depression and anxiety disorders. Two-week actigraphy data of 367 participants with current (n=94), remitted (n=176) or no (n=90) depression and/or anxiety were obtained from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Daily minute-to-minute activity data were represented with a set of nine Fourier-based functions and summarized with a smaller set of functional principal components with the R package fda. Preliminary analyses resulted in four functional principal components explaining 77.4% of variability (Fig. 1): 1) fPCA1 represented high (+) versus dampened and shifted delayed (-) activity; 2) fPCA2 described morning (+) versus evening (-) activity; 3) fPCA3 showed biphasic (+) versus monophasic (-) activity; 4) fPCA4 represented biphasic morning (+) versus biphasic evening (-) activity. First analyses on the association of the extracted features with depression and anxiety using GEE analysis seem to indicate that current depression and anxiety are significantly associated with lower fPCA1 (?= -0.298, standard error (se) = 0.042, p = 0.006) but not with the other components. Further analyses will be conducted to evaluate if specific depression and anxiety characteristics (e.g. age of onset, duration, comorbidity) are associated with the components.

Using support vector regression, we demonstrate that the intensity of single pulse electrical stimulation can be decoded from the waveform of the evoked electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity, even if intensities used for training and testing of the regression model are disjoint. This was most effective when stimulation was applied directly over the motor cortex, less so for premotor and sensory cortex. Thus, if the optimal shape of the evoked neural response to stimulation is known, a regression model trained on the responses to a small set of stimulation intensities could be sufficient to determine the optimal stimulation intensity.	electrocorticography;functional electrical stimulation;support vector machine;the unsolved;waveform	Armin Walter;Georgios Naros;Martin Spüler;Alireza Gharabaghi;Wolfgang Rosenstiel;Martin Bogdan	2013			support vector machine;regression analysis;artificial intelligence;machine learning;pattern recognition;waveform;stimulation;decoding methods;pulse (signal processing);sensory cortex;computer science	ML	14.730363199097729	-93.10060629485723	184571
2f8e7d4a3a50ae5137a5e2c7ddc1c6f6569c04fb	towards the ambulatory assessment of movement quality in stroke survivors using a wrist-worn inertial sensor		Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability that may lead to significant functional motor impairments in the upper limb (UL). Wrist-worn inertial sensors have emerged as an objective, minimally-obtrusive tool to monitor UL motor function in the real-world setting, such that rehabilitation interventions can be individually tailored to maximize functional performance. However, current wearable solutions focus on capturing the quantity of movement without considering the quality of movement. This paper introduces a novel approach to unobtrusively estimate the quality of UL movements in stroke survivors using a single wrist-worn inertial sensor during any type of voluntary UL movements. The proposed method exploits kinematic characteristics of voluntary limb movements that are optimized by the central nervous system during motor control. This work demonstrates that the proposed method could extract clinically important information during random UL movements in 16 stroke survivors, showing a statistically significant correlation to the Functional Ability Scale - a clinically validated score for movement quality.	cns disorder;cerebrovascular accident;genetic translation process;nocturnal myoclonus syndrome;personalization;solutions;survivors;upper extremity;wearable computer;limb movement;sensor (device)	Sunghoon Ivan Lee;Hee-Tae Jung;Joonwoo Park;Jugyeong Jeong;Taekyeong Ryu;Yangsoo Kim;Vitor Sotero dos Santos;José Garcia Vivas Miranda;Jean-François Daneault	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512845	inertial measurement unit;computer vision;physical medicine and rehabilitation;rehabilitation;artificial intelligence;motor control;computer science;stroke	Robotics	12.49818473758146	-83.49113651652168	184904

Although several basic mobility tasks are included, only the total time is used as outcome parameter. It has been shown that timings of sub-phases can be used as relevant clinical parameters for the assessment of Parkinson's disease patients. A variety of systems and methods have been proposed for instrumenting the TUG test, but only limited information has been published regarding phase classification. In this paper an automated TUG phase classification methodology is proposed and validated in a study with 16 Parkinson's disease patients. Statistical, signal energy, chronological and gait features were extracted from acceleration and orientation signals of shoe mounted inertial measurement units. The phases `sit to walk', `walking', `first turn', `second turn' and `turn to sit' were segmented in a two stage classifier approach. Strides were used for a separation of the walking phase and classifiers like NaiveBayes, k-Nearest-Neighbor, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest for the final phase segmentation. SVM performed best with a mean sensitivity of 81.80 % over all phases. Additionally, the impact of UPDRS and Hoehn & Yahr ratings on the phase times was assessed. The proposed methodology could be used to analyze gait parameters of sub-phases like stride length, stride time, foot clearance, heel-strike or toe-off angle for an improved assessment of Parkinson's disease patients.	cross infection;cross-validation (statistics);extraction;hidden markov model;instrumentation (computer programming);markov chain;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;population parameter;random forest;scientific publication;support vector machine;unified parkinson's disease rating scale questionnaire;biologic segmentation;sensor (device)	Samuel J.

Software modules reveal important information for cardiovascular disorders, it can also assist to general physicians to come up with more accurate and reliable diagnosis at early stages. Heart sound analyzer (HSA) software can overcome the deficiency of expert doctors and help them in rural as well as urban clinics and hospitals. HSA has two main blocks: data acquisition and pre-processing, time–frequency spectral analyses. The heart sounds are first acquired using a modified stethoscope which has an electret microphone in it. Then, the signals are analysed using the time–frequency/scale spectral analysis techniques such as STFT, Wigner–Ville distribution and wavelet transforms. HSA modules have been tested with real heart sounds from 35 volunteers and proved to be quite efficient and robust while dealing with a large variety of pathological conditions.	analyzer, device;angular defect;aortic valve insufficiency;bleomycin/doxorubicin/prednisone regimen (bap);cd-rom;cardiovascular diseases;computer simulation;congenital heart defects;data acquisition;exhibits as topic;heart septal defects;heart sounds;heart failure;heterogeneous system architecture;internet;labview;microphone device component;microsoft visio;mitral valve stenosis;parkinson disease;preprocessor;pulmonary stenosis;regurgitation;short-time fourier transform;software bug;software development;specification;spectral density estimation;stethoscopes;ventricular septal defects;virtual instrumentation;wavelet transform;wigner quasiprobability distribution	Taner Topal;Huseyin Polat;Inan Güler	2008	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-008-9146-8	fast fourier transform;speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;short-time fourier transform;software development;data acquisition;wavelet transform	Graphics	17.987649953706548	-88.18325999048452	185162

The device rests on a desktop and is portable, and permits real-time evaluation of the radial BMD. The device measures two (2) net time delay (NTD) parameters, NTD-DW and NTD-CW. NTD-DW is defined as the difference between the transit time of an ultrasound pulse to travel through soft-tissue, cortex and medullary cavity, and the transit time through soft tissue only of equal overall distance. NTD-CW is defined as the difference between the transit time of an ultrasound pulse to travel through soft-tissue and cortex only, and the transit time through soft tissue only again of equal overall distance. The square root of the product of these two parameters is a measure of the radial BMD at the 1/3rd location as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). A clinical IRB-approved study measured ultrasonically 49 adults at the 1/3rd radius. BMD was also measured at the same anatomical site and time using DXA. A linear regression using NTD produced a linear correlation coefficient of 0.94 (P<;0.001). These results are consistent with previously reported simulation and in vitro studies. In conclusion, although x-ray methods are effective in bone mass assessment, osteoporosis remains one of the largest undiagnosed and under-diagnosed diseases in the world today. The research described here should enable significant expansion of diagnosis and monitoring of osteoporosis through a desktop device that ultrasonically assesses bone mass at the 1/3rd radius.	asea irb;broadcast delay;coefficient;desktop computer;dreamwidth;dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry;notice and take down;radial (radio);radial basis function;real-time transcription;simulation	Jonathan J.

Although the HR has been studied almost since the beginning of fMRI, we are still far from having robust methods to account for the full range of known HR variation in typical fMRI analyses. This paper reviews how the authors and others contributed to our understanding of HR variation. We present an overview of studies that describe HR variation across voxels, healthy volunteers, populations, and dietary or pharmaceutical modulations. We also describe efforts to minimize the effects of HR variation in intrasubject, group, population, and connectivity analyses and the limits of these methods.	hemodynamics;population;review [publication type];voxel;fmri	Daniel A.

a77d58e0613ec0f91c9760d5362e963bac6a82f7	a portable wireless device based on oximetry for sleep apnea detection	sleep apnea;portable device;oxygen saturation;00-02;60-04;68-04	Obstructive sleep apnea is a highly prevalent sleep related breathing disorder and polysomnography is the gold standard exam for diagnosis. Despite providing results with high accuracy this multi-parametric test is expensive, time consuming and does not fit with the new tendency in health care that is changing the focus to prevention and wellness. Home health care is seen as a possible way to address this problematic by using minimal invasive devices, providing low cost of diagnosis and higher accessibility. To address this, a portable and automated sleep apnea detector was designed and evaluated. The device uses one SpO2 sensor and the analysis is based on the connection between oxygen saturation and apnea events. The measured signals are received in a field-programmable gate array that checks for errors and implements the communication protocols of two wireless transmitters. Two solutions were implemented for processing the data: one based on a smartphone (due to availability and low cost) and another based on a personal computer (for a higher computation capability). The algorithms were implemented in Java, for the smartphone, and in Python, for the computer. Both implementations have a graphical user interface to simplify the device operation. The algorithms were tested using a database consisting of 70 patients with the SpO2 signal collected in a Hospital. The algorithm performance achieved an average accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 87.5, 79.5 and 90.8% respectively.	accessibility;algorithm;computation;data validation;discriminant;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;finite-state machine;graphical user interface;heart rate variability;java;neural oscillation;personal computer;programmable sound generator;python;robustness (computer science);sensitivity and specificity;sleep mode;smartphone;transcription (software);transmitter;vhdl	Fabio Mendonça;Sheikh Shanawaz Mostafa;Fernando Morgado Dias;Juan L.

0cd5799b9b6f571792f093d9c1411a7ef593745c	a spinal motion measurement protocol utilizing inertial sensors without magnetometers		This study presents an approach for instrumenting a spinal motion measurement protocol using two inertial measurement units (IMU)s affixed at the posterior pelvis and superior trunk. The accuracy of the inertial motion measurement instrumentation in tracking the relative orientation of the trunk with respect to the pelvis in three spinal motions (flexionextension, side bending, and rotation) is compared to that of a concurrent optical motion capture (mocap) system. Six healthy adults $(31.5 \pm 11.2$; 2 females) were recruited to perform the spinal motions. The results show minimal deviations of the IMU measurements from those of the mocap system (RMSE $\lt 2 \deg $, $\mathrm {r}\gt 0.84$ in all cases) and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed instrumentation approach for spinal motion measurement.	instrument - device;instrumentation (computer programming);motion capture;system of measurement;magnetometers;sensor (device)	Ali-Akbar Samadani;Alex Lee;Dana Kulic	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512565	magnetometer;computer vision;inertial measurement unit;inertial frame of reference;artificial intelligence;computer science;instrumentation	Robotics	12.347776874662365	-84.58559671911681	186001

This led us to study the effects of the assistance provided by a pair of quasi-passive knee exoskeletons, which implement springs in parallel with the knee joints in the weight acceptance phase. Using the exoskeletons in a series of experiments on seven participants, we found that the exoskeleton mildly but non-significantly reduces the metabolic power of walking. We also found that the metabolic power of walking is significantly correlated with both the positive rate of moment generation and positive mechanical power of the lower extremity joints. This suggests that augmenting exoskeletons can aim to reduce both the muscle force and work generation to reduce the metabolic cost of walking.	articular system;experiment;knee joint;lopes (exoskeleton);limb structure;lower extremity;metabolic process, cellular;muscle;natural springs;powered exoskeleton	Kamran Shamaei;Albert A.

d14ec4e5cd6f1ee42c61ade77dfbcdc603fe28c4	prediction of the exit site of ventricular tachycardia based on different ecg lead systems		The effectiveness of a computer-based method for localization of arrhythmia exit sites was studied. The proposed algorithm works on any set of 3 or more ECG leads. The QRS complex integral of an ectopic beat is reduced to principal components treated as coordinates of the exit site in ECG space and then projected to real space by a linear transformation. The accuracy of the method was tested on 5 patient-tailored models of human heart and torso. For each model ∼500 simulations were run, each for different stimulus location. All locations were then estimated from simulated surface ECGs and method accuracy was investigated. The algorithm performed better for the left ventricle than for the right ventricle. The group mean absolute and relative (to a neighboring stimulation site) localization errors in millimeters were: 11.5 (SD=2.5), 2.6 (SD=0.5) for the 252-lead ECG; 12.2 (SD=2.7), 2.7 (SD=0.5) for the 12-lead ECG; and 11.7 (SD=2.4), 2.7 (SD=0.5) for the Frank VCG. This study suggest that the proposed method can predict exit sites with a precision in the order of a centimeter. Low values of error for neighbouring activation sites suggest opportunity for algorithm improvement. The use of vectorcardiographic leads is enough to obtain a precision comparable to a 252-lead ECG.	algorithm;simulation	Michal Kania;Yves Coudière;Hubert Cochet;Michel Haïssaguerre;Pierre Jaïs;Mark Potse	2017	2017 Computing in Cardiology (CinC)		ventricular fibrillation;ectopic beat;catheter ablation;ventricle;principal component analysis;qrs complex;ventricular tachycardia;internal medicine;mathematics;cardiology	HCI	16.76261303544224	-84.55729750892547	186280

BACKGROUND There are currently no standardized and widely accepted CBE screening techniques.   METHODS Experienced physicians attending a national conference conducted simulated CBEs presenting different pathologies with distinct tumorous lesions. Single hand exam motion was recorded and analyzed using marker-less video tracking. Four kinematic measures were developed to describe temporal (time pressing and time searching) and spatial (area covered and distance explored) patterns.   RESULTS Mean differences between time pressing, area covered, and distance explored varied across the simulated lesions. Exams were objectively categorized as either sporadic, localized, thorough, or efficient for both temporal and spatial categories based on spatiotemporal characteristics. The majority of trials were temporally or spatially thorough (78% and 91%), exhibiting proportionally greater time pressing and time searching (temporally thorough) and greater area probed with greater distance explored (spatially thorough). More efficient exams exhibited proportionally more time pressing with less time searching (temporally efficient) and greater area probed with less distance explored (spatially efficient). Just two (5.9 %) of the trials exhibited both high temporal and spatial efficiency.   CONCLUSIONS Marker-less video tracking was used to discriminate different examination techniques and measure when an exam changes from general searching to specific probing. The majority of participants exhibited more thorough than efficient patterns.   APPLICATION Marker-less video kinematic tracking may be useful for quantifying clinical skills for training and assessment.	breast fibrocystic disease;categories;categorization;exhibits as topic;hands-on computing;heisenbug;mammary neoplasms;temporal logic;video tracking	David P.

When action potential (AP) propagation either in longitudinal or transverse direction was slow (3-12 cm/s), the depolarization signals contained high-frequency (100-300 Hz) oscillations. The frequencies were related to macroscopic propagation velocity and strand architecture by simple formulas. Next, we extended a mathematical model of the QRS-complex presented in our earlier work to simulate unstable activation wavefront. It combines signals from different strands with small timing fluctuations relative to a large repetitive QRS-like waveform and can account for dynamic changes of real arrhythmogenic micropotentials. Variance spectrum of wavelet coefficients calculated from the composite QRS-complex contained the high frequencies of the individual abnormal signals. We conclude that slow AP propagation through fibrotic regions after myocardial infarction is a source of high-frequency arrhythmogenic components that increase beat-to-beat variability of the QRS, and wavelet variance parameters can be used for ventricular tachycardia risk assessment.	action potential;cicatrix;coefficient;contain (action);control theory;hertz (hz);mathematical model;myocardial infarction;risk assessment;sample variance;scar (physics);simulation;software propagation;spatial variability;strand (programming language);tachycardia;tachycardia, ventricular;transverse wave;unstable medical device problem;velocity (software development);waveform;wavelet	Adam Kapela;Anastasios Bezerianos	2004	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2004.834277	myocardial infarction;wavelet;risk assessment;spectrum;electronic engineering;muscle;index term;engineering;high frequency;mathematical model;mathematics;biological engineering;oscillation;action potential;physics;quantum mechanics;statistics;cardiology;wavelet transform	Visualization	18.69884759434467	-83.02424813822503	186484

The aim of this study was to validate Outwalk on four healthy subjects when it is used in combination with a specific IMMS (Xsens Technologies, NL), against a reference protocol (CAST) and measurement system (optoelectronic system; Vicon, Oxford Metrics Group, UK). For this purpose, we developed an original approach based on three tests, which allowed to separately investigate: (1) the consequences on joint kinematics of the differences between protocols (Outwalk vs. CAST), (2) the accuracy of the hardware (Xsens vs. Vicon), and (3) the summation of protocols’ differences and hardware accuracy (Outwalk + Xsens vs. CAST + Vicon). In order to assess joint-angles similarity, the coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC) was used. For test 3, the CMC showed that Outwalk + Xsens and CAST + Vicon kinematics can be interchanged, offset included, for hip, knee and ankle flexion–extension, and hip ab-adduction (CMC > 0.88). The other joint-angles can be interchanged offset excluded (CMC > 0.85). Tests 1 and 2 also showed that differences in offset between joint-angles were predominantly induced by differences in the protocols; differences in correlation by both hardware and protocols; differences in range of motion by the Xsens accuracy. Results thus support the commencement of a clinical trial of Outwalk on transtibial amputees.	amputees;cast tool;cns disorder;chest;coefficient;exclusion;gait analysis;nl (complexity);name;protocols documentation;system of measurement;video-in video-out;sensor (device)	Alberto Ferrari;Andrea Giovanni Cutti;Pietro Garofalo;Michele Raggi;Monique Heijboer;Angelo Cappello;Angelo Davalli	2009	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-009-0544-y	ambulatory;inertial measurement unit;kinematics;protocol;simulation;gait analysis;medicine;range of motion;engineering;physical therapy;clinical trial;system of measurement;physics;surgery	HCI	12.596820674408248	-84.35424426492818	187011

Images with high emotional content have been shown to alter signals such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the respiration among many other physiological recordings. However, recognizing emotions from multimedia stimuli, such as music video clips, which are growing in numbers in the digital world and are the medium of many recommendation systems, has not been adequately investigated. This study aims to investigate the recognition of emotions elicited by watching music video clips, from features extracted from the ECG, the respiration and several synchronization aspects of the two. On a public dataset, we achieved higher classification rates than the state-of-the-art using either the ECG or the respiration signals alone. A feature related to the synchronization of the two signals achieved even better performance.	recommender system;synchronization (computer science);video clip	Leila Mirmohamadsadeghi;Ashkan Yazdani;Jean-Marc Vesin	2016	2016 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)	10.1109/MMSP.2016.7813349	support vector machine;synchronization;speech recognition;feature extraction;respiration;computer science;machine learning;multimedia;vagal tone;oscillation	Web+IR	10.226194626246672	-93.90938739186495	187062

Diagnostic accuracy or precision is one of the core requirements of CAN detection. As the standard Ewing battery tests suffer from a number of shortcomings, research in automating and improving the early detection of CAN has recently received serious attention in identifying additional clinical variables and designing advanced ensembles of classifiers to improve the accuracy or precision of CAN diagnostics. Although large ensembles are commonly proposed for the automated diagnosis of CAN, large ensembles are characterized by slow processing speed and computational complexity. This paper applies ECG features and proposes a new ensemble-based approach for diagnosis of CAN progression.   METHODS We introduce a Minimal Ensemble Based On Subset Selection (MEBOSS) for the diagnosis of all categories of CAN including early, definite and atypical CAN. MEBOSS is based on a novel multi-tier architecture applying classifier subset selection as well as the training subset selection during several steps of its operation. Our experiments determined the diagnostic accuracy or precision obtained in 5 × 2 cross-validation for various options employed in MEBOSS and other classification systems.   RESULTS The experiments demonstrate the operation of the MEBOSS procedure invoking the most effective classifiers available in the open source software environment SageMath. The results of our experiments show that for the large DiabHealth database of CAN related parameters MEBOSS outperformed other classification systems available in SageMath and achieved 94% to 97% precision in 5 × 2 cross-validation correctly distinguishing any two CAN categories to a maximum of five categorizations including control, early, definite, severe and atypical CAN.   CONCLUSIONS These results show that MEBOSS architecture is effective and can be recommended for practical implementations in systems for the diagnosis of CAN progression.		Jemal H. Abawajy;Andrei V.

Within the system, algorithms use physiological signals from a wearable device (embedded in a shirt) to guide the patient through the exercise. After having been technically validated, the system was deployed for clinical evaluation with 63 patients in Germany (21), Great Britain (25) and Spain (17). The paper describes the first findings of this evaluation study with respect to: technical feasibility, adherence of the patients to the prescribed exercise protocol, and changes in physiological observables as the patients follow their exercise plan. Technically, the system functioned well, and overall the adherence of those patients that actually started using the system was stable, or even improving, in the vast majority of cases. An increase was especially seen in adherence to the protocol set for the warm-up phase of the exercise.

Based on the integral pulse frequency modulation model and the closely related heart timing signal, a new technique is introduced which corrects for the occasional presence of ectopic beats. The correction technique, which involves the occurrence times of a certain number of beats preceding the ectopic beat, is computationally very efficient. From actual heart rate data, the results show that the new technique is associated with a much lower computational complexity (flops reduced by a factor of about 3000) than the original heart timing technique, while producing similar performance. It is also shown that the power spectrum and related clinical indices obtained by the new technique are more accurately estimated than by other methods.	binaural beats;computational complexity theory;flops;handling (psychology);heart rate variability;modulation;premature cardiac complex;spectral density	Kristian Solem;Pablo Laguna;Leif Sörnmo	2006	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2005.859780	electronic engineering;real-time computing;neuroscience;heart rate variability;computer science;cardiology	EDA	19.672233975222017	-87.21361868410634	187775

The designed and implemented system includes three measurement channels. One of the measurement channels is based on the usage of a miniature pressure sensor and appropriate pneumatic circuit connected to the cuff tube of the tested oscillometric device. The second channel based on EMFIT sensor is used for dynamic mechanical stress measurement during cuff deflation. To obtain the continuous blood pressure variation during the oscillometric device testing, the multichannel architecture includes a Finometer device. Appropriate conditioning circuits connected to the sensing parts deliver the voltages associated with sensing wave turbulence and cuff pressure variations during blood pressure measurement procedure, through a high resolution data acquisition board connected to a computer. Software developed in LabVIEW performs the acquisition and primary processing of the acquired signals as well as data storage. The estimation of blood pressure by oscillometric devices was analyzed in this work taking into account the information on blood pressure changes detected by the Finometer device, the EMFIT sensor and cuff pressure sensor response during measurement, and through auscultatory method. Preliminary results suggest that the designed system may be used for more objective testing of oscillometric blood pressure device accuracy in estimating systolic and diastolic blood pressure.	computer data storage;data acquisition;digital back-propagation;labview;sbp;wave turbulence	Octavian Postolache;Pedro Silva Girão;Gabriela Postolache	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA)	10.1109/MeMeA.2013.6549737	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;biological engineering	Embedded	10.984385619066733	-88.31280343959125	187777

The aim of this study is to assess the potential of this parallel and nonlinear EEG analysis technique in distinguishing between subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with a high degree of accuracy in comparison with standard and advanced nonlinear techniques. The principal aim of the study was testing the hypothesis that automatic classification of MCI and AD subjects can be reasonably correct when the spatial content of the EEG voltage is properly extracted by ANNs.   METHODS AND MATERIAL Resting eyes-closed EEG data were recorded in 180 AD patients and in 115 MCI subjects. The spatial content of the EEG voltage was extracted by IFAST step-wise procedure using ANNs. The data input for the classification operated by ANNs were not the EEG data, but the connections weights of a nonlinear auto-associative ANN trained to reproduce the recorded EEG tracks. These weights represented a good model of the peculiar spatial features of the EEG patterns at scalp surface. The classification based on these parameters was binary (MCI versus AD) and was performed by a supervised ANN. Half of the EEG database was used for the ANN training and the remaining half was utilised for the automatic classification phase (testing).   RESULTS The best results distinguishing between AD and MCI reached to 92.33%. The comparative results obtained with the best method so far described in the literature, based on blind source separation and Wavelet pre-processing, were 80.43% (p<0.001).   CONCLUSION The results confirmed the working hypothesis that a correct automatic classification of MCI and AD subjects can be obtained extracting spatial information content of the resting EEG voltage by ANNs and represent the basis for research aimed at integrating spatial and temporal information content of the EEG.	alzheimer's disease;artificial neural network;blind signal separation;cognition disorders;cognitive science;electroencephalography;extraction;eye;mild cognitive disorder;name;nonlinear system;patients;preprocessor;rest;self-information;source separation;track (course);types of artificial neural networks;wavelet;weight;voltage	Paolo Massimo Buscema;Paolo Maria Rossini;Claudio Babiloni;Enzo Grossi	2007	Artificial intelligence in medicine	10.1016/j.artmed.2007.02.006	speech recognition;electroencephalography;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;artificial neural network	ML	17.472407667028868	-91.42460726489205	187866
bb79727bc4ac6de1d4be29f46bb713f6110cf0b0	sleepnet: automated sleep staging system via deep learning		Sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, parasomnias, and hypersomnia, affect 50-70 million adults in the United States (Hillman et al., 2006). Overnight polysomnography (PSG), including brain monitoring using electroencephalography (EEG), is a central component of the diagnostic evaluation for sleep disorders. While PSG is conventionally performed by trained technologists, the recent rise of powerful neural network learning algorithms combined with large physiological datasets offers the possibility of automation, potentially making expert-level sleep analysis more widely available. We propose SLEEPNET (Sleep EEG neural network), a deployed annotation tool for sleep staging. SLEEPNET uses a deep recurrent neural network trained on the largest sleep physiology database assembled to date, consisting of PSGs from over 10,000 patients from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Sleep Laboratory. SLEEPNET achieves human-level annotation performance on an independent test set of 1,000 EEGs, with an average accuracy of 85.76% and algorithm-expert inter-rater agreement (IRA) of κ = 79.46%, comparable to expert-expert IRA.	algorithm;archive;artificial neural network;deep learning;disk staging;electroencephalography;inter-rater reliability;machine learning;monumenta germaniae historica;programmable sound generator;recurrent neural network;smoothing;software deployment;test set;usability	Siddharth Biswal;Joshua A Kulas;Haoqi Sun;Balaji Goparaju;M.

The analysis of diaphragm electromyographic (EMGdi) signal amplitude is an alternative approach for the quantification of the neural respiratory drive (NRD). The EMGdi signal is, however, corrupted by electrocardiographic (ECG) activity, and this presence of cardiac activity can make the EMGdi interpretation more difficult. Traditionally, the EMGdi amplitude has been estimated using the average rectified value (ARV) and the root mean square (RMS). In this study, surface EMGdi signals were analyzed using the fixed sample entropy (fSampEn) algorithm, and compared to the traditional ARV and RMS methods. The fSampEn is calculated using a tolerance value fixed and independent of the standard deviation of the analysis window. Thus, this method quantifies the amplitude of the complex components of stochastic signals (such as EMGdi), and being less affected by changes in amplitude due to less complex components (such as ECG). The proposed method was tested in synthetic and recorded EMGdi signals. fSampEn was less sensitive to the effect of cardiac activity on EMGdi signals with different levels of NRD than ARV and RMS amplitude parameters. The mean and standard deviation of the Pearson's correlation values between inspiratory mouth pressure (an indirect measure of the respiratory muscle activity) and fSampEn, ARV, and RMS parameters, estimated in the recorded EMGdi signal at tidal volume (without inspiratory load), were 0.38 ± 0.12, 0.27 ± 0.11, and 0.11 ± 0.13, respectively. Whereas at 33 cmH2O (maximum inspiratory load) were 0.83 ± 0.02, 0.76 ± 0.07, and 0.61 ± 0.19, respectively. Our findings suggest that the proposed method may improve the evaluation of NRD.	average rectified value;centimeters of water;denture, partial, fixed, resin-bonded;diaphragm (acoustics);electromyography;inspiration function;quantitation;rms;respiratory insufficiency;respiratory muscles;root mean square;sample entropy;standard deviation;synthetic intelligence;vaginal contraceptive diaphragm (device);xm1219 armed robotic vehicle;algorithm;nonfunctional rrna decay	Luis Estrada;Abel Torres;Leonardo Sarlabous;Raimon Jané	2016	IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/JBHI.2015.2398934	approximate entropy;entropy;complexity;speech recognition;noise;electrode;force;quantum mechanics;statistics	HCI	15.432905987928113	-84.7229936714709	188146
2125e39a8b9e710df7f5b3a8ddb7a1aa1c297c65	automated detection of driver fatigue based on adaboost classifier with eeg signals	adaboost;driver fatigue;electroencephalogram (eeg);fuzzy entropy;receiver operating characteristic (roc)	Purpose: Driving fatigue has become one of the important causes of road accidents, there are many researches to analyze driver fatigue. EEG is becoming increasingly useful in the measuring fatigue state. Manual interpretation of EEG signals is impossible, so an effective method for automatic detection of EEG signals is crucial needed. Method: In order to evaluate the complex, unstable, and non-linear characteristics of EEG signals, four feature sets were computed from EEG signals, in which fuzzy entropy (FE), sample entropy (SE), approximate Entropy (AE), spectral entropy (PE), and combined entropies (FE + SE + AE + PE) were included. All these feature sets were used as the input vectors of AdaBoost classifier, a boosting method which is fast and highly accurate. To assess our method, several experiments including parameter setting and classifier comparison were conducted on 28 subjects. For comparison, Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers are used. Results: The proposed method (combination of FE and AdaBoost) yields superior performance than other schemes. Using FE feature extractor, AdaBoost achieves improved area (AUC) under the receiver operating curve of 0.994, error rate (ERR) of 0.024, Precision of 0.969, Recall of 0.984, F1 score of 0.976, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.952, compared to SVM (ERR at 0.035, Precision of 0.957, Recall of 0.974, F1 score of 0.966, and MCC of 0.930 with AUC of 0.990), DT (ERR at 0.142, Precision of 0.857, Recall of 0.859, F1 score of 0.966, and MCC of 0.716 with AUC of 0.916) and NB (ERR at 0.405, Precision of 0.646, Recall of 0.434, F1 score of 0.519, and MCC of 0.203 with AUC of 0.606). It shows that the FE feature set and combined feature set outperform other feature sets. AdaBoost seems to have better robustness against changes of ratio of test samples for all samples and number of subjects, which might therefore aid in the real-time detection of driver fatigue through the classification of EEG signals. Conclusion: By using combination of FE features and AdaBoost classifier to detect EEG-based driver fatigue, this paper ensured confidence in exploring the inherent physiological mechanisms and wearable application.	adaboost;approximate entropy;area under curve;bit error rate;boosting (machine learning);control theory;decision trees;decision tree;effective method;electroencephalography;ensemble learning;entropy (information theory);experiment;extractors;f1 score;fatigue;feature vector;jh (hash function);matthews correlation coefficient;naive bayes classifier;nonlinear system;population parameter;randomness extractor;real-time clock;receiver operating characteristic;sample entropy;sensor;silo (dataset);statistical classification;support vector machine;unstable medical device problem;wearable computer	Jianfeng Hu	2017		10.3389/fncom.2017.00072	naive bayes classifier;machine learning;support vector machine;adaboost;boosting (machine learning);artificial intelligence;receiver operating characteristic;approximate entropy;f1 score;sample entropy;speech recognition;computer science;pattern recognition	ML	14.78315750980439	-89.50960087816279	188175

Careful analyses of the electroencephalograph (EEG) records can provide valuable insight and improved understanding of the mechanisms causing epileptic disorders. The detection of epileptiform discharges in the EEG is an important element in the diagnosis of epilepsy. In this study, EEG signals recorded from 30 subjects were processed using autoregressive (AR) method and EEG power spectra were obtained. The parameters of autoregressive method were estimated by different methods such as Yule-Walker, covariance, modified covariance, Burg, least squares, and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). EEG spectra were then used to analyze and characterize epileptiform discharges in the form of 3-Hz spike and wave complexes in patients with absence seizures. The variations in the shape of the EEG power spectra were examined in order to obtain medical information. These power spectra were then used to compare the applied methods in terms of their frequency resolution and determination of epileptic seizure. The Cramer-Rao bounds (CRB) were derived for the estimated AR parameters of the EEG signals and the performance evaluation of the estimation methods was performed using the CRB values. Finally, the optimal AR spectral estimation method for the EEG signals was selected according to the computed CRB values. According to the computed CRB values, the performance characteristics of the MLE AR method was found extremely valuable in EEG signal analysis.	aoc2 gene;aoc2 protein, human;aides brino;amiga walker;ar (unix);autoregressive model;body fluid discharge;childhood absence epilepsy;electroencephalograph;electroencephalography;extraction;genetic selection;least squares;maximum likelihood estimation;patients;performance evaluation;regular expression;sample variance;seizures;signal processing;spectral density estimation;spectral method;spectrum analyzer;walkers;nervous system disorder	Abdulhamit Subasi	2007	Computers in biology and medicine	10.1016/j.compbiomed.2005.12.001	econometrics;speech recognition;cramér–rao bound;electroencephalography;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;spectral density estimation;maximum likelihood;spectral density;least squares;statistics	ML	18.73946654737602	-87.33211201162487	188285
02ff4b9d001f3bfa3b43b15b76c6d42bf582fc6f	a performance-based approach to designing the stimulus presentation paradigm for the p300-based bci by exploiting coding theory		The P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) speller relies on eliciting and detecting specific brain responses to target stimulus events, termed event-related potentials (ERPs). In a visual speller, ERPs are elicited when the user's desired character, i.e. the “target,” is flashed on a computer screen. The P300 speller is currently limited by its relatively slow typing speed due to the need for repetitive data measurements that are necessary to achieve reasonable signal-to-noise ratios. In addition, refractory effects limit the ability to elicit ERPs with every target stimulus event presentation. In this paper, we present a new method to design the stimulus presentation paradigm for the P300 speller by exploiting an information-theoretic approach to maximize the information content that is presented to the user while also mitigating refractory effects. We present results with real-time BCI use which demonstrate significant performance improvements with our performance-based paradigm compared to the conventional stimulus presentation paradigm.	brain–computer interface;coding theory;computer monitor;information theory;programming paradigm;real-time clock;real-time computing;self-information;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;words per minute	B.

If the apnea episode is not interrupted in time, it can cause several damages to the newborn's central nervous system. In this paper, we introduce a novel technology for detecting apnea of prematurity episodes, based on cardiac pulse frequency (PF) and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) simultaneously, and using vibrotactile stimulation to interrupt such episodes. The thresholds of the newborns' PF and SpO2 had been established to identify the apnea episode automatically through the proposed system: for babies ≤ 35 weeks gestation, PF is ≤ 100 bpm and SpO2 ≤ 80%; for babies > 35 weeks gestation, PF is ≤ 80 bpm and SpO2 ≤ 80%. The system used vibrotactile stimuli at 250 Hz for 4 s. To manage the system that activates the vibratory device automatically and registers those parameters, a program had been developed. It registers apnea occurrence, period of manual stimulation and vibratory stimulation duration. This technique was tested on 4 PNB. It was observed 10 apnea episodes and the device was successful in the detection of all of them. The vibrotactile stimulation was capable of promoting the return of respiratory movements in 9 of the 10 detected events of apnea and seemed to be a promising means of handling them.	eighty;handling (psychology);hearing loss, high-frequency;hertz (hz);infant;infant, newborn;instrumentation (attribute);interrupt;movement;nervous system structure;oxygen saturation test result;premature ventricular contractions;promotion (action);respiratory distress syndrome, adult;sacral nerve stimulation;sensor;apnea of prematurity	Vania Carla Camargo;Sandra Honorato da Silva;Mardson Freitas de Amorim;Percy Nohama	2014	2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944037	medicine;computer science;physical therapy;anesthesia;surgery	Visualization	15.801830118636035	-86.15328569410042	188527
eede5b6e67e71629d56a9a5e7146826d48239c39	fractal analysis of surface electromyography (emg) signal for identify hand movements using critical exponent analysis		Recent advances in non-linear analysis have led to understand the complexity and self-similarity of surface electromyography (sEMG) signal. This research paper examines usage of critical exponent analysis method (CEM), a fractal dimension (FD) estimator, to study properties of the sEMG signal and to use these properties to identify various kinds of hand movements for prosthesis control and human-machine interface. The sEMG signals were recorded from ten healthy subjects with seven hand movements and eight muscle positions. Mean values and coefficient of variations of the FDs for all the experiments show that there are larger variations between hand movement types but there is small variation within hand movement. It also shows that the FD related to the self-affine property for the sEMG signal extracted from different hand activities 1.944~2.667. These results have also been evaluated and displayed as a box plot and analysis-of-variance (p value). It demonstrates that the FD value is suitable for using as an EMG feature extraction to characterize the sEMG signals compared to the commonly and popular sEMG feature, i.e., root mean square (RMS). The results also indicate that the p values of the FDs for six muscle positions was less than 0.0001 while that of the RMS, a candidate feature, ranged between 0.0003-0.1195. The FD that is computed by the CEM can be applied to be used as a feature for different kinds of sEMG application.	electromyography;fractal analysis	Angkoon Phinyomark;Montri Phothisonothai;Pornpana Suklaead;Pornchai Phukpattaranont;Chusak Limsakul	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22191-0_62	estimator;box plot;fractal analysis;feature extraction;mathematics;artificial intelligence;speech recognition;electromyography;pattern recognition;fractal dimension;root mean square;critical exponent	Robotics	15.393900590256456	-91.35832774939438	189001
2021399e091f2f13bf045be2ac68d503775a1e46	identification of qrs complex in non-stationary electrocardiogram of sick infants	premature birth;hilbert transform;non stationary;electrocardiogram	BACKGROUND Due to the high-frequency of routine interventions in an intensive care setting, electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings from sick infants are highly non-stationary, with recurrent changes in the baseline, alterations in the morphology of the waveform, and attenuations of the signal strength. Current methods lack reliability in identifying QRS complexes (a marker of individual cardiac cycles) in the non-stationary ECG. In the current study we address this problem by proposing a novel approach to QRS complex identification.   METHOD Our approach employs lowpass filtering, half-wave rectification, and the use of instantaneous Hilbert phase to identify QRS complexes in the ECG. We demonstrate the application of this method using ECG recordings from eight preterm infants undergoing intensive care, as well as from 18 normal adult volunteers available via a public database. We compared our approach to the commonly used approaches including Pan and Tompkins (PT), gqrs, wavedet, and wqrs for identifying QRS complexes and then compared each with manually identified QRS complexes.   RESULTS For preterm infants, a comparison between the QRS complexes identified by our approach and those identified through manual annotations yielded sensitivity and positive predictive values of 99% and 99.91%, respectively. The comparison metrics for each method are as follows: PT (sensitivity: 84.49%, positive predictive value: 99.88%), gqrs (85.25%, 99.49%), wavedet (95.24%, 99.86%), and wqrs (96.99%, 96.55%). Thus, the sensitivity values of the four methods previously described, are lower than the sensitivity of the method we propose; however, the positive predictive values of these other approaches is comparable to those of our method, with the exception of the wqrs approach, which yielded a slightly lower value. For adult ECG, our approach yielded a sensitivity of 99.78%, whereas PT yielded 99.79%. The positive predictive value was 99.42% for both our approach as well as for PT.   CONCLUSIONS We propose a novel method for identifying QRS complexes that outperforms common currently available tools for non-stationary ECG data in infants. For stationary ECG our proposed approach and the PT approach perform equally well. The ECG acquired in a clinical environment may be prone to issues related to non-stationarity, especially in critically ill patients. The approach proposed in this report offers superior reliability in these scenarios.	baseline (configuration management);critical illness;database;electrocardiography;galaxy morphological classification;low-pass filter;ninety nine;patients;positive predictive value of diagnostic test;preterm infant;pro tools;puromycin aminonucleoside;rectifier;sensitivity and specificity;stationary process;waveform;non-t, non-b childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia	S.

2ceb308419952c5249b9cbc1ad335ac7025f6eeb	effect of physical therapy on muscle synergy structure during standing-up motion of hemiplegic patients		Stroke patients suffer from declined physical ability, and it is important to analyze rehabilitation intervention and clarify its effect on the motion of patients. In this study, the effect of intervention on the standing-up motion of stroke patients is investigated. First, the intervention timing of a physical therapist (PT) is analyzed quantitatively from the muscle activity of upper limbs during therapy. Next, the intervention effect is evaluated based on body kinematics and muscle synergy. In this study, twenty trials are conducted, in which the standing-up motion of hemiplegic patients (n=12) is measured with and without the intervention by a PT. The results show that PTs teach hemiplegic patients the timing of lifting their buttocks during standing-up motion. Furthermore, it has been found that this intervention could improve the standing-up motion, although stroke patients had inadequate muscle synergy structure. In particular, some patients had delayed activation of the synergy and they could only stood up after they moved their center of mass toward their feet. However, the intervention by PTs could induce earlier activation of the synergy. Moreover, the intervention could properly shorten the activation duration of muscle synergy for those who had unusually inappropriate longer activation of synergy.

To assess the distortion of any sound stimuli, a mathematical model of attenuation has to be used. In this paper a mathematical model is proposed on the basis of data from a physical model. The physical model consisted of muscle slices of two different thicknesses placed in a tank filled with water. The amplitudes of sinusoidal waves between 160 and 2000 Hz were measured under the water surface. Using the collected data, a linear mathematical model of sound attenuation on the way to the fetal ear was created. The results indicated a rise in the amount of sound attenuation for increasing frequencies. Analysis of slope coefficients for two muscle thicknesses revealed that there is no significant difference between attenuation by the thinner and the thicker tissue. Finally, the model was verified with data obtained during experiments on animals. The proposed model of the sound transmission allowed assessment of the attenuation by a soft tissue. It reveals changes in the sound reaching fetal ears, which can make acoustic stimulation different than what is heard in postnatal life. The model can be used to simulate the distortion of any sound which is proposed to prenatal stimulation and to assess its quality.		Maria J. Bienkowska;Andrzej W.

The two important components of such BCI system are to determine appropriate features and classification method to achieve better performance. In literature, Empirical Mode Decomposition is suggested for feature extraction from EEG which is suitable for the analysis of non-linear and non-stationary time series. However, the features obtained from EEG may contain irrelevant and redundant features which make them inefficient for machine learning. Relevant features not only decrease the processing time to train a classifier but also provide better generalization. Hence, relevant features which provide maximum classification accuracy are selected using ratio of scatter matrices, Chernoff distance measure and linear regression. The performance of different mental task using different measures used for feature selection is compared and evaluated in terms of classification accuracy. Experimental results show that there is significant improvement in classification accuracy with features selected using all feature selection methods and in particular with ratio of scatter matrices.	electroencephalography;feature selection	Akshansh Gupta;R.

The process is carried out by a laryngoscope inserted into the mouth, used to help doctors in visualizing the glottis and inserting the tube. Currently, very few studies on objective evaluation of the biomechanics of the doctors during the procedure have been done. Additionally, these studies have been concentrated only on the overall performance analysis, without any segmentation, with a consequent loss of important information. In this paper, the authors present a preliminary study on a methodology to objectively evaluate and segment the biomechanical performance of doctors during the ETI, using surface electromyography and inertial measurement units. In particular, the validation has been performed by comparing three kinds of laryngoscopes involving an expert doctor.

Starting from the electrical analogue mode/o f the heart expressing the arterial pressure in terms of the mode/parameters, a technique for determining the stroke volume, mean pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, etc is described. The mode/parameters are determined online during the diastole condition using actual patients' pressure profiles. The mode/dynamics are realized on a Z80 microprocessor and the results of the stroke volume, heart rate, cardiac output, mean pressure etc are printed out on every other beat. The technique suggested is more reliable and accurate than the other conventional methods for long term monitoring of the patient's clinical data and may be more suitable for use in intensive care units. microsystems medicine heart monitoring	microprocessor;printing	Pawan Kapur	1983	Microprocessors and Microsystems - Embedded Hardware Design	10.1016/0141-9331(83)90210-7	beat (music);blood pressure;stroke volume;real-time computing;microprocessor;heart rate;diastole;heart monitoring;computer science;cardiac output	EDA	10.413089298404008	-88.46102368004766	189854

In this study, we have investigated the relationship between cohered HFO intracranial EEG (iEEG) activity with that of slower low-frequency oscillations (LFOs; <;80 Hz). Methods: We applied wavelet phase coherence analysis to the iEEGs of patients with intractable extratemporal lobe epilepsy (ETLE). Results: It was observed that areas on the implanted patient subdural grids, which exhibited strong ictal HFO coherence were similar to tissue regions displaying strong interictal LFO coherence in the 5-12 Hz frequency range, relative to all other electrodes. A positive surgical outcome was correlated with having the clinically marked seizure onset zone(s) in close proximity to HFO/LFO coherence highlighted regions of interest (ROIs). Conclusion: Recent studies have suggested that LFOs (in the 8-12 Hz frequency range) play an important role in controlling cortical excitability, by exerting an inhibitory effect on cortical processing, and that the presence of strong theta activity (4-8 Hz) in awake adults is suggestive of abnormal and/or pathological activity. We speculate that the overlapping spatial regions exhibiting increased coherence in both ictal HFOs and interictal LFOs identified local abnormalities that underlie epileptogenic networks. Significance: Whereas it is worthwhile to note that the small patient group (n = 7) studied here, somewhat limits the clinical significance of our study, the results presented here suggest targeting HFO activity in the 80-300 Hz frequency range and/or interictal LFO activity in the 5-12 Hz frequency range, when defining seizure-related ROIs in the iEEGs of patients with ETLE.	acoustic lobing;aphasia, post-ictal;biological markers;cache coherence;cerebral cortex;coherence (physics);congenital abnormality;eighty;electric stimulation technique;electrocorticogram;electrocorticography;electroencephalography;epilepsy;epilepsy, temporal lobe;exhibits as topic;extrapolation;frequency band;functional electrical stimulation;hertz (hz);hybrid fibre-optic;implants;onset (audio);patients;region of interest;seizures;subdural space;wavelet;electrode;mapped	Marija Cotic;Yotin Chinvarun;Martin del Campo;Peter L.

Although several modified motor signs have been found in children with ASD, no specific markers enabling the early assessment of risk have been found yet. In this work, we discuss the problem posed by objective and quantitative behavioral analysis in non-structured environment. After an initial description of the main constraints imposed by the ecological approach, a technological and methodological solution to these issues is presented.

Cardiac pressure pulses propagate through the vascular system and enter the extracorporeal blood circuit of a dialysis machine, where the pulses are captured by pressure sensors. The cardiac pulses are obscured by the much stronger pressure pulses originating from the peristaltic blood pump. We have previously shown that a cardiac signal can be extracted from the venous pressure signal. However, that method has been found to perform less well at very low cardiac pressure pulse amplitudes. In the present study, we propose a novel method which addresses this issue by using the signals from both the arterial and the venous pressure sensors. The method is compared to the previous method on clinical data using a photoplethysmogram as reference. The results suggests that heart rate can be estimated more accurately from pressure signals with lower cardiac signal amplitude when both arterial and venous pressure are used, compared to when only the venous signal is used.	baxter (robot);iterative method;lenna;sensor	Mattias Holmer;Frida Sandberg;Kristian Solem;Bo Olde;Leif Sörnmo	2015	2015 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)	10.1109/CIC.2015.7408578	intensive care medicine;medicine;continuous noninvasive arterial pressure;diabetes mellitus;cardiology	HCI	14.27088558554089	-86.0776257317891	190032

Yet the development of effective treatments for diseases like chronic heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy depend on the ability to quantify improvements in electrocontractile function. In this paper, we present a sensor that is capable of making simultaneous, electrocontractile measurements. Its small size facilitates placement in multiple myocardial sites for multichannel studies. Semiconductor strain gages are used for force sensing, and Ag/AgCl-plated tungsten electrodes act as electrogram sensors. The sensor contains electronics on-board, including instrumentation amplifiers and a microprocessor for data sampling and analog-to-digital conversion. Each sensor can accurately detect 0-245/spl plusmn/5 mV in two electrogram channels with a sensitivity of 0.96/spl plusmn/0.2 mV/step and less than 2% error, and 0-144/spl plusmn/29 g of contractile force with a sensitivity of 0.56/spl plusmn/0.11 g/step in the analog-to-digital conversion and less than 6% error. The sensor has been tested in vivo in open-chest rabbit and pig mapping studies. These studies indicated that the average peak-to-peak contractile force at the apex is smaller in the rabbit than the pig (13.3 versus 40.3 g), that the average peak-to-peak contractile force in the pig is smaller near the base than near the apex (31.3 versus 40.3 g), and that contractile force is visibly decreased during ventricular fibrillation compared to normal sinus rhythm.	apex1 protein, human;amplifier;analog;analog-to-digital converter;apex (geometry);cardiac hypertrophy;heart ventricle;heart failure;instrument - device;left ventricular structure;map;microprocessor;muscle contraction;myocardium;nasal sinus;on-board data handling;plating;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;semiconductor;silver;small;transmitter;ventricular fibrillation;video-in video-out;electrode;sensor (device);tungsten	Benjamin A.

Cross validation between ECG and BP signals is used to identify the part of signals not contaminated by large, high frequency noises, where we can extract accurately the delay between the QRS peaks and BP peaks (defined in the “Methods” section). The delay is used to identify the QRS peaks even when the signal is very noisy. We also present a simple noise detection algorithm for the ECG signals. This complementary algorithm leads to high success rate in identifying aberrant ECG beats including the supraventricular premature beats (SVPB), premature ventricular contraction (PVC) and other unclassifiable beats.	algorithm	Bo Yang;Soo Kng Teo;Bart Hoeben;Christopher P.

In presented work the improvement of SVM classifier by introduction to a system a preliminary  feature extraction stage is proposed. Based on ECG signals from patients suffering from atrial fibrillation (AF) a new feature  vector based on separate time, frequency and mixed-domain time-frequency (TF) parameters was created. As a efficient tool  for non-stationary signals analysis the discrete wavelet transform was used to obtain the TF signal representation and then  new parameters based on energy and entropy measure were computed. Proposed system (FESVM) was tested on the set of 20 AF and  20 patients from control group (CG) divided into learning and verifying subsets. Obtained results showed, that the ability  of generalization for enriched FESVM based system increased, due to selectively choosing only the most representative features  for analyzed AF detection problem.

Prompt diagnosis and proper treatment are essential to prevent these unnecessary deaths. Reliable diagnosis of childhood pneumonia in remote regions is fraught with difficulties arising from the lack of field-deployable imaging and laboratory facilities as well as the scarcity of trained community healthcare workers. In this paper, we present a pioneering class of enabling technology addressing both of these problems. Our approach is centered on automated analysis of cough and respiratory sounds, collected via microphones that do not require physical contact with subjects. We collected cough sounds from 91 patients suspected of acute respiratory illness such as pneumonia, bronchiolitis and asthma. We extracted mathematical features from cough sounds and used them to train a Logistic Regression classifier. We used the clinical diagnosis provided by the paediatric respiratory clinician as the gold standard to train and validate our classifier against. The methods proposed in this paper could separate pneumonia from other diseases at a sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 75% respectively, based on parameters extracted from cough sounds alone. Our method has the potential to revolutionize the management of childhood pneumonia in remote regions of the world.	bronchiolitis;cessation of life;coughing;diagnosis, clinical;extraction;logistic regression;mathematics;microphone;mycoplasma pneumonia;patients;respiratory sounds;sensitivity and specificity;statistical classification	Udantha R.

In this paper, we propose a new method of identifying emotion from natural walking, and analyze the relevance between the traits of walking and affective states. After obtaining the pure acceleration data of wrist and ankle, we set a moving average filter window with different sizes w, then extract 114 features including time-domain, frequency-domain, power and distribution features from each data slice, and run principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimension. In experiments, we train SVM, Decision Tree, multilayerperception, Random Tree and Random Forest classification models, and compare the classification accuracy on data of wrist and ankle with respect to different w. The performance of emotion identification on acceleration data of ankle is better than wrist. Comparing different classification models’ results, SVM has best accuracy of identifying anger and happy could achieve 90.31% and 89.76% respectively, and identification ratio of anger-happy is 87.10%. The anger-neutral-happy classification reaches 85%-78%-78%. The results show that it is capable of identifying personal emotional states through the gait of walking.	database;datasheet;decision tree;preprocessor;principal component analysis	Liqing Cui;Shun Li;Zhan Zhang;Tingshao Zhu	2015	CoRR		computer vision;simulation;machine learning	AI	12.259328748613324	-90.27326858377835	190752

In this work, we investigated CRPS during wake and sleep stages in Polysomnographic (PSG) recordings of 30 subjects suspected from Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). The population was classified into three severity groups according to the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI): G1 (AHI<;15), G2 (15<;=AHI<;30) and G3 (AHI>30). The synchrogram between single lead ECG and respiratory abdominal band signals from PSG was computed with the Hilbert transform technique. The different phase locking ratios (PLR) m:n were monitored throughout the night. Ratio 4:1 was the most frequent and it became more dominant as OSA severity increased. CRPS was characterized by the percentage of synchronized time (%Sync) and the average duration of synchronized epochs (AvDurSync) using three different thresholds. Globally, we observed that %Sync significantly decreased and AvDurSync slightly increased with OSA severity. A high synchronization threshold enhanced these population differences. %Sync was significantly higher in NREM than in REM sleep in G2 and G3 groups. Population differences observed during sleep did not translate to the initial wake state. Reduced CRPS could be an early marker of OSA severity during sleep, but further studies are needed to determine whether CRPS is also present during wakefulness.	apnea hypopnea index;classification;complex regional pain syndromes;electroencephalography phase synchronization;epoch (reference date);hilbert transform;lock (computer science);phrase structure grammar;population;programmable sound generator;public lending right;respiratory sinus arrhythmia;respiratory system;sleep apnea, obstructive;sleep mode;synchronization (computer science);two-phase locking;wakefulness	Jordi Solà-Soler;Beatriz F.

This paper applied the nonparametric Parzen-window estimation method to establish the probability density function (PDF) models for the stride interval time series of 50 children (25 boys and 25 girls). Four statistical parameters, in terms of averaged stride interval (ASI), variation of stride interval (VSI), PDF skewness (SK), and PDF kurtosis (KU), were computed with the Parzen-window PDFs to study the maturation of stride interval in children. By analyzing the results of the children in three age groups (aged 3–5 years, 6–8 years, and 10–14 years), we summarize the key findings of the present study as follows. (1) The gait cycle duration, in terms of ASI, increases until 14 years of age. On the other hand, the gait variability, in terms of VSI, decreases rapidly until 8 years of age, and then continues to decrease at a slower rate. (2) The SK values of both the histograms and Parzen-window PDFs for all of the three age groups are positive, which indicates an imbalance in the stride interval distribution within an age group. However, such an imbalance would be meliorated when the children grow up. (3) The KU values of both the histograms and Parzen-window PDFs decrease with the body growth in children, which suggests that the musculoskeletal growth enables the children to modulate a gait cadence with ease. (4) The SK and KU results also demonstrate the superiority of the Parzen-window PDF estimation method to the Gaussian distribution modeling, for the study of gait maturation in children.

Sleep-related breathing disorders also influence the autonomic nervous system and can cause heart rate changes known as cyclical variation. We investigated the effect of sleep stages and sleep apnea on autonomic activity by analyzing heart rate variability (HRV). Since spectral analysis is suited for the identification of cyclical variations and detrended fluctuation analysis can analyze the scaling behavior and detect long-range correlations, we compared the results of both complementary techniques in 14 healthy subjects, 33 patients with moderate, and 31 patients with severe sleep apnea. The spectral parameters VLF, LF, HF, and LF/HF confirmed increasing parasympathetic activity from wakefulness and REM over light sleep to deep sleep, which is reduced in patients with sleep apnea. Discriminance analysis was used on a person and sleep stage basis to determine the best method for the separation of sleep stages and sleep apnea severity. Using spectral parameters 69.7% of the apnea severity assignments and 54.6% of the sleep stage assignments were correct, while using scaling analysis these numbers increased to 74.4% and 85.0%, respectively. We conclude that changes in HRV are better quantified by scaling analysis than by spectral analysis.	autonomic computing;autonomic nervous system;bonjour sleep proxy;cfh gene;cns disorder;detrended fluctuation analysis;heart rate variability;image scaling;modulation;patients;quantum fluctuation;sleep stages;sleep mode;test scaling;wakefulness;nervous system disorder	Thomas Penzel;Jan W.

af8336ea1e5fa1996e709d9d9937dc0a6522f19e	an r-peak detection method based on peaks of shannon energy envelope	mit bih;chinese cardiovascular disease database ccdd;peaks of shannon energy envelope psee;qrs detection	In a real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring system, to detect the R-peak in each beat with low delay, high accuracy and high speed is an important and fundamental task. Aiming at satisfying these requirements, a novel R-peak detection algorithm based on Shannon energy envelope (PSEE) is introduced. It extracts Shannon energy envelope (SEE) from ECG firstly, then finds out the R-peaks after SEE by three new introduced sub-processes: peak detection, false-R detection and false-noise detection. Owing to these sub-processes, the whole schema can deal with long pause or asystole case, and avoid segmenting ECG. Moreover, by splitting the calculation into every sampling time slot, the delay is guaranteed. The new method has been evaluated with all records in MIT-BIH with 99.83% detection rate of R-peaks and about 1.77 mu s computation time for each sample and with 251 records in Chinese Cardiovascular Disease Database with total accuracy 99.78%. Therefore, it not only satisfies real-time requirements but also improves the detection accuracy rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	shannon (unit)	Hong-hai Zhu;Jun Dong	2013	Biomed.

The Kinect can detect the posture and motion of the patients while the fuzzy inference system can interpret the acquired data on the cognitive level. The system is capable to assess the initial posture and motion ranges of 20 joints. Using angles to describe the motion of the joints, exercise patterns can be developed for each patient. Using the exercise descriptors the fuzzy inference system can track the patient and deliver real-time feedback to maximize the efficiency of the rehabilitation.

Due to stress in the chest cavity due to the enlarged liver, the cry signals are unique and can be distinguished from healthy infant cries. We investigate the usage of the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier to diagnose infant hypothyroidism. The Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) feature extraction method was used to extract important information from the cry signal itself. This study investigates the number of filter banks and coefficients in MFCC to extract optimal information from infant cry signals, to be classified using MLP. The cry signals were first divided into equal-length segments, and MFCC was used to extract features from them. Tests on the combined University of Milano-Bicocca and Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica datasets yielded MLP classification accuracy of 89.18%, suggesting that the optimal MFCC resolution was obtained using 36 filter banks, and 19 coefficients.	cepstrum;coefficient;feature extraction;filter bank;memory-level parallelism;multilayer perceptron;naive bayes classifier	Azlee Zabidi;Wahidah Mansor;Lee Yoot Khuan;Ahmad Ihsan Mohd Yassin;Rohilah Sahak	2010	The 2010 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2010.5595734	speech recognition;audio signal processing;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;cepstrum;pattern recognition;filter bank;accuracy and precision;multilayer perceptron;artificial neural network	Robotics	16.70544669817446	-90.26834975848604	191393
cfd5b1b7157ba2944dfe30251b4c782ae6f82253	validated assessment of gait sub-phase durations in older adults using an accelerometer-based ambulatory system		Validated extraction of gait sub-phase durations using an ambulatory accelerometer-based system is a current unmet need to quantify subtle changes during the walking of older adults. In this paper, we describe (1) a signal processing algorithm to automatically extract not only durations of stride, stance, swing, and double support phases, but also durations of sub-phases that refine the stance and swing phases from foot-worn accelerometer signals in comfortable walking of older adults, and (2) the validation of this extraction using reference data provided by a gold standard system. The results show that we achieve a high agreement between our method and the reference method in the extraction of (1) the temporal gait events involved in the estimation of the phase/sub-phase durations, namely heel strike (HS), toe strike (TS), toe-off (TO), maximum of heel clearance (MHC), and maximum of toe clearance (MTC), with an accuracy and precision that range from ‒3.6 ms to 4.0 ms, and 6.5 ms to 12.0 ms, respectively, and (2) the gait phase/sub-phase durations, namely stride, stance, swing, double support phases, and HS to TS, TO to MHC, MHC to MTC, and MTC to HS sub-phases, with an accuracy and precision that range from ‒4 ms to 5 ms, and 9 ms to 15 ms, respectively, in comfortable walking of a thirty-eight older adults ( (mean ± standard deviation) 71.0 ± 4.1 years old). This demonstrates that the developed accelerometer-based algorithm can extract validated temporal gait events and phase/sub-phase durations, in comfortable walking of older adults, with a promising degree of accuracy/precision compared to reference data, warranting further studies.	algorithm;desert strike: return to the gulf;model of hierarchical complexity;signal processing	Mohamed Boutaayamou;Sophie Gillain;Cédric Schwartz;Vincent Denoël;Jean Petermans;Jean-Louis Croisier;Bénédicte Forthomme;Jacques G.

In the human nervous system, two types of vibrotactile information, flutter and vibration, are delivered from mechanoreceptors to the somatosensory cortex through segregated neural afferents. To investigate how the somatosensory cortex differentiates flutter and vibration, we analyzed the cortical responses to vibrotactile stimuli with a wide range of frequencies. Specifically, we examined whether cortical activity changed most around 50 Hz, which is known as a boundary between flutter and vibration. We explored various measures to evaluate separability of cortical activity across frequency and found that the hypothesis margin method resulted in the greatest separability between flutter and vibration. This result suggests that flutter and vibration information may be processed by different neural processes in the somatosensory cortex.	audio system measurements;cardiac flutter;computation (action);haptic device component;haptic technology;hertz (hz);linear separability;mechanoreceptors;mobile computing;nervous system structure;somatosensory cortex;wow and flutter measurement	Sang Woo Han;Yoon Gi Chung;Hyung-Sik Kim;Soon-Cheol Chung;Jang-Yeon Park;Sung-Phil Kim	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610522	neuroscience;acoustics;computer science;communication;mobile computing;neurophysiology	ML	16.765242750222388	-81.17002653124479	191766

While changes in the properties of SEMG signals with respect to muscle fatigue have been reported in the literature, the large variation in these signals across different individuals makes the task of modeling and classification of SEMG signals challenging. Indeed, the variation in SEMG parameters from subject to subject creates differences in the data distribution. In this article, we propose two transfer learning frameworks based on the multisource domain adaptation methodology for detecting different stages of fatigue using SEMG signals, that addresses the distribution differences. In the proposed frameworks, the SEMG data of a subject represent a domain; data from multiple subjects in the training set form the multiple source domains and the test subject data form the target domain. SEMG signals are predominantly different in conditional probability distribution across subjects. The key feature of the first framework is a novel weighting scheme that addresses the conditional probability distribution differences across multiple domains (subjects) and the key feature of the second framework is a two-stage domain adaptation methodology which combines weighted data from multiple sources based on marginal probability differences (first stage) as well as conditional probability differences (second stage), with the target domain data. The weights for minimizing the marginal probability differences are estimated independently, while the weights for minimizing conditional probability differences are computed simultaneously by exploiting the potential interaction among multiple sources. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the generalization performance of the proposed multisource domain adaptation formulation using the weighted Rademacher complexity measure. We have validated the proposed frameworks on Surface ElectroMyoGram signals collected from 8 people during a fatigue-causing repetitive gripping activity. Comprehensive experiments on the SEMG dataset demonstrate that the proposed method improves the classification accuracy by 20% to 30% over the cases without any domain adaptation method and by 13% to 30% over existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.	computational complexity theory;domain adaptation;electromyography;experiment;marginal model;rademacher complexity;sensor;test set	Rita Chattopadhyay;Qian Sun;Wei Fan;Ian Davidson;Sethuraman Panchanathan;Jieping Ye	2012	TKDD	10.1145/2382577.2382582	marginal distribution;artificial intelligence;machine learning;domain adaptation;conditional probability;rademacher complexity;computer science;conditional probability distribution;training set;pattern recognition;weighting	ML	15.359887662893069	-93.77947619496089	191839

cf68c9947df1516443a426231c5c7f09c796dafe	a concept sensor-based system to be integrated in an existing automated platform monitoring bacterial growth		Bacterial infections are still one of the main causes of disease around the world. For this reason, the early diagnosis of an infection becomes fundamental for patient's health. In the market, there are very advanced systems that perform such analyses on biological samples, such as WASPLab, by COPAN Italia S.p.A. This platform monitors the growth of bacterial cultures, in a fully automated way, by taking periodic images of the Petri dishes inoculated with bacteria. In this work, we describe the preliminary study on a concept sensor-based system that, when optimized, could be integrated in the WASPLab, to provide a more rapid and complete diagnosis response. The system measures the electrical impedance related to a Petri dish instrumented with an electrode-based sensor, only at two fixed frequencies. In addition, it presents quantitative information associated to bacterial growth to the user in real time. Such information comes under the form of parameters derived from impedance response. We tested the system through a specific experimental analysis. During repeated tests, we inoculated a Petri dish with an initial concentration equal to 1.5 McFarland of Staphylococcus Aureus ATC 6538. We have been monitoring its growth for 18 hours, while the dish was staying in an incubator at 35°C, by measuring the impedance at 100 Hz and 1000 Hz. After six hours, we observed a variation higher than 10% on the best parameter, which allowed finding a growth detection time of four hours. Achieved results demonstrate the validity of our approach, paving the way to the possibility to integrate our device in the WASPLab, to enhance its flexibility and diagnosis capabilities.	advanced transportation controller;characteristic impedance;image analysis;input impedance;mathematical optimization;petri net;sensor;type system;zanamivir	Michele Bona;Michela Borghetti;Paolo Bellitti;Mauro Serpelloni;Emilio Sardini	2017	2017 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation (ICE/ITMC)	10.1109/ICE.2017.8279923	bacterial growth;control engineering;microbiological culture;petri dish;incubator;focused impedance measurement;computer science	Robotics	10.85146951537586	-88.45006135206978	192104

In most neurophysiology laboratories this classification task is simplified by limiting investigations to single, electrically well-isolated neurons recorded one at a time. However, for those interested in sampling the activities of many single neurons simultaneously, waveform classification becomes a serious concern. In this paper we describe and constrast three approaches to this problem each designed not only to recognize isolated neural events, but also to separately classify temporally overlapping events in real time. First we present two formulations of waveform classification using a neural network template matching approach. These two formulations are then compared to a simple template matching implementation. Analysis with real neural signals reveals that simple template matching is a better solution to this problem than either neural network approach.	action potential;algorithm;cmos;computation;experiment;hopfield network;neural networks;neuron;real-time transcription;requirement;sampling (signal processing);simulation;template matching;temporal logic;very-large-scale integration;waveform graphics	James M.

We developed an estimation model for foot-ankle muscular activity in the design of an ankle-foot orthosis by means of a statistical method. We chose three muscles for measuring muscular activity and built a Bayesian network model [1] to confirm the appropriateness of the estimation model. We experimentally examined the normal gait of a non-disabled subject. We measured the muscular activity of the lower foot muscles using electromyography, the joint angles, and the pressure on each part of the sole. From these data, we obtained the causal relationship at every 10% level for these factors and built models for the stance phase, control term, and propulsive term. Our model has three advantages. First, it can express the influences that change during gait because we use 10% level nodes for each factor. Second, it can express the influences of factors that differ for low and high muscular-activity levels. Third, we created divided models that are able to reflect the actual features of gait. In evaluating the new model, we confirmed it is able to estimate all muscular activity level with an accuracy of over 90%.	bayesian network;causality;choose (action);disabled persons;electromyography;experiment;foot orthoses;muscle function;network model;norm (social);orthotic devices	Jun Inoue;Kazuya Kawamura;Masakatsu G.

Inside it, signal classification has shown to be one of the most important aspects. One of the most used tools for doing this analysis are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which have proven their utility in modeling almost any input/output system. However, their application is not easy, because it involves some design and training stages in which the expert has to do much effort to develop a good network, which is even harder when working with time series, in which recurrent networks are needed. This paper describes a new technique for automatically developing Recurrent ANNs (RANNs) for signal processing, in which the expert does not have to take part on their development. These networks are obtained by means of Evolutionary Computacion (EC) tools, and are applied to the classification of electroencephalogram (EEGs) signals in epileptic patients. The objective is to discriminate those EEG signals in which an epileptic patient is having a seizure.		Daniel Rivero;Julian Dorado;Juan R.

In other words, BCIs create a new communication channel between the brain and an output device by bypassing conventional motor output pathways consisting of nerves and muscles. This is particularly useful for facilitating communication for people suffering from paralysis. Due to the low bit rate, it takes much more time to translate brain activity into commands. Especially it takes much time to input characters by using BCI-based typewriters. In this paper, we propose a brain-operated typewriter which is accelerated by a language prediction model. The proposed system uses three kinds of strategies to improve the entry speed: word completion, next-syllable prediction, and next word prediction. We found that the entry speed of BCI-based typewriter improved about twice as much through our demonstration which utilized the language prediction model.

Large pial veins are located above the surface of the cerebral cortex. Following activation, these veins exhibit oxygenation changes but their volume likely stays constant. The back-reflection geometry of the NIRS measurement renders the signal very sensitive to these superficial pial veins. As such, the measured NIRS signal contains contributions from both the cortical region as well as the pial vasculature. In this work, the cortical contribution to the NIRS signal was investigated using (1) Monte Carlo simulations over a realistic geometry constructed from anatomical and vascular MRI and (2) multimodal NIRS-BOLD recordings during motor stimulation. A good agreement was found between the simulations and the modeling analysis of in vivo measurements. Our results suggest that the cortical contribution to the deoxyhemoglobin signal change (ΔHbR) is equal to 16-22% of the cortical contribution to the total hemoglobin signal change (ΔHbT). Similarly, the cortical contribution of the oxyhemoglobin signal change (ΔHbO) is equal to 73-79% of the cortical contribution to the ΔHbT signal. These results suggest that ΔHbT is far less sensitive to pial vein contamination and therefore, it is likely that the ΔHbT signal provides better spatial specificity and should be used instead of ΔHbO or ΔHbR to map cerebral activity with NIRS. While different stimuli will result in different pial vein contributions, our finger tapping results do reveal the importance of considering the pial contribution.	% total hemoglobin;blood supply aspects;cell respiration;cerebral cortex;comstock–needham system;contain (action);deoxyhemoglobin;hemodynamics;leucaena pulverulenta;monte carlo method;multimodal interaction;quantitation;rendering (computer graphics);sensitivity and specificity;seventy nine;simulation;small;spectroscopy, near-infrared;spin contamination;the superficial;veins;video-in video-out;fmri	Louis Gagnon;Meryem A.

84d0776477b26600f80b99e291bef921ad246a39	improving diffusion-weighted imaging of post-mortem human brains: ssfp at 7 t	health research;uk clinical guidelines;biological patents;europe pubmed central;citation search;uk phd theses thesis;life sciences;uk research reports;medical journals;europe pmc;biomedical research;bioinformatics	Post-mortem diffusion imaging of whole, human brains has potential to provide data for validation or high-resolution anatomical investigations. Previous work has demonstrated improvements in data acquired with diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession (DW-SSFP) compared with conventional diffusion-weighted spin echo at 3T. This is due to the ability of DW-SSFP to overcome signal-to-noise and diffusion contrast losses brought about by tissue fixation related decreases in T2 and ADC. In this work, data of four post-mortem human brains were acquired at 3T and 7 T, using DW-SSFP with similar effective b-values (b(eff)~5150 s/mm(2)) for inter-field strength comparisons; in addition, DW-SSFP data were acquired at 7 T with higher b(eff) (~8550 s/mm(2)) for intra-field strength comparisons. Results demonstrate that both datasets acquired at 7 T had higher SNR and diffusion contrast than data acquired at 3T, and data acquired at higher b(eff) had improved diffusion contrast than at lower b(eff) at 7 T. These results translate to improved estimates of secondary fiber orientations leading to higher fidelity tractography results compared with data acquired at 3T. Specifically, tractography streamlines of cortical projections originating from the corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, and superior longitudinal fasciculus were more successful at crossing the centrum semiovale and projected closer to the cortex. Results suggest that DW-SSFP at 7 T is a preferential method for acquiring diffusion-weighted data of post-mortem human brain, specifically where the primary region of interest involves crossing white matter tracts.	abbreviations;agenesis of corpus callosum;body of uterus;brain;cessation of life;clomiphene;coefficient;corticospinal tracts;data quality;diffusion anisotropy;diffusion tensor imaging;digimon world;dreamwidth;estimated;fascicle - nerve fibers;fractional anisotropy;gradient;hla-d antigens;image resolution;magnetic resonance imaging;maximum intensity projection;optical fiber;preclinical imaging;projections and predictions;region of interest;relevance;scanner device component;signal-to-noise ratio;spin echo;steady state;tissue fixation;tissue fiber;tract (literature);video-in video-out;voxel;white matter;benefit	Sean Foxley;Saâd Jbabdi;Stuart Clare;Wilfred Lam;Olaf Ansorge;Gwenaëlle Douaud;Karla L.

d1a22e0d80ab3fbe81bffa4ed9a44bd86366d280	sequential motion rates in the dysarthria of multiple sclerosis: a temporal analysis		Dysarthria is present in 23 51% of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and the perceived characteristics of dysarthria have been shown to predict quality of life in these individuals. Tests of maximum performance such as oral diadochokinesis and Sequential Motion Rates (SMRs) are used in many neurology clinics and are considered to be sensitive indices of dysarthria. This large scale study investigated the SMRs in two groups of participants, i.e. MS dysarthrics and pair matched controls. The main conclusion of this study is that speech rate was significantly lower in the MS dysarthrics. This was primarily caused by longer stop gap durations and to a lesser extent the duration of the word-final vowels. The significance of measuring SMR rate to the description of dysarthria in the MS participants in this study holds promise for being a marker of disease progression and may have implications for speech therapy in these patients.	color gradient;mike lesser;shingled magnetic recording	Kostas Konstantopoulos;Marina Charalambous;Jo Verhoeven	2011				HCI	16.238845462302088	-83.10619529877748	192747

It is known that such changes are difficult to assess from EMG signals during dynamic contractions, especially, using linear signal processing tools. The aim of this work was to use nonlinear prediction in order to analyze muscle couplings and interactions in this context and to assess the load-sharing of different muscles during fatigue. Results show promising for detecting interaction strategies between muscles and even for the interaction between muscles and the output torque during endurance tests.	electromyography;exercise;fatigue;interaction;muscle;nonlinear system;sensor;signal processing	Monica Rojas-Martínez;Joan Francesc Alonso;Joaquim Chaler;Miquel Angel Mañanas	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610672	simulation;physical medicine and rehabilitation;engineering;biomechanics;physical therapy;torque;physiology;physics	Visualization	13.801272882979205	-84.18063497319761	192762
1d2b330118f8916303f7e6ef23583f48daab04d2	effects of c825t polymorphism of the gnb3 gene on availability of dopamine transporter in healthy volunteers — a spect study	dopamine transporter;healthy volunteer;trodat 1;spect;genetic variation;g protein coupled receptor;β3 subunit of g protein;healthy subjects;functional status;metabolic regulation;polymorphism;g protein;single photon emission computed tomography;analysis of variance;second messengers;individual difference;dopamine;single nucleotide polymorphism	Striatal dopaminergic activity is significantly correlated with various cognitive activities, mood regulation, and even metabolic homeostasis, and is modulated by the dopamine transporter (DAT). The availability of DAT could be regulated by presynaptic autoreceptors, which are G-protein coupled receptors; however, whether functional variations in the common downstream signaling molecule, G-protein, could cause individual differences in presynaptic transporter availability remains unclear. To investigate this relationship, the DAT availability in seventy-eight healthy subjects was approximated using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [(99m)Tc] TRODAT-1, a radio-labeled form of tropan derivative for the selective labeling of DAT. The C825T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs5443) of the beta subunit of the G-protein second messenger (GNβ3) gene was genotyped, and analysis of variance showed a significant difference in striatal DAT when referenced to the entire occipital lobe among the three genotypes. Post hoc independent t tests were also performed, and showed that the striatal DAT availability of the CC genotype was higher than that of the other two genotypes. These results indicated that genetic variation in the common downstream signaling molecule of the dopamine autoreceptor could affect the functional status of the striatal dopamine system. These results together with the known role of the GNβ3 gene might provide further evidence to support the common effect of the striatal dopamine system on mood and metabolic regulation.	acoustic lobing;approximation algorithm;autoreceptors;cc system;ct scan;cell signaling;dopamine hydrochloride;downstream (software development);genotype;hereditary diseases;hoc (programming language);homeostasis;intel dynamic acceleration;metabolic process, cellular;modulation;occipital lobe;photons;sample variance;second messenger systems;single nucleotide polymorphism;single-chain antibodies;tomography, emission-computed;tomography, emission-computed, single-photon;tracer;x-ray computed tomography;t test	Po See Chen;Tzung Lieh Yeh;I.

This paper proposes a novel framework that can optimally select dyadic filter bank common spatial pattern (CSP) features in low-frequency band (0-8 Hz) for multi-class classification of four orthogonal hand movement directions. The proposed framework encompasses EEG signal enhancement, dyadic filter bank CSP feature extraction, fuzzy mutual information (FMI)-based feature selection, and one-versus-rest Fisher's linear discriminant analysis. Experimental results on data collected from seven human subjects show that (1) signal enhancement can boost accuracy by at least 4%; (2) low-frequency band (0-8 Hz) can adequately and effectively discriminate hand movement directions; and (3) dyadic filter bank CSP feature extraction and FMI-based feature selection are indispensable for analyzing hand movement directions, increasing accuracy by 6.06%, from 60.02% to 66.08%.	common spatial pattern;dyadic transformation;electroencephalography;feature extraction;feature selection;filter bank;finnish meteorological institute;frequency band;hertz (hz);linear discriminant analysis;multiclass classification;mutual information;numerous;optimizing compiler;radiology information systems;spatiotemporal pattern	Andrew Keong Ng;Kai Keng Ang;Keng Peng Tee;Cuntai Guan	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610117	speech recognition;electroencephalography;feature extraction;computer science;biomechanics;machine learning;pattern recognition;physiology	ML	15.358696094124385	-92.32030797590294	192802
ce08b85d14b54e6d3a00b1450795881bd950f1b9	effect of eog signal filtering on the removal of ocular artifacts and eeg-based brain-computer interface: a comprehensive study		It is a fact that contamination of EEG by ocular artifacts reduces the classification accuracy of a brain-computer interface (BCI) and diagnosis of brain diseases in clinical research. Therefore, for BCI and clinical applications, it is very important to remove/reduce these artifacts before EEG signal analysis. Although, EOG-based methods are simple and fast for removing artifacts but their performance, meanwhile, is highly affected by the bidirectional contamination process. Some studies emphasized that the solution to this problem is low-pass filtering EOG signals before using them in artifact removal algorithm but there is still no evidence on the optimal low-pass frequency limits of EOG signals. In this study, we investigated the optimal EOG signal filtering limits using state-of-the-art artifact removal techniques with fifteen artificially contaminated EEG and EOG datasets. In this comprehensive analysis, unfiltered and twelve different low-pass filtering of EOG signals were used with five different algorithms, namely, simple regression, least mean squares, recursive least squares, REGICA, and AIR. Results from statistical testing of time and frequency domain metrics suggested that a low-pass frequency between 6 and 8Hz could be used as the most optimal filtering frequency of EOG signals, both to maximally overcome/minimize the effect of bidirectional contamination and to achieve good results from artifact removal algorithms. Furthermore, we also used BCI competition IV datasets to show the efficacy of the proposed framework on real EEG signals. The motor-imagery-based BCI achieved statistically significant high-classification accuracies when artifacts from EEG were removed by using 7Hz low-pass filtering as compared to all other filterings of EOG signals. These results also validated our hypothesis that low-pass filtering should be applied to EOG signals for enhancing the performance of each algorithm before using them for artifact removal process. Moreover, the comparison results indicated that the hybrid algorithms outperformed the performance of single algorithms for both simulated and experimental EEG datasets.	bidirectional reflectance distribution function;bidirectional search;brain–computer interface;electroencephalography;electrooculography;filter (signal processing);hybrid algorithm;least mean squares filter;low-pass filter;recursion;recursive least squares filter;signal processing	Malik Muhammad Naeem Mannan;Muhammad Ahmad Kamran;Shinil Kang;Myung-Yung Jeong	2018	Complexity	10.1155/2018/4853741	statistical hypothesis testing;frequency domain;brain–computer interface;machine learning;recursive least squares filter;filter (signal processing);signal processing;electroencephalography;least mean squares filter;mathematics;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence	ML	21.190075943994724	-90.45855409477261	192919
9e2d805669466b175668678dadc25d75eb899e88	use of a virtual integrated environment in prosthetic limb development and phantom limb pain		Patients face two major difficulties following limb loss: phantom limb pain (PLP) in the residual limb and limited functionality in the prosthetic limb. Many studies have focused on decreasing PLP with mirror therapy, yet few have examined the same visual ameliorating effect with a virtual or prosthetic limb. Our study addresses the following key questions: (1) does PLP decrease through observation of a 3D limb in a virtual integration environment (VIE) and (2) can consistent surface electromyography (sEMG) signals from the VIE drive an advanced modular prosthetic limb (MPL)? Recorded signals from the residual limb were correlated to the desired motion of the phantom limb, and changes in PLP were scored during each VIE session. Preliminary results show an overall reduction in PLP and a trend toward improvement in signal-to-motion accuracy over time. These signals allowed MPL users to perform a wide range of hand motions.	amputees;imaging phantom;motion;multiphoton lithography;muscular dystrophies, limb-girdle;pl/p;pain in limb;phantoms, imaging;score;surface electromyography	Aimee L.

Electrohysterography (EHG) provides a non-invasive and accurate alternative to intrauterine pressure (IUP) measurements, and several techniques provide an estimated IUP (eIUP) based on the EHG alone. Commonly, EHG contraction detection is based on amplitude thresholding of the eIUP. We aim at improving the reliability of contraction detection, such that automatic contraction detection can be realized. An algorithm for template-matching of the eIUP signal is proposed. This method is based on Bayesian evidence using a Gaussian likelihood function to classify uterine activity. Gaussian templates are matched to the input signal, with weights obtained empirically from manually-annotated contraction events in a training data-set. The results show an improvement in contraction detection accuracy compared to threshold-based methods. The template-matching method is adaptable to relevant features in the input training data, and is thus less sensitive to differences in eIUP derivation or measurement variability. The method allows for improved automatic uterine contraction detection in labor EHG data, while being extensible to e.g. preterm contraction detection.	automatic control;clinical use template;iup;intracranial hypertension;intrauterine;matching;normal statistical distribution;spatial variability;thresholding (image processing);uterine contraction;uterus;algorithm	G.

08f39c8e06dbaa3ea22ed5dd8e690a678a834e3d	wavelet based qrs complex detection of ecg signal		The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a sensitive diagnostic tool that is used to detect various cardiovascular diseases by measuring and recording the electrical activity of the heart in exquisite detail. A wide range of heart condition is determined by thorough examination of the features of the ECG report. Automatic extraction of time plane features is important for identification of vital cardiac diseases. This paper presents a multi-resolution wavelet transform based system for detection ‘P’, ‘Q’, ‘R’, ‘S’, ‘T’ peaks complex from original ECG signal. ‘R-R’ time lapse is an important minutia of the ECG signal that corresponds to the heartbeat of the concerned person. Abrupt increase in height of the ‘R’ wave or changes in the measurement of the ‘R-R’ denote various anomalies of human heart. Similarly ‘P-P’, ‘Q-Q’, ‘S-S’, ‘T-T’ also corresponds to different anomalies of heart and their peak amplitude also envisages other cardiac diseases. In this proposed method the ‘P Q R S T’-peaks are marked and stored over the entire signal and the time interval between two consecutive ‘R’-peaks and other peaks interval are measured to detect anomalies in behavior of heart, if any. The peaks are achieved by the composition of Daubeheissub-bands wavelet of original ECG signal. The accuracy of the ‘P Q R S T’ complex detection and interval measurement is achieved up to 100% with high exactitude by processing and thresholding the original ECG signal.	level of measurement;thresholding (image processing);wavelet transform	Sayantan Mukhopadhyay;Shouvik Biswas;Anamitra Bardhan Roy;Nilanjan Dey	2012	CoRR		speech recognition;telecommunications	Robotics	17.890891291031792	-87.18398179102427	193065

Functional connectivity has been studied by analyzing the correlation between coherent neural oscillations in different areas of the brain. In electro- or magneto-encephalography, coherent source reconstruction in a source-space is very tricky due to power leaking from the correlation among the sources. For this reason, most studies have been limited to sensor-space analyses, which give doubtful results because of volume current mixing. The direct visualization of coherent brain oscillations can circumvent this problem. The feasibility of this idea was demonstrated by conducting phantom experiments with a SQUID-based, micro-Tesla NMR/MRI system. We introduce an experimental trick, an effective step-up of the measurement B-field in a pulse sequence, to decouple the magnetic resonance signal from the strong magneto-encephalographic signal at the same frequency.	basal metabolic rate;base one foundation component library (bfc);behavior;british informatics olympiad;categorization;coherence (physics);distortion;experiment;frequency band;gradient;iso 10303;imagery;magnetic resonance imaging;magnetoencephalography;mixing (mathematics);modality (human–computer interaction);myocardium;neural network simulation;neural oscillation;numerous;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;protons;resting state fmri;tesla - unit;biomagnetics;encephalography	Kiwoong Kim;Seong-Joo Lee;Chan-Seok Kang;Seong-Min Hwang;Yong Ho Lee;Kwon-Kyu Yu	2014	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.01.030	artificial intelligence;mathematics	ML	23.0607080645836	-81.25961004016429	193325

Tube malpositioning can compromise respiratory function and can be associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Clinical assessment of ETT position normally involves chest auscultation, which is highly skill-dependent and can be misleading. The objective of this pilot study was to investigate breath sound changes associated with ETT malpositioning. Breath sounds were acquired in six human subjects over each hemithorax and over the epigastrium for tracheal, bronchial and oesophageal intubations. When the ETT was in the oesophagus, the acoustic energy ratio between epigastrium and chest surface increased in all subjects (p<0.04). In addition, ETT placement in the right mainstem bronchus decreased the acoustic energy ratio between the left and right hemithoraxes in all subjects (p<0.04). A baseline measurement of this energy ratio was needed for bronchial intubation identification. However, using this ratio after bandpass filtering (200–500 Hz) did not require a baseline value, which would increase the utility of this method for initial ETT placement. These results suggest that computerised analysis of breath sounds may be useful for assessment of ETT positioning. More studies are needed to test the feasibility of this approach further.	acoustic cryptanalysis;auscultation;baseline dental cement;baseline (configuration management);bronchi;dyspnea;ett protein, arabidopsis;endotracheal tube;epigastrium;esophagus;gastroesophageal reflux disease;general anesthesia;intubation;liver failure, acute;morbidity - disease rate;patients;respiration;respiratory sounds;biomedical tube device	Hussein Mansy;C.

The data is gathered from extra-cellular recordings with multi-electrode arrays (MEAs). The signal is a stream containing an unknown number of neural sources superpositioned with non-stationary noise components. In order to analyze the recorded spike trains, a prior separation into its individual components is required. The increasing number of sensors on a MEA surface demand an automatic spike sorting procedure. In this article the proposed spike sorting method replaces the manual steps with artificial neural networks to enable an unsupervised separation of mixed signal components. Furthermore the artificial neural network based feature extraction allows realtime processing and ensures high flexbibility and adaptivity for unknown signals with non-stationary noise components.	artificial neural network;feature extraction;mixed-signal integrated circuit;population;sensor;sorting;stationary process;unsupervised learning	Gerold Bausch;Helmut Beikirch	2011	Proceedings of the 6th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems	10.1109/IDAACS.2011.6072824	speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;cluster analysis;neurophysiology;artificial neural network	Robotics	20.043975836239373	-93.01357758476158	193626
762c4109b7d680798d305474decc6b2165a28dc6	convolutional neural networks for seizure prediction using intracranial and scalp electroencephalogram	convolutional neural network;intracranial eeg;machine learning;scalp eeg;seizure prediction	Seizure prediction has attracted growing attention as one of the most challenging predictive data analysis efforts to improve the life of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and tonic seizures. Many outstanding studies have reported great results in providing sensible indirect (warning systems) or direct (interactive neural stimulation) control over refractory seizures, some of which achieved high performance. However, to achieve high sensitivity and a low false prediction rate, many of these studies relied on handcraft feature extraction and/or tailored feature extraction, which is performed for each patient independently. This approach, however, is not generalizable, and requires significant modifications for each new patient within a new dataset. In this article, we apply convolutional neural networks to different intracranial and scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets and propose a generalized retrospective and patient-specific seizure prediction method. We use the short-time Fourier transform on 30-s EEG windows to extract information in both the frequency domain and the time domain. The algorithm automatically generates optimized features for each patient to best classify preictal and interictal segments. The method can be applied to any other patient from any dataset without the need for manual feature extraction. The proposed approach achieves sensitivity of 81.4%, 81.2%, and 75% and a false prediction rate of 0.06/h, 0.16/h, and 0.21/h on the Freiburg Hospital intracranial EEG dataset, the Boston Children's Hospital-MIT scalp EEG dataset, and the American Epilepsy Society Seizure Prediction Challenge dataset, respectively. Our prediction method is also statistically better than an unspecific random predictor for most of the patients in all three datasets.	algorithm;artificial neural network;convolutional neural network;electrocorticography;electroencephalography phase synchronization;epilepsy;feature extraction;gene prediction;intracranial hypertension;kerrison predictor;microsoft windows;neural network simulation;patients;seizures;short-time fourier transform;silo (dataset)	Nhan Duy Truong;Anh Duy Nguyen;Levin Kuhlmann;Mohammad Reza Bonyadi;Jiawei Yang;Samuel J.

Magnetization transfer effects can be visualized in magnetization transfer ratio images or quantified via the z-spectrum. This paper presents methods of measuring the z-spectrum and of producing high-resolution MTR images and maps of z-spectrum asymmetry in vivo at 7 T, within SAR limits. It also uses a 3-compartment model to measure chemical exchange and magnetization transfer parameters from the z-spectrum data. The peak in the z-spectrum associated with chemical exchange between amide and water protons (amide proton transfer, APT, effects) is much more apparent at 7 T than at 3 T. Furthermore at 7 T quantitative APT results varied between the corpus callosum and other white matter structures, suggesting that quantitative APT imaging could be used as a method of measuring myelination. The results also suggest that chemical exchange is not responsible for the phase shift observed in susceptibility weighted images between grey matter and white matter.	body of uterus;corpus callosum;gray matter;image resolution;in-phase and quadrature components;mtr;magnetic resonance imaging;map;protons;video-in video-out;white matter;myelination;solute	Olivier E.

7ae6dbcb8449cd9a9335b24ccd9c9bb9c2ddf0f8	multivariate multiscale symbolic entropy analysis of human gait signals		The complexity quantification of human gait time series has received considerable interest for wearable healthcare. Symbolic entropy is one of the most prevalent algorithms used to measure the complexity of a time series, but it fails to account for the multiple time scales and multi-channel statistical dependence inherent in such time series. To overcome this problem, multivariate multiscale symbolic entropy is proposed in this paper to distinguish the complexity of human gait signals in health and disease. The embedding dimension, time delay and quantization levels are appropriately designed to construct similarity of signals for calculating complexity of human gait. The proposed method can accurately detect healthy and pathologic group from realistic multivariate human gait time series on multiple scales. It strongly supports wearable healthcare with simplicity, robustness, and fast computation.	algorithm;blum axioms;broadcast delay;computation;computational complexity theory;dhrystone;norm (social);pink noise;time series;wearable computer;wearable technology;white noise	Jian Yu;Junyi Cao;Wei-Hsin Liao;Yangquan Chen;Jing Lin;Rong Liu	2017	Entropy	10.3390/e19100557	robustness (computer science);statistics;computation;wearable computer;quantization (signal processing);mathematics;multivariate statistics;embedding;gait (human)	ML	19.745143748841887	-86.17567231513374	194256

Nowadays a logarithmic frequency distribution is mostly used in Electrical Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (EBIS) applications. However it is not optimized following any criterion. Our hypothesis is that an EBIS signal contains more information where the variation of the measurement regarding the frequency is larger; and that there ought to be more measuring frequencies where there is more information. Results show that for EBIS data with characteristic frequencies up to 200 kHz the error obtained with both frequency distribution schemes is similar. However, for EBIS data with higher values of characteristic frequency the error produced when estimating the values from EBIS measurements using an adaptive frequency distribution is smaller. Thus it may useful for EBIS applications with high values of characteristic frequency, e.g. cerebral bioimpedance.	cerebral infarction;electrical phenomena;estimated;excitation;kilohertz;large;normal mode;population parameter;small;time complexity	Fernando Seoane;Javier Ferreira;Ruben Buendia;Kaj Lindecrantz	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6345993	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	HPC	19.209542076566482	-86.9791960262695	194343

PPI deficits have been seen in patients with schizophrenia and animal models of this mental disorder. The goal of this study was to provide an alternative method for the analysis of PPI data. The new method is expected to be more reliable and sensitive than the existing conventional method. We applied the Kernel density estimation (KDE) in the analysis of PPI data. KDE is a non-parametric method of estimating the probability density function of a random variable and is widely used in inferring population statistics based on limited, noisy samples of continuous random variables.

The third heart sound normally occurs in children but disappears with maturation. The sound can also appear in patients with heart failure. The sound is characterised by its low-amplitude and low-frequency content, which makes it difficult to identify by the traditional use of the stethoscope. A wavelet-based method has recently been developed for detection of the third heart sound. This study investigated if the third heart sound could be identified in patients with heart failure using this detection method. The method was also compared with auscultation using conventional phonocardiography and with characterisation of the patients with echocardiography. In the first study, 87% of the third heart sounds were detected using the wavelet method, 12% were missed, and 6% were false positive. In study 2, the waveletdetection method identified 87% of the patients using the third heart sound, and regular phonocardiography identified two (25%) of the subjects.	anatomical maturation;auscultation;echocardiography;fingerprint;heart sounds;heart failure;patients;phonocardiography;stethoscopes;verification of theories;wavelet	Peter Hult;Tore Fjällbrant;K.

Analysis of such representations is sometimes difficult, however, and is often reduced to the extraction of ridges, or local energy maxima. In this paper, we describe a new ridge extraction method based on the image processing technique of active contours or snakes. We have tested our method on several synthetic signals and for the analysis of uterine electromyogram or electrohysterogram (EHG) recorded during gestation in monkeys. We have also evaluated a postprocessing algorithm that is especially suited for EHG analysis. Parameters are evaluated on real EHG signals in different gestational periods. The presented method gives good results when applied to synthetic as well as EHG signals. We have been able to obtain smaller ridge extraction errors when compared to two other methods specially developed for EHG. The gradient vector flow (GVF) snake method, or GVF-snake method, appears to be a good ridge extraction tool, which could be used on TFR of mono or multicomponent signals with good results.	biomedical research;characterization test;contraction mapping;electromyography;extraction;gradient;handling (psychology);image processing;maxima;placenta;premature obstetric labor;signal-to-noise ratio;small;snakes;synthetic intelligence;time–frequency representation;uterine contraction;uterine corpus carcinosarcoma;uterine hemorrhage;uterus;algorithm;benefit	Jérémy Terrien;Catherine Marque;Guy Germain	2008	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2008.918556	algorithm design;computer vision;ridge;speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;computer science;artificial intelligence;frequency;signal processing;time–frequency representation;active contour model;software testing;physics;quantum mechanics;gestation	Visualization	18.415016981173757	-88.5452117030454	194710

Most abnormal EEG patterns in epilepsy are interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), which consist of spike and sharp waves. These two types of waves can be detected in detail by using the Walsh transformation. In this technique, training data consisting of the original data from EEGs and the results of the first- and second-order Walsh transformation are collected to construct IED profiles. In this paper we propose two Bayesian classification models based on the dependence of the IED profiles. Bayesian classification is applied to classify spike and sharp waves resulting from the Walsh transformation. In our case study, the classification model with dependent features assumption gave better results than the model with independent features assumption.	electroencephalography	Juni Wijayanti Puspita;Suryani Gunadharma;Sapto W.

In this paper, we examine this issue when performing a joint detection-estimation of brain activity in a given homogeneous region of interest (ROI). Following the work of Bullmore et al. (1996), we adopt a space-varying AR(1) temporal noise model and assess its influence, on both the estimation of the HRF and the detection of brain activity, using synthetic and real fMRI data.

02e746649c6a056054acc254824500bf28bbd6fc	multi-scale transitions of fuzzy sample entropy of rr-intervals and their phase-randomized surrogates: a possibility to diagnose congestive heart failure	heart rate variability;surrogate analysis;multi scale transition;regularity;complexity;fuzzy sample entropy	Heart rate variability (HRV) is the variability of consecutive cardiac inter-beat intervals (RR-intervals or RR-signals). It contains features that are essential indicators for the health of a human being. Recently, researchers have investigated the usefulness of non-linear dynamics to gain insight on temporal relationships within the RR-signals. Sample entropy and fuzzy sample entropy (fSEn) are variables reflecting the non-linear dynamics of HRV. However, previous studies have only rarely considered that the information of a signal might be encoded in its phase. In this article, we define and quantify complexity of a signal by the part of regularity caused by the non-random aspect of the phase of a signal.#R##N##R##N#The purpose of the study is to show that information about the control of HRV is largely encoded in the phase of the Fourier transformed signal and its complexity can be quantified using the multi scale transition (MST) of fSEn of RR-signals and their phase-randomized surrogates. This may allow classifying individual participants with congestive heart failure from healthy controls.#R##N##R##N#The results show distinct differences in the biphasic MST transitions between controls and patients suffering from congestive heart failure. The differences of normalized fSEn of surrogates minus fSEn of the RR-signal show a clear first, fast response lasting about 3–4 s followed by a long lasting trend. The sum of these differences in the fast response trend represent a feature variable that allowed classifying patients and controls with a high sensitivity of 87% and a high specificity of 89%. The relationship to neural control of the HRV can now be investigated with variables that reflect the regularity and complexity of the HRV using the information that is encoded in the phase of the Fourier transformed RR-signal and is not resolved by the classical, power spectra based HRV analysis.	randomized algorithm;rapid refresh;sample entropy;surrogates	Vinzenz von Tscharner;Payam Zandiyeh	2017	Biomed.

8e568e92fb7c41ebc9b45baa1626082fab11675d	characterizing residual muscle properties in lower limb amputees using high density emg decomposition: a pilot study*		As research is progressing towards EMG control of lower limb prostheses, it is vital to understand the neurophysiology of the residual muscles in the amputated limb, which has been largely ignored. Therefore, the goal of this study was to characterize the activation patterns (muscle recruitment and motor unit discharge patterns) of the residual muscles of lower limb amputees. One transtibial amputee subject was recruited for this pilot study. The participant wore three high-density EMG electrode pads (8x8 grid with 64 channels) on each limb (a total of six pads) – one on the tibialis anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (MG), and lateral gastrocnemius (LG), respectively. The participant was asked to follow a ramping procedure plateauing at 50% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) for both the TA and Gastrocnemius muscles. The EMG signals were then decomposed offline; the firing rate and spatial activation patterns of the muscle were analyzed. Results showed slower and more variable firing rate in motor units of residual muscles than those of intact side. In addition, the spatial pattern of muscle activation differed between residual and intact muscles. These results indicate that surface EMG signals recorded from residual muscles present modified signal features from intact shank muscles, which should be considered when implementing myoelectric control schemes.	amputees;discharger;electromyography;gastrocnemius muscle structure;hypothalamic area, lateral;lateral computing;lateral thinking;limb prosthesis;limb structure;lower extremity;lumbar anterior root stimulator;medial graph;mg (editor);model–view–controller;motor unit;muscular dystrophies, limb-girdle;online and offline;prosthesis implantation;science of neurophysiology;spatiotemporal pattern;tibialis anterior muscle structure;bismuth subsalicylate 35 mg/ml oral suspension;interest	Bretta L.

All of these elements create a nontrivial, complex structure, the statistical properties of which were studied here carefully. We observed a different behavior of heart rate variability for each phase. Thus, we should take these specific properties of sleep architecture into consideration while modeling heart rate variability.We analyzed 34 simultaneous heart rate variability and 30 EEG nighttime recordings from healthy adults. EEG provides accurate information about sleep phases. The main idea behind our sleep architecture reconstruction is to consider two properties: probabilities of transitions between all possible pairs of phases and probability distribution of phase durations. We calculated the probabilities of transition between each pair of phases and we aggregated them into two probability matrices (separately for each half of the sleep period because the character of the inter-phase transitions is diferent in early and late sleep). We found also that the probability distribution of L, D and REM sleep duration are described by a gamma distribution and that of the W phase - by a Pareto distribution. To generate the RR intervals for every sleep phase, we use the model described in [1j. We consider three variants: (a) periodic sleep cycles with the sequences of phases: L, D, REM, W in each cycle, (b) a randomized distribution of phases, (c) the architecture based on our model. The results show that variant (c) gives 50% of the time series indistinguishable from real data using all standard linear and nonlinear HRV assessment methods while for variants (a) and (b) we obtain 41% and 3% accordingly.	dynamical system;electroencephalography;emoticon;heart rate variability;nonlinear system;pareto efficiency;randomized algorithm;rapid refresh;round-robin scheduling;simulation;synthetic intelligence;time series	Mateusz Solinski;Jan Gieraltowski;Jan J.

This is mainly due to the fact that the systolic and diastolic pressures cannot be directly measured by noninvasive automatic oscillometric blood-pressure meters (NIBP) but need to be computed based on some kind of algorithm. This is in strong contrast with the classical Korotkoff method, where the diastolic and systolic blood pressures can be directly measured by a sphygmomanometer. Although an NIBP returns results similar to the Korotkoff method for patients with normal blood pressures, a big discrepancy exist between both methods for severe hyper- and hypotension. For these severe cases, a statistical model is needed to compensate or calibrate the oscillometric blood-pressure meters. Although different statistical models have been already studied, no immediate calibration method has been proposed. The reason is that the step from a model, describing the measurements, to a calibration, correcting the blood-pressure meters, is a rather large leap. In this paper, we study a “databased” Fourier series approach to model the oscillometric waveform and use the Windkessel model for the blood flow to correct the oscillometric blood-pressure meters. The method is validated on a measurement campaign consisting of healthy patients and patients suffering from either hyper- or hypotension.	algorithm;discrepancy function;statistical model;waveform	Kurt Barbé;Wendy Van Moer;Danny Schoors	2012	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2011.2161933	engineering;blood pressure;mathematics;statistics	Visualization	13.636533606317128	-86.21921463332014	195693

The multimodal database consists of 1250 life-threatening alarm recordings, each categorized as a bradycardia, tachycardia, asystole, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular flutter/fibrillation arrhythmia. Based on the quality of available signals, heart rate was either estimated from pulsatile waveforms (photoplethysmogram and/or arterial blood pressure) using an adaptive frequency tracking algorithm or computed from ECGs using an adaptive mathematical morphology approach. Furthermore, we introduced a supplementary measure based on the spectral purity of the ECGs to determine if a ventricular tachycardia or flutter/fibrillation arrhythmia has taken place.

Inspired by findings in the fields of neuroscience, computational neuroscience, and psychoacoustics, not only does the model extract spectral and temporal characteristics of a signal, but it also analyzes amplitude modulations on different timescales. It uses a cochlear filter bank to resolve the spectral components of a sound, lateral inhibition to enhance spectral resolution, and a modulation filter bank to extract the global temporal envelope and roughness of the sound from amplitude modulations. The model was evaluated in three applications. First, it was used to simulate subjective data from two roughness experiments. Second, it was used for musical instrument classification using the k-NN algorithm and a Bayesian network. Third, it was applied to find the features that characterize sounds whose timbres were labeled in an audiovisual experiment. The successful application of the proposed model in these diverse tasks revealed its potential in capturing timbral information.	bayesian network;british informatics olympiad;cochlear implant;computational neuroscience;experiment;filter bank;hierarchical database model;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;lateral thinking;modulation;musical instrument classification;psychoacoustics;simulation;spectral centroid	Mohammad Adeli;Jean Rouat;Sean U.

Group-level analysis plays an important role for detecting differences at group or condition level, especially when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. Tensor factorization has provided a framework for group-level analysis of ERPs by exploiting more information of brain responses in more domains simultaneously. A 4-way ERP tensor of time × frequency × channel × subjects/condition is generated and decomposed via PARAFAC. A crucial step after PARAFAC decomposition is to select the component that corresponds to the event of interest and moreover differentiates the two groups\conditions. This is usually done manually, which is tedious when the number of components is high. Here we propose a technique to select the multi-domain feature of an ERP among all extracted features by a template matching approach, that uses the MMN temporal and spectral signatures. Following a statistical test, the selected feature significantly discriminated subjects for the two experimental conditions.	clinical use template;domain analysis;erp;electroencephalography;electronic signature;extraction;feature selection;mismatch repair;mystery meat navigation;negativity (quantum mechanics);numerous;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;statistical test;template matching;type signature	Saeed Pouryazdian;Andrew Chang;Dan J.

Procedures for measuring IOP have been used by eye care professionals for over 100 years, but those without access to such professionals often go undiagnosed. We present a smartphone-based system that can be operated by minimally trained users to measure IOP. The system emulates fixed-force tonometry using a low-cost mechanical attachment to the smartphone. Video is captured through the attachment and then processed in real-time to provide an absolute estimate of the patient's intraocular pressure. Our preliminary assessment with two ex vivo porcine eyes demonstrates that the system follows a baseline physical model with correlations of 0.89 and 0.88.	attachments;baseline (configuration management);emulator;eye;glaucoma;interoperability;patients;physiologic intraocular pressure;real-time clock;smartphone;tire-pressure monitoring system;tonometry;video-in video-out;vital signs	Alexander Mariakakis;Edward Jay Wang;Shwetak N.

67b1a898450e6d2268a2de96d16e944111d6f7f2	methods for reliable estimation of pulse transit time and blood pressure variations using smartphone sensors	pulse transit time;arterial blood pressure;embedded systems;bio medical signal processing;smartphone	Hypertension is known to affect around one third of adults globally and early diagnosis is essential to reduce the effects of this affliction. Today’s Blood Pressure (BP) monitoring cuffs are obtrusive and inconvenient for performing regular measurements, and continuous non-invasive blood pressure devices are too complex and expensive for ambulatory use. Hence, there is a strong need for affordable systems that can measure blood pressure (BP) variations throughout the day as this will allow to monitor, diagnose and follow-up not only patients at risk, but also healthy population in general for early diagnosis. A promising method for arterial BP estimation is to measure the Pulse Transit Time (PTT) and derive pressure values from it. However, current methods for measuring this surrogate marker of BP require complex sensing and analysis circuitry and the related medical devices are expensive and inconvenient for the user. In this paper, we present new methods to estimate PTT reliably and subsequently BP, from the baseline sensors of smartphones. This new approach involves determining PTT by simultaneously measuring the time the blood leaves the heart, by recording the heart sound using the standard microphone of the phone, and the time it reaches the finger, by measuring the pulse wave using the phone’s camera. We present algorithms that can be executed directly on current smartphones to obtain clean and robust heart sound signals and to extract the pulse wave characteristics. We also present methods to ensure a synchronous capture of the waveforms, which is essential to obtain reliable PTT values with inexpensive sensors. Additionally, we combine Autocorrelation and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based methods for reliably estimating the user heart rate (HR) from his/her heart sounds, and describe how to use the calculate HR to compensate for the camera frame rate variations and to improve the robustness of PTT estimation. Our experiments show that the computational overhead of the proposed processing methods is minimum, which allows real-time feedback to the user, and that the PTT values are fully accurate (beat-to-beat), thereby enabling state-of-the-art smartphones to be used as affordable medical devices. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An accelerometer was placed on the sternum of 142 participants (120 healthy and 22 ischemic heart patients) to record Seismocardiogram (SCG). It is claimed that SCG, in combination with electrocardiogram (ECG), provides a mechanism for predicting diastole. It is demonstrated that prediction of the aortic valve closure point in the SCG signal helps start the vibrator in time to cover most of the isovolumic relaxation period. Also, through prediction of the mitral valve closure point, safety of the technique can be assessed by estimation of the amount of unwanted vibrations applied during the isovolumic contraction period.	aortic valve structure;closure;diastole;electrocardiography;linear programming relaxation;mitral valve;sternum;vibration - physical agent;vibrator (electronic);accelerometers	Kouhyar Tavakolian;Farzad Khosrow-Khavar;Behrad Kajbafzadeh;Marcin Marzencki;Shadi Rohani;Bozena Kaminska;Carlo Menon	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346794	structural engineering;electronic engineering;seismometer;engineering;vibration;mathematics;forensic engineering;estimation theory;accelerometer;physics;statistics	Visualization	14.219651945913855	-85.41858815920385	196374
d0f29ceaeb424d169d924f2ecaa2546b0ee7adaf	parallel support vector architectures for taxonomy of radial pulse morphology		Application of impedance plethysmography (IP) for impedance measurement is the paradigm in assessment of central and peripheral blood flow. We propose the expediency of IP to unearth hidden patterns from Plethysmographic observations on a radial pulse. The variability analysis in one thousand control and disease subjects evolves an archetype of eight different morphological patterns. The peripheral pulse waveforms not only characterize the physiology of control subjects, but also define the morphology of patients suffering from Myocardial Infarction, cirrhosis of liver, and disorder of lungs. Diverse parallel support vector machine (pSVM) topologies are designed as an aid to the physician for multiclass pattern recognition problem. Besides a lowest confusion coefficient (0.133), the PCA-based pSVM classifier offers a comparatively higher generalized correlation coefficient and κ value of 0.6586 and 0.8407, respectively. However, the ROC characteristics and the benchmark parameters suggest that wavelet-based pSVM is the optimum classifier with a sensitivity of 85.33 %, an elevated MCC (0.69), and a least upper bound on the expected error. pSVM stands out as a model classifier as compared with identified indices such as, Fishers Ratio, Morphology Index, and Heart rate variability.	mathematical morphology;radial (radio)	Sunil Karamchandani;Uday B.

c6569eac097261e25f16990b53601b5bfde9b51a	limbs synchronisation as a measure of movement quality in karate		We present a method to compute a measure of karate movement quality from MoCap data. We start from well-known common assumptions: an expert athlete is able to perform movements characterized by stable and clean postures and stances, i.e., he is able to conclude the movements without hesitation, noisy small fluctuations or movement ripples. To explore this hypothesis, we collected a dataset of motion capture data of movements of five athletes while performing two different kata's for a total of 22 trials. The athletes have two distinct levels of skill and age: junior brown belt and senior black belt. For each trial, we compute the acceleration of the limbs (arms and legs) and carry out a multi-scale analysis to identify and extract relevant events. Such events correspond to maxima and minima of acceleration intensity (i.e. peaks of high acceleration or deceleration) that occur near the start and the end points of each basic movement segment in a session of kata. Significant events are then selected and an event-synchronisation approach is used to measure the amount of synchrony between the two arms and between the two legs. Results show that expert performers exhibit higher synchronisation with respect to beginners, resulting in more stable and clean movements perceived by observers.	belt machine;coat of arms;maxima and minima;motion capture	Paolo Alborno;Nikolas De Giorgis;Antonio Camurri;Enrico Puppo	2017		10.1145/3077981.3078027	acceleration;synchronization;maxima and minima;simulation;motion capture;engineering;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence	ML	11.843446971362342	-84.61036903758318	196538

For example, body sensors have been used in 6-min walk (6 MW) tests for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients to identify gait features useful in the study, diagnosis, and tracking of the disease. However, most studies to date have focused on features localized to the lower or upper extremities and do not provide a holistic assessment of mobility. This paper presents a causality analysis method focused on the coordination between extremities to identify subtle whole-body mobility impairment that may aid disease diagnosis. This method was developed for and utilized in an MS pilot study with 41 subjects (28 persons with MS (PwMS) and 13 healthy controls) performing 6 MW tests. Compared with existing methods, the causality analysis provided better discrimination between healthy controls and PwMS and a deeper understanding of MS disease impact on mobility.	causality;correction of hearing impairment;holism;limb structure;microwave;multiple sclerosis;parkinson disease;patients;pulse-width modulation;upper extremity;nervous system disorder;sensor (device)	Jiaqi Gong;Yanjun Qi;Myla D.

b8b8588d33a512c3559f3ce3c5907b38e8645360	foetal heart rate estimation by empirical mode decomposition and music spectrum		Abstract It is still a challenge to estimate the foetal heart rate accurately from a strong nonstationary abdominal ECG signal. Even if signal process eliminates the predominant maternal ECG component, the foetal heartbeats are still very weak due to other existing interferences. This paper introduces empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and multiple signal classification (MUSIC) to tackle this issue. Firstly, preprocessing eliminates the interferences and noise in abdominal ECG signal and then the EMD is utilized to decompose the foetal ECG signal into a set of intrinsic mode functions, which could be used to detect the foetal QRS waves. Finally, the MUSIC is applied on the foetal QRS waves indicator sequence to estimate the foetal heart rate in the frequency domain with a high resolution. The basis functions of EMD are derived from the foetal signal under test, which makes the detection process robust and adaptive. In addition, the foetal heart rate estimation is carried out in the frequency domain regardless of the detection of R-wave peaks. In the simulated experiments with the proposed method, the mean value of the fHR estimation error is 2 BPM with a standard deviation of 1.5 at SNR = − 30  dB, and it decreases to 0 when SNR =  −16  dB. When compared to the fastICA algorithm, the proposed method shows robustness using three different real foetal ECG databases with variable degrees of nonstationarity.	hilbert–huang transform	Wei Zheng;Li Xiaolong;Zhu Jin;Xueyun Wei;Hongxing Liu	2018	Biomed.

Many studies use this approach to detect changes in the physiological conditions in the human body. However, MSE results are easily affected by noise and trends, leading to incorrect estimation of MSE values. In this paper, singular value decomposition (SVD) is adopted to replace MSE to extract the features of physiological signals, and adopt the support vector machine (SVM) to classify the different physiological states. A test data set based on the PhysioNet website was used, and the classification results showed that using SVD to extract features of the physiological signal could attain a classification accuracy rate of 89.157%, which is higher than that using the MSE value (71.084%). The results show the proposed analysis procedure is effective and appropriate for distinguishing different physiological states. This promising result could be used as a reference for doctors in diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF) disease.	congestive heart failure;entity name part qualifier - adopted;feature extraction;paget disease extramammary;singular value decomposition;support vector machine;test data	Cheng-Ding Chang;Chien-Chih Wang;Bernard C.

In this study, we suggest a new approach to estimate SOL based on the correlation between blood pressure (BP) and heart beat interval (HBI). This approach facilitates less intrusive finding of SOL as compared with currently using polysomnographic method. We hypothesized that the arterial baroreflex, one kind of reflex mechanism to regulate BP, takes a role of maintaining sleep's toning-down effect on BP. At the time of transition from full wakefulness to sleep, the toning-down effect starts to drop the BP and the arterial baroreflex is activated to maintain lowered BP by leading to increase in HBI for the elevated BP. Consequently, there is a great contribution of arterial baroreflex to HBI control. With a quantitative evaluation of the contribution, we tried to estimate SOL. For six healthy subjects (27.5 ± 3.15 years), the mean absolute error (MAE) was 0.3 ± 0.42 minutes. We expect our method can be applicable to non-intrusive and automatic SOL estimation system by not using electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors.	approximation error;electroencephalography;horizontal blanking interval;kernel density estimation;onset (audio);sensor	Da Woon Jung;Gih Sung Chung;Su-Hwan Hwang;Kwang Suk Park	2012	Proceedings of 2012 IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/BHI.2012.6211733	medicine;anesthesia;diabetes mellitus;surgery	Robotics	15.261693141144761	-85.5376276993428	197484

Reduction of noise in EEG signals during fMRI recording is crucial for acquiring high-quality EEG-fMRI data. The main source of the noise includes the gradient artifact, the radio frequency (RF) pulse artifact, and the cardiac pulse artifact. Since the RF pulse artifact is relatively small in amplitude, little attention has been paid to this artifact, and its origin is not well understood. However, the amplitude of the RF pulse artifact fluctuates randomly even if a very high EEG sampling rate is used, making it more salient than the gradient artifact after postprocessing for noise removal. In this paper, we investigate the cause of the RF pulse artifact in EEG systems that use carbon wires.	carbon monoxide poisoning;electroencephalograph;electroencephalography;epilepsy;gradient;image rectification;magnetic resonance imaging;radio frequency;randomness;sampling (signal processing);fmri	Michiro Negishi;Boris I.

In this paper, we present an independent component analysis based technique to mitigate these signal artifacts. We propose a new statistical measure to enable an automatic identification and removal of independent components, which correspond to the sources of noise. For the first time, we also present a signal-dependent closed-loop system for the quality assessment of the denoised ECG. In one experiment, noisy data is obtained by the addition of calibrated amounts of noise from the MIT-BIH NST database to the AHA ECG database. Arrhythmia classification based on a state-of-the-art algorithm with the direct use of noisy data thus obtained shows sensitivity and positive predictivity values of 87.7% and 90.0%, respectively, at an input signal SNR of -9 dB. Detection with the use of ECG data denoised by the proposed approach exhibits significant improvement in the performance of the classifier with the corresponding results being 96.5% and 99.1%, respectively. In a related lab trial, we demonstrate a reduction in RMS error of instantaneous heart rate estimates from 47.2% to 7.0% with the use of 56 minutes of denoised ECG from four physically active subjects. To validate our experiments, we develop a closed-loop, ambulatory ECG monitoring platform, which consumes 2.17 mW of power and delivers a data rate of 33 kbps over a dedicated UWB link.	16-bit;algorithm;analog front-end;automatic identification and data capture;bounding interval hierarchy;cluster analysis;computation;data rate units;emoticon;experiment;field-programmable gate array;front and back ends;gnu nano;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;information processing;low-power broadcasting;mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory;mathematical morphology;network security toolkit;noise reduction;signal-to-noise ratio;time series;ultra-wideband	Mohammed Shoaib;Gene Marsh;Harinath Garudadri;Somdeb Majumdar	2012	2012 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)	10.1109/DATE.2012.6176510	independent component analysis;electronic engineering;real-time computing;speech recognition;information processing;feature extraction;computer science;engineering;noise measurement;noise reduction;remote patient monitoring;physical fitness;signal-to-noise ratio	EDA	12.625094536826465	-88.72372364018712	198024

bde89856324d9373971e78d13d4e04b73ffb84e8	use of phase-locking value in sensorimotor rhythm-based brain–computer interface: zero-phase coupling and effects of spatial filters	brain–computer interface (bci);phase-locking value (plv);spatial filters;zero phase	Phase-locking value (PLV) is a potentially useful feature in sensorimotor rhythm-based brain–computer interface (BCI). However, volume conduction may cause spurious zero-phase coupling between two EEG signals and it is not clear whether PLV effects are independent of spectral amplitude. Volume conduction might be reduced by spatial filtering, but it is uncertain what impact this might have on PLV. Therefore, the goal of this study was to explore whether zero-phase PLV is meaningful and how it is affected by spatial filtering. Both amplitude and PLV feature were extracted in the frequency band of 10–15 Hz by classical methods using archival EEG data of 18 subjects trained on a two-target BCI task. The results show that with right ear-referenced data, there is meaningful long-range zero-phase synchronization likely involving the primary motor area and the supplementary motor area that cannot be explained by volume conduction. Another novel finding is that the large Laplacian spatial filter enhances the amplitude feature but eliminates most of the phase information seen in ear-referenced data. A bipolar channel using phase-coupled areas also includes both phase and amplitude information and has a significant practical advantage since fewer channels required.	application program interface;arabic numeral 0;bipolar disorder;brain–computer interface;electroencephalography phase desynchronization;extraction;fluconazole;frequency band;group delay and phase delay;interface device component;key derivation function;lock (computer science);modulation;national institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering (u.s.);national institute of child health and human development (u.s.);national institute of neurological disorders and stroke;right ear structure;synchronization (computer science);two-phase locking;united states national institutes of health;zhi-li zhang;primary motor cortex	Wenjuan Jian;Minyou Chen;Dennis J.

Nine input variables including temporal and spectrum analyses of the EEG, EOG, and EMG signals were extracted and normalization was applied to these variables to reduce the effect of individual variability. A fuzzy inference system contains fourteen fuzzy rules was designed to classify the 30-s sleep epochs as five sleep stages. Finally, a smoothing process was applied to the scoring results for fine-tuning. The average accuracy of the proposed method applied to 16 all-night polysomnography (PSG) recordings compared with the manual scorings can reach 87 %. This method can integrate with various PSG systems for sleep monitoring in clinical or homecare applications.	bonjour sleep proxy;castlevania: symphony of the night;disk staging;electroencephalography;electromyography;electrooculography;fuzzy logic;inference engine;programmable sound generator;smoothing;spatial variability	Sheng-Fu Liang;Ying-Huang Chen;Chih-En Kuo;Jyun-Yu Chen;Sheng-Che Hsu	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)	10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007380	speech recognition;electroencephalography;artificial intelligence	Robotics	15.791627933655539	-88.63533810991258	198332
3f6da51dcc40aefd12e87242221426927482e86c	greedy solutions for the construction of sparse spatial and spatio-spectral filters in brain computer interface applications	brain computer interface;greedy search;common spatial pattern;sparse	In the original formulation of common spatial pattern (CSP), all recording channels are combined when extracting the variance as input features for a brain computer interface (BCI). This results in overfitting and robustness problems of the constructed system. Here, we introduce a sparse CSP method in which only a subset of all available channels is linearly combined when extracting the features, resulting in decomposition approach for identifying multiple sparse eigenvectors to compute the spatial projections. We evaluate the performance of the proposed sparse CSP method in binary classification problems using electrocorticogram (ECoG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets of brain computer interface competition 2005. We show that the results obtained by sparse CSP outperform those obtained by traditional (non-sparse) CSP. When averaged over five subjects in the EEG dataset, the classification error is 12.3% with average sparseness level of 11.6 compared to 18.4% error obtained by the traditional CSP with 118 channels. The classification error is 10% with sparseness level of 7 compared to that of 13% obtained by the traditional CSP using 64 channels in the ECoG dataset. Furthermore, we explored the effectiveness of the proposed sparse methods for extracting sparse common spatio-spectral patterns (CSSP). & 2012 Elsevier B.V.

PDC provides a quantitative spectral measure of the causal relations between signals by its central use of a multivariate autoregressive (mAR) model. Yet, in real applications, the successful estimation of PDC depends on the accuracy of mAR parameter estimation, which is often sensitive to the data size and model order. In addition, it is generally believed that connections between EEG nodes (brain regions) may be sparse. To address these concerns, we propose a sparse mAR-based PDC technique where PDC estimates are computed from sparse mAR coefficient matrices derived from penalized regression. The proposed technique is applied to both simulated data and real EEG recordings, and results show enhanced stability and accuracy of the proposed technique compared to the traditional, non-sparse approach. The sparse mAR-based PDC technique is promising for analyzing brain connectivity in EEG analysis.	autoregressive model;causal filter;coefficient;electroencephalography;estimation theory;peripheral dma controller;programme delivery control;sparse matrix	Joyce Chiang;Z.

The performance of a BCI based on this principle increases with the number of stimuli. However the number of the corresponding flickering frequencies is limited due to several factors. Besides the frequency response of SSVEPs is not uniform for the full range of frequencies and varies among individuals, being difficult to establish accurate decision boundaries. In this paper we propose a new technique to overcome this limitation based on the AM modulation of the flickering stimuli that reuses the same modulating frequencies with different phase.	brain–computer interface;modulation	Miguel Ángel López;Héctor Pomares;Alberto Prieto;Francisco J.

By varying the stiffness of its joints, the resonant frequency of a system can be tuned to perform cyclical tasks most energy-efficiently, making the variable-stiffness joint a candidate element for an advanced prosthetic device specifically designed for the cyclical task of drumming. A prerequisite for a successful variable-stiffness drumming prosthesis is the ability of human drummers to profitably employ different stiffness levels for playing different beats. In this pilot study, 29 able-bodied subjects (20 drumming novices and 9 experts) wear a cuff on the forearm, to which a drumstick is connected using changeable adapters, consisting of several leaf springs with different stiffness and one maximally stiff connection element. The subjects are asked to play simple regular drum beats at different frequencies, one of which is the resonant frequency of the adapter-drumstick system. The subjectu0027s performance of each drumming task is rated in terms of accuracy and precision, and the effort is measured using questionnaires for the perceived stress as well as electromyography (EMG) for the muscular activity. The experiments show that using springs instead of the stiff connection leads to lower muscular activity, indicating that humans are able to use the energy-storing capabilities of the springs, or that muscular activity is reduced due to the lower mass of the springs. However, the perceived stress is increased and the novicesu0027 performance lowered, possibly due to a higher cerebral load for controlling the elastic system. The hypothesis that ``matching the resonant frequency of the spring-drumstick system to the desired frequency leads to better performance and lower effortu0027u0027 is not confirmed. Possible explanations are discussed. In conclusion, a series-elastic element appears to lower the muscular effort of drumming, while a stiff connection appears to minimize the mental load and has a positive effect on the performance of drumming novices.	articular system;common variable immunodeficiency;drum memory;electromyography;experiment;joint stiffness;matching;muscle function;natural springs;prosthesis implantation;rating (action);resonance;temporomandibular joint disorders;explanation	Georg Stillfried;Johannes Stepper;Hannah Neppl;Jörn Vogel;Hannes Höppner	2018		10.3389/fnbot.2018.00009	machine learning;prosthesis;mechanical joint;artificial intelligence;cuff;forearm;computer science;wrist;stiffness;control engineering;electromyography	HCI	14.416522118415493	-81.72587038705505	198741

The model consists of multiple CPGs to approximate the complex rhythmic movement of humans, and has the potential to allow evaluation of abnormal movements in patients with motor function impairments such as Parkinson's disease (PD). To verify the validity of the proposed model, comparison experiments were conducted using model parameters (i.e., synergies, weight coefficients and time-shift parameters) extracted from finger tapping movements performed by individuals in a healthy subject group and a PD patient group. The results showed that the number of synergies, the second moment of synergy shapes and the coefficient of variation of maximum weight coefficients show significant differences for each subject group, and indicated that the model could be used to evaluate irregular rhythmic movements as well as regular ones.	approximation algorithm;autoregressive model;biomimetics;cys2-his2 zinc fingers;central pattern generators;central pattern generator;coefficient;concurrent versions system;dyskinesia, drug-induced;experiment;extraction;large;motion;movement;muscle;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;stationary process;synergy	Keisuke Shima;Yasuhiro Tamura;Toshio Tsuji;Akihiko Kandori;Saburo Sakoda	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091102	biomimetics;central pattern generator;muscle;simulation;motor skill;engineering;artificial intelligence;rhythm;biomechanics;communication;physiology;coefficient of variation;statistics	Vision	18.361768710457913	-85.34363550941991	198912

The virtual reality augmented cycling kit (VRACK) was designed as a compact mechatronics system for lower limb and mobility rehabilitation. The system measures interaction forces and cardiac activity during cycling in a virtual environment. The kinematics measurement was added to the system. Due to the constrained problem definition, the combination of inertial measurement unit (IMU) and Kalman filtering was recruited to compute the optimal pedal angular displacement during dynamic cycling exercise. Using a novel benchmarking method the accuracy of IMU-based kinematics measurement was evaluated. Relatively accurate angular measurements were achieved. The enhanced VRACK system can serve as a rehabilitation device to monitor biomechanical and physiological variables during cycling on a stationary bike.	angularjs;displacement mapping;foot;inverse kinematics;kalman filter;lower extremity;mast/stem cell growth factor receptor kit, human;mechatronics;psychologic displacement;stationary process;virtual reality;nervous system disorder	Amir B.

2f9b2a8b1864ab63b2d80f830b8cc6c85cd1877e	artificial neural network classification of motor-related eeg: an increase in classification accuracy by reducing signal complexity		We apply artificial neural network (ANN) for recognition and classification of electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns associated with motor imagery in untrained subjects. Classification accuracy is optimized by reducing complexity of input experimental data. From multichannel EEG recorded by the set of 31 electrodes arranged according to extended international 10-10 system, we select an appropriate type of ANN which reaches 80± 10% accuracy for single trial classification. Then, we reduce the number of the EEG channels and obtain an appropriate recognition quality (up to 73± 15%) using only 8 electrodes located in frontal lobe. Finally, we analyze the time-frequency structure of EEG signals and find that motor-related features associated with left and right leg motor imagery are more pronounced in the mu (8–13Hz) and delta (1–5Hz) brainwaves than in the high-frequency beta brainwave (15–30Hz). Based on the obtained results, we propose further ANN optimization by preprocessing the EEG signals with a low-pass filter with different cutoffs. We demonstrate that the filtration of high-frequency spectral components significantly enhances the classification performance (up to 90± 5% accuracy using 8 electrodes only). The obtained results are of particular interest for the development of brain-computer interfaces for untrained subjects.		Vladimir A. Maksimenko;Semen A. Kurkin;Elena N. Pitsik;Vyacheslav Yu.
