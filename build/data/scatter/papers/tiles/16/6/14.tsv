Current progress in this area is discussed. The questions addressed include user survivability perspectives on standards, planning, and deployment; the analysis and quantification of network disasters; survivable and fault-tolerant network architectures and associated economic analyses; and techniques to handle network restoration as a result of physical damage or failures in software and control systems. Special interests are devoted to the survivability of broadband networks employing the new transport/switching techniques based on the synchronous optical network (SONET) and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) standards due to their emerging role in future B-ISDN. Network integrity due to failures of common channel signaling (CCS) systems is also very critical. The present special issue includes 22 papers and is organized into the following sections: user perspectives and planning, software quality and reliability, network survivability characterization and standards, network restoration for SONET networks, network restoration for ATM networks, traffic effect and performance enhancement for computer networks, and survivable network design methods. Network restoration methods for SONET, ATM, and computer networks correspond to those for the physical layer (SONET), ATM layer, and the network layer, defined in the CCITT broadband ISDN layer structure. >	telecommunications network	Tsong-Ho Wu;John C.

After defining the AP syntax and semantics, Mohamed G. Gouda uses it to present the basic communication protocols. He then builds on the basic concepts to discuss more advanced topics such as routing, internetworking, security, compression, and client–server applications. Throughout, he uses AP to give clear and unambiguous definitions of network protocols. Gouda begins by considering several traditional methods for specifying network protocols—including the English language, time charts, and the C programming language. According to Gouda, English is inadequate because of its inherent ambiguity, time charts are too unwieldy for complex protocols, and the C language introduces semantics—such as nonzero message propagation delay—that violate the desired semantics for a network protocol language. To overcome these deficiencies, he takes several examples and introduces AP. First, Gouda gives a specification for a vending machine. He then presents a simple message-transfer protocol and defines Manchester encoding. Rapidly, he applies his protocol concepts to the Internet. A pattern Gouda repeats throughout the book is to introduce protocols in simple terms before modifying and extending them. He also usually explains how to implement the protocols on the Internet. The intended audience is undergraduate and first-year graduate students. The material is appropriate for two one-semester courses. There are 25 chapters in the book, and a set of exercises follows each chapter, typically asking students to modify protocols from the text or design new protocols. Overall, Gouda does a good job of presenting network protocols. The AP language is proven to be a useful vehicle for unambiguous network protocol specification. In addition, Gouda includes specifications for a wide variety of useful protocols and describes how to implement them on the Internet. This makes the book essential reading for anyone teaching network protocol design and also for all serious students. Elements of Network Protocol Design Mohamed G.

357869049327c4e14bb490bcd2ae1698cef99653	transition and modernization of the internet registration service		Status of this Memo This memo provides information for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Discussion As a result of the NREN NIS award by National Science Foundation, non-DDN registration services will soon be transferred from the DDN NIC to the new Internet Registration Service, which is a part of an entity referred to as the InterNIC. References in this document to the InterNIC apply to the Registration Services portion only. Internet registration services are gradually transitioning to the InterNIC. We expect that the full transition will be accomplished by April 1, 1993. During this transitional period, EMail, Fax, and U.S. mail received at either site will be processed. DDN users will continue to receive full registration support from the DDN NIC, and the transition should be transparent to them. DDN users should continue to send registration requests to hostmast@nic.ddn.mil (IP, .mil domain, inaddr for 26.x.x.x) or registrar@nic.ddn.mil (user registrations or TAC card requests) using the DISA approved registration forms. From now through March 31, 1993, non-DDN Internet registration requests will be handled as follows: The current DDN NIC registration templates may be filled out and submitted to either hostmaster@internic.net or hostmaster@nic.ddn.mil through March 31. The new InterNIC templates will be accepted effective April 1, 1993, but not until that time.	defense data network;email;fax;internet;national research and education network;network interface controller	Scott Williamson	1993	RFC	10.17487/RFC1400	public relations;knowledge management;business;computer security	Web+IR	-27.00292774020221	88.71327221536538	141132

The implementation of the Digital Data Network and packet switched related services which utilize this network, such as e-mail, videotex, Electronic Funds Transfer Point of Sale, intermational host connection, etc., have been significant mile-stones in telecommunications development in New Zealand. A number of other communication services such as the cellular radio and teletext are then briefly discussed, concluding with a look at Integrated Services Digital Network developments.

478cb003bbca55d00e95f2641909ca6ac85677a9	snmp management for atm		Industry standards for managing ATM are keeping pace with the rapid development of the overall collection of ATM specifications. For SNMP management of ATM, the bulk of this work has been accomplished through an informal collaboration between the ATM Forum and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This report surveys the current state of SNMP specifications for ATM management, describes the role of the ATM Forum and the IETF in getting the industry to this point, and previews the follow-on work that is in progress or proposed. The first Management Information Base (MIB) defined for ATM was for the Interim Local Management Interface (ILMI) defined by the ATM Forum as part of the ATM User-Network Interface (UNI) specification, the most recent version of which is UNI 3.1, August, 1994. Although based on SNMP, ILMI messages do not flow between an ATM device and a Network Management Station--they flow instead on a reserved channel in the ATM cell stream. The purpose of the ILMI is to enable two connected ATM devices to share configuration, state, and other information about the ATM link that connects them. This allows, for example, two adjacent devices to auto-configure into compatible configurations (without management system intervention) when the link between them is activated. Although the UNI specification also suggests that the ILMI MIB could be used for ATM Network Management, in practice it has not been used that way. The next major step was taken in the IETF where the AToMMIB Work Group was chartered to define a MIB for ATM terminal equipment, ATM switches and for ATM networks as a whole. The ILMI MIB was taken as a starting point for the AToMMIB, but the expanded role of this MIB required many extensions leading to a completely new MIB, published as RFC 1695, incorporating many of the original ILMI data elements. The new MIB was defined so that where the ILMI and RFC 1695 overlap, an implementation can maintain one common set of data for both purposes. RFC 1695 was published as an IETF Proposed Standard in August 1994.	atm turbo;auto-configuration;management interface;mebibyte;network interface;network switch;simple network management protocol	George V.

ae916c5da48fee83753991d99fb3e49daefa77a4	redundancy elimination might be overrated: a quantitative study on wireless traffic		With significant increases in mobile device traffic slated for the foreseeable future, numerous technologies must be embraced to satisfy such demand. Notably, one of the more intriguing approaches has been blending on-device caching and device-to-device (D2D) communications. While various past research has pointed to potentially significant gains (30%+) via redundancy elimination (RE), some skepticism has emerged to whether or not such gains are truly harnessable in practice. The premise of this paper is to explore whether or not significant potential for RE exists and whether the rise of encryption might blunt said efforts. Critically, we find that absent significant synchronized interests of mobile users, the actual redundancy falls well short of the values from the literature. In our paper, we investigate the roots for said shortcomings by exploring RE savings with regards to cache characteristics and to what extent client and domain diversity contributes to the savings.	alpha compositing;cpu cache;cache (computing);encryption;mobile device	Xueheng Hu;Aaron Striegel	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2017.8116471	redundancy (engineering);real-time computing;wireless;premise;cache;skepticism;synchronization;encryption;business;mobile device	Visualization	-21.616714432033802	98.20407495879175	151788

241f3d903fd68bdca5c8d22a6c8f46fcbf00fc7a	on improving communication system performance in some virtual private networks		The paper presents the procedure for determining the optimal set of hubs and spokes and thus the collection of tunnels in hub-and-spoke network. The subject of the study was a multi-departmental network, with security of transmission requirement, so DMVPN technology with IPSec-protected tunnels were used. The optimization of the hub/spoke set was intended to improve inter-departmental communication efficiency, which was to be confirmed by the analysis of simulation results. In the simulation studies, the quality of the chosen service (VoIP) was checked for the different structures of tunnel connections. Simulation tests were prepared and implemented in Riverbed Modeler environment.	virtual private network	Tomasz Malinowski;Jan Chudzikiewicz	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-92459-5_6	computer network;communications system;private network;routing protocol;computer science;voice over ip;transmission (mechanics)	HPC	-22.27159923790103	89.258402079124	155827

The protocol provides a reliable request/response service to the Session layer in the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) architecture. When only a single transaction is considered occurrence graph and language analysis reveals 3 inconsistencies between the protocol and service speci cation: (1) the initiator user can receive two TR-Invoke.cnf primitives; (2) turning User Acknowledgement on doesn't always provide the User Acknowledgement service; and (3) a transaction can be aborted without the responder user being noti ed. Based on the modelling and analysis, changes to WTP have been recommended to the WAP Forum.	coloured petri net;eclipse;request–response;scsi initiator and target	Steven Gordon;Jonathan Billington	2000		10.1007/3-540-44988-4_13	real-time computing;telecommunications;formal verification;computer science;operating system;formal specification;programming language;computer security;telecommunications network	Security	-23.225842201822076	91.22194904505518	156964

Work on Xunet 2 began in 1989 and the network, consisting of experimental ATM switches, IP routers, and 45 Mbps transmission lines, has been operational since October 1991. The network serves as a ‘‘laboratory without walls’’ for eight research groups across the United States. While Xunet 2 has only a small number of nodes, it was designed as a prototype of a nationwide ATM network. This paper reviews some of the design decisions and lessons learned in the project and points out the research directions motivated by this work, focusing on the areas of traffic management, ATM switch design, network control, and the implementation of an IP router.	atm turbo;data rate units;network switch;prototype;router (computing);testbed;transmission line	Charles R.

0b765f5684a36156b32f8de5dc1706bb7e3e1b5b	an evaluation of virtual circuits and lettergram services	virtual circuit	Abstract Two service provided by the transport layer in a computer network to the users (the virtual circuit service and lettergram service) are defined. In the virtual circuit service, data packets are transmitted after a virtual circuit has been established at both ends of the transport layer. The virtual circuit is cleared when the communication is completed. In the lettergram service, the unit of data which a transport user is going to transmit is called a “lettergram”. By designating each of the lettergrams for a desired address, the lettergram service permits data transmission to any process in the network without establishing a virtual circuit. The characteristics of these services are analyzed quantitatively so as to define their ranges of application.	virtual circuit	Yutaka Matsushita;Haruaki Yamazaki;Isamu Yoshida	1979	Computer Networks	10.1016/0376-5075(79)90033-3	computer science;virtual circuit;computer network	Theory	-22.20116430949473	89.50004766828008	168773

However, challenges issued by the marketplace require the full integration of voice, data, and video in a real-time environment. This paper proposes a metropolitan area network that covers a campus environment and truly integrates voice, data, and video under a single transmission medium. Furthermore, the transmission is achieved through a single media-access schema. This paper also presents marketing issues, network requirements, and technology constraints. The proposed mediaaccess schema is also being considered by the IEEE 802.6 MAN Committee for Standardization.	access network;real-time transcription;requirement	Daniel T. W.

This system allows an arbitrary split of transaction charges between two communication partners. Using this kind of system, new business models can be implemented on the Internet. The new system provides more flexibility than existing charging schemes. Under these new business models, service providers can pick up a share of the cost for the transaction with any of their customers; offer collect-call type of services; or provide services such as the 900 services on the telephone network. This paper describes in detail the transaction management protocol (TMP), its implementation, and the transaction management service platform (TMS). The TMP specifies the protocol state diagram as well as the process of how the costs for resource usage can be allocated to communicating end-users. The TMS platform defines the architecture and the modules, simplifying the implementation of the TMP on the Internet. The TMS provides a module-based transaction management environment, carrying transaction signals such as message schema, accounting policy information, communication reference information, and end-user agreement information. In addition to this, an application of the TMS within the framework of bandwidth broker interconnection networks and a short evaluation of the proposed transaction management system are given.	interconnection;internet;star trek:;state diagram;transaction processing	Junseok Hwang;Jörn Altmann;Ibrahim T.

Therefore, the integration of a new voice over packet (VoP) interface into the 5ESS switch architecture is both a complement and a natural extension to the VoTDM interfaces already supported by the 5ESS switch. A new 5ESS peripheral unit, the optical interface unit (OIU), is being developed to support a VoP and a VoTDM trunk interface on the 5ESS switch. The OIU will provide a highly reliable, cost-effective, compact, and energy-efficient solution for both VoP and VoTDM trunks on the 5ESS switch. The OIU will protect a service provider's investment in the 5ESS switch while allowing significant savings, both capital and operational, as the service provider migrates from circuit-based to packet-based voice services in their networks. © 2003 Lucent Technologies Inc.	multiplexing;network packet;packet switching;peripheral	Jeffrey G.

82d95b73f871cd11d67159c600338ea5b24d2d48	media server markup language (msml)		The Media Server Markup Language (MSML) is used to control and invoke many different types of services on IP media servers. The MSML control interface was initially driven by RadiSys with subsequent significant contributions from Intel, Dialogic, and others in the industry. Clients can use it to define how multimedia sessions interact on a media server and to apply services to individuals or groups of users. MSML can be used, for example, to control media server conferencing features such as video layout and audio mixing, create sidebar conferences or personal mixes, and set the properties of media streams. As well, clients can use MSML to define media processing dialogs, which may be used as parts of application interactions with users or conferences. Transformation of media streams to and from users or conferences as well as interactive voice response (IVR) dialogs are examples of such interactions, which are specified using MSML. MSML clients may also invoke dialogs with individual users or with groups of conference participants using VoiceXML.

Digital cross-connect systems (DCS's) are an ideal vehicle for providing the hubbing function in a flexible and economic manner. However, planning hubbed networks with DCS's requires considerable analysis on a networkwide basis, a requirement difficult to carry out in a manual environment. This paper describes two strategic network planning tools that can aid network planners in determining the optimal hubbing configuration for their networks. HUBCAP (Hubbing Configuration Analysis Program) is a program that analyzes analog special services networks. SUBCAP (Subrate Configuration Analysis Program) examines networks designed for digital data services. The capabilities and application of each of the tools are discussed. Because the transmission equipment has the capabilities to support both types of services, and since shared applications are becoming increasingly popular, it is important to optimize the total network.

The integrated local area network (ILAN) presented in this paper has been designed to support the research activities intended for MAGNET. An active slotted ring topology was chosen to implement adaptive sequential-type access mechanisms that are a function of the network loading. The ILAN is based on fiber optic technology with wavelength-division multiplexing of two 100 Mbit/s channels. The media-access protocol provides higher levels with the capability of implementing two modes of operation referred to as circuit-switching, and packet-switching modes, respectively. Provisions have also been made for implementing simultaneous scheduling as well as centralized and decentralized access control schemes. Finally, the reconfigurable structure of the network testbed enables the study of the reliability and availability of ILAN's.	access control;block cipher mode of operation;centralized computing;circuit switching;integrated services;megabit;network packet;optical fiber;packet switching;ring network;scheduling (computing);televideo;testbed;wavelength-division multiplexing	Aushalom Patir;Tatsuro S Takahashi;Yashiharu Tamura;Magda El Zarki;Aurel A.

6aa80dbfc76f7b6ef3d323fd80675c1c6facd316	sip message prioritization and its applications		Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling is an integral part of the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) to support services such as Voice over IP (VoIP), multimedia sessions, presence, and instant messaging (IM). All of these services share a common SIP signaling infrastructure. In spite of careful network engineering, SIP network elements may experience high-load situations, in which SIP messages may experience too much delay or even get dropped. This paper addresses how such undesired high-load situations can be handled effectively by introducing a message prioritization mechanism in SIP servers. To validate the mechanism, it has been implemented in a high-performance JAIN∗-SIP-compliant Java∗ SIP stack. This SIP stack incorporates several other innovations, such as a very efficient SIP message parser, and it can be used for a variety of SIP-based applications. Its design enables service providers to define custom message prioritization and rejection strategies based on SIP message characteristics, system state, and statistics. Measurements show that high-priority emergency messages can indeed be serviced without significant delay or loss in a high-load situation. The concept of and techniques for SIP prioritization are the subjects of a Lucent Technologies patent application.	end-to-end principle;floor and ceiling functions;ip multimedia subsystem;instant messaging;java;rejection sampling;server (computing);signalling system no. 7	Harold J.

In this paper we report on a study of one such approach, PAWS, that seeks to understand the technical and social constraints of providing Internet access, free at the point of use, by sharing existing broadband subscribers' connections. We elaborate the technical and social context of our deployment, a deprived neighbourhood in a medium-sized British city, and discuss the constraints on and resulting architecture of this system, including the authentication and security mechanisms necessary for a service of this kind. We then report on the use of our deployment over a period of seven months from July 2013 to February 2014, including analyses of the performance and usage of the network. Our data show that PAWS is socially and technically feasible and has the potential to provide Internet access economically to many who are currently digitally disenfranchised. However, doing so requires overcoming numerous challenges, both technical and social.	authentication;internet access;software deployment	Arjuna Sathiaseelan;Richard Mortier;Murray Goulden;Christian Greiffenhagen;Milena Radenkovic;Jon A Crowcroft;Derek McAuley	2014		10.1145/2674377.2674383	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;computer security	Metrics	-20.704644707233193	94.33659991441161	185495

12505101c5cbaf89f71364b24f4e68482f4e7895	framework for realizing mobile and computer communications through color signals		This paper proposes a technology for realizing a mobile network based on color signals which does not require the time and the space switching matrix for call routing. In absence of the Mobile Switching Center, the call processing is actuated by a color server which synthesizes color signals and transreceives the data as video broadcast signal. The proposed system is based on adaptive color technology. Unlike the existing methods of switching or time multiplexing, this is dependent on a process that can be best described as a multicast method based on color clamping. Each Mobile Station is identified by, and can clamp on to, a specific hue (tinge) and a band of saturation level (how much white is mixed with the color). The Voice information is transcoded within this band of saturation level which is tied up with the specific hue that has been assigned to the mobile subscriber and is further carried by the chrominance signal. The same technology can be used for realizing a Wireless Computer Network which transreceives Information in terms of color without involving IP switching and routing. The technology can be built on the existing methodologies of television transmission .	clamping (graphics);multicast;multilayer switch;multiplexing;routing;server (computing);television	Rajarshi Sanyal	2006			wireless;computer network;multicast;computer science;mobile station;chrominance;hue;broadcasting;cellular network;multiplexing	Mobile	-19.55238456710123	90.97632501728381	186940

To use Internet telephony, a direct method is to use a computer connected to the Internet. However, non-Internet users constitute a significant portion of the general public, and Internet users may not be able to access the Internet at a certain time (e.g., when they are walking in the street or traveling in a bus without Internet access). To serve all users, a service provider can adopt the following phone-to-phone configuration: in each servicing city, a telephone gateway is used to bridge the local telephone network and the Internet, so that users can use telephones or mobile phones to access this telephone gateway for long-distance calls through the Internet. The phone-to-phone configuration involves two important issues:#R##N#(i)#TAB##R##N#Service coverage: The service provider should provide service to many cities to attain good service coverage. However, it is costly to operate telephone gateways in many cities.#R##N##R##N#(ii)#TAB##R##N#Voice quality: Voice quality depends on various factors (e.g., coding method, available bandwidth, packet loss in the Internet, etc.). In the phone-to-phone configuration, multiple voice streams are sent from a source gateway to a destination gateway. This property can be exploited to tackle the packet loss problem for better voice quality.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#In this chapter, we describe the current methods for tackling the above two issues. Specifically, we describe the sparse telephone gateway configuration [Y.W. Leung, Sparse telephone gateway for Internet telephony, Comput. Netw. 54(1) (2010) 150–164.] which can serve many cities at lower cost, and describe the shared packet loss recovery method [Y.W. Leung, Shared packet loss recovery for Internet telephony, IEEE Commun. Lett. 9 (1) (2005) 84–86.] and the lightweight piggybacking method [W.Y. Chow, Y.W. Leung, Lightweight piggybacking for packet loss recovery in Internet telephony, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communications, Glasgow, UK, June 2007, pp. 1809–1814 (Revised version is under review by a journal.)], which exploit the property of the phone-to-phone configuration for effective packet loss recovery.

a7f3ce1c6a8c429d38784fe3fbedbabbed913f2f	a telephone adapter for internet telephony systems	design and development;real time;internet telephony	In order to make the Internet telephony system a step closer to being a viable replacement of the conventional telephony system, an Internet telephone adapter (ITA) is proposed to interface a conventional telephone to the host computer. With the ITA, there is no longer the need for the current practice of using the host computer’s microphone as the audio input and the internal or external speaker as the audio output to carry out a conversation. Users are able to dial an Internet telephone number to make a connection, be notified of an incoming Internet call through ringing of the telephone set, and carry out a conversation using the conventional telephone handset. This paper describes the design and development of an ITA which is connected to the parallel port of the host computer and optionally, to an existing sound card in the host computer. This will allow the ITA to be used as a stand-alone device or in conjunction with a sound card to support full-duplex real-time voice communication across the Internet.	ccir system a;duplex (telecommunications);host (network);internet;microphone;parallel port;real-time clock;real-time transcription;ringing (signal);sound card;telephone number	Schubert Foo;Chai Kiat Yeo;Siu Cheung Hui	1997	Microprocessors and Microsystems - Embedded Hardware Design	10.1016/S0141-9331(97)00045-8	embedded system;class 4 telephone switch;telephone network;telephone exchange;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;operating system;telephone line;dial-up internet access;mobile radio telephone;voice over ip;multimedia;class 5 telephone switch;telephony;computer network	HCI	-21.736783469433732	93.73538030900667	191588

Therefore, the performance analysis of a specific network based on absolute references or third parties may not be applicable in all circumstances, especially in highly complex and heterogeneous networks. Indeed, it carries a high degree of uncertainty, and the classical logic may not be appropriate to deal it. This paper aims to parameterize and evaluate the operating elements of heterogeneous networks, from the analysis of representative attributes, based on concepts of Paraconsistent Annotated Evidential Logic Eτ.	paraconsistent logic;profiling (computer programming)	Avelino Palma Pimenta Junior;Jair Minoro Abe;Genivaldo Carlos Silva	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-51133-7_1	computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;algorithm	Metrics	-33.42748883754501	91.35165269000643	192290

It has been applied in many automation control fields successfully such as medicine and chemical industry. On the other hand, the wireless LAN standards IEEE802.11 have been established for several years and after fast growing, it is now the recognized standard around the world and has been expanded so as to include important features to ensure its compatibility in industrial applications. How to combine EPA with WLAN is important so that we can extend EPA to some applications where it is not convenient to layout. The deterministic communication mechanism of EPA is on the assumption that the data communication has no disturbance and no one data package will be lost. This is not suitable in wireless environment. So a master-slave mode is introduced to realize deterministic scheduling, which is proved to be reliable and robust in practice. Instead of IEEE1588, an upgraded method basing on TSF is used to achieve clock synchronization. Not only can it cut the shortage of TSF but also it needn't extra message to increase network payload.

The TransPAC, submarine fiber-optic link was also used as a backup for the Intelsat link. We began to establish the full-scale experimental network in May 2000, and performed the engineering tests during about a two-month period of the TPD. We verified the connectivity of the satellite links, ATM connections, IP and higher layers, and then measured satellite link performance, ATM transmission performance, TCP/XTP performances and so on. As the result of the engineering test, we found that networks that include one or two satellite links can be used as network infrastructure for high data rate applications.	network architecture;propagation delay	Naoto Kadowaki;Naoko Yoshimura;Nozomu Nishinaga;Ray Gilstrap;Mark Foster	2001	Space Communications		network architecture;software performance testing;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;computer network	DB	-20.296507020440192	91.35071950071044	194822

The modeling process utilizes mathematical and simulation models as well as simulators. Only simulators or simulation tools make it possible to solve problems related to the analysis and optimization of the control parameters. The most appropriate modeler is the simulators reflecting the protocols and functions, which are fully or partially built into the original system. At present, there are no simulators for modeling the work of SIP servers in overload conditions with an application of mechanisms, which are currently under development by IETF SIP Overload Control workgroup. Simulation tool that supports the main SIP RFCs such as RFC 3261 are proposed in the paper. The architecture of SIP node is developed, and numerical example is presented.	control system;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;programming tool;server (computing);simulation	Pavel O.

This first part focuses exclusively on the connection management (i.e. connection set-up and release) mechanisms. The mechanisms used during the phase of data transfer over a connection will be analysed in the companion paper. The goal of the comparison of the connection management mechanisms is to determine the suitability of each of the three protocols assuming that they operate in HSLANs environments characterized by high performance but also, possibly, by a wide range of application requirements as regards the types of communications to provide. This paper takes account of the very last Revision 3.6 of XTP and of the upgraded version of the ISO Transport Protocol which has been circulated for ballot as Draft International Standard (DIS) 8073.	belief revision;iso/iec 646;mike lesser;requirement	Yves Baguette;André A.

The packet transport mechanism provided by Ethernet has been used to build systems which can be viewed as either local computer networks or loosely coupled multiprocessors. An Ethernet's shared communication facility, its Ether, is a passive broadcast medium with no central control. Coordination of access to the Ether for packet broadcasts is distributed among the contending transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration. Switching of packets to their destinations on the Ether is distributed among the receiving stations using packet address recognition. Design principles and implementation are described, based on experience with an operating Ethernet of 100 nodes along a kilometer of coaxial cable. A model for estimating performance under heavy loads and a packet protocol for error controlled communication are included for completeness.	digital data;distributed computing;loose coupling;network packet;network switch;packet switching;transmitter	Robert Metcalfe;David Boggs	1983	Commun.
