ef80ca7fc90e6ac3948a7c21fd689cc0d039328c	if there is something it is like to be alife, what is it?		In the field of consciousness studies, the phrase ‘Is there something it is like to be X?’, derived from Nagel’s ‘What is it like to be a bat?’ (Nagel 1974), has become an acceptable way of asking whether X is conscious. It is my contention that this is a question that should be asked in the context of artificial organisms of the type studied in Alife, and especially of physically embodied organisms; the fact that it has so rarely been asked within Alife is perhaps a legacy of the influence of behavior based ideas, which have emptied most such entities of internal representations and processes just as behaviorism banished them from psychology for the best part of a century. However, the question of whether and how some forms of consciousness can be produced in artefacts is the province of the new discipline of machine consciousness, which emerged from outside Alife, and is proceeding independently of it. I wish to bring the two together, and to do so I will ask and answer a slightly different question: if an Alife organism did have a form of consciousness, what would it be like? One of the advantages of asking this particular question is that we can answer objections that certain abilities are impossible (e.g. building and maintaining a world model) by pointing to current work in robotics and AI that demonstrates those abilities. So what would such a consciousness be like? My claim is that, if it had developed through artificial evolution, it would be very like our own, and in particular it would have many of the same defects, deficiencies, and peculiarities. One problem with making this claim to an audience unfamiliar with the current state of consciousness research is that most people are blissfully unaware of the differences between objective reality and what our consciousness represents to us. I will briefly review the current state of knowledge in respect of this, and I will then show how distortions of time, memory, perception, and voluntary capacity may be the inevitable consequences of the evolution of progressively more capable entities, whether natural or artificial. This will entail a description of how and why world-models and self-models must arise, and of how and to what purpose they might interact. An enduring problem in the study of consciousness is the explanatory gap – our continuing inability to account for the mental in terms of the physical (Levine 1983). I will not engage directly with this issue, but will instead avoid it by proposing what I call the representational principle of experience: in a system capable of conscious experience, what is experienced must be represented within the system, but not everything represented within the system will or can be experienced (Holland and Marques 2010). One attractive and much discussed possibility is that conscious experience is in some way centered around a model of the physical self. Using the principle, I will present evidence from both robotics and psychology that this, regrettably, is probably not the case.	artificial consciousness;artificial life;banished;distortion;earl levine;entity;evolutionary algorithm;robotics;self-similarity	Owen Holland	2010			social psychology;explanatory gap;consciousness;artificial intelligence;phrase;perception;computer science;objectivity (philosophy);embodied cognition;behaviorism;wish	AI	-25.7660397118731	-13.544493596408616	51736
0d0c4000af2f977f3e54706cd40f1f7dedf1a033	les réseaux d'engagements comme méthode pour modéliser le comportement dialogique des agents		In this article, we present the web of commitment methodology that allows us to specify the dialogical behavior of agents from the commitments that can be co ntra ted between them and from the links that can exist between those commitments. At first, we present the DIAGAL agent communication language which is based on social commitme nts and dialogue games that are defined as structures regulating the mechanism under wh ich some commitments are discussed through the dialogue. Then, we present our social com mitments model to explain how the agent who uses DIAGAL can use the dialogue games to manipulate th e commitments. For that, we introduce the web of commitments concept which makes it poss ble to specify the causality links that exist between various commitments of a multi-agent sy stem. Finally, we explain using an illustrative example how we could implement, through our s im lator, our concepts and ideas.

f3eb1d884efc8eb3ef60e94fa3ef540883651322	data-driven and collision-free hybrid crowd simulation model for real scenario		In order to take into account evading mechanism and make more realistic simulation results, we propose a data-driven and collision-free hybrid crowd simulation model in this paper. The first part of the model is a data-driven process in which we introduce an algorithm called MS-ISODATA (Main Streams Iterative Self-organizing Data Analysis) to learn motion patterns from real scenarios. The second part introduces an agent-based collision-free mechanism in which a steering approach is improved and this part uses the output from the first part to guide its agents. The hybrid simulation model we propose can reproduce simulated crowds with motion features of real scenarios, and it also enables agents in simulation evade from mutual collisions. The simulation results show that the hybrid crowd simulation model mimics the desired crowd dynamics well. According to a collectiveness measurement, the simulation results and real scenarios are very close. Meanwhile, it reduces the number of virtual crowd collisions and makes the movement of the crowd more effective.

We argue that signals in the brain constantly generate relations among their constituents. Unsupervised learning is then accomplished by fast similarity testing of the stored relation sets using resonance transients and time sequenced memory units. We discuss specific algorithms to achieve these functions.	algorithm;artificial general intelligence;artificial intelligence;computation;resonance;unsupervised learning	Weibo Gong;Bo Jiang	2017	2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2017.8264282	mathematical optimization;visualization;machine learning;computer science;unsupervised learning;artificial intelligence;human intelligence	Robotics	-27.30936984632969	-16.225270948788136	53599

This paper contends that all developers bring to the task of development some implicit or explicit assumptions of the agent communication pattern. This issue is not readily addressed in current literature and represents a gap in knowledge. For this purpose, a generic pattern of inter-agent communication is introduced and discussed in this paper. For better understanding and modelling of agent-based e-commerce systems, the semiotic approach and the DEMO transaction concept are briefly introduced. It is shown that the semiotic approach offers a unifying framework for identifying the roles of agents, the responsible human agents and the right/constraints associated with each role. The DEMO transaction concept is applied to model the communicative interaction between agents.	e-commerce;semiotics	Joseph Barjis;Samuel Chong;Jan L. G.

In this abstract I outline three such flows between the domains of evolutionary biology and robotics. First, biological evolution shapes all aspects of an organism’s body and brain simultaneously. This led to work in which artificial evolution optimizes the morphology and neural control of robots such that they perform increasingly sophisticated tasks. Second, evolution causes change over evolutionary time, but also over the lifetime of the organism. This led to work in which virtual robots change body plans as they evolve to perform more complex tasks, but their bodies also change as they perform those tasks. Finally, evolution always works on populations. This led to work in which populations of humans collaborate and compete to evolve increasingly sophisticated robots. © Selection and peer-review under responsibility of FET11 conference organizers and published by Elsevier B.V.	evolution;evolutionary algorithm;galaxy morphological classification;humans;population;robot;robotics	Josh C.

The central question this effort poses is which abstract representations are required to express and evaluate plans composed of sequences of skills. We show that classifiers can be used as a symbolic representation system, and that the ability to represent the preconditions and effects of an agent’s skills is both necessary and sufficient for task-level planning. The resulting representations allow a reinforcement learning agent to acquire a symbolic representation appropriate for planning from experience.	high- and low-level;precondition;reinforcement learning	George Konidaris;Leslie Pack Kaelbling;Tomás Lozano-Pérez	2013			computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;representation;reinforcement learning	AI	-24.124045305897628	-18.404567576410756	54794

Our available information is often limited to observations of the agent's external behavior in the past and present. To understand these actions, we need to deduce the agent's internal state, which includes not only rational elements (such as intentions and plans), but also emotive ones (such as fear). In addition, we often want to predict the agent's future actions, which are constrained not only by these inward characteristics, but also by the dynamics of the agent's interaction with its environment. BEE (Behavior Evolution and Extrapolation) uses a faster-than-real-time agent-based model of the environment to characterize agents' internal state by evolution against observed behavior, and then predict their future behavior, taking into account the dynamics of their interaction with the environment.	agent-based model;direct inward dial;extrapolation;real-time clock;real-time transcription	H.

36247bef36e691a36bc5cb0202fe1b65a4aeaddc	simulating crowds with ocean personality traits		Most of the techniques available nowadays for crowd simulation are focused on a specific situation, like people evacuation. Even if one consider heterogeneous crowds, very few of existing methodologies consider the psychological traits of individuals in order to determine the behavior of agents. Therefore, this work aims to add psychological factor as input for agents simulation, which is going to determine their group behavior and, therefore, how individuals move and evolve in virtual environments. The proposed input is the individuals OCEAN attributes which are used to parametrize BioCrowds, a crowd simulation method. We implemented two different parameterizations to map from OCEAN to crowd parameters and compare results. Obtained results with both methods indicate a positive correlation, once they presented a similar behavior in both tested scenarios. In addition, we show how heterogeneous behaviors we can generate in comparison to original BioCrowds.	crowd simulation;numerical analysis;prototype;user interface;virtual actor;virtual reality	Paulo Knob;Marcio Balotin;Soraia Raupp Musse	2018		10.1145/3267851.3267871	multimedia;crowds;human–computer interaction;psychological models;big five personality traits;computer science;crowd simulation	AI	-21.737149842199045	-21.301260266665615	54946

In particular, does it do full justice to the phenomenal aspects of our social intentional relations?

We describe two possible implementations of SCT process at an architectural level, on the basis of the Soar cognitive architecture. The first, which seems to follow directly from Festinger’s social comparison theory, treats the SCT process as an uncertainty-resolution method. The second, takes a different approach, in which an SCT process is constantly active, in parallel to any problem solving activity. We present the implementation of these approaches in the Soar cognitive architecture and argue that one is more suitable for modeling crowd behaviors. In previous work, we have shown that SCT covers a variety of pedestrian movement phenomena. In this paper we present the use of the SCT model in generation of imitational behavior in loosely-coupled groups. Based on experiments with human subjects, we show that SCT generates behavior in-tune with human crowd behavior.	cognitive architecture;cognitive model;computation;computational model;experiment;problem solving;soar (cognitive architecture)	Natalie Fridman;Gal A.

This approach gives the possibility to apply the quantum formalism for probabilities induced in any domain of science. In this paper we propose a model of brain functioning based on the quantum-like (QL) representation of mental contexts. In this model brain can be considered as a QL (but not conventional quantum) computer. We discuss a possible mechanism of the QLrepresentation of information in the brain. It is based on processing of information at two different time scales: pre-cognitive (fine) and cognitive (coarse).	quantum;semantics (computer science)	Andrei Khrennikov	2007			contextual design;artificial intelligence;computer science;machine learning;quantum;formalism (philosophy);cognition	AI	-24.619286258304786	-14.673729908079743	55204

We introduce a Macroscopic-Influenced Microscopic (MIM) approach which aims at reducing the gap between microscopic and macroscopic approaches by providing credible walking paths for a potentially highly congested crowd of autonomous pedestrians. Our approach originates from a least-effort formulation of the navigation task, which allows us to consistently account for congestion at every level of decision. We use the multi-agent paradigm and describe pedestrians as autonomous and situated agents who plan dynamically for energy efficient paths and interact with each other through the environment. The navigable space is considered as a set of contiguous resources that agents use to build their paths. We emulate the dynamic path computation for each agent with an evolutionary search algorithm, especially designed to be executed in real-time, individually and autonomously. We have compared an implementation of our approach with the ORCA model, on low density and high density scenarios, and obtained promising results in terms of credibility and scalability. We believe that ORCA model and other microscopic models could be easily extended to embrace our approach, thus providing richer simulations of potentially highly congested crowd of autonomous pedestrians.	agent-based model;autonomous robot;computation;multi-agent system;network congestion;orca;programming paradigm;real-time clock;scalability;search algorithm;simulation;situated	Patrick Simo Kanmeugne;Aurélie Beynier	2014		10.1145/2671015.2671030	computer vision;real-time computing;scalability;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;motion planning;computer security	AI	-20.56116708374438	-20.086972749672658	55273

However, human beings communicate or share tasks among each other through the specification of spatial relations among elements or zones within the space. Heuristic Topological Qualitative Semantic (HTQS) is an algorithm to make decisions about navigation developed into the program of research denominated Multifunctional Robots On Topological Notions (MROTN). HTQS permits decisions to be taken about local navigation by means of establishing options concerning spatial relations which will enable new lines of research to be developed. Two lines of research which extend the scope of HTQS are thus presented. One is the inclusion of enclosure topological relations to describe spatial situations. The other is about the use of fuzzy topological relations to control velocity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

c8a61f3814cb7d4810640da6c6554684df08b02e	presuppositions about the role of consciousness in the agent causation conception of agents and the problem of the disappearing agent	regulative control;action;disappearing agent;consciousness	Well-known theories of Agent Causation rely on a conception of agency that expects that agents play a role in the production of their action, a conscious role. According to this conception of agents, the requirement of consciousness provides ground for these theories to pose the Disappearing Agent objection to the Causal Theory of Action. In a similar way, Wegner (2002, 2008) holds that without the conscious will playing a role in the production of actions we are not agents. In this sense, the elements that ground the Disappearing Agent objection resemble Wegner’s conclusion that it is an illusion that we are agents. I will argue that the objection raised by Agent Causation theories equates lack of consciousness with lack of control and, consequently, of agential role in the production of action. This will show that the issue is grounded on a specific conception of what an agent is, and what her role in producing actions should be. I, however, defend the claim that this conception of agency should be revised, as well as the objection that springs from it, because if we accept that consciousness does not always play a relevant role in the production of actions, then human agents cannot fulfill the requirements in question.	action theory (philosophy);ana (programming language);artificial consciousness;causal system;causality;correlation does not imply causation;requirement;sara (computer);software agent	Beatriz Sorrentino Marques;Osvaldo Frota Pessoa	2017	Cognitive Systems Research	10.1016/j.cogsys.2016.12.003	psychology;computer science;artificial intelligence;consciousness;social psychology	AI	-25.03410312177427	-13.080458897950637	55463

Such approaches are thus in a natural position to oppose the ‘thesis of linguistic structuring’: The claim that the ability to use language results in a wholesale recapitulation of linguistic structure in onboard mental representation. Prominent examples of researchers adopting this critical stance include Andy Clark, Michael Wheeler, and Mark Rowlands. But is such opposition warranted? Since each of these authors advocate accounts of mental representation that are broadly connectionist, I survey research on formal language computation in artificial neural networks, and argue that results indicate a strong form of the linguistic structuring thesis is true: Internal representational systems recapitulate significant linguistic structure, even on a connectionist account of mental representation. I conclude by sketching how my conclusion can nonetheless be viewed as consistent with and complimentary to an embedded/embodied account of the role of linguistic structure in cognition.	artificial neural network;cognition;computation;connectionism;embedded system;formal language;mental representation;subversion	Whit Schonbein	2012	Minds and Machines	10.1007/s11023-012-9275-1	psychology;connectionism;developmental psychology;philosophy;epistemology;computer science;artificial intelligence;mental representation;situated cognition;language;communication;artificial neural network;algorithm;cognitive science	NLP	-26.377788349738562	-15.295728736441145	55659
bad2943600745caca3121b9e711ca0159ba49c47	structure and interpretation of classical mechanics	classical mechanics	We now know that there is much more to classical mechanics than previously suspected. Derivations of the equations of motion, the focus of traditional presentations of mechanics, are just the beginning. This innovative textbook, now in its second edition, concentrates on developing general methods for studying the behavior of classical systems, whether or not they have a symbolic solution. It focuses on the phenomenon of motion and makes extensive use of computer simulation in its explorations of the topic. It weaves recent discoveries in nonlinear dynamics throughout the text, rather than presenting them as an afterthought. Explorations of phenomena such as the transition to chaos, nonlinear resonances, and resonance overlap to help the student develop appropriate analytic tools for understanding. The book uses computation to constrain notation, to capture and formalize methods, and for simulation and symbolic analysis. The requirement that the computer be able to interpret any expression provides the student with strict and immediate feedback about whether an expression is correctly formulated. This second edition has been updated throughout, with revisions that reflect insights gained by the authors from using the text every year at MIT. In addition, because of substantial software improvements, this edition provides algebraic proofs of more generality than those in the previous edition; this improvement permeates the new edition.	interpretation (logic)	Gerald J.

d4eef3fa0f4aa184c86350a97663ae24e2c80288	the retrieval power of nfql	query language;cognitive modeling with heuristics;machine learning;learning strategy;heuristics	Forms are common and well understood in our modern society, especially in the office. They organize and structure communication according to well established and long standing convention. The Natural Forms Query Language (NFQL) takes advantage of these features to provide a “natural” communication language between computers and humans. Various facets of NFQL have been discussed elsewhere. In this paper we explore the retrieval power of NFQL. We explain why basic NFQL forms (which are essentially ordinary business forms) do not by themselves have enough retrieval power to be relationally complete. We then explain how to augment the notation to increase the retrieval power, and we provide an inductive proof to show that NFQL, as augmented, is relationally complete. Because additional notation may negatively effect usability, we discuss the pragmatics of adding new features. We explain how these features can be improved notationally, and argue that, with the improvements, we maintain the objective of being able to interpret standard forms, while increasing their retrieval power.	computer;mathematical induction;query language;usability	Yiu-Kai Ng;David W.

76af60b0cae533540ae071cc1cd1c94ed4621188	imagery in cognitive architecture: representation and control at multiple levels of abstraction	cognitive science;artificial intelligence;perception;architecture;images	Visual     and     spatial    mental     imagery    processes     seem     to    play     a    prominent     role     in    human cognition,     and     AI     systems     have     occasionally     incorporated     imagery-­‐like     processes     in order    to    leverage    functional    benefits.    Typically,    these    benefits    have    been    characterized as     the     ability     to     perform     more     efficient     inference     through     the     use     of     specialized representation.    However,    as    explored     in     this    article,    when    considering     the    design    of    a cognitive     architecture—a     specification     of     fixed     mechanisms     underlying     intelligent behavior—the    functional    benefits    of    imagery    go    beyond    increased    inference    efficiency. In     a     cognitive     architecture,     as     in     most     AI     systems,     intelligent     behavior     is     often contingent    upon     the    use    of     an    appropriate    abstract     representation    of     the     task.    When designing     a     general-­‐purpose     cognitive     architecture,     two     basic     challenges     related     to abstraction     arise.     The     perceptual     abstraction     problem     results     from     the     difficulty     of creating    a    single    perception    system    able    to    induce    appropriate    abstract    representations in     any     task     the     agent    might     encounter,     and     the     irreducibility     problem     arises     because some     tasks     are     resistant     to    being     abstracted     at     all.          Key    benefits     of     imagery     relate     to addressing    these    challenges. As    it    is    defined    here,    to    support    imagery,    a    concrete    (highly    detailed)    representation    of the    spatial    state    of    the    problem    is    maintained    as    an    intermediate    between    the    external world    and    an    abstract    representation.    Actions    can    be    simulated    (imagined)     in    terms    of this    concrete    representation,    and    the    agent    can    derive    abstract    information    by    applying perceptual     processes     to     the     resulting     concrete     state.     Imagery     works     to     mitigate     the perceptual    abstraction    problem    by    allowing    a    given    perception    system    to    work    in    more tasks,     since     perception     can     be     dynamically     combined     with     imagery,     and     works     to mitigate     the     irreducibility    problem    by    allowing     internal     simulation    of     low-­‐level     control processes. To    demonstrate    these    benefits,    an    implementation    is    described,    which    is    an    extension    of the     Soar     cognitive     architecture.     An     agent     in     this     architecture     that     uses     reinforcement learning     and     imagery     to     play     an     arcade     game     and     an     agent     that     performs     sampling-­‐ based    motion    planning     for     a     car-­‐like     vehicle     are    described.     The    performance    of     these agents    is    discussed    in    the    context    of    the    underlying    imagery    theory. UNCLASSIFIED: Dist. A.

This paper presents a new approach, based on an integral information measure of the random process. An entropy functional (EF) on the trajectories of the process accumulates and encodes the process’ inner connections between the information states. The application of a variation principle (VP) to the EF determines the process’ information path functional (IPF), whose extremal trajectories describe the informational dynamics of this process. Information dynamics with the VP invariant relations evaluate the information content of a random process, expose its information code and reveal a conserved (hidden) information, produced at an acquisition of the process information. By introducing both objective and subjective information observers, we consider the observers information cognitive dynamics and neurodynamics, based on the EF–IPF approach. The universal nature of information process’ dynamics and regularities, discovered in the information observers, have many applications not only in cognitive and intelligent systems, but also in different biological, social and economic systems. 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Diagrams used in society are expressed in a variety of notations, which we call natural visual languages. Examples include notations used for mathematics, music, engineering drawings and architecture. These visual languages do not have fixed, formal definitions, but evolve through use in society. This paper examines the use of graph transformation in processing natural visual languages, describing the difficult problesm in this domain, existing graph transformation work in this area, and competing methods. Many problesm have not been adequately addressed by any technique. The use of graph transformation is appropriate, since the representation and manipulation of spatial and logical relationships is central to the computation.

The first one takes into account phenomenological aspects of signification which are insisting on the human experience """"from within"""". The second adopts solely the view """"from the outside"""" based on scientific practice, with an observing agent generating inter-subjective knowledge in a research community. The process of knowledge production, embodied into networks of cognizing agents interacting with the environment and developing through evolution is studied on different levels of abstraction in both frames of reference. In order to develop scientifically tractable models of evolution of intelligence in informational structures from pre-biotic/chemical to living networked intelligent organisms, including the implementation of those models in artificial agents, a basic level language of Info-Computationalism has shown to be suitable. There are however contexts in which we deal with complex informational structures essentially dependent on human first person knowledge where high level language such as Cybersemiotics is the appropriate tool for conceptualization and communication. Two research projects are presented in order to exemplify the interplay of info-computational and higher-order approaches: The Blue Brain Project where the brain is modeled as info-computational system, a simulation in silico of a biological brain function, and Biosemiotics research on genes, information, and semiosis in which the process of semiosis is understood in info-computational terms. The article analyzes differences and convergences of Cybersemiotics and Info-computationalist approaches which by placing focus on distinct levels of organization, help elucidate processes of knowledge production in intelligent agents.

We describe a methodology that focuses analysts only on regions of the trade space holding the most promise for effective analyses. Our methodology uses an iterative process to define the trade space, develop system and operator descriptions, parameterize the trade space and analyze performance against requirements. Each step is briefly described through the use of a notional attack aircraft crew system example. Four vectors through the trade space are identified to guide definition of specific issues modeled within the Combat Automation Requirements Testbed (CART) environment.

c74f138f588ac901029dbb81423cb42c9e17d7f5	a novel approach on evolutionary dynamics analysis - a progress report		Abstract In this paper, we discuss the possibility of unique mutual fusion of evolutionary algorithms, complex networks, strange dynamics and hidden attractors. As demonstrated in many research papers, evolutionary algorithms are capable of very complex tasks such as chaotic system control, identification or synthesis and vice versa; chaos can also be observed in the evolutionary dynamics, as originally demonstrated by various researchers. We propose a novel approach on how to analyze and control dynamic of the evolutionary algorithm and also discuss the possibility of strange dynamics analysis that can be a part of dynamic of evolutionary algorithms. In any words, we propose to understand algorithms as a discrete dynamical system that exhibits a wide spectrum of the behavior that can be controlled and analyzed.

An algorithm named Neighbor-Miner is proposed for MADWH and MADM. The algorithm is defined in an evolving dynamic environment with semiautonomous neurofuzzy agents. Instead of mining frequent itemsets from customer transactions, the new algorithm discovers new neurofuzzy agents and mines agent associations in first-order logic for coordination that was once considered impossible in traditional data mining. While the Apriori algorithm uses frequency as a priori threshold, Neighbor-Miner uses agent similarity as a priori knowledge. The concept of agent similarity leads to the notions of agent cuboid, orthogonal MADWH, and MADM. Based on agent similarities and action similarities, Neighbor-Miner is presented and illustrated with brain modeling for robot control. The novelty of a multiagent data warehouse lies in its ability to systematically combine neurofuzzy systems, multiagent systems, database systems, machine learning, data mining, information theory, neuroscience, decision, cognition, and control all together into a modern multidimensional information system architecture * Corresponding author.

The decision process of the robot agent should consider the presence of its human partner. Also, the robot planning should be flexible to human comfortability and all possible changes in the shared environment. To solve the problem of human-robot collaboration with no communication, we present a model that gives the robot the ability to build a belief over human intentions in order to predict his goals, this model counts mainly on observing the human actions. We integrate this prediction into a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) model to achieve the most appropriate and flexible decisions for the robot.	automated planning and scheduling;human–robot interaction;markov chain;no-communication theorem;open collaboration;partially observable markov decision process;robot	Abir-Beatrice Karami;Laurent Jeanpierre;Abdel-Illah Mouaddib	2010	2010 5th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)	10.1145/1734454.1734520	human–robot interaction;robot;augmented reality;master/slave;simulation;partially observable markov decision process;computer science;humanoid robot;speech;artificial intelligence;predictive modelling;markov process;collaboration	Robotics	-24.416750489305333	-19.704917284272728	57216

Since network-based humanoid architecture was proposed, it's possible to reduce costs of robots. We hope robots will be all around at each home. Therefore, normal users who are not experts need to be able to control various robots with easy commands. We developed a scripting language, named CCSLR (Common Command-Scripting Language for network-based Robots) to help users and developers who control various robots in ubiquitous environments. If a user composes a script in CCSLR commands, CCSLR translator system translates the script into suitable low-level command. Therefore, with a set of high-level commands, CCSLR is able to represent low-level commands in common way. Before making the robotic system understand commands that a user input, first, we need to determine what command is. High-level command should lit into both a user intention and a low-level control for heterogeneous robots. We developed the CCSLR and its translator system within the network-based humanoid architecture [1].	high- and low-level;robot;scripting language	Il-Gu Lee;Dong To Nguyen;Doik Kim	2007	RO-MAN 2007 - The 16th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication	10.1109/ROMAN.2007.4415092	embedded system;simulation;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;scripting language;robot control;ubiquitous computing;aisoy1	Robotics	-28.22026925914344	-21.777289959898795	57267

0b875389873cd3dc94a46b27179e820c713b1676	self-governance by transfiguration: from learning to prescriptions		Norms are commonly understood as guides for the conduct of autonomous agents, thereby easing their individual decision-making and coordination. However, their study exhibits a polarity between (i) norms as behavioural patterns emerging from repeated agents’ (inter)actions and (ii) norms as explicit prescriptions. In this paper, we attempt to build a bridge between these two conceptual poles of norms: it takes the form of a mental function for prescriptive transfiguration allowing reinforced learning agents to express their learning experiences into prescriptions. The population of transfigurative agents are then equipped with a consensus system to build and enforce prescriptive systems to self-govern on-line. Simple simulations suggest the pertinence of the approach and shows its weaknesses, in particular prescriptions stalling learning, and timeliness in norm construction.	autonomous agent;autonomous robot;behavioral pattern;computational resource;consensus (computer science);norm (social);online and offline;reinforcement learning;relevance;risk aversion;self-organization;simulation	Régis Riveret;Alexander Artikis;Dídac Busquets;Jeremy V.

Perspective In Undemanding Recent work on the understanding of natural language narratives has emphasized representations composed of goals, plans, and their outcomes. Causal chains [121, hierarchical goal/outcome graphs [3] [16], story grammar parse trees [9] [10] [15], and causally linked networks [6] [7] have been proposed as models of the mental representation of a story. A problem that has received little attention however is the influence of perspective in understanding a narrative. Perspective may operate on many levels. Inputs are understood by evaluating them in terms of the system's knowledge, which is often based on subjectively interpreted personal experiences. Thus, understanders having different belief systems may interpret the same story in different ways [5].	causality;experience;mental representation;natural language;parsing	Brian J.

The motivational module implements two conflicting drives: a goal-location drive and a characteristic-based drive. We investigate the interactions and scaling of these partially competing drives and show how they can be properly integrated into the SURE REACH system. The aim of this paper is two-fold. From a biological perspective, this paper studies how motivation-like mechanisms may be involved in behavioral decision making and control. From an engineering perspective, the paper strives for the generation of integrated, self-motivated, live-like artificial creatures, which can generate self-induced, goal-oriented behaviors while safely and smartly interacting with humans.	robot;robotic arm	Martin V.

This paper presents a cognitive informatics perspective on autonomous agent systems (AAS’s). A hierarchical reference model of AAS’s is developed, which reveals that an autonomous agent possesses intelligent behaviors at three layers known as those of imperative, autonomic, and autonomous from the bottom up. The theoretical framework of AAS’s is described from the facets of cognitive informatics, computational intelligence, and denotational mathematics. According to Wang’s abstract intelligence theory, an autonomous software agent is supposed to be called as an intelligent-ware, shortly, an intelware, parallel to hardware and software in computing, information science, and artificial intelligence.	artificial intelligence;autonomic computing;autonomous agent;autonomous robot;cognitive science;cognitive tutor;computational intelligence;imperative programming;informatics;information science;reference model;software agent;top-down and bottom-up design;warez	Yingxu Wang	2009	IJCINI	10.4018/jcini.2009010101	reference model;computer science;artificial intelligence;autonomous agent;theoretical computer science;software agent;machine learning;computational intelligence;mathematical model;artificial intelligence, situated approach;intelligent agent;autonomic computing	AI	-25.997891923471787	-15.514288887125577	58498

For example, several studies have shown that the time required for two people to perform a simple task like assembling a trash-can carrier can vary by more than a factor of two, depending on whether the people are allowed to talk directly to each other or whether they are constrained and can only communicate by, say, typing messages back and forth. Communication for problem solving is as important when the agents are all people as when they are all machines or some of each. Because ofthe importance of communication as a part of problem solving, an important part of the design of any program is its ability to communicate with its users. There are, of course, many ways in which people can communicate with programs. Some are linguistict they use a verbal language of some kind, be it English or an artificial command language. Others are nonlinguistic, relying instead on such techniques as pointing or drawing. This article concentrates on the use of natural languages, such as English. Such languages are attractive because they are powerful and people already know them. This power, however, causes practical difficulties in the use of natural languages as interfaces to programs. We will examine the role of natural languages in such interfaces and will explore some techniques for exploiting them.

1919d146f0977c62076466315e5da75c046302ee	steps towards a theory of representation design	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	"""A computer program was developed that designs specialized representations for problems of the sort found in the analytical reasoning section of the GRE and LSAT. These problems are intended to test a person's ability to """"draw logical conclusions from information presented and to synthesize that information in order to deduce the actual structure of or interrelationships among things."""" [Weber83] The system takes as input a straightforward predicate calculus translation of a problem, requests additional information if necessary, decides what to represent and how, designs representations specialized to the problem, and finally creates and executes a LISP program that uses those representations to produce a solution. Even though typically these problems are very difficult for theorem provers to solve, the LISP programs that uses the specialized representations is very efficient. The representations the system designs are powerful because they capture the constraints of a problem, in two ways: (i) the structure of the representation resembles the structure of the thing represented and (ii) this structure enables efficient behaviors that enforce a problem's constraints by keeping those constraints invariant in the structure. More specialized representations capture more problem constraints in their structure and behavior. As constraints get captured in a representation, fewer situations can be expressed. This reduces the space that a problem solver must consider in a specialized representation. This, in turn, results in more efficient problem solving behavior. The goal of the system is to design a representation that captures all of a problem's constraints. The process developed to achieve this is divided into three subprocesses: classification, concept introduction, and operationalization. Each of these contributes in different ways to capture constraints of a problem in a representation being designed. Constraints on a problem concept are captured structurally when the concept is represented with a structure having the same properties as the concept. Classification uses a library of structures organized into a taxonomy around the constraints that they capture: Structures that capture more constraints are more specialized. Constraints on a concept are captured structurally by identifying the library structure that captures the most constraints on the concept and then representing the concept with that structure. This is done by classifying concepts in the taxonomy. The success of classification in capturing constraints is limited by the particular vocabulary used to state a problem. Concept introduction is a way of enhancing classification. If classification fails to capture constraints on a concept, then introduction tries a different way of representing the concept. For example, if classification fails to capture all the constraints on a concept represented as a relation, introduction might try representing it as a function. This strategy works because different library structures capture different constraints and have different specializations. Representing a concept differently may be a better fit between the constraints on that concept and the constraints captured by the different representation. Classification and concept introduction run as coroutines, trying to capture all of the constraints of a problem. As they do this, the statements of those constraints get removed from the problem. They usually fail to capture all the constraints leaving statements of the uncaptured constraints in the problem. Operationalization then tries to capture the constraints of any remaining statements by writing new procedures and using these to specialize the representations created by classification and concept introduction. An interesting property of analytical reasoning problems is that they are usually incomplete. An important part of the representation design process developed is identifying where information might be missing from a problem and asking a user informed questions in an effort to complete the problem."""	computer program;constraint (mathematics);coroutine;first-order logic;problem solving;solver;taxonomy (general);theory;vocabulary	Jeffrey Van Baalen	1988			electrical engineering technology;applied mathematics;computer science;engineering physics;mechanical engineering	AI	-31.858047962772098	-13.605023916188813	59262

It is claimed that representations so designed will benefit from greater semantic transparency, which enhances comprehension and ease of learning, and plastic generativity, which makes the meaningful manipulation of the representation easier and less error prone. Epistemic principles for encoding fundamental conceptual structures directly in representational schemes are described. The diagrammatic recodification of probability theory is undertaken to demonstrate how the fundamental conceptual structure of a knowledge domain can be analyzed, how the identified conceptual structure may be encoded in a representational system, and the cognitive benefits that follow. An experiment shows the new probability space diagrams are superior to the conventional approach for learning this conceptually challenging topic.	advocate (person);cognitive dimensions of notations;diagram;probability learning;probability theory;representation (action);benefit;notation	Peter C.-H.

Since a computer is a central unit in many information-processing systems, it seems reasonable to assume that some of the underlying principles of """"how computers operate"""" are important to the unders tanding of information processing in general. One natural approach is to try to express these underlying principles of how computers operate through properties of the set of all computations possible on a computer. This philosophy can be expressed as follows: Once a computer is given to us, the set of all possible computations (runs) on it is fixed.

In this paper we compare classical decision theory with qualitative decision theory, knowledge-based systems and belief–desire–intention models developed in artificial intelligence and agent theory. They all contain representations of information and motivation. Examples of informational attitudes are probability distributions, qualitative abstractions of probabilities, knowledge, and beliefs. Examples of motivational attitudes are utility functions, qualitative abstractions of utilities, goals, and desires. Each of them encodes a set of alternatives to be chosen from. This ranges from a small predetermined set, a set of decision variables, through logical formulas, to branches of a tree representing events through time. Moreover, they have a way of formulating how a decision is made. Classical and qualitative decision theory focus on the optimal decisions represented by a decision rule. Knowledge-based systems and belief–desire–intention models focus on an alternative conceptualization to formalize decision making, inspired by cognitive notions like belief, desire, goal and intention. Relations among these concepts express an agent type, which constrains the deliberation process. We also consider the relation between decision processes and intentions, and the relation between game theory and norms and commitments. 2003 Elsevier B.V.

An important component of our work is to evaluate the performance of the automatically generated planning logic. We have used a virtual environment based game to compare the efficiency of an automatically discovered decision tree representing a planning logic for blocking to the behavior exhibited by the human operators. During our testing we used four volunteers to play against each other and against the computer. In human against human testing, the four players took turns playing the role of the USV and the intruder. In computer against human tests the four players played the role of the intruder while computer played the role of the USV defending a target. The efficiency of the logic was measured in terms of the time delay applied on the intruder by the USV as the USV carried out blocking maneuvers to protect a target. Our preliminary results show that a genetic programming based framework is capable of generating decision trees expressing useful reactive blocking logic.	blocking (computing);broadcast delay;decision tree;genetic programming;machine learning;reactive planning;unmanned aerial vehicle;virtual reality	Maxwell Schwartz;P.

Every model has been developed, prototyped and tested. The article contains experiments results and conclusions for every model. After evolving several theories, we found the most suitable for solving the problem of automatically processing a users incidents.

f1b87a19d934ed27a60fe2ca068aa2555e0447ca	playing 20 question game with policy-based reinforcement learning		The 20 Questions (Q20) game is a well known game which encourages deductive reasoning and creativity. In the game, the answerer first thinks of an object such as a famous person or a kind of animal. Then the questioner tries to guess the object by asking 20 questions. In a Q20 game system, the user is considered as the answerer while the system itself acts as the questioner which requires a good strategy of question selection to figure out the correct object and win the game. However, the optimal policy of question selection is hard to be derived due to the complexity and volatility of the game environment. In this paper, we propose a novel policy-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) method, which enables the questioner agent to learn the optimal policy of question selection through continuous interactions with users. To facilitate training, we also propose to use a reward network to estimate the more informative reward. Compared to previous methods, our RL method is robust to noisy answers and does not rely on the Knowledge Base of objects. Experimental results show that our RL method clearly outperforms an entropy-based engineering system and has competitive performance in a noisyfree simulation environment.	end-to-end principle;experiment;game theory;information;interaction;knowledge base;mit engineering systems division;natural language understanding;reinforcement learning;selection algorithm;simulation;text corpus;volatility;wikipedia	Huang Hu;Xianchao Wu;Bingfeng Luo;Chongyang Tao;Can Xu;Wei Chung Wu;Zhan Chen	2018			artificial intelligence;machine learning;reinforcement learning;computer science;deductive reasoning;knowledge base;creativity	AI	-21.231386690178944	-19.102880376926414	60570
3e7e2db08abc015ff63f152dce024f69042ce8d7	towards a theory of the comprehension of computer programs	computer program;programme ordinateur	A sufficiency theory is presented of the process by which a computer programmer attempts to comprehend a program. The theory is intended to explain four sources of variation in behavior on this task: the kind of computation the program performs, the intrinsic properties of the program text, such as language and documentation, the reason for which the documentation is needed, and differences among the individuals performing the task. The starting point for the theory is an analysis of the structure of the knowledge required when a program is comprehended which views the knowledge as being organized into distinct domains which bridge between the original problem and the final program. The program comprehension process is one of reconstructing knowledge about these domains and the relationship among them. This reconstruction process is theorized to be a top-down, hypothesis driven one in which an initially vague and general hypothesis is refined and elaborated based on inf ormation extracted from the program text and other documentation.	computer program;list comprehension	Ruven E.

Borrowing its concept of design competence from Chomsky's definition of linguistic competence, the paper reviews biological evidence from fields including evolution, genetics, and animal behavior from the perspective of design research to propose that design competence is the product of an evolutionary history during which five key developments in cognitive evolution came together: conception unbounded by sensory perception, symbolic manipulation at a level of metarepresentation, theory of mind, curiosity, and mental time travel. These cognitive capabilities were derived from the biological evidence based upon the criteria that they are presumed to be unique to humans (Homo sapiens), they may be lost because of neurodegenerative diseases or they may fail to develop because of neurodevelopmental disorders, and they are not immediately present upon birth and develop as a child's brain matures. Based on these five capabilities, the paper concludes by discussing how computation may provide a useful way to understand the origins and evolution of design competence.

To ensure the project objectives are met, a project manager (PM) maintaining control of the project plays much important roles in complex projects where interaction may be limited to a web-based collaborative tool. In such limitations, he should more strongly help avoid cost overruns, shipment delays, but most importantly, product performance including product reliability. We utilize context-based reasoning (CxBR) for implementing such control measures as typically used by competent PMs. A rocket development project is used as the domain to evaluate our technique, using NASA¿s open software for rocket design. Through the experimental evaluation, the easiness of validation and refinement of Knowledge represented by CxBR is clarified. As well, this Knowledge representation is expected to be effective even for building a web-based complex and intelligent CSCW system where biological sensor fusions are included for situational assessment to aim at the further reliable collaboration support that can avoid such as misunderstanding, mishearing, etc.	collaborative software;computer-supported cooperative work;knowledge representation and reasoning;open-source software;refinement (computing);web application	Yoshitaka Sakurai;Avelino J.

These and other things that cause changes in objects over time are intuitively characterized as processes. To understand commonsense physical reasoning and make programs that interact with the physical world as well as people do we must understand qualitative reasoning about processes, when they will occur, their effects, and when they will stop. Qualitative process theory defines a simple notion of physical process that appears useful as a language in which to write dynamical theories. Reasoning about processes also motivates a new qualitative representation ]:or quantity in terms of inequalities, called the quantity space. This paper describes the basic concepts of qualitative process theory, several different kinds of reasoning that can be performed with them, and discusses its implications for causal reasoning. Several extended examples illustrate the utility of the theory, including figuring out that a boiler can blow up, that an oscillator with friction will eventually stop, and how to say that you can pull with a string, but not push with it. I . I n t r o d u c t i o n Many kinds of changes occur in physical situations. Objects move, collide, flow, bend, heat up, cool down, stretch, compress, and boil. These and the other things that cause changes in objects over time are intuitively characterized by processes. Much of formal physics consists of characterizations of processes by differential equations that describe how the parameters of objects change over time. But the notion of process is richer and more structured than this. We often reach conclusions about physical processes based on very little information. For example, we know that if we heat water in a sealed container the water can eventually boil, and if we continue to do so the container can explode. To understand commonsense physical reasoning we must understand how to reason qualitatively about processes, when they will occur, their effects, and when they will stop. This paper describes qual i ta t ive process theory, which I have been developing for this purpose.

25146c927645f69d2943efeae5d0db181c70dcf4	exploiting social reasoning to deal with agency level inconsistency		In a previous work [?], we presented the fundamental concepts of a social reasoning mechanism, which enables an agent to reason about the others using information about their goals, actions, resources and plans. In this paper we first place ourselves as an external observer to analyse the possible coupled outcomes of the social reasoning mechanisms of two different agents. We show that in some particular cases, different inferred dependence situations imply that the agents’ mutual representations are inconsistent at an agency level. Then, we detail our analysis in a particular case where the agents have the same plans (and believe in that), showing that some particular coupled outcomes can be explained either by incompleteness or incorrectness of mutual representation. In order to do that, we extend our previous model by introducing the notion of goal situation. Finally, we conclude by showing that these properties may be detected by the agents themselves if we supply them with an internal mechanism which enables them to manipulate the outcomes inferred both by their own social reasoning mechanism and by those of the others, whenever these latter are obtained by communication.	agent-based model;belief revision;correctness (computer science);intelligent agent;machine learning;multi-agent system;plasma cleaning;robot;traffic flow (computer networking)	Jaime Simão Sichman;Yves Demazeau	1995			observer (quantum physics);political science;knowledge management	AI	-21.193350147992177	-11.262348146347653	61186

Technical revolutions have also proved to be cultural revolutions. The skills required by one culture, the identification and creation of problems and the solutions are interrelated. These interrelationships are worked out in a cultural context endowed with its own experiences, knowledge and needs which define and make it different from other societies. The advanced technologies require new competences and new skills. This paper examines imaginary from two different viewpoints: (a) the imaginary aspect of body-mind relations, influenced by research into artificial intelligence and its prospects for the future; and (b) the roles and forms assumed by the imaginary in human-computer relations.	artificial intelligence;emoticon;experience;imaginary time	Mariella Combi	1992	AI & SOCIETY	10.1007/BF02472768	social environment;cognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;sociology;information technology;cultural diversity	AI	-25.919602039190888	-11.805014518023917	61306

Choice mechanisms include where to stop, in what order, and which overall route to take. In our network approach, the movement choice network is approximated using a lattice of irregular cells representing streets and shops. In this approach, cell centroids are considered the nodes of an implicit movement network. A pedestrian agent is located in a node and can move on the implicit movement network to other nodes and is situated randomly in the cell related to that node. In this paper, the focus is on the generation of the movement network and the underlying behavioral rules that conducts the activation of pedestrians on the network representing a shopping environment.	simulation	Jan Dijkstra;Joran Jessurun	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-11520-7_72	simulation	AI	-19.2273282672334	-22.18438673101421	61368

However, there is little consensus on what constitutes an ideal moral agent let alone an artificial one. Leveraging a recent account of heroism in humans, the aim of this paper is to provide a prospective framework for conceptualizing, and in turn designing ideal artificial moral agents, namely those that would be considered heroic robots. First, an overview of what it means to be an artificial moral agent is provided. Then, an overview of a recent account of heroism that seeks to define the construct as the dynamic and interactive integration of character strengths (e.g., bravery and integrity) and situational constraints that afford the opportunity for moral behavior (i.e., moral affordances). With this as a foundation, a discussion is provided for what it might mean for a robot to be an ideal moral agent by proposing a dynamic and interactive connectionist model of robotic heroism. Given the limited accounts of robots engaging in moral behavior, a case for extending robotic moral capacities beyond just being a moral agent to the level of heroism is supported by drawing from exemplar situations where robots demonstrate heroism in popular film and fiction.	connectionism;humans;machine ethics;prospective search;robot;social affordance	Travis J.

In this paper, we propose a meta-level representation of human behavior for interpretative, higher level applications in human-computer interaction systems called Directed Effort. A theoretical framework is described which is derived from behavioral and psychological sciences and which is designed to represent the commitment and interest of people towards objects via behavior analysis in real-life scenarios. Directed Effort, a score which allows the interpretation of detected behavior changes is introduced as a generic measurand. Furthermore, a prototypical implementation is documented to show the potential of the computed meta-level description of behavior.	human–computer interaction;iterative method;iterative refinement;microsoft outlook for mac;real life;refinement (computing)	Benedikt Gollan;Alois Ferscha	2014		10.5220/0004696500830090	simulation	AI	-20.086498386280926	-21.377592660776173	62667

On the other hand, in developing symbolic reasoning models, one usually emphasizes only declarative knowledge, ignoring procedural knowledge. In contrast, we have developed a learning model CLARION, which is a hybrid connectionist model consisting of both localist and distributed representations, based on the two-level approach proposed in [40]. CLARION learns and utilizes both procedural and declarative knowledge, tapping into the synergy of the two types of processes, and enables an agent to learn in situated contexts and generalize resulting knowledge to different scenarios. It unifies connectionist, reinforcement, and symbolic learning in a synergistic way, to perform on-line, bottom-up learning.

This is probably due to the demand of reaching ever more realistic behaviors on agent-based simulations which extends to several and diverse application fields. The present work proposes O3A: an Open Affective Agent Architecture, which extends a traditional BDI agent architecture improving a practical reasoning with more “human” characteristics. This architecture tries to address disperse definitions combining the main elements of supporting psychological and neurological theories.	agent architecture;agent-based model;open architecture;simulation;theory	Bexy Alfonso;Emilio Vivancos;Vicent J.

This paper shows that there is a logical problem with standard functionalist arguments for multiple realizability. These arguments rely essentially on Turing’s powerful insights regarding computation. In addressing a possible reply to this criticism, it is further argued that functionalism is not a useful approach for understanding what it is to have a mind. In particular, it is shown that the di culties involved in distinguishing implementation from function make multiple realizability claims untestable and uninformative . As a result, it is concluded that the role of Turing machines in philosophy of mind needs to be reconsidered.	cognition;computation;philosophy of mind;turing machine	Chris Eliasmith	2002	J. Exp.

03578f64149a8d38d68e36ddec30428eb0eda8fb	who needs time? implicit time is sufficient for some hri tasks	dynamical;word referent learning;neural network	We examine the temporal evolution of a neural-network model of word-referent co-learning engaged in an interactive learning task with a human teacher (Veale, Schermerhorn, and Scheutz in preparation). The observed naturallytimed interaction is used to argue that in at least some interesting interactive situations, explicit representation of or operation on time is not necessary. Observing that many interactive situations will be similar, we hypothesize that in fact most interactions will require no explicit representation or reasoning about time. Rather, natural timing of interaction falls out of dynamical properties of the coupled system involving the interactors’ brains, bodies, and the shared environment. A change in internal dynamics in one interactor may be caused by its own internal dynamics (e.g. getting bored) or by cues from the other interactor (e.g. a word uttered), or by a combination of both. This may cause cause him to produce cues affecting the other interactor, completing the dynamical loop. To contextualize our argument, we examine research showing that a variety of interesting (temporal) behaviors can be produced and explained by adopting a dynamical systems stance. None of the agents examined have any explicit representation or knowledge of time, yet still manage to engage in interesting temporally extended behaviors. We then present a more thorough analysis of the interaction in our experiments, investigating the internal dynamics of the robot model and the human interactor, how they produce what behaviors, and how all of this can be put together to build a convincing picture of the coupled interaction dynamics. We conclude that even in complex HRI interactions, explicit representation of time is not required to produce rich temporal dynamic interaction.	dynamical system;experiment;human–robot interaction;network model	Richard Veale;Matthias Scheutz	2010			computer science;dynamical system;machine learning;artificial neural network	AI	-22.88380475849958	-17.44703264393732	64091

It proposes model-based representations of attention for improved human-computer cooperation. In particular, the thesis proposes in theory and details in practice a computational framework for live capture and analysis of eye movement data in diagrammatic reasoning scenarios. The analysis includes an on-line generation of hypotheses about spatial mental representations currently held by human reasoners. The generated hypotheses may be employed to guide reactive and proactive behavior in semiautomated reasoning systems more (cognitively) adequately than previously possible, for example, in live human-computer collaboration or tutoring settings. Among other fields of application, the framework may be used to externally influence mental visuo-spatial reasoning in selective ways through administering specific patterns of sensory cues. Additionally, the presented theoretical and practical approaches may significantly contribute to the development of novel techniques and research methodologies aimed at better understanding human visuo-spatial reasoning and problem solving.	diagram;online and offline;proactive parallel suite;problem solving;spatial–temporal reasoning	Sven Bertel	2010				AI	-23.568799749535888	-16.03798134304711	64249

The knowledge-acquisition workshops that responded to this interest led to the formation of a vibrant research community that has achieved remarkable consensus on a number of issues. These viewpoints include (1) the rejection of the notion of knowledge as a commodity to be transferred from one locus to another, (2) an acceptance of the situated nature of human expertise, (3) emphasis on knowledge acquisition as the modeling of problem solving, and (4) the pursuit of reusable patterns in problem solving and in domain descriptions that can facilitate both modeling and system implementation. The Semantic Web community will benefit greatly by incorporating these perspectives in its work. & 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, cognitive agents employ knowledge about the spatial environment; they require suitable representations of this knowledge as well as approaches to make use of this knowledge for the specific tasks to be performed. In my talk, I will address three areas of research of the SFB/TR 8 Spatial Cognition: (1) the relation between spatial structures in the physical environment and representational structures in mental representations; (2) the relation between mental representations and external representations for reasoning, for communicating, and for assisting cognitive agents in understanding spatial situations; (3) the relation between spatial environments and their external representations in the light of mental concepts. For these three areas of research, I will describe concepts of qualitative spatial reasoning that we employ in the interaction between the different domains involved in spatial reasoning and spatial communication. About the speaker Prof. C. Freksa is a professor for informatics at Universität Bremen and head of the cognitive systems group (CoSy). My research interests focus on knowledge representation, specifically on the representation of spatial and temporal knowledge and on reasoning with qualitative, approximate, incomplete, imprecise, fuzzy, uncertain, and conflicting knowledge. In the CoSy research group we employ formal and computational approaches to knowledge representation, we design computer models of spatial environments for simulation studies, and we carry out autonomous robotic experiments in our spatial environment laboratory using diverse intelligent technologies. We closely cooperate with researchers from other disciplines interested in the investigation of spatial structures, especially cognitive psychology, linguistics, geography, and design. I coordinate the Transregional Collaborative Research Center Spatial Cognition Reasoning, Action, Interaction (SFB/TR8), a joint enterprise of the Universities of Bremen and Freiburg funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) and the International Quality Network on Spatial Cognition (IQN) funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).

Supreme Court justices pose hypothetical cases, often adapting precedents, to evaluate if a proposed rule for deciding a problem needs to be adapted. This paper describes a diagrammatic representation of adaptive reasoning with hypothetical cases based on a process model. Since the diagrams are interpretations of argument texts, there is no one “correct” diagram, and reliability could be a challenge. An experiment assessed the reliability of expert grading of diagrams prepared by students reconstructing examples of hypothetical reasoning. Preliminary results indicate significant areas of agreement, including with respect to the ways tests are modified in response to hypotheticals, but slight agreement as to the role and import of hypotheticals. These results suggest that the diagrammatic representation will support studying and modeling the examples of case-based adaptation, but that the diagramming support needs to make certain features more explicit.	computation;computational model;correctness (computer science);diagram;list of concept- and mind-mapping software;process modeling	Kevin D.

MCIs require rapid decisions to be taken by geographically-dispersed teams in an environment characterized by insufficient information, ineffective collaboration and inadequate resources. Despite the increasing adoption of decision support systems in healthcare, there is limited evidence of their value in large-scale disasters. We conducted focus groups with emergency medical services and emergency department personnel who revealed that one of the main challenges in emergency response during MCIs is information management. Therefore, to alleviate the issues arising from ineffective information management, we propose R-CAST-MED, an intelligent agent architecture built on Recognition-Primed Decision-making (RPD) and Shared Mental Models (SMMs). A simulation of R-CAST-MED showed that this tool enabled efficient information management by identifying relevant information, inferring missing information and sharing information with other agents, which led to effective collaboration and coordination of tasks across teams.	agent architecture;cast tool;debian-med;decision support system;focus group;information management;intelligent agent;medline;r-cast;simulation;type conversion	Shizhuo Zhu;Joanna Abraham;Sharoda A.

This research has been in the domain of cognitive psychology rather than artificial intelligence and it is important to begin by stressing that they are two somewhat separate areas with their own paradigmatic approaches. However, there exists a well-established tradition of cross-fertilization of ideas between the two areas. There are, in general, two ways in which this cross-fertilization can take place. One is to develop a model that operates as both a psychological theory and an AI model, the most prominent recent example being SOAR (Newell, in press). The second, which is far more common, is to make use of the ideas and techniques in one area to develop a theory in the other, resulting in a complementary evolution of parallel areas rather than the development of a homogeneous theory. The predominance of this latter approach stems from the fact that the demands made upon theories are quite different in the two areas. The primary test of a psychological theory lies in its relationship to empirical data. AI does not suffer from this constraint. On the other hand, AI models need to satisfy a requirement of precision of definition that tends to be impossible to achieve in psychological models except within highly delimited domains.	cognitive model	Vimla L.

Causality is, in general, formalized by using axiomatic approaches. Instead of using axiomatic methods, we, however, compose a model consisting of agents who have knowledge about causal relations among objects. The model society can reveal the transitive law through interactional dialogues among themselves. The agents are reciprocally influenced, if they have either completely same opinions, or a particular pattern of opinions, that are regarded as the extension of such exact accordance. In addition, we add some vagueness to the dialogue, which is closer to a real communication than the former model. A set of knowledge of each agent is expressed as a directed graph, hence the every model can be construed as mere transformations of directed graphs through the interactions among directed graphs themselves. Following this perspective, the models are the systems that connect local logic with global one, while the union of the directed graphs is regarded as the global.	causal filter;causality;directed graph;essence;graph - visual representation;interaction;physical object;vagueness;cell transformation	Koji Sawa;Yukio-Pegio Gunji	2007	Bio Systems	10.1016/j.biosystems.2007.04.001	directed graph;causality;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;algorithm	AI	-24.172362261547118	-10.622640233425349	65112

Depending on its context, a crowd can adopt different behaviors: it can be ambulant, aggressive, expressive or in an emergency situation, get into panic and flee. The main idea is to hold upon observations and assumptions made by crowd psychology studies in order to formulate a model up to reproduce as close as possible their behavior, depending on the context. To do so, we are considering the use of a microscopic model based on a scale concept: the Scale Based Model (SBM). This model is based on the psychological profile of the individuals to build crowds of different natures, crowds that will then have an influence on their own members. We will also bring up with the question of the model implementation in a real time environment.	cinema 4d;crowdsourcing;simulation;super bit mapping;virtual reality	Fabien Tschirhart	2013		10.1145/2466816.2466836	psychology;simulation;artificial intelligence;crowd simulation;social psychology	AI	-21.911807912157784	-20.425903515477216	65268

However, in the realm of Artificial Intelligence, it did not lead to an elaborate model of knowledge representation, beyond scripts and cases. In this paper, we attempt to go further by identifying three differentiating features of narratives that may inspire novel forms of knowledge representation: transformation, conflict and unactualized events. In particular, these three features open the way for knowledge representation formalisms that take greater account of the co-existence of intertwined conflicting representations, with various validities and validity domains, beyond a purely factual representation of the world. 1998 ACM Subject Classification I.2 Artificial Intelligence	artificial intelligence;knowledge representation and reasoning	Nicolas Szilas	2015		10.4230/OASIcs.CMN.2015.133	psychology;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;body of knowledge;social psychology	AI	-25.80969168944909	-13.47650889805367	65413

91d89bb21e626ffd11f38128b302702f05c226c5	computational intelligence applied to nonlinear dynamics and synchronization		In general, to efficiently deal with modeling of complex nonlinear dynamical systems three essential tasks amongst others are involved, namely understanding, predicting, and explaining. The understanding task aims at developing mathematical models of systems relying on available data, measurements and observations in a bottom-up fashion. This allows identifying the system’s dynamics including the external interactions that affect the system’s behavior. Such identification should specify the set of functions (rules or equations) that captures the factors that control the change of the system’s behavior. Often, the identification task is reduced to choosing a certain parameterized model for which an estimation of the unknown parameters is to be performed. Identification as a process may be part of a more general task that is control whose aim is to equip the system with regulation mechanisms that provide stability and the desired performance in presence of feedback and disturbances from the environment. There is no doubt that the identification and control tasks are typical computational tasks that involve various algorithmic paradigms.	computation;computational intelligence;dynamical system;interaction;mathematical model;nonlinear dynamics;programming paradigm;synchronization (computer science);top-down and bottom-up design	Abdelhamid Bouchachia;Kyandoghere Kyamakya	2009	Int.

a23d3e34c2ed39e70654c1e31526a3662c8452cc	constraint exploration and envelope of simulation trajectories	constraint logic programs;multi agent system	The implicit theory that a simulation represents is precisely not in the individual choices but rather in the ‘envelope’ of possible trajectories – what is important is the shape of the whole envelope. Typically a huge amount of computation is required when experimenting with factors bearing on the dynamics of a simulation to tease out what affects the shape of this envelope. In this paper we present a methodology ai med at systematically exploring this envelope. We propose a method for searching for ten dencies and proving their necessity relative to a range of parameterisations of the mod el and agents’ choices, and to the logic of the simulation language. The exploration consists of a forward chaining gene ration of the trajectories associated to and constrained by such a range of parameterisations and choices. Additionally, we propose a computational procedure that helps implement this exploration by translating a Multi Agent System simulation into a constraint-based search over possible trajectories by ‘compiling’ the simulation rules in to a more specific form, namely by partitioning the simulation rules using appropriate modularity in the simulation. An example of this procedure is exhibited.	artificial intelligence;computation;experiment;forward chaining;multi-agent system;simulation language	Oswaldo Terán;Bruce Edmonds;Steve Wallis	2000	CoRR		mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence	AI	-19.49342498549313	-17.31750720113062	66097

In particular, we define a simple model of cooperative ability, give a definition of rational plans, and show how an agent's intentions play a role in determining her next actions. This bridges the gap between intentions to achieve a goal and intentions to act. We also show that in the absence of interference, an agent that is able to achieve a goal, intends to do so, and is acting rationally will eventually achieve it.	agent-based model;formal language;formal specification;interference (communication);multi-agent system;rational agent;specification language;verification and validation	Shakil M.

9554be4a41aa22f1f04e4761ce564a3ac063e7e5	adaptive artificial intelligence in games: issues, requirements, and a solution through behavlets-based general player modelling		We present the third in a series of three academic essays which deal with the question of how and why to build a generalized player model. We begin with a proposition: a general model of players requires parameters for the subjective experience of play, including at least: player psychology, game structure, and actions of play. Based on this proposition, we pose three linked research questions, which make incomplete progress toward a generalised player model: RQ1 what is a necessary and sufficient foundation to a general player model?; RQ2 can such a foundation improve performance of a computational intelligencebased player model?; and RQ3 can such a player model improve efficacy of adaptive artificial intelligence in games? We set out the arguments behind these research questions in each of the three essays, presented as three preprints. The third essay, in this preprint, presents the argument that adaptive game artificial intelligence will be enhanced by a generalised player model. This is because games are inherently human artefacts which therefore, require some encoding of the human perspective in order to effectively autonomously respond to the individual player. The player model informs the necessary constraints on the adaptive artificial intelligence. A generalised player model is not only more efficient than a per-game solution, but also allows comparison between games which makes it a useful tool for studying play in general. We describe the concept and meaning of an adaptive game. We propose requirements for functional adaptive AI, arguing from first principles drawn from the games research literature. We propose solutions to these requirements, chiefly formal specification for a generalised player model. Finally, we propose a plan for future work to develop the formal model approach and integrate with our existing ’Behavlets’ method for psychologically-derived player modelling: Cowley, B., & Charles, D. (2016). Behavlets: a Method for Practical Player Modelling using Psychology-Based Player Traits and Domain Specific Features.

In order for information and communication technologies to be successfully applied to realize knowledge circulation, social aspects need to be considered so that the technologies can be properly embedded into the society. This issue has been addressed in social intelligence design, a field of research aiming at understanding and augmenting social intelligence based on a bilateral definition of social intelligence as an individual’s ability to better live in a social context and a group’s ability to collectively solve problems and learn from experiences.

This model relies on a model of negotiation that allows an agent to express behaviors of power through its strategy of negotiation. Based on the simulation theory, we adapted the decision model of the agent to reason about its interlocutor’s behavior. A preliminary evaluation in the context of agent-agent interaction shows that the system correctly predicts the interlocutor’s power.	computation;computational model;simulation	Lydia Ould Ouali;Nicolas Sabouret;Charles Rich	2018			machine learning;computer science;artificial intelligence;decision model;negotiation;simulated reality	AI	-22.8278073246698	-20.052347575549884	66416

The paper presents selected topics from Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Connectionism (Neural Network Modelling) and assesses the contribution of both disciplines to our understanding of the human mind and brain. Firstly three different ways of approaching the mind are discussed, that is, through inner experience (introspection), by means of objective scientific method, and by using artificial models. Two philosophical issues related to AI are treated, the logical limitation of formalized thought and the phenomenological limitation of external modelling. Connectionism is presented as a science of collective phenomena similar to those in physical systems. Its relationship to AI is exemplified by a theory of knowledge representation. The paper concludes with a description of Dennet's theory of consciousness.		Ivan M.

The issue of concern is the practice and criteria that will be appropriate to validation of different models. In order to address this concern, two modelling approaches are investigated in some detailed — one from each end of our metaphorical spectrum. Windrum et al. (2007) (http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/10/2/8.html) claimed strong similarities between agent based social simulation and conventional social science — specifically econometric — approaches to empirical modelling and on that basis considered how econometric validation techniques might be used in empirical social simulations more broadly. An alternative, the approach of the French school of 'companion modelling' associated with Bousquet, Barreteau, Le Page and others, engages stakeholders in the modelling and validation process. The conventional approach is constrained by prior theory and the French school approach by evidence. In this sense they are at opposite ends of the theory-evidence spectrum. The problems for validation identified by Windrum et al. are shown to be irrelevant to companion modelling which readily incorporates complexity due to realistically descriptive specifications of individual behaviour and social interaction. The result combines the precision of formal approaches with the richness of narrative scenarios. Companion modelling is therefore found to be practicable and to achieve what is claimed for it and this alone is a key difference from conventional social science including agent based computational economics.	agent-based model;agent-based social simulation;computational economics;relevance	Scott Moss	2008	J.

Proposed methodology is differentiated from other conventional agent-based defense M&S approaches in that; (i) it supports an intelligent hierarchical multi-agent architecture, (ii) it provides an efficient mechanism for analyzing the strategic and operational effectiveness of warfare environment between multiple platforms.

Here we take a more comprehensive approach in order to draw more general conclusions about robot mission reliability. The approach is based on a mission taxonomy coupled with detailed reliability analysis of each of the resultant mission classes. This paper describes initial work towards that goal.  In this paper we present the above-mentioned taxonomy, which divides planetary robotic missions into subgroups with common characteristics with respect to the time proportion of tasks involved in the missions. For a given mission class, we show how a mission designer can obtain the optimum robot configuration in terms of robot team size and component reliability that maximize mission success rate under a budget constraint.	planetary scanner;resultant;robot;rover (the prisoner)	David Asikin;John M.

319ffc742901dfb146ff1f46db0b48513bb60975	inserting the presence of mind into a philosophy of presence: a response to sheridan and mantovani and riva	presence bridge;divine presence;virtual reality;term presence;different reality;perceptual presence;j. j. gibson;physical reality;researchable theory;article detail	This article considers the following question: What is the best foundation for a theory of presence? After establishing criteria for a philosophy of presence, the article applies these criteria to a set of articles on the philosophy of presence by Sheridan (1999), Mantovani and Riva (1999), and others. Although we share common goals, it is suggested that these articles advance a philosophy of presence that may be ill suited to support theory and research on presence. Several arguments are advanced to support this judgment. J. J. Gibson's work may be misinterpreted to accommodate relativistic models of physical reality. By directly referencing Gibson's writings, especially his concepts of ecological invariants, the article details how Gibson's work could not be used to support cultural, relativistic, or engineering arguments about different realities, perceptual or otherwise, without significant modification of Gibson's work and violation of his apparent intent. Another source of problems for a philosophy of presence is traced. There appears to be a terminological and theoretical confusion about the difference between epistemology and ontology. This article proposes that ontological debates about divine presence represented by these authors may be inappropriate or sterile for three reasons: (1) although perceptual presence (that is, phenomenal states of distal attribution) and divine presence (that is, immanence of God) share the term presence, they are fundamentally different philosophical problems; (2) the concept of divine presence and Sheridan's associated estimation paradigm is framed at such a level of generality to be incapable of supporting specific, actionable, and researchable theories about perceptual presence; and (3) any theory about virtual reality, a technology with a misleading oxymoronic term, provides no more ontological insight into reality than does theory and research on any other communication medium such as photography, film, or sound recording. Finally, the article proposes a remedy. The philosophy of presence might be most fruitfully approached via the philosophy of mind. Specifically, it is suggested that presence opens the door to related problems in the science of human consciousness, notably the mind-body problem. The article also suggests that the problem of presence bridges the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of technology on the issue of mediated embodiment, that is, the fuzzy boundary between the body and technological extensions of the body.	consciousness;ecology;mind–body problem;ontology (information science);philosophy of mind;programming paradigm;theory;virtual reality	Frank Biocca	2001	Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments	10.1162/105474601753132722	computer science;artificial intelligence	HCI	-28.96106140300724	-12.6859067353061	66937

The framework addresses the challenges associated with conducting a task-oriented and real-time robot competition, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Virtual Robotics Challenge (VRC), designed to mimic reality. The core of the framework is the Gazebo simulator, a platform to simulate robots, objects, and environments, as well as the enhancements made for the VRC to maintain a high fidelity simulation using a high degree of freedom and multisensor robot. The other major component used is the CloudSim tool, designed to enhance the automation of robotics simulation using existing cloud technologies. The results from the VRC and a discussion are also detailed in this work. Note to Practitioners - Advances in robot simulation, cloud hosted infrastructure, and web technology have made it possible to accurately and efficiently simulate complex robots and environments on remote servers while providing realistic data streams for human-in-the-loop robot control. This paper presents the software and hardware frameworks established to facilitate cloud-hosted robot simulation, and addresses the challenges associated with conducting a task-oriented robot competition designed to mimic reality. The competition that spurred this innovation was the VRC, a precursor to the DARPA Robotics Challenge, in which teams from around the world utilized custom human-robot interfaces and control code to solve disaster response-related tasks in simulation. Winners of the VRC received both funding and access to Atlas, a humanoid robot developed by Boston Dynamics. The Gazebo simulator, an open source and high fidelity robot simulator, was improved upon to met the needs of the VRC competition. Additionally, CloudSim was created to act as an interface between users and the cloud-hosted simulations. As a result of this work, we have achieved automated deployment of cloud resources for robotic simulations, near real-time simulation performance, and simulation accuracy that closely mimics real hardware. These tools have been released under open source licenses and are freely available, and can be used to help reduce robot and algorithm design and development time, and increase robot software robustness.	algorithm design;cloud computing;cloudsim;darpa robotics challenge;humanoid robot;open-source license;open-source software;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;robot control;robot software;robustness (computer science);simulation;software deployment;software framework;transverse redundancy check	Carlos E.

At the same time, the technology itself is getting more complex, enabling devices to act in a way that previously only humans could, based on developments in the fields of both robotics and artificial intelligence. This results in a situation in which many autonomous, intelligent and context-aware systems are involved in decisions that affect their environment. These relations between people, machines, and decisions can take many different forms, but thus far, a systematic account of machine-assisted moral decisions is lacking. This paper investigates the concept of machine-assisted moral decisions from the perspective of technological mediation. It is argued that modern machines do not only have morality in the sense of mediating the actions of humans, but that, by making their own decisions within their relations with humans, mediate morality itself. A classification is proposed to differentiate between four different types of moral relations. The moral aspects within the decisions these systems make are combined into three dimensions that describe the distinct characteristics of different types of moral mediation by machines. Based on this classification, specific guidelines for moral behavior can be provided for these systems.	action selection;artificial intelligence;autonomous robot;computer;context-aware pervasive systems;cyborg;intentionality;interaction;interference (communication);mediation (statistics);observable;principle of abstraction;reconfigurability;requirement;robotics;service-orientation;value sensitive design	Marlies Van de Voort;Wolter Pieters;Luca Consoli	2015	Ethics and Information Technology	10.1007/s10676-015-9360-2	moral reasoning;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;sociology;moral disengagement;social psychology;ubiquitous computing;social cognitive theory of morality	AI	-23.754895252642505	-13.056345346499844	67077

A computational model of emotion is set up, inner motivation variable and outer stimuli variable can drive the trigger of a basic emotion, the quantitative relations among personality, motivation, and emotion are proposed.

Ross Ashby, this paper offers an account of one aspect of his work, information theory. It shows his motivation to embrace information theory, how he extended it, where it failed while fertilizing reconstructability analysis, and what it took for a solution to emerge. Based on Ashby‘s recognition of the material limits of computation, the paper continues his concern for transcomputational phenomena and proposes a paradigm shift to cope with what probably is one of the most complex system we face today, cyberspace. Replacing the epistemological stance of discovery with that of design, the paper discusses how the enormous information quantities of cyberspace implicate human agency, a concept necessary to explain the ecology of electronic artifacts that populate cyberspace. It suggests a new direction for constructing theories of complex systems involving their human constituents not recognized by Ashby but derivable from his ideas.	approximation algorithm;bremermann's limit;complex system;complex systems;computation;computational resource;cybernetics;cyberspace;ecology;electronic component;information theory;interaction;mainframe computer;mutation (genetic algorithm);population;programmer;programming paradigm;recursion;systems theory	Klaus Krippendorff	2009	Int.

For each such agent, in that context, two questions about trust are raised: Where an agent must access (or store) personal information, can one trust that artificial agent with that information and, where an agent does not need to either access or store personal information, can one trust that agent not to either access or store that information? It would be an infeasible task for any human being to explicitly determine, for each artificial agent, whether it can be trusted. That is, no human being has the computational resources to make such an explicit determination. There is a well-known class of problems in the artificial intelligence literature, known as frame problems, where explicit solutions to them are computationally infeasible. Human common sense reasoning solves frame problems, though the mechanisms employed are largely unknown. I will argue that the trust relation between two agents (human or artificial) functions, in some respects, is a frame problem solution. That is, a problem is solved without the need for a computationally infeasible explicit solution. This is an aspect of the trust relation that has remained unexplored in the literature. Moreover, there is a formal, iterative structure to agent-agent trust interactions that serves to establish the trust relation non-circularly, to reinforce it, and to “bootstrap” its strength.	artificial intelligence;commonsense reasoning;computational complexity theory;computational resource;frame language;frame problem;information privacy;intelligent agent;interaction;iterative method;personally identifiable information;routing	Jeff Buechner	2011	Information	10.3390/info2010195	frame problem;epistemology;express trust;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;machine learning;trustworthy computing;computer security;computational trust	AI	-20.2783340724093	-10.359650632867467	67543
47aaaa8dc7e81a29e3cd3e8d5103444b53941073	similarity in cognition: a review of similarity and analogical reasoning		The area of similarity and analogy has been of long-standing interest to cognitive scientists and AI researchers. However, recently, there seems to be a new wave of interest, as indicated by many papers, monographs, edited books, and doctoral theses, in exploring aspects of similarity and analogical reasoning from various perspectives. Amid these numerous publications, Similarity and Analogical Reasoning surely stands out as the most valuable reference work on the topic, covering especially well the recent advances in the understanding of this topic, with many chapters written by leading researchers. Although it is based on a collection of papers initially presented at the Workshop on Similarity and Analogy, unlike the typical workshop proceedings, this volume is well edited and coherent in both its content and format, with a great deal of cross-references and detailed summary-comment chapters for every part of the book. Let us look at the book in detail. Because each of these chapters has a different perspective, approach, and organization, I first discuss a number of chapters one by one. The first part of the book contains five chapters plus a commentary at the end. They mainly deal with the cepts. They proceed to explain a number of phenomena in human decision making, such as the conjunction fallacy, the base-rate effect, and causal effects of base rate. Their model is based on computing overall similarity between the properties of the concept representation and the properties of the observed objects, using the frame representation. This work represents a step toward a detailed cognitive model of similarity and its role in commonsense reasoning (as opposed to formal reasoning) and decision making. The next two chapters discuss the instability, or flexibility, in conceptual representations and its implication for similarity. Barsalou demonstrates this instability by introducing a number of experiments, which show that conceptual structures vary greatly. The experiments involve property generation and graded structures of concepts. The results show that graded structures vary widely across populations, vary within the same population, vary across contexts, and even vary in the same context with the same individual. In the experiments for property generation, the same kind of instability is observed. Barsalou identifies the source of instability: By some thought experiments and analysis of experimental results, he rules out most of the possible sources; what is left is some possibility involving contextual cues and accessibility. Based on this remaining possibility, he proposes a retrievalbased framework for conceptual representation in which the interplay of context, recent experience, and stable core information creates loosely organized clusters of conceptual knowledge. Barsalou divides this knowledge into context-independent information (CI), context-dependent information (CD), and recent context-dependent information (CDrec). This framework does provide a highly plausible explanation for the variability observed in the aforemenSimilarity in Cognition: A Review of Similarity and Analogical Reasoning	accessibility;base rate;bell test experiments;book;causality;cognition;cognitive model;cognitive science;coherence (physics);commonsense reasoning;context-sensitive language;cross-reference;experiment;heart rate variability;instability;population;reference work;semantic similarity	Ron Sun	1993	AI Magazine		cognitive science;artificial intelligence;cognition;computer science	AI	-27.685596341498158	-12.800563384425642	67544

It is closely related to the problems that motivated the birth of modern thermodynamics, but these problems were already present, in different forms, in the scientific and philosophical theories of the distant past. In this paper, I would like to show that one particular and very influential ancient scientific theory, Aristotle's physics, includes a solution to the problem of Heat Death implicitly, and that this solution can fruitfully be compared with the different solution offered by modern thermodynamics.

An important component of this system is the mechanism that will allow humans to interface with the objects. Menu Based Natural Language Interfaces ( MBNU) seem like a good candidate for this job because of the intuitive way in which they allow the user to build commands. However, the MBNLI system will have to scale with the number of objects in the system.

384067742a49ea44cd217fd840afecb5f1376b9c	special issue on swarm robotics	swarm robotics	Swarm robotics is a new approach to the coordination of multi-robot systems. In contrast with traditional multi-robot systems which use centralised or hierarchical control and communication systems in order to coordinate robots’ behaviours, swarm robotics adopts a decentralised approach in which the desired collective behaviours emerge from the local interactions between robots and their environment. Such emergent or self-organised collective behaviours are inspired by, and in some cases modelled on, the swarm intelligence observed in social insects. The potential for swarm robotics is considerable. Any task in which physically distributed objects need to be explored, surveyed, collected, harvested, rescued, or assembled into structures is a potential real-world application for swarm robotics. The key advantage of the swarm robotics approach is robustness, which manifests itself in a number of ways. Firstly, because a swarm of robots consists of a number of relatively simple and typically homogeneous robots, which are not pre-assigned to specific roles or tasks within the swarm, then the swarm can self-organise or dynamically re-organise the way individual robots are deployed. Secondly, and for the same reasons, the swarm approach is highly tolerant to the failure of individual robots. Thirdly, the fact that control is completely decentralised means that there is no common-mode failure point or vulnerability in the swarm. Indeed, it could be said that the high level of robustness evident in robotic swarms comes for free in the sense that it is intrinsic to the swarm robotics approach, which contrasts with the high engineering cost of fault tolerance in conventional robotic systems. The realisation of the potential of swarm robotics requires the solution of a number of very challenging problems. Firstly, in algorithm design: swarm roboticists face the problem of designing both the physical morphology and behaviours of the individual robots such that when those robots interact with each other and their environment, the desired overall collective behaviours will emerge. At present there are no principled approaches to the design of low-level behaviours for a given desired collective behaviour.

In this paper we propose a framework to incorporate an emotional model into the decision making process of a machine learning agent. We use a hierarchical structure to combine reinforcement learning with a dimensional emotional model. The dimensional model calculates two dimensions representing the actual affective state of the autonomous agent. For the evaluation of this combination, we use a reinforcement learning experiment (called Dyna Maze) in which, the agent has to find an optimal path through a maze. Our first results show that the agent is able to appraise the situation in terms of emotions and react according to them.	affective computing;algorithm;autonomous agent;autonomous robot;cognition;machine learning;reinforcement learning;shortest path problem;simulation	Johannes Feldmaier;Klaus Diepold	2014	The 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication	10.1109/ROMAN.2014.6926309	planning;robot;robot learning;error-driven learning;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;learning classifier system;computational model;reinforcement learning;active learning;hyper-heuristic	AI	-22.193165816863043	-19.249627983418407	68824

Sophisticated design and modeling tools support the development of individual agent models and their arrangement in organizational structures. However, only limited support is available to pre-estimate the qualitative, macroscopic system properties that rise from agent (inter-)action. Here, we propose a systemic modeling level that allows to describe the qualitative macroscopic dynamics of MAS by modeling the impact of exhibiting agent behaviors on parts of the agent population as well as environment elements. We discuss the systematic derivation of these models from established design models / notations and outline how these models can be used to anticipate the qualitative dynamics of MAS as well as to validate MAS implementations.	agent-based model;distributed computing	Jan Sudeikat;Wolfgang Renz	2009		10.1145/1558109.1558291	simulation;computer science;system dynamics	AI	-19.508895874687767	-16.151567598366558	69009

This annual competition started in 2006 and it has been celebrated during the last eight editions. Aimed at initiate graduate and master’s students in humanoid robotics, they have to program the sensor and motor skills of little humanoids built by themselves, or tune up a commercial kit. The challenge is to obtain the best platform able to complete a set of trials that are reviewed and renewed each year. In this paper, a review of similar contests, objectives and results will be discussed. A brief review of platforms and trials evolution will also allow presenting some key ideas for the promotion and future assurance of this initiative. Furthermore, a brief review of some didactic approaches experienced, and some insights about the future of this and similar contests that use robotic platforms to face similar goals will be presented.	humanoid robot;robotics;trials evolution	Alberto Jardón Huete;Félix Rodríguez;Juan G.

Our aim is to develop a reasoning model for artificial actors in such systems. Starting point is the relation between autonomy of individuals and coordination of group behavior. We adopt the agent paradigm as basis for the actors. Although autonomy is a key concept in agent research, there is no common definition of agent autonomy and adjustable autonomy. Our agents should be autonomous such that they can be held responsible for their actions. Furthermore, they should be able to work together following different types of coordination in order to achieve dynamic coordination. In this research, we define being autonomous as having control over external influences on the decision-making process. Adjustable autonomy in our context means dynamically dealing with external influences on the decision-making process based on internal motivations. An agent controls to what extend it is being influenced by the environment and by other agents. Agents achieve coordination by allowing influences of others on their decision-making process. We present an abstract reasoning model that facilitates agent autonomy. The two main components of the reasoning model are influence control and decision-making. In the component for influence control the agent deals with new observations and messages. We propose to use reasoning rules to process those external events. The reasoning rules specify the effects of external events on the beliefs and goals of the agent. The beliefs and goals, then, are used for the decision-making process. With this reasoning model we do a simulation experiment of a firefighter organization extinguishing several fires. The organizational goal can be reached via different types of coordination ranging from emergent to centralized coordination. The experiment shows that the perspective on autonomy as influence control provides a promising way to facilitate dynamic coordination. Our reasoning model separates event-processing and decision-making. This allows the development of domain-independent heuristics for event-processing. In this thesis we mention three heuristics: information relevance, organizational knowledge and trust. The first two are discussed in further detail. We propose an algorithm for relevance determination. We argue that potential benefits of using information relevance for influence control can be found in controling the decision quality and preventing information overload. Furthermore, we work out the use of organizational knowledge to process external events. We show how organizational norms can be translated into event-processing rules. We describe how our approach facilitates organizational dynamics. The modularity in our reasoning model ensures that the event-processing rules are explicitly defined. This allows for metareasoning about the event-processing rules. We present a metareasoning model, with which the agent can select and take up the desired attitude with respect to the environment and to other agents. This process gives the agent control over external influences, and therewith it meets the requirements for autonomy and adjustable autonomy. In a simulation experiment we implement a firefighter organization that exhibits dynamic coordination via self-adjustable autonomy of the firefighters.	autonomy	Bob van der Vecht	2009			engineering;knowledge management;management science;social psychology	AI	-21.736535782725262	-12.537456544560952	69181

It is generic according to two main axes. First, it can be instantiated to cover various types of inferences usually considered relevant in science, second, and more important here, it allows for the modeling of the social dimension of scientific activity. After motivating this drive for genericity by looking at some results from philosophy of science, the paper presents the bases of the framework and its central reliance on the notion of consistency, both at the individual and group levels. It then instantiates the social dimension of the framework by proposing an actor-critic model of scientific interaction. The ideas proposed are illustrated with examples of hypothesis formation in medicine.	abductive reasoning;generic programming;reinforcement learning	Gauvain Bourgne;Vincent Corruble	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-88411-8_18	philosophy of science;applied mathematics;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;mathematics;management science	AI	-23.391370161276534	-13.535461786518074	69233

The approach is based on past research results and current efforts in three different areas including: computational vision, evolutionary computation, and text analysis. Following their description, an integrative paradigm for the development of a distributed system is suggested and described. While motivated by a particular scenario, this work contains generic elements that might prove valuable for the creation of future mediated systems at-large.	artificial intelligence;computer vision;distributed computing;evolutionary computation;programming paradigm;ubiquitous computing	Amiram Moshaiov	2005		10.1145/1085313.1085328	web mining;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;computer-supported cooperative work;world wide web	AI	-32.35145506062625	-17.90654095294164	69252

Implicit knowledge describes the things that an agent could infer from what is known, if the agent were aware of the necessary concepts. Reasoning techniques that are robust to incomplete awareness are important when considering interactions of automated agents in complex dynamic environments, such as the semantic web. Here we revisit Hector Levesque’s original motivation of implicit knowledge and consider several contemporary realizations of implicit knowledge. We present a framework to compare different interactions of knowledge and awareness in the context of public announcements, and introduce a new formalism for tacit knowledge.	automated reasoning;dynamic epistemic logic;epistemic modal logic;hector levesque;interaction;knowledge management;qualitative comparative analysis;secure communication;semantic web;semantics (computer science)	Hans van Ditmarsch;Tim French	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-25832-9_74	computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;procedural knowledge;social psychology	AI	-21.4258851703422	-10.915127882381217	69338

The argumentation language helps in representing the structure of the negotiation process and provides a normative argumentative evaluation methodology to represent and capture the roles played by the different participants in the negotiation process. The design of a prototype negotiation support system is described along with its intended use. (Kersten et al 1991) and Persuader (Sycara 1991) which provide formalisms to explicitly represent goals, rules, and relationships using restructurable modelling representations. Restructurable modelling uses rule-based formalism to build consecutive representations of a negotiation problem and thus captures changes created by exogenous decisions and actions of dynamic agents. In this paper, we discuss the design and development of an argumentationbased negotiation framework which lies in the middle of the spectrum and thus shares the advantages of the above formal and informal systems.	katia sycara;logic programming;prototype;semantics (computer science)	Ai-Mei Chang;Taedong Han	1995		10.1109/HICSS.1995.375725	process design;game theory;systems analysis;decision support system;decision theory;negotiation theory;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;management science;logic	AI	-22.4049907731283	-10.341684490386086	69357

These properties will endow the agent with the deep semantics required to pass the test. An embodied agent functioning over a wide range of domains is needed to be exposed to and learn the semantics of those domains. Following human cognitive and neural functioning simplifies the search for sufficiently sophisticated mechanisms by reusing mechanisms that are already known to be sufficient. This is a difficult task, but initial steps have been taken, including the development of CABots, neural agents embodied in virtual environments. Several different CABots run in response to natural language commands, performing a cognitive mapping task. These initial agents are quite some distance from passing the test, and to develop an agent that passes will require broad collaboration. Several next steps are proposed, and these could be integrated using, for instance, the Platforms from the Human Brain Project as a foundation for this collaboration.	artificial intelligence;automated planning and scheduling;behavior;cdisc adas-cog - commands summary score;cognition;cognition disorders;cognitive map;cognitive model;embodied agent;experiment;frame problem;human brain project;natural language user interface;neurorobotics;reuse (action);seventy nine;situated;turing test;virtual reality	Christian R.

It first introduces the concept of the ultra-tactical as an additional realm of operations in the traditional strategic-operational-tactical framework. The context of this realm is compared to human cognitive processes as well as machine processes used to aid human decision making. Potential biases intrinsic in both processes are identified and evaluated. Factors that contribute to the complexity of cyberspace environment in ultra-tactical time scales are reviewed and the potential impact of emergent events on automated decision making protocols are examined. Futuring methodologies are used to develop feasible operational scenarios which are in turn used to evaluate the benefits and risks inherent in implementing automated responses that operate without human cognitive interaction. Specific focus of the analysis includes determining if automated responses will be robust enough to accommodate the dynamic nature of cyberspace and if they can differentiate adversarial threats from natural emergent behavior.	cognition;cognitive science;complexity;cyberspace;emergence;emergent gameplay;futures and promises;interaction	Jeffrey L.

It enables an agent to abstract useful knowledge learned from its past experience. Based on an extension of fusion adaptive resonance theory network, this paper presents a novel self-organizing memory model to represent and learn various types of semantic knowledge in a unified manner. The proposed model, called fusion adaptive resonance theory for multimemory learning, incorporates a set of neural processes, through which it may transfer knowledge and cooperate with other long-term memory systems, including episodic memory and procedural memory. Specifically, we present a generic learning process, under which various types of semantic knowledge can be consolidated and transferred from the specific experience encoded in episodic memory. We also identify and formalize two forms of memory interactions between semantic memory and procedural memory, through which more effective decision making can be achieved. We present experimental studies, wherein the proposed model is used to encode various types of semantic knowledge in different domains, including a first-person shooting game called Unreal Tournament, the Toads and Frogs puzzle, and a strategic game known as StarCraft Broodwar. Our experiments show that the proposed knowledge transfer process from episodic memory to semantic memory is able to extract useful knowledge to enhance the performance of decision making. In addition, cooperative interaction between semantic knowledge and procedural skills can lead to a significant improvement in both learning efficiency and performance of the learning agents.	15 puzzle;adaptive resonance theory;algorithm;artificial neural network;encode;experiment;interaction;organizing (structure);real life;self-organization;semiconductor consolidation;starcraft;starcraft: brood war;unreal tournament	Wenwen Wang;Ah-Hwee Tan;Loo-Nin Teow	2017	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems	10.1109/TSMC.2016.2531683	memory model;machine learning;adaptive resonance theory;semantic memory;natural language processing;semantics;procedural memory;context model;computer science;episodic memory;knowledge transfer;artificial intelligence	AI	-22.95361471141607	-18.01116995649009	69474

In order to coordinate their behaviour, the agents should be able to interact with each other. Social commitments have been used in recent years as an answer to the challenges of enabling heterogeneous agents to communicate and interact successfully. However, coordinating agents only by means of interaction models is difficult in open multi-agent systems, where possibly malevolent agents can enter at any time and violate the interaction rules. Agent organizations, institutions and normative systems have been used to control the way agents interact and behave. In this paper we try to bring together the two models of coordinating agents: commitment-based interaction and organizations. To this aim we describe how one can use social commitments to represent the expected behaviour of an agent playing a role in an organization. We thus make a first step towards a unified model of coordination in multi-agent systems: a definition of the expected behaviour of an agent using social commitments in both organizational and non-organizational contexts.	autonomous robot;interaction design;multi-agent system;task analysis environment modeling simulation;unified model	Cosmin Carabelea;Olivier Boissier	2006	Electr.

This problem, known as difficult, is more complex when the considered environment is not fully under sensory coverage. Classical approaches either focus on location estimation or attempt to build the relationship between possible activities in the environment and reason on it, which may turn out to be inadequate. In this paper, we propose an approach based on behavioral models from the situated artificial intelligence field, which aim to realistically reproduce human behaviors within complex environments. We focus on the special case of a single target and experimentally show that we are performing well even in case of long periods of occlusion.	artificial intelligence;artificial intelligence, situated approach;experiment;hidden surface determination;simulation	Arsène Fansi Tchango;Vincent Thomas;Olivier Buffet;Fabien Flacher;Alain Dutech	2014			computer vision;simulation;particle filter;computer science	AI	-20.733779073799024	-20.701345002250505	70543

298ad2cb17ec08267744c5fc75f0e00936fb8998	exploring feedback and endogeneity in agent-based models	system theory;multi agent systems	Agent-based modeling is an approach used to describe systems composed of autonomous, independent, interactive, and potentially adaptive agents. Although agent-based models (ABMs) often include endogenous relationships that exist in agent-level interactions, such relationships are seldom salient when the structural elements of the models are analyzed and communicated. There are close relationships between agent-based modeling and other systems modeling techniques, such as the system dynamics approach. In system dynamics, feedback effects among major model components that can rapidly take systems far from equilibrium states are central to the modeling approach. In this paper we distinguish between structural endogeneity and behavioral endogeneity in models and derive an explicit representation of feedback and endogeneity in agent models---agent feedback diagrams. Finally, we describe a way that endogeneity and feedback may be highlighted in agent-based modeling and simulation.	agent-based model;autonomous robot;diagram;endogeneity (econometrics);feedback;interaction;simulation;system dynamics;systems modeling	Ignacio J.

Its aim is to illustrate how a developmental system, based on a truly indirect mapping from a modular genotype to a modular phenotype, can facilitate the generation of variations, thus structural innovation."""	artificial development;compaq evo;complex adaptive system;heart rate variability;multi-agent system;pattern formation;programming paradigm;self-organization;simulation;swarm intelligence;swarm robotics	René Doursat	2009		10.1145/1569901.1569996	complex systems;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;systems design	AI	-20.318890687832454	-17.01418824751407	70924
00b7111d7670568ccf422e45ef9661322d90f242	towards collaborative and adversarial learning: a case study in robotic soccer	learning scenario;multiagent learning;robot soccer	Soccer is a rich domain for the study of multiagent learning issues. Not only must the players learn low-level skills, but they must also learn to work together and to adapt to the behaviors of different opponents. We are using a robotic soccer system to study these different types of multiagent learning: low-level skills, collaborative, and adversarial. Here we describe in detail our experimental framework. We present a learned, robust, low-level behavior that is necessitated by the multiagent nature of the domain, namely shooting a moving ball. We then discuss the issues that arise as we extend the learning scenario to require collaborative and adversarial learning.	agent-based model;high- and low-level;robot	Peter Stone;Manuela M.

We adopt a dynamical systems approach to outline how different social and cognitive processes operates simultaneously as talk unfolds along different nested time-scales, which interact in complex, nonlinear ways to shape ''metaphor performance''. Adopting a dynamic systems approach demonstrates how elements of metaphor performance that have been previously thought of as fixed or static are re-interpreted as potential emergent stabilities in the dynamical systems. This approach is applied to the analysis of a single conversation between two participants to get an overall impression of the interaction between these various forces when metaphor is produced and understood and to illustrate the stability and variability in metaphor performance.

d1ab94889819113dfd9618847cd81c49e1ff0aa4	a coalition-based communication framework for intelligent flying ad-hoc networks		In this paper, we develop the intelligent networking framework for Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs), where a coalition-based model is designed. Firstly, we present a brief survey to show the state-of-the art studies on the intracommunication of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms. The features and deficiencies of existing models are analyzed. To capture the task-driven requirement of the flying multi-agent system, a coalition-based framework is proposed. We discuss the composition, networking mode and the classification of data transmission. After that, the application scenario of UAV coalitions is given, where large-scale, distributed and highly dynamic characteristics greatly increase the difficulty of resource optimization for UAVs. To tackle the problem, we design an artificial intelligence-based optimization architecture, which mainly includes the game model, machine learning and the real-time decision. Under the guidance of game theories and machine learning, UAVs can make comprehensive decisions by combining the previous training results with their own sensing, information interaction and game strategies. Finally, a preliminary case and promising open issues of UAV coalitions are studied.	aerial photography;artificial intelligence;game theory;hoc (programming language);machine learning;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;numerous;real-time locating system;unmanned aerial vehicle	Dianxiong Liu;Jin Wang;Yuhua Xu;Lang Ruan;Yuli Zhang	2018	CoRR			AI	-28.57218749224852	-21.945886594018063	71467
7abbdd35d650770564f856ad57491e3131de5475	a preliminary auditory subsystem based on a growing functional modules controller		In the present paper, a learning based controller that per- forms as an auditory subsystem is described. Based on the Growing Func- tional Modules (GFM) paradigm, the auditory subsystem is the result of the interconnection of four kinds of components: Global Goals, Acting Modules, Sensations and Sensing Modules. The resulting controller is radically different from conventional speech recognition due to its ability to gradually learn in context a set of vocal commands while perform- ing in a virtual environment. Recognition is considered as satisfactory when the robot's behavior is in accordance with the commands' mean- ing. This learning process may be compared to how a dog learns to obey its master's orders. The experiment described in this paper illustrates the design process of a GFM controller. It exhibits the behavior of the control process and principally, exposes the inherent philosophy of the GFM approach.

Emotion of animals has an important role in their social interactions. We attempt to incorporate emotion into decision making of robots. To make a social decision making, the DRE combines a decision based on intrinsic fear emotion with a strategic decision obtained by reinforcement learning. Agents with the DRE learn state values by reinforcement learning and learn emotion values by fear emotion learning. In simulation experiments, the effectiveness of the DRE is verified concerning the emergence of social behaviors and the adaptability to an environmental change through an unmoving target search problem.	emergence;experiment;interaction;reinforcement learning;robot;search problem;simulation	Atsushi Matsuda;Hideaki Misawa;Keiichi Horio	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)	10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007506	robot learning;error-driven learning;emotion;environmental change;social behavior;computer science;artificial intelligence;reinforcement learning	Robotics	-21.906059415372116	-18.812155231597558	72110
7ad943155c2d5cb5ae306504985420841ed1e8a9	edumorse: an open-source framework for mobile robotics education		The increasing spreading of robotics applications requires the formation of more and more experts with knowledge in core aspects of robotics systems. This paper introduces eduMorse, a novel framework for the education in the scope of mobile robotics. The framework addresses the accurate simulation of singleand multi-robot systems, with special focus on the possibility to implement path planning, navigation and control strategies, to handle sensors and actuators, and the communication among robots, thus allowing for the simulation of multi-robot coordination strategies. eduMorse leverages open-source tools to build a modular client-server framework for the simulation of mobile robots, with the aim of a simple setup of the simulation as a primary goal. The paper describes the components of eduMorse and its architecture. An example of application is also presented to show the effectiveness of the robotics simulation and the usage workflow of the system.	as-interface;client–server model;mobile robot;motion planning;open-source software;performance;robotics;server (computing);simulation	Daniele De Martini;Andrea Bonandin;Tullio Facchinetti	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-62875-2_26	educational robotics;computer engineering;motion planning;mobile robot;architecture;robot;modular design;workflow;robotics;computer science;artificial intelligence	Robotics	-25.89190613236907	-20.714014717216916	72203

The complexity of the problem increases proportionally with the number of agents, due to the fact that all robots must act in cooperation to complete the task. The proposed model employs a combination of different natural swarm behavior techniques to control a team of robots. It was named robot probabilistic cellular automata ant memory (RPCAAM). Our inspiration came from the possibility to mimic the cognitive behaviors of foraging ants with those of pedestrians in a building evacuation. The proposed probabilistic homing can avoid inertial behavior near the nests, which improves team performance. Furthermore, some investigations into robot-robot and robot-obstacles conflicts were improved to make the model more adequate to real-world applications. The probabilistic model was contrasted with deterministic homing. Moreover, the proposed method was implemented in a robotics simulation environment called Webots. Simulation results indicate that foraging tasks could be implemented with low complexity in low-cost architectures.	automata theory;memory model (programming);missile guidance;multiple homing;robot;robotics;simulation;statistical model;stochastic cellular automaton;swarm	Danielli A.

Continuous economic growth brings a traffic volume increase and implies a gradual saturation of road and motorway networks. Managing motorways is today a complex task, especially during a time of crisis (traffic jam, accident). Our aim is to design a system for risk management on motorways. Risk management is a very important endeavour today and many people work on this subject [Adams 95], [Beek 92]. In our system, risk management provides tools to help managers to anticipate potential accidents so as to avoid them or, otherwise to reduce accident consequences. In addition, the system must be able to give fit information to initiate preventive actions and then to follow them in real-time. Such a system requires much information in real-time. Information must be acquired and then sent to the various motorway departments to be processed. It is necessary to have a complex real-time architecture based on sensors and communication technology to link motorways with the management stations. The proposed global system for risk management on motorways is presented in this paper. Real-time information composition and use particulars are presented. Details on processing can be found in [Tanzi 97b]. An industrial prototype has been realised and for the motorway network of the south of France.	information system;real-time data;risk management	Tullio Tanzi;Sylvie Servigne;Régis Guiol	1998		10.1007/BFb0054233	network management;information and communications technology;real-time data;risk management;computer science;artificial intelligence;knowledge engineering;systemic risk;information system;incident management	DB	-19.938122601680035	-23.24125462461374	72387
03a9dc7ae7488cae51ade4b0957db55de54bd1a6	imitation learning as cause-effect reasoning		We propose a framework for general-purpose imitation learning centered on cause-effect reasoning. Our approach infers a hierarchical representation of a demonstrator’s intentions, which can explain why they acted as they did. This enables rapid generalization of the observed actions to new situations. We employ a novel causal inference algorithm with formal guarantees and connections to automated planning. Our approach is implemented and validated empirically using a physical robot, which successfully generalizes skills involving bimanual manipulation of composite objects in 3D. These results suggest that cause-effect reasoning is an effective unifying principle for cognitive-level imitation learning.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;causal filter;causal inference;general-purpose markup language	Garrett E.

Some attempts have already been made both in the statistical and machine learning communities to address some of the issues. In this paper we give a state of the art from the available literature in this area. We argue that a lot of further research is still needed, outline the directions that such research should go and describe the expected results. We argue also that most of the problems in this area can be solved only by interaction between the researchers of both the statistical and ML-communities.	belief revision	Charles Taylor;Gholamreza Nakhaeizadeh	1997		10.1007/3-540-62858-4_99	computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning	ML	-27.068784546597588	-11.220833999992717	72709

Most of credibility evaluation methods measure the credibility by analyzing gap between simulation results and actual results, but the actual results of combat cannot be predicted. The paper brings forward a credibility evaluation method based on event logic analysis, using the same form of event logical graph models to describe the combat process in simulation and theory. According to the merger thoughts, the paper also gives a strategy of contrast between the two event logic models, which can measure the flow rationality of simulation models by analyzing the event coverage degree and process matching degree between simulation logic models and theoretic logical models.	cognition;rationality;simulation;theory	Ming Sun;Hui-xian Tao	2012	2012 ACM/IEEE/SCS 26th Workshop on Principles of Advanced and Distributed Simulation	10.1109/PADS.2012.36	data modeling;simulation;concurrent computing;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;evaluation;machine learning;mathematical model;distributed computing;computational model;logic	AI	-23.01970146040877	-10.231060534221617	72805

In both cases, they require: (i) processes to acquire information; (ii) structures to model and store information as usable knowledge; (iii) reasoning systems to interpret the information; and (iv) finally, ways to express their interpretations. The H5W (How, Why, What, Where, When, Who) framework is a conceptualization of the problems faced by any agent situated in a social environment, which has defined several robotic studies. We introduce the H5W framework, through a description of its underlying neuroscience and the psychological considerations it embodies, we then demonstrate a specific implementation of the framework. We will focus on the motivation and implication of the pragmatic decisions we have taken. We report the numerous studies that have relied upon this technical implementation as a proof of its robustness and polyvalence; moreover, we conduct an additional validation of its applicability to the natural language domain by designing an information exchange task as a benchmark.	benchmark (computing);conceptualization (information science);entity;information exchange;intelligent agent;interaction;natural language;parsing;reasoning system;robot;situated	Stéphane Lallée;Paul F.

Several reasoning methods which the proposed representation permits are explained.

In general, all kinds of multi-agent groups require coordination for their effort and it seems that stigmergy is a very powerful means to coordinate activity over great spans of time and space in a wide variety of systems. In a situation in which many individuals contribute to a collective effort, such as building a nest, stimuli provided by the emerging structure itself can provide a rich source of information for the working insects. The current article provides a detailed review of this stigmergic paradigm in the building behavior of paper wasps to show how stigmergy influenced the understanding of mechanisms and evolution of a particular biological system. The most important feature to understand is how local stimuli are organized in space and time to ensure the emergence of a coherent adaptive structure and to explain how workers could act independently yet respond to stimuli provided through the common medium of the environment of the colony.	biological system;coherence (physics);distributed control system;emergence;eusociality;gene regulatory network;information source;multi-agent system;numerous;precipitating factors;programming paradigm;stigmergy;wasps	István Karsai	1999	Artificial Life	10.1162/106454699568719	biology;simulation;information flow;decentralised system;computer science;artificial intelligence;pattern formation;ecology;genetics	AI	-19.143798728098517	-16.540526481206406	72913

We present a neural framework using which explorative sensorimotor experiences of cognitive robots can be efficiently ‘internalized’ using growing sensorimotor maps and planning realized using goal induced quasi-stationary value in a slightly modified world), the robot will have to try and realize its goal by exploration after which reward/penalty is given at the end. This paper proposes three simple rules for distribution of the received end reward among the contributing neurons in a high dimensional sensorimotor map. Importantly, reward/penalty distribution over hundreds of neurons in the sensorimotor map is computed one shot. This resulting reward distribution can be visualized as an additional value field, representing the new learnt experience and can be combined with other such fields in a context dependent fashion to plan/compose novel emergent behavior. The simplicity and efficiency of the approach is illustrated through the resulting behaviors of the GNOSYS robot in two different scenarios (a) learning ‘when’ to optimize ‘what constraint’ while realizing spatial goals and (b) learning to push a ball intelligently to the corners of a table, while avoiding traps randomly placed by the teacher (this scenario replicates the famous trap tube paradigm from animal reasoning carried out on chimpanzees, capuchins and infants). & 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Much of the relevant work has concentrated on new methods for modeling and simulation, such as qualitative physics, or on sophisticated natural language generation, in which the device models are specially crafted for explanatory purposes . We show how two techniques from the modeling research-compositional modeling and causal ordering-can be effectively combined to generate natural language explanations of device behavior from engineering models. The explanations offer three advances over the data displays produced by conventional simulation software: (1) causal interpretations of the data, (2) summaries at appropriate levels of abstraction (physical mechanisms and component operating modes), and (3) query-driven, natural language summaries . Furthermore, combining the compositional modeling and causal ordering techniques allows models that are more scalable and less brittle than models designed solely for explanation . However, these techniques produce models with detail that can be distracting in explanations and would be removed in hand-crafted models (e .g ., intermediate variables) . We present domain-independent filtering and aggregation techniques that overcome these problems . 1 . Introduction Generating Explanations of Device Behavior Using Compositional Modeling and Causal Ordering This paper presents a method for generating explanations of device behavior characterized by systems of mathematical constraints over continuous-valued quantities . Such models are widely used in engineering for dynamical systems, such as electromechanical and thermodynamic control systems . Given such a model and initial conditions, conventional simulation software can predict and plot the values of these quantities over time . However, the data can be difficult to interpret because conventional simulators do not explain how the predicted behavior arises from the structure of the modeled system and physical laws . What we call explanations are presentations of information about the modeled system that satisfy three requirements . First, an explanation offers a meaningful interpretation of the simulation data, explaining how and why and not just what happened .

Synchronization between neuron groups in different structures of the mirror neuron system are in the basis of the interaction behaviour. The robotics experimental setting is used to illustrate the method.

The emergence of the intelligent decision making technology provides a good decision support to deal with these complex decision making problems, and soft computing plays a core role in the intelligent decision making technology. In recent years, intelligent decision support systems based on soft computing have attracted the attention of both, academic researchers and practitioners in a wide range of disparate areas from computing science, engineering, operations research, economics and also management. Intelligent decision support systems based on soft computing are of great importance to deal with complex decision environments, and involve the design of mathematical models for modeling decision problems, the use of different information technologies (such as the Web and social networks) and artificial intelligence tools (such as computational intelligence tools).	artificial intelligence;computational intelligence;computer science;decision problem;emergence;intelligent decision support system;mathematical model;operations research;social network;soft computing;world wide web	Enrique Herrera-Viedma;Francisco Chiclana;Yucheng Dong;Francisco Javier Cabrerizo	2018	Appl.

4a47da35cd02ecbce1dd3ceb9e6b25359303285c	formalizing psychological knowledge in answer set programming	answer set programming;psychology;knowledge representation	In the field of psychology, a considerable amount of knowledge is expressed using only natural language, which complicates accurate studies and comparisons. We believe that Answer Set Programming (ASP) can be used successfully for the formalization of psychological knowledge. To demonstrate the viability of ASP for this task, in this paper we develop an ASP-based formalization of the mechanics of Short-Term Memory, and show how it correctly reproduces the observed behavior of human subjects.	answer set programming;long short-term memory;natural language;stable model semantics	Marcello Balduccini;Sara Girotto	2010			knowledge representation and reasoning;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;answer set programming;algorithm	AI	-24.052475718408232	-14.03171328761427	73377

We endow agent driver with an ego-centered representation of the environment. This representation permits the agent to take a decision in terms of space occupation. Our agent driver model is based on the concept of affordances the ways in which an agent can interact with its environment. First, we use the concept of affordances to identify the possible actions, in terms of space occupation, afforded by the environment. Second, we use an ego-centered representation of the situation around the agent, composed by the identified affordances. The proposed driver model was implemented with ArchiSim and the experiments show that this model makes traffic more fluid.	experiment;multi-agent system;simulation;user-centered design	Feirouz Ksontini;Zahia Guessoum;René Mandiau;Stéphane Espié	2013			simulation;computer science;affordance;multimedia	AI	-19.739849552947213	-22.054781836118938	73919
014782be8ccd40118e88520b97e492105a547254	learning language games through interaction		We introduce a new language learning setting relevant to building adaptive natural language interfaces. It is inspired by Wittgenstein’s language games: a human wishes to accomplish some task (e.g., achieving a certain configuration of blocks), but can only communicate with a computer, who performs the actual actions (e.g., removing all red blocks). The computer initially knows nothing about language and therefore must learn it from scratch through interaction, while the human adapts to the computer’s capabilities. We created a game called SHRDLURN in a blocks world and collected interactions from 100 people playing it. First, we analyze the humans’ strategies, showing that using compositionality and avoiding synonyms correlates positively with task performance. Second, we compare computer strategies, showing that modeling pragmatics on a semantic parsing model accelerates learning for more strategic players.	blocks world;formal language;interaction;natural language;parsing	Sida I.

This paper describes a collective intelligence algorithm that performs localized rather than centralized control of a number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) that can survey complex areas for fires, devoting attention in proportion to the user specified importance of each area. Simulation shows that not only is the algorithm able to perform this action successfully, it is also able to automatically adapt to a simulated malfunction in one of the UAVs.	algorithm;centralized computing;collective intelligence;simulation;television antenna;unmanned aerial vehicle	David J.

The oscillatory dynamic, according to this perspective, operates as a “bridge” between two seminal theoretical models of developments—the psychoanalytic and the infant research model—which, in turn, leads to the formulation of some neurological hypotheses on how oscillation regulates the elaboration of maternal interaction in the infant’s brain, and how the mother may act to modify it. The paper discusses how the oscillatory dynamic offers an innovative framework for the reconceptualization of the development of mentalization, the function of mirror neurons, and, most interestingly, of the development of language, explaining the non-verbal properties of ordinary linguistic communication and the function of oscillation in the regulation of information exchange processing.	anatomical maturation;autonomous robot;essence;information exchange;information processing;jackson;jakobson's functions of language;linguistics;mirror neurons;neural coding;phylogenetics;plant roots;psychoanalytic theory;reticulum;cognitive development;motor development	Giampaolo Sasso	2009	Cognitive Processing	10.1007/s10339-009-0346-z	psychology;social relation;neuroscience;developmental psychology;mirror neuron;communication;oscillation;social psychology	Robotics	-24.408680351123024	-16.303410926195838	74354

Particularly, there have been various studies on the emergence of communication and language in artificial agents, where the debate on representations underlying these processes should be significant, however not much discussion and studies have been done. We propose to identify and classify possible representational processes occurring during the emergence of communication, replicating a computational experiment previously proposed and evaluating neural network activations patterns. To define representation and its classes, including icons, indexes and symbols, we rely on the semiotics of Charles Sanders Peirce. Results show that symbolic associations are established during the evolution of artificial agents and such symbolic associations benefit adaptive success.	activation function;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;computation;emergence;index (publishing);intelligent agent;interpretation (logic);interpreter (computing);keyboard shortcut;point of view (computer hardware company);recurrent neural network;relevance;semiotics	Emerson Silva de Oliveira;Angelo Loula	2015	2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280706	visualization;symbolic communication;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;semiotics;symbolic artificial intelligence;cognitive science	AI	-26.090719870077635	-15.914038383495729	74479
7e4ec06f946594d014de1a78df80175301782b7c	formal concept analysis: current trends and directions	concept;formal context;fca;formal concept	Formalization of human thinking helps in fostering the process of learning by giving an explicit representation to human thoughts. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) finds it’s core here. It considers a “concept” as a formal unit of human thought. A concept is represented as a set of inter related objects called the extent and the set of the properties of these objects, called the intent. Making use of the mathematical principles of Lattice Theory and Map Theory of Abstract Algebra, a set of tools and algorithms have been developed in FCA. These helps us to analyze and represent any context as a relation between it’s extent and intent. Concepts drawn from the subsets of the extent and intent can be organized in the form of a lattice giving a subsumption hierarchy. Such concept lattices could be maintained by different operations on the lattice like scaling, pruning, navigating etc. A host of applications and software have been developed over the years which serves the usage of FCA tools and processes for specific purposes in various fields. This paper reviews the theoretical foundation, research and applications of FCA in different areas. The paper projects current trends in FCA and concludes with a discussion on open issues and limitations of FCA.	algorithm;chomsky hierarchy;formal concept analysis;image scaling;subsumption architecture	Achyanta Sarmah;Shyamanta M.

48316e2948f5c98b6a5c489ed63728e35fb0e196	representing and reasoning with probabilistic knowledge: a bayesian approach	bayesian approach	PAGODA (Probabilistic Autonomous GOal­ Directed Agent) is a model for autonomous learning in probabilistic domains [desJ ardins, 1992) that incorporates innovative techniques for using the agent's existing knowledge to guide and constrain the learning process and for representing, reasoning with, and learn­ ing probabilistic knowledge. This paper de­ scribes the probabilistic representation and inf�rence mechanism used in PAGODA. PAGODA forms theories about the effects of its actions and the world state on the envi­ ronment over time. These theories are rep­ resented as conditional probability distribu­ tions. A restriction is imposed on the struc­ ture of the theories that allows the inference mechanism to find a unique predicted dis­ tribution for any action and world state de­ scription. These restricted theories are called uniquely predictive theories. The inference mechanism, Probability Combination using Independence (PCI), uses minimal indepen­ dence assumptions to combine the probabili­ ties in a theory to make probabilistic predic­ tions.	autonomous robot;bayesian network;interaction;scribes;theory	Marie desJardins	1993			bayesian probability;probabilistic relevance model;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;mathematics;probabilistic logic;probabilistic argumentation;statistics	AI	-23.540474270388685	-13.989819735443133	74796
bd4550458c0fbdef5b5989d65ea2100af59c5746	cognitive function synthesis: preliminary results		Purpose – This paper introduces the Cognitive Function Synthesis, or CFS, Conceptual Framework to Artificial General Intelligence. CFS posits that at the ‘core’ of intelligence in Hybrid Architectures, ‘interdependent’ cognitive functions are synthesised through the interaction of various Associative Memory, or AM, based systems. This synthesis could form an interface layer between deliberative/symbolic and reactive/sub-symbolic layers in Hybrid Cognitive Architectures. Design/methodology/approach – A CFS Conceptual Framework, specifying an arrangement of AMs, was presented. The framework was executed using Sparse Distributed Memory, SDM. Experiments were performed to investigate CFS Autonomous Extraction, Consciousness and Imagination. Findings – Autonomous extraction was achieved using data from a Wi-Fi camera with the CFS autoassociative AM handling ‘Sensor Data’. However, noise reduction degraded the extracted image. An environment, simulated in V-REP 3.3.1, was used to investigate consciousness and imagination. CFS displayed consciousness by successfully tracking/anticipating the object position with over 90% congruence. CFS Imagination was seen by its predicting 2 time-steps into the future. Originality/value – Preliminary results demonstrate the plausibility of CFS claims for Autonomous Extraction, Consciousness and Imagination.	am broadcasting;artificial general intelligence;artificial intelligence;autonomous robot;byte;climate forecast system;cognition;cognitive architecture;congruence of squares;consciousness;distortion;distributed memory;experiment;nl (complexity);neuron;noise reduction;plausibility structure;sparse;zeller's congruence	Gerard A.

The architecture of COGENT is based on Rasmussen's integrated theory of human information processing, and supports decisionmaking at multiple levels of abstraction and complexity. The decision-aiding process ranges from situation feature extraction and summarization to support perceptual processing, through situation assessment and alert generation to support enhanced situation awareness, to situation-specific response recommendation to support complex decision-making. COGENT displays information in a format that is easily understood, and matches the user's own mental model of the situation, thus requiring minimal amounts of translation and cognitive processing for assimilation. The robust performance of COGENT is assured through the use of complementary AI techniques such as probabilistic belief networks and argumentation. We developed and demonstrated a prototype for COGENT, and tested it on real telemetry data sets. We are specifically addressing our effort for enhancing operator situation awareness and decision-aiding capability at ground stations.	.net framework;artificial intelligence;automatic summarization;bayesian network;cpu cache;cognition;cognitive science;commonsense reasoning;communications satellite;data assimilation;feature extraction;fuzzy logic;information filtering system;information processing;mental model;principle of abstraction;prototype;relevance;rendering (computer graphics);software propagation;steen rasmussen	Subrata Kumar Das;Dan L.

The symbolic approach utilizes symbolic emotional rule-based systems (rule base that generated emotions) with continuous interactions with environment and an internal ‘‘thinking’’ machinery that comes as a result of series of inferences, evaluation, evolution processes, adaptation, learning, and emotions. We build two models for agent based systems; one is supported with artificial emotions and the other one without emotions. We use both in solving a bench mark problem; ‘‘The Orphanage Care Problem’’. The two systems are simulated and results are compared. Our study shows that systems with proper model of emotions can perform in many cases better than systems without emotions. We try to shed the light here on how artificial emotions can be modeled in a simple rule-based agent systems and if emotions as they exist in ‘‘real intelligence’’ can be helpful for ‘‘artificial intelligence’’. Agent architectures are presented as a generic blueprint on which the design of agents can be based. Our focus is on the functional design, including flow of information and control. With this information provided, the generic blueprints of architectures should not be difficult to implement agents, thus putting these theoretical models into practice. We build the agents using this architecture, and many experiments and analysis are shown. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The system functions in the role of a pilot's assistant in the domain of commercial air transport emergencies. The model represents causal relationships among the aircraft subsystems, the effectors (engines, control surfaces), the forces that act on an aircraft in flight (thrust, lift), and the aircraft's flight profile (speed, altitude, etc.). The causal relationships are represented at three levels of abstraction: Boolean, qualitative, and quantitative, and reasoning about causes and effects can take place at each of these levels. Since processing at each level has different characteristics with respect to speed, the type of data required, and the specificity of the results, the problem-solving system can adapt to a wide variety of situations. The system is currently being implemented in the KEE™ development environment on a Symbolics Lisp machine.	causal filter;causal model;causality;kee games;level of detail;lisp machine;numerical analysis;pilot;principle of abstraction;problem solving;sensitivity and specificity;simulation;thrust	Eva Hudlicka;Kevin Corker	1988		10.1145/51909.51928	simulation;causal reasoning;artificial intelligence;machine learning;development environment;aviation;causal model	AI	-23.192751693495133	-20.799572269741144	75507

To this end, we have simulated a physical system from which we can obtain numerical information. The physical system perceives information from its environment and generates predicates that can be reasoned by a defeasible logic engine. The conclusions/decisions derived will then realized by the physical system as it takes actions based on the conclusion derived. Here we consider a scenario where a “flock” of UAVs have to navigate within an urban canyon environment. The UAVs are self-autonomous without centralized control. The goal of the UAVs is to navigate to their desired destinations without colliding with each other. In case of possible collision, the UAVs concerned will communicate with each other and use their background knowledge or travel guidelines to resolve the conflicts.	algorithm;autonomous robot;centralized computing;computation;defeasible logic;defeasible reasoning;flock;modal logic;numerical analysis;rule-based system;simulation;speedup;the australian;time complexity;unmanned aerial vehicle;vehicle routing problem	Brian Lam;Guido Governatori	2013	J.

0b005b802336a96267db1ce54c0f2876911c7845	agent-based trust management and prediction using d3-frt		Reputation and trust management systems have been useful in domains that rely on the cooperation of members to function correctly and to fulfil their purposes. Despite the advent of these systems, having trusted communications remains a challenge. This is as a result of relying on the domain members for reputation information. These systems lack well analysed approaches for determining the bias of the members. A semi-distributed framework D3-FRT, which is inspired by the Dynamic Data-Driven Simulation paradigm, is presented in this paper. The framework adopts an agent-based modelling approach to make predictions about domain members. The D3-FRT framework is novel as it uses past, online and predicted data to identify misbehaving members. In this paper, the accuracy of the prediction is tested and a report on the framework’s performance in different network scenarios is also presented. The results of experiments and simulations using the D3-FRT approach are discussed.	agent-based model;dynamic data;experiment;programming paradigm;semiconductor industry;simulation;trust management (information system);trust management (managerial science)	Olufunmilola Oladunni Onolaja;Rami Bahsoon;Georgios Theodoropoulos	2012		10.1016/j.procs.2012.04.121	simulation;data mining;computer security	AI	-19.66506552447908	-12.065033605467816	75772

The aim of this paper is to review so called enacted theories of vision and argue that they are too severe in terms of removing inner representations from the argument and removing the possibility of mental imagery. This is followed by an exposition of an axiomatic approach we have developed to explain issues of visual consciousness and show how this, while respecting enacted theories provides a new model of visual awareness which not only attempts to characterise the natural version, but may inspire the design of machinery.

Recently, some important elements have been underlined: hybrid connectionist models outside formal ontologies; complex subjective representations linking culture, personality and norms, and so on, but proposed solutions do not provide a formalized structure of a social experience, expressive and well-grounded in psychology. In this paper, we develop a new approach to social situation modeling based on the dramaturgical and dissonance theories. A new component Dramaturgical Module is described with implementation used to generate example behavior depicting new social modeling capabilities and a believable representation of the relevant psychological theories. We present a case scenario with a dramaturgical interpretation of dynamic social situations and related cognitive dissonances resulting in a simple and flexible classification. Easily usable in reasoning, planning or affect generation, dramaturgical interpretation is additionally presented here as basis of social affect generation.

a19202bf074b74823e71a55caf819de3b3d4c13b	a model of agents (robots) command behavior: the cognitive approach		The paper suggests a mathematical model of agents' cooperation in dynamics, which employs agents' utility functions and cognitive dissonance of their relations. The model is based on the theories of social psychologists investigating the behavior of people in small social groups and explaining the principles of their functioning and stability. We illustrate the suggested model via simulation of virtual soccer game of agents (robots). The performed simulation allows to model diverse aspects of agents' cooperation and selfish behavior.	robot	Alexander A.

While a number of cognitive strategies have been proposed for human wayfinding, these have been hard to evaluate thoroughly owing to a lack of computational simulation. In this work, we propose a stochastic approach for capturing these aspects, and argue for a memoryless, stationary implementation. In two longitudinal experiments on the same group of subjects, we first estimate the subjective regionalized maps for each subject on the same familiar spatial domain. Later, based on their wayfinding responses, we can estimate the stationary probabilities for different strategies. We apply this algorithm to evaluate three wayfinding strategies proposed in the literature, and repudiate the previously held suggestion that they are followed	algorithm;approximation;cluster analysis;cognition;cognitive model;distortion;encode;emoticon;experiment;first-order predicate;heuristic (computer science);map;non-repudiation;relevance;simulation;spatial navigation;stationary process;vagueness	Sushobhan Nayak;Varunesh Mishra;Amitabha Mukerjee	2011			simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;computational model	AI	-23.51234723287756	-17.292947642122986	76130

a486258e3cacb1095055d2f052cb7ffb3655501a	evolutionary developmental soft robotics as a framework to study intelligence and adaptive behavior in animals and plants		In this paper, a comprehensive methodology and simulation framework will be reviewed, designed in order to study the emergence of adaptive and intelligent behavior in generic soft-bodied creatures. By incorporating artificial evolutionary and developmental processes, the system allows to evolve complete creatures (brain, body, developmental properties, sensory, control system, etc.) for different task environments. Whether the evolved creatures will resemble animals or plants is in general not known a priori, and depends on the specific task environment set up by the experimenter. In this regard, the system may offer a unique opportunity to explore differences and similarities between these two worlds. Different material properties can be simulated and optimized, from a continuum of soft/stiff materials, to the interconnection of heterogeneous structures, both found in animals and plants alike. The adopted genetic encoding and simulation environment are particularly suitable in order to evolve distributed sensory and control systems, which play a particularly important role in plants. After a general description of the system some case studies will be presented, focusing on the emergent properties of the evolved creatures. Particular emphasis will be on some unifying concepts that are thought to play an important role in the emergence of intelligent and adaptive behavior across both the animal and plant kingdoms, such as morphological computation and morphological developmental plasticity. Overall, with this paper, we hope to draw attention on set of tools, methodologies, ideas and results, which may be relevant to researchers interested in plant-inspired robotics and intelligence.	adaptive behavior;computation;control system;emergence;interconnection;robotics;simulation;triune continuum paradigm	Francesco Corucci;Nick Cheney;Sam Kriegman;Josh C.

One of the basic tenets of embodied cognitive science states that categorization can be interpreted as a process of sensory-motor coordination, in which an embodied agent, while interacting with its environment, can structure its own input space for the purpose of learning about categories. Many researchers, including John Dewey and Jean Piaget, have argued that sensory-motor coordination is crucial for perception and for development. In this paper we give a quantitative account of why sensory-motor coordination is important for perception and category learning.	categorization;concept learning;dewey decimal classification;dimensionality reduction;embodied agent;embodied cognitive science;fingerprint;interaction;jean;piaget's theory of cognitive development;robot	I.

e67e8ede2c69b35fbd07a981e7218df1eb295606	a theoretical model of design creativity: nonlinear design dynamics and mental stress-creativity relation	chaotic dynamics;design governing equation;environment based design ebd;nonlinear dynamics;mathematical model;mental stress;design creativity	Creativity is an important topic in design research. Attempts have been made to develop methods and tools that can help designers become more creative. Yet how and why creativity occurs is still unknown to researchers. In this paper, we propose a theoretical model for creative design. This theoretical model builds on two postulates: 1) design reasoning follows a nonlinear dynamics, which may become chaotic; and 2) there is an inverse U shaped relationship between designer’s mental stress and design creativity. In the first postulate, the nonlinear dynamics assumes the form of design governing equation and can be solved by Environment Based Design (EBD). The first postulate implies that design reasoning is sensitive to initial conditions, which are defined by the combination of design problem, design solutions, design knowledge, and other design related information. Since the major components in initial conditions may evolve simultaneously and are subject to continuous change during the design process, the design process is highly unpredictable. Some of the unpredictable solutions, which could be of high quality and useful, can be deemed creative. From this first postulate, three paths to creative design are derived, which specify how the initial conditions can be changed. The second postulate states that design creativity occurs when a designer is under a medium mental stress. Mental stresses are positively related to the workload associated with a design problem and negatively related to the designer’s mental capacity. The workload is related to the complexity of the design problem and the amount of work in the design process whereas the mental capacity is related to the knowledge and skills required by the design process and to the designer’s affect when dealing with the stresses arising from uncertainties and unpredictability of the design dynamics. To show how this theoretical model can be used to study design phenomena, an interpretation of the roles of sketching in design is presented.	axiomatic design;axiomatic system;chaos theory;coherence (physics);computer simulation;display resolution;dynamical system;initial condition;interdependence;nondeterministic algorithm;nonlinear system;recursion;stellar classification	Thanh An Nguyen;Yong Zeng	2012	J.

Interactions and relationships between motivation and attitude are formally described in real-time process algebra (RTPA). Applications of the mathematical models of motivations and attitudes in software engineering are demonstrated. This work is a part of the formalization of LRMB, which provides a comprehensive model for explaining the fundamental cognitive processes of the brain and their interactions.

9789f087de81b58a690c068bdbcfda2ca795ff5c	editorial: special issue on self-reconfiguring modular robots		This Special Issue contains 13 papers that cover the most recent advances in the area of self-reconfiguring modular robots. Self-reconfiguring robots are modular robots that can change their morphology and topology. Each module is a robot by itself. These systems promise great flexibility compared to fixed-shape robots. By keeping the design of each individual module relatively simple and through mass production, selfreconfiguring robots can offer an affordable platform to perform a variety of tasks. They have the potential to perform self-diagnosis and self-repair. Moreover, a simple design lends itself well to miniaturization. Potential applications included reconnaissance missions in search and rescue operations, self-assembly (both in space and at the micro-scale), and self-replication on other planets or moons. However, the design, control, communication, and planning for such systems give rise to many challenges. Most of the papers in this issue were presented at the Workshop on Self-Reconfiguring Modular Robots held at the 2006 “Robotics: Science & Systems” conference in Philadelphia, PA. Submissions for the workshop were reviewed by the Program Committee for this workshop, which consisted of Greg Chirikjian (Johns Hopkins), Eric Klavins (University of Washington), Hod Lipson (Cornell), Mark Moll (Rice), Daniela Rus (MIT), Behnam Salemi (ISI/USC), Wei-Min Shen (ISI/USC), and Mark Yim (University of Pennsylvania). After the workshop, workshop participants and the wider robotics community were invited to submit journallength papers, which were submitted to another round of reviews. As part of the workshop, a panel discussion was held to discuss the Grand Challenges for the field. The key technical difficulties that were identified were: Scaling up: Typically, experiments are performed only on a small number of modules. As the number of modules increases, new challenges arise such as power distribution, efficient communication, and fault / noise tolerance. Self-repairing systems: Self-repair requires modules to identify what the global arrangement of modules should be and what each individual module’s role is. Even deciding whether a system requires repair is already a challenging problem. Self-assembly can be seen as the most extreme form of self-repair. Self-replication: Although simple self-replicating systems exist, it remains a formidable challenge to design a modular robot that can assemble copies of itself from elementary parts. Miniaturization: At the micro-/nano-scale, biological processes efficiently use stochastic motions that are robust to intrinsic noise. Most of the current robotic systems overcome uncertainty through brute force. Bridging this gap, and coming up with efficient algorithms at the nanoscale is a big challenge. In this issue, Brener et al. analyze current designs for modular robots using results from crystallography. Campbell and Pillai describe a method for collective actuation of modules, thereby forming more powerful meta-modules. De Rosa et al. bring tools for debugging and verification for distributed software systems to the domain of modular robots. Fitch and Butler introduce a new locomotion algorithm for lattice-type modular robots that scales up to millions of modules. Gilpin et al. describe a novel approach to shape formation through self-disassembly. Kurokawa et al. describe recent advances in distributed self-reconfiguration. Lee et al. introduce a formal framework to analyze the complexity of self-replicating systems and present several	2.5d;algorithm;bridging (networking);brute-force search;debugging;disassembler;distributed computing;experiment;fitch notation;grand challenges;information sciences institute;mathematical morphology;robotics;self-assembly;self-reconfiguring modular robot;self-replication;software system;eric	Mark Moll;Daniela Rus	2008	I.

At a social level this means that I can know a lot of things on people that I never met; it is social 'prejudice' with its good side and fundamental contribution to social exchange. In this paper we focus on the importance of generalised knowledge: agents' categories. In studies on trust building and dynamics the role of direct/personal experience and of recommendations and reputation is a bit overrated; while the importance of inferential processes in deriving the evaluation of trustees' trustworthiness is underestimated and not exploited. We will experimentally inquire the role played by categories' reputation with respect to the reputation and opinion on single agents: when it is better to rely on the first ones and when are more reliable the second ones. This powerful inferential device has to be strongly present in WEB societies supported by MAS.	category theory;computation;computational model	Rino Falcone;Alessandro Sapienza;Cristiano Castelfranchi	2016	IJCIStudies	10.1504/IJCISTUDIES.2016.077120	trustworthiness;reputation;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;opinion;social simulation;social exchange theory	Graphics	-20.591932881704373	-11.626531130851365	78036

This approach is based on the formalism MIRA (Mīmāṁsā Inspired Representation of Actions), which has the feature of expressing an action as reason , instruction and goal . MIRA also prescribes a set of deduction rules, which helps in the reasoning process of actions. These features are incorporated in this approach and a software tool, namely MIRATaskGen is designed, which facilitates the task analysis process of special education. The software receives various action related inputs along with the start and finish stages and generates a sequence of tasks from the start to the finish . This tool also informs the user, whether the desired goal can be achieved. If the desired goal cannot be achieved, then the sequence of actions from the start to a point of discontinuity is detected.	mira;natural deduction;programming tool;reflections of signals on conducting lines;semantics (computer science);task analysis;television	Bama Srinivasan;Ranjani Parthasarathi	2013	J.

2eb4201ad3c658a3c303bc5efbf785b72c21f64e	examples of artificial perceptions in optical character recognition and iris recognition		— This paper assumes the hypothesis that human learning is perception based, and consequently, the learning process and perceptions should not be represented and investigated independently or modeled in different simulation spaces. In order to keep the analogy between the artificial and human learning, the former is assumed here as being based on the artificial perception. Hence, instead of choosing to apply or develop a Computational Theory of (human) Perceptions, we choose to mirror the human perceptions in a numeric (computational) space as artificial perceptions and to analyze the interdependence between artificial learning and artificial perception in the same numeric space, using one of the simplest tools of Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing, namely the perceptrons. As practical applications, we choose to work around two examples: Optical Character Recognition and Iris Recognition.

Some social games also require cunning, duplicity, or bad faith.

Recent studies of joint action have shown that when performing tasks together people strongly rely on the neurocognitive mechanisms that they also use when performing actions individually, that is, they predict the consequences of their co-actor's behavior through internal action simulation. Context-sensitive action monitoring and action selection processes, however, are relatively underrated but crucial ingredients of joint action. In the present paper, we try to correct the somewhat simplified view on joint action by reviewing recent studies of joint action simulation, monitoring, and selection while emphasizing the intricate interrelationships between these processes. We complement our review by defining the contours of a neurologically plausible computational framework of joint action.	action potential;action selection;complement system proteins;humans;review [publication type];simulation;neurocognitive	Harold Bekkering;Ellen R.

In order to do field-related simulations or to solve a variety of problems based in this research area, Multi-Agent System (MAS) frameworks are necessary. Several good proposals have been presented in this field. This paper presents a new MAS-based framework for agent societies based on the principles of a familiar, global connotation youth movement known as Scouting. The main goal of this paper is not to demonstrate whether the proposal presented here, which is presented by name of MAS-Scout, is better or not than the other current proposals. Instead, MAS-Scout is focusing in the following premise: knowing that Scouting has been a very successful social movement in the world; can its principles be used as a basis for designing a MAS-based framework used for implementing agent societies?

In this regard, the use of the following terms should be noted: organization, neutral architecture, communication, rules, roles, ownership / leadership, hierarchy and model. On the other hand, and due to the fact that there is a rising awareness that MASs and cybersocieties can best be understood and developed if they are inspired by human social phenomena (Artikis et al., 2001; Castelfranchi, 2000; Zambonelli et al., 2001), authors of reference (Dignum & Dignum, 2001) established that any formalism for the design of open agent societies must fulfill the following requirements: (1) agent societies must describe the roles, norms, and goals of the society instead of just describing the state of the agents; (2) certain mechanisms are needed to verify whether the design of a society of agents satisfies the requirements and objectives stated by its design (Dignum et al., 2001); (3) interactions between members and the expected outcome of roles must be formalized in order to verify the overall animation of the society; (4) the organizational and normative elements of a society must be explicitly specified since an open society cannot rely on its elements being embedded in the intentions, desires, and beliefs of each agent (Dellarocas, 2000; Ossowski, 1998); and (5) communication and the ability to conform to expected role behaviors need to be assumed by members. Once again, the use of the following terms should be noted: organization, communication, rules, and roles / objectives. Of the terms identified, it is worth noting that “organization” is perhaps one of the most important. This is so because the society of the agents’ model emerges from the idea that in an organizational system interactions between members occur not just by accident, but by aiming at the completion of some desired global goals. Moreover, it is possible to conclude that the same is true in any organized society. So then, organizations are formed because social structure is determined by organizational design and not dependent on the agents themselves (Tikanmaki et al., 2006). Furthermore, norms have been identified in social sciences as crucial tools to solve important (agent) societies’ issues such as coordination, cooperation, trust and, reputation (Tikanmaki et al., 2006). In the same order of ideas, verification of the behavior of an open society, where the design of participating agents cannot be controllable, must be based on the externally observable effects of agent actions. That is, from the society perspective, different actions that bring about the same state of affairs in the world cannot be distinguished. From the above considerations, it follows that a logical formalism for the society of agents’ model must be able to represent (Tikanmaki et al., 2006): (1) Deontic relations (obligations, prohibitions, permissions); (2) externally observable results of agent actions (changes in state caused through influence of agents); (3) temporal relationships (the effect of actions and agreements is neither instantaneous nor deterministic, several futures are possible at each moment depending on agent decisions and environment changes); and (4) violations and reasoning about effects, and recovery from violated states. Another term that becomes important in the context of agent societies is the term cooperation. In this regard, in a society of agents it becomes reasonable to talk about cooperation if there is a problem to solve that exceeds the capability of problem-solving of the individual agents. A cooperative activity can take form only if there is a society of agents and a common objective. Moreover, a cooperative activity can be performed if the objective, which is composed of many global goals, is shared by all agents having the capacity of realizing fulfilling their local goals.

Sellers' desire to quickly achieve high reputation has fueled a profitable underground business, which operates as a specialized crowdsourcing marketplace and accumulates wealth by allowing online sellers to harness human laborers to conduct fake transactions for improving their stores' reputations. We term such an underground market a seller-reputation-escalation (SRE) market. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the SRE service on reputation escalation by performing in-depth measurements of the prevalence of the SRE service, the business model and market size of SRE markets, and the characteristics of sellers and offered laborers. To this end, we have infiltrated five SRE markets and studied their operations using daily data collection over a continuous period of two months. We identified more than 11,000 online sellers posting at least 219,165 fake-purchase tasks on the five SRE markets. These transactions earned at least $46,438 in revenue for the five SRE markets, and the total value of merchandise involved exceeded $3,452,530. Our study demonstrates that online sellers using SRE service can increase their stores' reputations at least 10 times faster than legitimate ones while only 2.2% of them were detected and penalized. Even worse, we found a newly launched service that can, within a single day, boost a seller's reputation by such a degree that would require a legitimate seller at least a year to accomplish. Finally, armed with our analysis of the operational characteristics of the underground economy, we offer some insights into potential mitigation strategies.	crowdsourcing;doxing;e-commerce payment system;emergence;privilege escalation;reputation	Haitao Xu;Daiping Liu;Haining Wang;Angelos Stavrou	2015		10.1145/2736277.2741650	e-commerce;computer science;database;world wide web	Web+IR	-33.5961352579829	-17.70212524047901	79244

We argue that learning using generalized representations of the robot’s experience can assist such a ability. Design/methodology/approach – We present results from our research on methods for enabling mobile robots to plan their actions using generalized representations of their experience. Such generalized representations are acquired through a learning phase during which the robot explores its environment and builds subsymbolic (connectionist) representations of the result that its actions have to its sensory perception. Then these representations are employed by the robot for autonomously determining task-achieving sequences of actions (plans),for attaining assigned tasks. Findings – Such subsymbolic mechanisms can employ generalization techniques in order to pursue plans through unexplored regions of the robot’s environment. Originality/value – Subsymbolic motion planning can autonomously determine task-achieving sequences of actions in real environments, without using presupplied symbolic knowledge, but instead generating novel plans using previously acquired subsymbolic representations.	artificial intelligence;connectionism;mobile robot;motion planning	John Pisokas;Dongbing Gu;Huosheng Hu	2006	Industrial Robot	10.1108/01439910610667881	planning;motion control;mobile robot;robot learning;computer vision;simulation;design methods;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;motion planning;robotics;plan	AI	-24.10558227933189	-17.792675651145263	79301

Most approaches have focused on building high-level probabilistic cognitive models. However, research in cognitive science shows that people often build common ground for communication with each other by seeking and providing evidence of understanding through behaviors like mimicry. Predictive State Representations (PSRs) allow one to build explicit, low-level models of the expected outcomes of actions, and are therefore well-suited for tasks that require providing such evidence of understanding. Using human-robot shadow puppetry as a prototype interaction study, we show that PSRs can be used successfully to both model human interactions, and to allow a robot to learn on-line how to engage a human in an interesting interaction.	cognitive model;cognitive science;high- and low-level;humans;interaction;online and offline;prototype;robotics;social robot	Eric Meisner;Sanmay Das;Volkan Isler;Jeffrey C.

781e7070b46bc7d6a9feb68c2c43c69694ff9910	dealing with agents' behaviour in the decision-making process		Gathering a group of managers or executives (decision-makers) in a same place and at a same time is not an easy task. In fact, the decision-makers’ schedule is so tight that it becomes necessary to develop tools that will aid in the communication and in the decision-making process. The intelligent systems (IS) can be the solution to overcome these necessities. In literature, there have been appearing more and more IS that make use of multi agent systems (MAS) in order to represent real decision-makers in this type of systems. In our work we address the problem of how agents should behave during the decision-making process and what strategies they can follow to represent the interests of the decision-maker. We intend to define valid behaviours for agents in group decision-making context and to relate the theoretical behaviours definition with usual attitudes and acts that are relevant for this context. We define two dimensions and relate them with two facets based on the Five Factor Model. Then we propose the behaviours classification according three different levels (low, moderate and high) for each one of the dimensions. We use the value of the personality trait correspondent to each facet in order to classify our behaviours in the scale.

5e20bbec96a962cb1c6f688fd8a4b890a78225e6	an hri approach to learning from demonstration		The goal of this research is to enable robots to learn new things from everyday people. For years, the AI and Robotics community has sought to enable robots to efficiently learn new skills from a knowledgeable human trainer, and prior work has focused on several important technical problems. This vast amount of research in the field of robot Learning by Demonstration has by and large only been evaluated with expert humans, typically the system’s designer. Thus, neglecting a key point that this interaction takes place within a social structure that can guide and constrain the learning problem. We believe that addressing this point will be essential for developing systems that can learn from everyday people that are not experts in Machine Learning or Robotics. Our work focuses on new research questions involved in letting robots learn from everyday human partners (e.g., What kind of input do people want to provide a machine learner? How does their mental model of the learning process affect this input? What interfaces and interaction mechanisms can help people provide better input from a machine learning perspective?) Often our research begins with an investigation into the feasibility of a particular machine learning interaction, which leads to a series of research questions around re-designing both the interaction and the algorithm to better suit learning with end-users. We believe this equal focus on both the Machine Learning and the HRI contributions are key to making progress toward the goal of machines learning from humans. In this abstract we briefly overview four different projects that highlight our HRI approach to the problem of Learning from Demonstration.	algorithm;human–robot interaction;machine learning;mental model;robot learning;robotics;social structure	Baris Akgun;Kalesha Bullard;Vivian Chu;Andrea Lockerd Thomaz	2014				HCI	-28.43147772336159	-18.920264324463073	80520

Here, we present a broader picture in which information is associated with epistemic structures, which form cognitive infological systems as basic recipients and creators of cognitive information. Infological systems are modeled by epistemic spaces, while operators in these spaces are mathematical models of information. Information that acts on epistemic structures is called cognitive information, while information that acts on knowledge structures is called epistemic information. The latter brings new and updates existing knowledge, being of primary importance to people. In this paper, both types of information are studied as operators in epistemic spaces based on the general theory of information. As a synthetic approach, which reveals the essence of information, organizing and encompassing all main directions in information theory, the general theory of information provides efficient means for such a study. Different types of information dynamics representation use tools from various mathematical disciplines, such as the theory of categories, functional analysis, mathematical logic and algebra. In this paper, we base our exploration of information and knowledge dynamics on functional analysis further developing the mathematical stratum of the general theory of information.	category theory;cognitive science;information science;information theory;mathematical model;organizing (structure);process calculus;spaces;synthetic intelligence	Mark Burgin	2014	Information	10.3390/info5020357	information algebra;discrete mathematics;information;vector bundle;computer science;artificial intelligence;pure mathematics;mathematics;knowledge;epistemic possibility;interaction information	AI	-24.708702825893354	-10.830828246399982	81172
9f0481ce453191e8e7f99005f796db605a7cc362	improvisation as model for real-time decision making		Abstract This work explores the concept of improvisation as a framework for understanding real-time dynamic decision making (RTDDM) and systems support for it. The contexts for RTDDM and those in which agents improvise are remarkably similar according to several parameters. The foundations of improvisation are built on management theory, practice, and education. The work provides a rich definition of improvisation and a typology of different improvisational contexts based on two key dimensions. This framework illustrates how seemingly diverse contexts such as emergency management and jazz performance are related. The work then explores the antecedents of improvisation, degrees of improvisation, the elements for individual and team improvisation, and effective improvisation. The work then explores the design of Real-Time dynamic decision support systems (DSS). These are broken into preand postperformance support, as well as Real-Time support. The conclusion is that our knowledge of improvisational contexts can shed new light on RTDDM systems design and development.	apache continuum;autonomous robot;biological anthropology;computer performance;decision support system;declarative programming;emoticon;jones calculus;problem domain;problem solving;procedural programming;real-time data;real-time transcription;requirement;semiconductor industry;systems design	Eric W.

This is particularly the case when systems are “open”, in the sense of having no centralised control, where traditional design approaches struggle. In this chapter, we indicate the key features of social simulation work that are valuable for distributed systems design. We also discuss the differences between social and biological models in this respect. We give examples of socially inspired systems from the currently active area of peer-to-peer systems, and finally we discuss open areas for future research in the field.	hardware description language	T.

If also relevant data on internal physical states over time are available, these can be analysed with respect to their relation to mental states as well.	mental state;simulation;tracing (software)	Catholijn M.

The initial idea was: can the laws of Nature also been found of rebuilt, independently from theoretical research in Physics (on elementary particles and matter in general), also in the field of Computer Science i.e. Information Processing? Pressing a lemon reveals its juice and stones; if one “tortures” matter, the components of its (first electrons, neutrons and protons, then quarks and gluons at a lesser order of magnitude) may be detected. What will appear if one tries to compress algorithms instead of atoms? APL seemed to be the ideal candidate for such a systematical investigation that led to some intriguing results which first proved to be indeed strongly connected with the conventional laws of Physics, then might enlighten in a new way many apparently-independent observations and studies, in a variety of fields such as neural networks, natural-language and signal processing, fractal geometry, Biology and Genetics inter alia.	apl;algorithm;artificial neural network;computer science;elementary particle;fractal;information processing;mike lesser;natural language;signal processing;strongly connected component	Gérard A.

dbe93ad7505be89fe76beb087f591411c59ef3b6	computers in abstraction/representation theory		Recently, Horsman et al. (Proc R Soc Lond A 470:20140182, 2014) have proposed a new framework, Abstraction/Representation (AR) theory, for understanding and evaluating claims about unconventional or non-standard computation. Among its attractive features, the theory in particular implies a novel account of what is means to be a computer. After expounding on this account, I compare it with other accounts of concrete computation, finding that it does not quite fit in the standard categorization: while it is most similar to some semantic accounts, it is not itself a semantic account. Then I evaluate it according to the six desiderata for accounts of concrete computation proposed by Piccinini (Physical computation: a mechanistic account, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2015). Finding that it does not clearly satisfy some of them, I propose a modification, which I call Agential AR theory, that does, yielding an account that could be a serious competitor to other leading account of concrete computation.	association for automated reasoning;biological system;categorization;challenge-handshake authentication protocol;computation;computational complexity theory;computational physics;computer;entity;information processing;objectivity/db	Samuel C.

The goal of this work is the development of a decision support system for category management in the retail domain for optimizing pricing, promotions and sales mix. I will show how to simulate ex ante the sales behaviour of products with probabilistic agents. The basis of the system is a new developed probabilistic holonic multi-agent system (PH-MAS), where the knowledge bases of the agents are extracted by data mining retailers’ real data. The patterns of sale will be encoded into so-called behaviour networks, which will be used for simulating the represented items. We will see how the core of the behaviour networks is realised with extended Bayesian networks. New kinds of evidences – soft and extrapolation evidences – are introduced and concretised. For modelling and simulating global dependencies between item agents a merging algorithm is presented for fusing the probabilistic behaviour networks of the agents into holonic meta networks. Additionally, I will present a concept of a multi-dimensional simulation language (MSL) for arbitrary behaviour networks and other multi-dimensional knowledge representation formalisms. Finally, a self-optimising simulation routine is presented, which converts arbitrary simulation scenarios into a sequence of network configurations for efficient simulation based on behaviour networks. All developed technologies of this work are integrated into the agents of the PH-MAS, which is realised by using the new developed distributed agent framework MASg and the .NET technology. I will show how this generic multi-agent system is successively expanded to a massive simulation system to forecast the sales behaviour of products.	agent-based model;algorithm;bayesian network;data mining;decision support system;extrapolation;holon (philosophy);knowledge representation and reasoning;multi-agent system;simulation language	Björn Patrick Stahmer	2006				AI	-19.332014772813064	-11.937813853759458	81677

We do so by examining and describing how messages affect the planning process and thereby relating communication to the intentions of the agents. We start by developing an abstract formal theory of knowledge representation based on the concept of information. We distinguish two types of information: state information, which describes the agent's knowledge about its world (knowing that) and process information, which describes the agent's knowledge of how to achieve some goal (knowing how). These two types of information are then used to formally define the agent's representation of knowledge states including the agent's intentional states. We then Show how situations and actions are related to the knowledge states. Using these relations we define a formal situation semantics for a propositional language. Based on this semantics, a formal pragmatic interpretation of the language is defined that formally describes how any given knowledge representational state is modified by a given message. Finally, using this theory of meaning of messages or speech acts, a theory of cooperation by means of communication is described.	agent-based model;autonomous agent;autonomous robot;high- and low-level;knowledge representation and reasoning;operational semantics;theory of computation	Eric Werner	1988			planning;knowledge representation and reasoning;computability theory;information;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;autonomous agent;automated reasoning	AI	-21.915060268767412	-10.566411967960324	82043

ALE provides an interface to hundreds of Atari 2600 game environments, each one different, interesting, and designed to be a challenge for human players. ALE presents significant research challenges for reinforcement learning, model learning, model-based planning, imitation learning, transfer learning, and intrinsic motivation. Most importantly, it provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating and comparing approaches to these problems. We illustrate the promise of ALE by developing and benchmarking domain-independent agents designed using well-established AI techniques for both reinforcement learning and planning. In doing so, we also propose an evaluation methodology made possible by ALE, reporting empirical results on over 55 different games. All of the software, including the benchmark agents, is publicly available.	atari;benchmark (computing);reinforcement learning;testbed	Marc G. Bellemare;Yavar Naddaf;Joel Veness;Michael H.

However, its importance is inarguable and, recently, a lot of effort on research was put into this field. The use of Agent-Based Models (ABM) and known techniques such as the Social Forces Model (SFM) has fostered this most recent application field. Several models are already available for crowd simulation, but the validation of such models is a critical issue. Methodologies for behaviour elicitation and validation in social simulation models are needed. In this paper, a new framework to tackle these problems is proposed. Based on research made for more specific applications, concerned with buildings' evacuation, a methodological approach to develop a simulator for pedestrian's dynamics consisting of five main tasks is proposed hereafter. The tasks are: 1) """"Reference Models and Benchmarks"""" 2) """"Pedestrian Sensor Fusion, 3) """"Serious Games for Pedestrian Behaviour Elicitation"""" 4) """"Behaviour Mining, """" and 5) """"Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation of Pedestrian Elicitation of Emergent Dynamics, """" a Decision Support Tool aimed at the study and analysis at pedestrian dynamics in the urban context, specifically for helping planners to develop the new generation of buildings and cities."""	agent-based model;behavioral modeling;bluetooth;crowd simulation;emergent;next-generation network;reduced cost;social simulation;suicidegirls;ultra-wideband	João Emílio Almeida;Zafeiris Kokkinogenis;Rosaldo J.

What prompted focusing on these particular domains? Was it theoretical interests, specific issues the customers for these models wanted to address, or simply the best opportunities at hand? Casti: My simulation models of the catastrophe insurance industry and the supermarket were purely targets of opportunity: the people in those industries came to me, following a lecture or reading of my book Would-Be Worlds, and in effect said, “Can you help us?” So the choice of topic was customer-driven. The stock market model is not my own, but one created by Brian Arthur, John Holland, and others, in an attempt to construct a laboratory for studying the Efficient Market Hypothesis, as well as other aspects of academic finance. Der Standard: Our readers will be very interested in who should knock on your door and for what purpose. What type of questions is best answered by simulation approaches? Some problems are tractable analytically. Other types of problems are not tractable at all. Which types of problems match well what simulation approaches can offer? Casti: In my view, the best type of problems/questions to use agent-based modeling to address are those that have a collection of objects making up the system that are heterogeneous, intelligent, and adaptive, for example, drivers in a road-traffic network, shoppers in a supermarket, traders in a financial market, or animals in an ecosystem. By these terms, I mean that these agents are intelligent, in the sense that they use rules to decide upon their actions at any time, they are adaptive in the sense that they are ready to change their rule if the old rule isn’t working so well anymore, and they are heterogeneous in that the agents don’t all use the same rule. Such systems are very difficult to model using traditional mathematics, since that mathematics is based on physics, whereas the JOHN L.

Over the past decade, sequential pattern acquisition has attracted the attention of researchers from Computer Science, Cognitive Psychology and the Neurosciences. Methodologies for the investigation of sequence learning processes range from the exploration of computational mechanisms to the conduct of experimental studies and the use of event-related brain potentials, functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (Clegg, DiGirolamo, u0026 Keele 1998; Curran 1998). This interest in sequential pattern acquisition is also understandable from an evolutionary perspective: sequencing information and learning of event contingencies are fundamentally important processes without which adaptive behavior in dynamic environments would hardly be possible. From sequencing continuous speech to learning operating sequences of technical devices or acquiring the skill to play a musical instrument, learning of event sequences seems to be an essential capability of human (and artificial) cognition. It is therefore not surprising that we are witnessing a tremendous interest in sequence learning in the disciplines contributing to Cognitive Science. This chapter presents and analyses a model of sequence learning based on the ACT-R theory (Anderson 1993; Anderson u0026 Lebiere 1998). The model is rooted in, and has been successfully applied to, empirical studies using the serial reaction task that was introduced by (1987).	act-r;cognitive architecture	Christian Lebiere;Dieter Wallach	2001		10.1007/3-540-44565-X_9	psychology;cognitive model;simulation;developmental psychology;artificial intelligence	AI	-22.55612192588937	-17.726311249958147	84051

The analogical reasoning component, employing the Structure Mapping Theory from psychology, provides a flexibility to respond innovatively in unusual circumstances, in contrast with conventional approaches confined into specialized problem domains. We aim to build a mediation case base incorporating real world instances ranging from interpersonal or intergroup disputes to international conflicts.	case-based reasoning;commonsense reasoning;content adaptation;foremost;matchware mediator;mathematical optimization;ontology (information science);problem domain;problem solving;real life;requirement;tree structure	Atilim Günes Baydin;Ramón López de Mántaras;Simeon J.

A learning system must be constrained to learn efficiently, but some of these constraints are themselves learnable. To know how something will behave, a learner must know what kind of thing it is. Although this has led previous researchers to argue for domain-specific constraints that are tied to different kinds/domains, an exciting possibility is that kinds/domains themselves can be learned. General cognitive constraints, when combined with rich inputs, can establish domains, rather than these domains necessarily preexisting prior to learning. Knowledge is structured and richly differentiated, but its """"skeleton"""" must not always be preestablished. Instead, the skeleton may be adapted to fit patterns of co-occurrence, task requirements, and goals. Finally, we argue that for models of development to demonstrate genuine cognitive novelty, it will be helpful for them to move beyond highly preprocessed and symbolic encodings that limit flexibility. We consider two physical models that learn to make tone discriminations. They are mechanistic models that preserve rich spatial, perceptual, dynamic, and concrete information, allowing them to form surprising new classes of hypotheses and encodings."""	categories;circa;class;computation;domain theory;domain-specific language;emergence;navigation;note (document);organizing (structure);process modeling;requirement;rule (guideline);selective calling;speculative execution;cognitive development	Robert L.

Any inconsistency among design objectives and working procedures of heterogeneous designers interacting in the design system can result in design conflicts due to these couplings. Modeling design attitudes can help to understand inconsistencies and manage conflicts in design processes. We extend the conventional bottom-up or design supervision approach through agent-based attitude modeling techniques to a more powerful level. In our model, design agents can set requirements directly on their wellbeing values that represent how their design targets are likely to be met at a given moment of the design process. Some design conflicts can in this manner be prevented at an earlier phase of the design process. Set-based design and constraint programming techniques are used to explore the overall performance of stochastic design collaborations on a product modeled with uncertainties at a given moment of the design process. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of our set-based thinking approach, providing a variety of agent attitudes. The results show that the number of design conflicts occurring during the design process and the intensity of design conflicts are both reduced through our collaborative design platform.

After three years of development, first field tests have been carried out in 2011 by professionals such as the Rapid Deployment Unit for Salvage Operations Abroad (SEEBA). We present results from evaluating search teams in simulated USAR scenarios equipped with newly developed technical search means and digital data input terminals developed in the I-LOV project. In particular, USAR missions assisted by the “bioradar”, a ground-penetrating radar system for the detection of humanoid movements, a semi-active video probe of more than 10 m length for rubble pile exploration, a snake-like rescue robot, and the decision support system FRIEDAA were evaluated and compared with conventional USAR missions. Results of this evaluation indicate that the developed technologies represent an advantages for USAR missions, which are discussed in this paper. keywords: USAR, e ciency, information management, technical search, radar, endoscope, emergency communications.	assistive technology;data recovery;decision support system;digital data;human factors and ergonomics;information management;lov grover;radar;rescue robot;semiconductor industry;simulation;software deployment;synergy	Quirin Hamp;Omar Gorgis;Patrick Labenda;Marc Neumann;Thomas Predki;Leif Heckes;Alexander Kleiner;Leonhard M.

Training programmes involving specifically designed simulators constitute a promising approach for improving human reliability and safety in real applications. One of the world's most advanced providers of simulators for such demanding offshore operations is the Offshore Simulator Centre AS (OSC). However, even though the OSC provides powerful simulation tools, techniques for visualising operational procedures that can be used to further improve situational awareness (SA), are still lacking. In this work, an integrated multi-sensor fusion system is integrated with the OSC. The proposed system is designed to improve planning, execution and assessment of demanding maritime operations by adopting newly-designed risk-evaluation tools. Different information from the simulator scene and from the real world can be collected, such as audio, video, bio-metric data from eye-trackers, other sensor data and annotations. This integration is the base for research on novel SA assessment methodologies. A training methodology based on the concept of briefing/debriefing is adopted. By using this methodology, the efficiency of the proposed system is validated in a conceptual case study that considers the training procedure performed by Statoil and partners for the world's first sub-sea gas compression plant, in Aasgard, Norway.	british informatics olympiad;eb-eye;eye tracking;human reliability;iteration;layer (electronics);plan 9 from bell labs;sensor;simulation	Filippo Sanfilippo	2016	2016 International Conference On Cyber Situational Awareness, Data Analytics And Assessment (CyberSA)	10.1109/CyberSA.2016.7503280	simulation;systems engineering;engineering;operations management	Robotics	-24.117715338736904	-23.28905064195302	85166

Studies of division of labor are related with the collaboration of individual behavior and the group performance in terms of task performance. From the perspective of game theory, the conflicts between individual and group can be described by strategy competition, which is the motivation of the work here. Our point of departure is the proposed division of labor game model and its realization and application by robotic experiments. Results help us to investigate how this approach and involved factors influence the steady state and task performance of robots. We find that division of labor can be realized through the strategy collaboration among robots when they are required to perform a given task.	control theory;experiment;game theory;multi-agent system;rationality;robot;social system;steady state	Qiaoyu Li;Xiaolong Yang;Yuying Zhu;Jianlei Zhang	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2017.8324690	control engineering;game theory;simulation;division of labour;task analysis;robot;evolutionary game theory;mobile robot;robot kinematics;engineering;social system	Robotics	-20.926966555664652	-14.978249595493232	85674

Understanding the human point of view in continuous interaction requires an understanding of human causal reasoning, of the way in which humans perceive and structure the world, and of human cognition. We present a framework for representing human cognition, and show briefly how it relates to the analysis of structure in continuous interaction, and the ways in which it may be applied in design.	causality;cognition;observable;scott continuity	Jon May;M.

In this special issue, organised as part of the activities of the Nature-inspired Data Technology (NiDT) focus group within the European Co-ordinated Action project on Nature-inspired Smart Information Systems (NiSIS), we were seeking original contributions within an area of Nature-inspired technologies for Learning and Adaptive Systems. In the accepted comprehensive contributions this issue covers four quite distinctive, emerging areas inspired by broadly perceived nature and observed mechanisms and behaviours of natural systems. In the first of these contributions Kasabov discusses a new trend currently emerging from the research into extending the well established connectionist systems paradigm. As argued by the author, in contrast to a single brain-like connectionist principle of information processing exploited in the current connectionist systems, the proposed integrative connectionist learning systems (ICOS) integrate in their structure and learning algorithms principles from different hierarchical levels of information processing in the brain, including cognitive-, geneticand quantum-levels. The author further postulates that ICOS can be used to solve more efficiently challenging biological and engineering problems when fast adaptive learning systems are needed to incrementally learn in a large dimensional space.

Email: gudukbay@cs.bilkent.edu.tr Abstract Predicting interest points of virtual characters and accurately simulating their gaze behavior play a significant role for realistic crowd simulations. We propose a saliency model that enables virtual agents to produce plausible gaze behavior. The model measures the effects of distinct saliency features implemented by examining the state-of-the-art perception studies. When predicting an agent's interest point, we compute the saliency scores by using a weighted sum function for other agents and environment objects in the field of view of the agent for each frame. Then, we determine the most salient entity for each agent in the scene; thus, agents gain a visual understanding of their environment. Besides, our model introduces new aspects to crowd perception, such as perceiving characters as groups of people and applying social norms on crowd gaze behavior, effects of agent personality on gaze, gaze copy phenomena, and effects of agent velocity on attention. For evaluation, we compare the resulting saliency gaze model with real-world crowd behavior in captured videos. In the experiments, we simulate the gaze behavior in real crowds. The results show that the proposed approach generates plausible gaze behaviors and is easily adaptable to varying scenarios for virtual crowds.	algorithm;basic stamp;bottom-up proteomics;computation;computational model;computer engineering;crowd simulation;email;entity;experiment;game engine;intelligent agent;level of detail;norm (social);plug-in (computing);top-down and bottom-up design;velocity (software development);weight function	Umut Agil;Ugur Güdükbay	2018	Journal of Visualization and Computer Animation	10.1002/cav.1806	gaze;simulation;crowds;personality psychology;computer science	HCI	-21.7456354859391	-20.993787290537142	86230

One approach to achieve this is to equip a cloud application with a range of encyclopedic knowledge (i.e., ontologies) and execution logs of different robots performing the same tasks in different environments. In this letter, we show how knowledge exchange between robots can be done using openEASE as the cloud application. We equipped openEASE with ontologies about the kitchen domain, execution logs of three robots operating in two different kitchens, and semantic descriptions of both environments. By addressing two different use cases, we show that two PR2 robots and one Fetch robot can successfully adapt each other's plan parameters and subsymbolic data to the experiments that they are conducting.	artificial intelligence;cloud robotics;crowdsourcing;experiment;knowledge management;ontology (information science);robot;software as a service	Asil Kaan Bozcuo&#x011F;lu;Gayane Kazhoyan;Yuki Furuta;Simon Stelter;Michael Beetz;Kei Okada;Masayuki Inaba	2018	IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters	10.1109/LRA.2018.2794626	control engineering;task analysis;engineering;ontology (information science);robot;cloud robotics;semantics;cloud computing;cognition;distributed computing;use case	Robotics	-27.818322120159696	-19.798912131172543	86630

Companies operating in these and similar businesses are increasingly constructing forecasting models with which to identify potential heavy users as early as possible and create special retention measures to suit those users’ needs. In our study, we observe three digital freemium companies that sell virtual credits and investigate to what extent initial purchase information can be used to determine a given customer’s lifetime value. We find that customers represent higher future lifetime values if they (a) make a purchase early after registration, (b) spend a significant amount on their initial purchase, and (c) use credit cards to purchase credits. In addition, we see that users tend to spend increasing amounts on subsequent purchases.

The proposed framework, which is inspired by a cognitive theory called Computational Functionalism, is aimed at integrating ontology and logic based approaches to context representation and recognition. Two are the assumptions underlying the model: (1) the availability of an ontology (i.e., a “concept–role” representation of what is relevant in a given domain); (2) a simple inference scheme (i.e., subsumption between descriptions of elements within the ontology). The context model is formally defined adopting a structural approach that describes contexts and situations as hierarchical structures grounded with respect to the ontology. Examples are presented to discuss the proposed model.	cognitive model	Fulvio Mastrogiovanni;Antonio Sgorbissa;Renato Zaccaria	2010	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/s12243-010-0171-5	upper ontology;home automation;computer vision;ontology alignment;simulation;computer science;ontology;artificial intelligence;ontology;gesture recognition;ontology-based data integration;process ontology;activity recognition	AI	-27.131708985384602	-19.865721860409426	87109

However, providing stimuli that are rich and yet both reproducible and amenable to experimental manipulations is technically challenging, and even more so if a closed-loop scenario is required. In this work, we present a novel approach to solve this problem, connecting robotics and neural network simulators. We implement a middleware solution that bridges the Robotic Operating System (ROS) to the Multi-Simulator Coordinator (MUSIC). This enables any robotic and neural simulators that implement the corresponding interfaces to be efficiently coupled, allowing real-time performance for a wide range of configurations. This work extends the toolset available for researchers in both neurorobotics and computational neuroscience, and creates the opportunity to perform closed-loop experiments of arbitrary complexity to address questions in multiple areas, including embodiment, agency, and reinforcement learning.	artificial neural network;biological neural networks;cns disorder;computational neuroscience;experiment;interaction;middleware;neural network simulation;neurorobotics;operating system;real-time clock;reinforcement learning;robot;simulators;spiking neural network	Philipp Weidel;Mikael Djurfeldt;Renato C.

Such less trivial individual behaviours can be modelled either from an agent-internal perspective, in the form of direct (causal) temporal relations between internal states of the agent, or from an agent-external, behavioural perspective, in the form of more complex input-output relations for the agent. Illustrated by a case study on collective decision making, this paper addresses how the two types of agent models can be related to each other. First an internal agent model for collective decision making is presented, based on neurological principles. It is shown how by an automated systematic transformation from an internal agent model an abstracted behavioural model can be obtained, by abstracting from the internal states. The abstraction approach introduced includes specific methods for abstraction of internal loops, as often occur in neurologically inspired internal agent models, for example to be able to model mutual interaction between cognitive and affective states. As an example of a given behavioural agent model, an existing behavioural agent model for collective decision making incorporating principles on social diffusion is described. It is shown under which conditions and how by an interpretation mapping the obtained abstracted behavioural agent model can be related to this existing behavioural agent model for collective decision making.	agent-based model;causal filter	Alexei Sharpanskykh;Jan Treur	2012	Web Intelligence and Agent Systems	10.3233/WIA-2012-0257	input/output;group decision-making;computer science;artificial intelligence;agent-based social simulation	AI	-22.714704293939885	-13.518286168628224	87269
57eee358eac1de2f9154ff66111ff48622d380fd	creative interference and states of potentiality in analogy problem solving	structure;potentiality	Creative processes are widely believed to involve the generation of multiple, discrete, well-defined possibilities followed by exploration and selection. An alternative, inspired by parallel distributed processing models of associative memory, is that creativity involves the merging and interference of memory items resulting in a single cognitive structure that is ill-defined, and can thus be said to exist in a state of potentiality. We tested this hypothesis in an experiment in which participants were interrupted midway through solving an analogy problem and asked what they were thinking in terms of a solution. Naïve judges categorized their responses as AP if there was evidence of merging solution sources from memory resulting in an ill-defined idea, and SM if there was no evidence of this. Data from frequency counts and mean number of SM versus AP judgments supported the hypothesis that midway through creative processing an idea is in a potentiality state.	battle of midway;categorization;connectionism;content-addressable memory;distributed computing;interference (communication);interrupt;problem solving	Liane Gabora;Adam Saab	2011			psychology;artificial intelligence;mathematics;communication;social psychology;cognitive science	ML	-28.76775178868493	-15.11445606945562	87280

The goal of this study is to introduce the Inverse task. We consider methods of solution together with practical applications. We present a brief overview of the RGT for easy understanding of the problem. We also develop the schematic representation of the RGT inference algorithms to create the basis for softand hardware solutions of the RGT tasks. We propose a unified hierarchy of schemas to represent humans and robots. This hierarchy is considered as a unified framework to solve the entire spectrum of the RGT tasks. We conclude by illustrating how this framework can be applied for modeling of mixed groups of humans and robots. All together this provides the exhaustive solution of the Inverse task and clearly illustrates its role and relationships with other issues considered in the RGT.	algorithm;game theory;robot;schematic;unified framework	Sergey Tarasenko	2010	CoRR		game theory;spectrum;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics	Robotics	-23.53293321237412	-14.52045460265719	87591

In this paper we describe IDS, an integrated system that addresses both qualitative and quantitative discovery. The program represents its knowledge in terms of qualitative schema*, which it discovers by interacting with a simulated physical environment. Once IDS has formulated a qualitative schema, it uses that schema to design experiments and to constrain the search for quantitative laws. We have carried out preliminary tests in the domain of heat phenomena. In this context the system has discovered both intrinsic properties, such as the melting point of substances, and numeric laws, such as the conservation of mass for objects going through a phase change. I I n t r o d u c t i o n In recent years, AI researchers have developed a number of systems that operate in the domain of scientific discovery. For instance, BACON [4] discovers numerical laws (e.g., the ideal gas law) and postulates intrinsic properties of object classes (e.g., atomic weight). ABACUS [2] is similar to BACON, but employs an improved search mechanism to find numeric laws in a more efficient manner. It also improves upon BACON by identifying qualitative preconditions on quantitative laws. GLAUBER [6] addresses a different aspect of empirical discovery the formation of qualitative laws and object taxonomies. Although each of these systems is successful at its task, each addresses only part of the overall problem of empirical discovery [5], We are developing an integrated discovery system (IDS) that deals with a variety of empirical discovery tasks, including the formation of qualitative and numeric laws. Historically, qualitative discoveries have tended to lay the foundation for quantitative discoveries, but the latter can in turn lead to higher level qualitative discoveries. Our system operates in the same basic manner, first finding qualitative laws and then using them to aid in discovering quantitative relations. IDS operates in a simulated world of simple physics and chemistry, thus overcoming one deficiency of previous discovery systems. Previous systems were provided with data* and could not perform their own experiments. In contrast, IDS interacts with the simulated world through a set of effectors and sensors. Using an effector, the system can actively alter certain attributes of an object, e.g., by changing its location or heating it. Sensors let the program inspect certain attributes, such as the temperature and mass of an object. To carry out an experiment, the system applies effectors to a set of objects and uses its sensors to observe the manner in which those objects change over time. In the following section, we introduce the representation that IDS employs to state qualitative laws. After this, we examine the mechanisms by which the system discovers qualitative laws and then consider how it uses the resulting schemas to aid its discovery of numeric laws. We close with some proposals for extending the system. I I R e p r e s e n t i n g Q u a l i t a t i v e Schemas Before one can discover qualitative knowledge about the world, one must first have some way to represent that knowledge. Let us consider an example from the domain of heat phenomena. We might begin with a simple view of what happens when we heat an object, e.g., we expect the temperature of the object to increase. If we actually heat a solid, we will see that this occurs, but after some time we may also observe the appearance of a new liquid object. At this point the temperature increase stops and the mass of the liquid increases while the mass of the solid decreases. When the solid has disappeared, the temperature of the liquid begins to increase. This process continues until a new gaseous object appears. As before the mass of the gas increases while the mass of the liquid decreases, the temperature of both objects remains constant during this period. Finally, the liquid vanishes and the temperature of the gas increases, but so does its pressure. IDS represents qualitative knowledge of this type in qualitative schemas. Our representation has been influenced by Forbus' [3] qualitative process (QP) theory, with qualitative schemas corresponding to envisionments in QP theory. * Lenat's AM [7] is an exception, since it collected its own data and designs its own experiments. But the mathematical domain of AM allowed methods not easily extendable to """"real world"""" domains. 198 KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION description: solid(a) V liquid(a) quant.cond.: temp.(a) < C1 weight(a) > 0 weight (a) = C2 process: Atemp.(a) > 0 description: description: •olid(b), liquid(c) gas(d) V liquid(b), gas(c) quant.cond.: quant.cond.: wcight(d) = C2 temp.(b) = C process: weight(b) > 0 Atemp.(d) > 0 weight(b) < C2 Apressure(d) > 0 weight(c) > 0 weight(c) < C2 process: Aweight(b) < 0 Awcight(c) > 0 Figure 1: Qualitative Schema for heating an object The schemas can be viewed as finite state diagrams that describe the behavior of objects over time. States correspond to intervals of time during which objects exhibit some constant behavior. Links specify connections between states, along with the conditions that must be satisfied to enter a successor state. IDS represents each state as a frame with three slots. The description slot includes one or more classifications of the objects present in the state (e.g., solid or acid). This slot also includes structural descriptions (e.g, heater h touches object a, container a is connected to container b). The quantity-conditions slot contains statements about attributes of the objects in the state. These statements are expressed as equalities or inequalities between the quantities of attributes and limit-points (see below). The process slot is a list of zero or more changes that are occurring during the state. Like Forbus, we express a change in terms of the derivative of the changing attribute. For example, an increase in mass of object a is denoted Amass(a) > 0. A state ends only if the process reaches a limit-point, such as the melting-point, or if the agent intervenes, e.g., by turning off the heat. Limit-points are important because they are used in the quantity-conditions, and also because they form the basis for quantitative discoveries. Figure 1 presents a graphical illustration of a heat schema with the object description, the quantity-conditions, and the process for each state. Although qualitative schemas are structurally similar to the envisionments of De Kleer [1] and Forbus, there is a major difference. Envisionments are deduced from structural or process descriptions, while qualitative schemas are induced from observations. In the following section we describe this discovery process. I l l I n d u c i n g Q u a l i t a t i v e Schemas IDS begins with a simple qualitative schema for each of its effectors. For example, the initial schema of the heat effector consists of two states: sO, with one object and no active process, and sl, with an object touched by a heater and with the temperature of the object increasing. This represents IDS' initial knowledge of the results of applying the heat effector to an object. The system carries out experiments to improve its schemas, which can be refined in several ways. First, if IDS encounters unfamiliar behavior, it adds a new state to the schema along with a link connecting it to the existing states. Second, the system may discover that an existing state can follow another known state; in this case it simply adds a new link connecting the states. Furthermore, any time new limit-points are found, the system adds quantityconditions to the states. Consider again the heat example and the initial heat schema. IDS experiments by applying the heat effector to a block of ice. At first, the temperature of the ice increases, satisfying all conditions of state s1. Eventually, a new object (liquid water) appears; after this point the mass of this new object increases, while the mass of the ice decreases. IDS' heat schema does not yet contain a state for this behavior, so the system creates a new state (st) and adds it to the schema. This state has a heater and two objects, b and c. The process slot describes the qualitative behavior of the system that the mass of object 6 decreases and the mass of object c increases. Since a new limit-point has been found, quantity-conditions are added to states s1 and s2. These conditions specify that the temperature of the object in state s1 is less than some limit-point C1 and that the temperatures of the objects in state st are equal to C1. After the ice disappears, state s1 again accurately describes the current behavior. When the temperature of the liquid reaches the limit-point C1, state st adequately describes the current behavior, so the system does not change the schema at this point. When the liquid disappears, IDS encounters unseen behavior; not only does the temperature of the object increase, but so does its pressure. Thus the system creates a new state (sS) and adds it to the schema. After further experimentation using different objects, IDS discovers that the object in sS is always a gas, while the object in si is either a solid or a liquid. The object description for st is found in a similar way. This information is added, giving the final schema shown in Figure 1. One can think of this schema-building process as a datadriven search through the space of possible schemas. In these terms, adding states and links make schemas more general, while augmenting the state description and adding quantity-conditions makes them more specific. I V D i s c o v e r i n g Q u a n t i t a t i v e L a w s Once IDS has formulated a qualitative schema, it uses that knowledge to constrain the search for numeric laws.** """"In addition, schemas provide a context for numeric laws.

A common epistemic requirement in assessing whether new knowledge is actionable for decision making is its predictive power, not just its ability to explain the past. The heterogeneity and scale of data and diversity of analytical methods require data scientists to have an integrated skill set, as well as a deep understanding of the craft of problem formulation and the science required to engineer effective solutions. I shall talk about the key issues that arise in industrial strength predictive modeling, including the implications for education in this fast emerging field.

The work on Conceptual Modelling performed by our group The work on Conceptual Modelling performed by our group at PUC-Rio is surveyed, covering four mutually dependent research topics. Regarding databases as a component of information systems, we extended the scope of the Entity-Relationship model, so as to encompass facts, events and agents in a three-schemata specification method employing a logic programming formalism. Next we proceeded to render the specifications executable, by utilizing backward-chaining planners to satisfy the agents’ goals through sequences of fact-modification events. Thanks to the adoption of this plan-recognition / plan-generation paradigm, it became possible to treat both business-oriented and fictional narrative genres. To guide our conceptual modelling approach, we identified four semiotic relations, associated with the four master tropes that have been claimed to provide a system to fully grasp the world concep-	backward chaining;conceptual schema;data science;database;entity–relationship model;executable;information system;logic programming;personal and ubiquitous computing;predictive modelling;programming paradigm;semantics (computer science);semiotics;winsock	Eric Yu;Gillian Dobbie;Matthias Jarke;Sandeep Purao	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-12206-9	conceptual model	AI	-29.124006621032127	-11.012670021641119	88066

4f51fd45bac127b6125e85dfa7070b4b3244ef2a	simulation of carpooling agents with the janus platform		Carpooling is an emerging alternative transportation mode that is eco-friendly and sustainable as it enables commuters to save time, travel resource, reduce emission and traffic congestion. The procedure of carpooling consists of a number of steps namely; (i) create a motive to carpool, (ii) communicate this motive with other agents, (iii) negotiate a plan with the interested agents, (iv) execute the agreed plans, and (v) provide a feedback to all concerned agents. The state-of-the-art research work on agent-based modeling is limited to a number of technical and empirical studies that are unable to handle the complex agent behavior in terms of coordination, communication and negotiations. In this paper, we present a conceptual design of an agent-based model (ABM) for the carpooling a that serves as a proof of concept. Our model for the carpooling application is a computational model that is used for simulating the interactions of autonomous agents and to analyze the effects of change in factors related to the infrastructure, behavior and cost. In our carpooling application, we use agent profiles and social networks to initiate our agent communication model and then employ a route matching algorithm, and a utility function to trigger the negotiation process between agents. We plan to, as a part of the future work, develop a prototype of our agent-based carpooling application based on the work presented in this paper. Furthermore, we also intend to carry out a validation study of our results with real data.	agent-based model;algorithm;autonomous agent;autonomous robot;big data;computational model;computer data storage;computer science;data science;emoticon;françois lionet;interaction;janus;machine learning;network congestion;prototype;sas;scalability;simulation;social network;synthetic intelligence;utility	Stéphane Galland;Ansar-Ul-Haque Yasar;Luk Knapen;Nicolas Gaud;Tom Bellemans;Davy Janssens	2014	JUSPN	10.5383/JUSPN.05.02.002	simulation;engineering;operations management;transport engineering	AI	-20.830990025160364	-22.74468709448367	89354
5e1b330448b13081264298b32dc4add71ee12fd4	previsualization in robotics: an atomic approach		In this paper, we discuss previsualization in robotics. Previsualization is a design technique used in film industry. In previsualization, a computer animates a highly underspecified scene; thus, helping the designers to detect missing components from the scene. Previsualization can also be used in robotics for inspecting a highly underspecified model. However, for previsualization to work, it should reveal detailed dynamics not explicitly specified in the model. The details should appear as emergent dynamics. In robotics, in particular, the emergent dynamics should cover the interaction dynamics of the physical components. Such a requirement is non-trivial. The contribution of this paper is an investigation of an atomic approach that supports previsualization in robotics. The approach is based on use of atoms. Atoms obey simple, compositional interaction laws. The laws produce emergent interaction dynamics for physical components composed of atoms. We shall also illustrate in this paper how atoms, despite their simplicity, can capture compactly non-trivial collision of non-rigid strings, and how the emerging dynamics shows nevertheless also intricate details. keywords: robotics, previsualization, emergent dynamics	emergence;previsualization;robotics	Mauno Rönkkö	2004			engineering;collision;control engineering;human–computer interaction;artificial intelligence;robotics	Robotics	-29.668706902732545	-21.888313128081514	89616

Military route planning is a challenging problem in many domains such as military mission planning, simulated war games, and battlefield simulations. The simulations have levels of complexity, abstraction, and scale. In this paper we discuss a framework for modeling intelligent systems in the context of a battlefield simulation tool. We apply this framework to model a battlefield simulation comprising of enemy outposts, minefields, barriers, and platoons of soldiers in a multi-agent system to aid commanders in decision making strategies. The results shown in this paper could be used for decision making by commanders as they can visualize bottle-neck situations such as goal swapping for platoons, route planning, and strategy planning.	computer simulation;multi-agent system	Sharad K Sharma	2009	J.

However, we show that in the fast dynamic environment of robotic soccer, Plausible Logic can be used effectively to deploy non-monotonic reasoning. We show this is also possible within the frame rate of vision in the (not so powerful) hardware of the AIBO ERS-7 used in the legged league. The non-monotonic reasoning with Plausible Logic not only has algorithmic completion guarantees but we show that it effectively filters the visual input for improved robot localisation. Moreover, we show that reasoning using Plausible Logic is not restricted to the traditional value domain of discerning about objects in one frame. We present a model to draw conclusions over consecutive frames and illustrate that adding temporal rules can further enhance the reliability of localisation.	aibo;language localisation;non-monotonic logic;robot	David Billington;Vladimir Estivill-Castro;René Hexel;Andrew Rock	2006		10.1007/978-3-540-74024-7_20	statistical model;computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;sensor fusion;reasoning system	AI	-23.75986994104485	-18.02277805024079	89979

Such issues result in flawed analysis as well as misdirected human and computational effort. We put forward a methodological basis, which aims to (1) explore the utility of viewing models as adaptive agents that mediate among domain theories, data, requirements, principles, and analogies, (2) underline the role of cognitive assistance for model discovery, experimentation, and evidence evaluation so as to differentiate between competing models and to attain a balance between model exploration and exploitation, and (3) examine strategies for explanatory justification of model assumptions via cognitive models that explicate coherence judgments.	bayesian network;cognitive computing;cognitive model;computation;design of experiments;domain model;experiment;kepler;model-driven integration;requirement;self-awareness;simulation;theory	Levent Yilmaz;Sritika Chakladar;Kyle Doud;Alice E.

This might prevent the agents from making coordinated choices, purely due to their ignorance of what others want. This paper describes the integration of a learning module into a communication-intensive negotiating agent architecture. The learning module gives the agents the ability to learn about other agents’ preferences via past interactions. Over time, the agents can incrementally update their models of other agents’ preferences and use them to make better coordinated decisions. Combining both communication and learning, as two complement knowledge acquisition methods, helps to reduce the amount of communication needed on average, and is justified in situations where communication is computationally costly or simply not desirable (e.g. to preserve the individual privacy).	agent architecture;agent-based model;interaction;knowledge acquisition;multi-agent system;two's complement	Hung Hai Bui;Dorota H.

However, we start to observe promising results in the last few years as the large amount of conversation data is available for training and the breakthroughs in deep learning and reinforcement learning are applied to dialogue. In this tutorial, we start with a brief introduction to the history of dialogue research. Then, we describe in detail the deep learning and reinforcement learning technologies that have been developed for two types of dialogue systems. First is a task-oriented dialogue system that can help users accomplish tasks, ranging from meeting scheduling to vacation planning. Second is a social bot that can converse seamlessly and appropriately with humans.

1262d6c946f5e95eaea9804f791ee0cbabe971fe	reasoning with qualitative positional information for domestic domains in the situation calculus	tecnologia industrial tecnologia mecanica;tecnologia electronica telecomunicaciones;ikz121920;websearch;fuzzy sets;qualitative spatial representation;golog;reasoning;tecnologias;grupo a;situation calculus;domestic service robotics;rwth publications	In this paper, we present a thorough integration of qualitative representations and reasoning for positional information for domestic service robotics domains into our high-level robot control. In domestic settings for service robots like in the RoboCup@Home competitions, complex tasks such as “get the cup from the kitchen and bring it to the living room” or “find me this and that object in the apartment” have to be accomplished. At these competitions the robots may only be instructed by natural language. As humans use qualitative concepts such as “near” or “far”, the robot needs to cope with them, too. For our domestic robot, we use the robot programming and plan language Readylog, our variant of Golog. In previous work we extended the action language Golog, which was developed for the high-level control of agents and robots, with fuzzy set-based qualitative concepts. We now extend our framework to positional fuzzy fluents with an associated positional context called frames. With that and our underlying reasoning mechanism we can transform qualitative positional information from one context to another to account for changes in context such as the point of view or the scale. We demonstrate how qualitative positional fluents based on a fuzzy set semantics can be deployed in domestic domains and showcase how reasoning with these qualitative notions can seamlessly be applied to a fetch-and-carry task in a RoboCup@Home scenario.	action language;domestic robot;fluent (artificial intelligence);framing (world wide web);fuzzy set;high- and low-level;humans;natural language;robot control;robotics;situation calculus	Stefan Schiffer;Alexander Ferrein;Gerhard Lakemeyer	2012	Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems	10.1007/s10846-011-9606-0	simulation;qualitative reasoning;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;fuzzy set;situation calculus;reason	AI	-26.900027146501113	-19.336725932246015	91570
8716615a89558cf5f36891260f1d048a957c3b03	probabilistic simulation predicts human performance on viscous fluid-pouring problem		The physical behavior of moving fluids is highly complex, yet people are able to interact with them in their everyday lives with relative ease. To investigate how humans achieve this remarkable ability, the present study extended the classical water-pouring problem (Schwartz & Black, 1999) to examine how humans take into consideration physical properties of fluids (e.g., viscosity) and perceptual variables (e.g., volume) in a reasoning task. We found that humans do not rely on simple qualitative heuristics to reason about fluid dynamics. Instead, they rely on the perceived viscosity and fluid volume to make quantitative judgments. Computational results from a probabilistic simulation model can account for human sensitivity to hidden attributes, such as viscosity, and their performance on the water-pouring task. In contrast, non-simulation models based on statistical learning fail to fit human performance. The results in the present paper provide converging evidence supporting mental simulation in physical reasoning, in addition to developing a set of experimental conditions that rectify the dissociation between explicit prediction and tacit judgment through the use of mental simulation strategies.	black–scholes model;computation;heuristic (computer science);human reliability;machine learning;probabilistic turing machine;simulation;terminator 2: judgment day;water-pouring algorithm	James Kubricht;Chenfanfu Jiang;Yixin Zhu;Song-Chun Zhu;Demetri Terzopoulos;Hongjing Lu	2016			cognitive psychology;probabilistic logic;machine learning;viscous liquid;physics;artificial intelligence	AI	-24.119779091240815	-16.37871628063271	91603

Beyond the classical elaboration of a hierarchical representation in a series of layers, we report here inspiration from neuroscience and argue for the design of heterogenous neural networks, processing information at feature, configuration and history levels of granularity, and interacting very efficiently for high-level and complex decision making. This framework is built from known characteristics of the sensory cortex, the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex and is exemplified here in the case of pavlovian conditioning, but we propose that it can be advantageously applied in a wider extent, to design flexible and versatile information processing with neuronal computation.	artificial neural network;computation;high- and low-level;information processing;interaction	Frédéric Alexandre;Maxime Carrere;Randa Kassab	2014		10.5220/0005156003160321	classical conditioning;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computational neuroscience	ML	-25.608589883793915	-16.24785303624394	91861

In this paper, we take a different approach. If we assume that agents are autonomous (and this is a quite reasonable assumption in many practical situations, such as e-commerce), the more interesting question is: how to cope with the autonomy of agents? What are the effects on the way agents have to coordinate their behavior with other agents, and on the agent design process? And what are the effects of that (secondary effects) on the architecture of agents and agent societies. We address these questions by working out the concept of „collaboration autonomy“, and by describing an agent society model that respects this kind of autonomy.	agent-based model;autonomous robot;autonomy;e-commerce;entity;entry point;interaction;mental state;multi-agent system;opera (web browser);population;top-down and bottom-up design	Hans Weigand;Virginia Dignum	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-25928-2_18	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;autonomous agent;intelligent agent	AI	-20.897388161393085	-12.436546748851613	91862

We make the observation that experts frequently use diagrams as an efficient means of communicating detailed information. For some types of information diagrams might offer the expert an alternative to the high cost of understanding existing knowledge representation formalisms. We are interested in accomplishing three things: 1) understanding the diagramming techniques used by domain experts to encode detailed information in a restricted type of diagram called a relational diagram; 2) characterizing a set of notions that experts frequently encode in relational diagrams; 3) developing an environment that allows experts to partially construct a formal specification of problem domain knowledge by drawing relational diagrams. We describe BOS, a diagramming tool that allows domain experts to build a customized set of diagramming conventions suitable to their problem domain. Diagrams drawn with BOS generate formal specifications that reduce the need to establish the diagram's meaning through accompanying text or verbal explanation. BOS is currently able to generate frames and rules from an interesting set of relational diagrams that allow the use of spatial arrangement and connectivity to represent notions about problem domain entities, part of relations, constraints, temporal ordering, and procedural steps.	encode;entity;executable;formal specification;information diagram;knowledge representation and reasoning;problem domain	Stephen Casner;Jeffrey Bonar	1988		10.1109/WVL.1988.18023	natural language processing;computer science;knowledge management;theoretical computer science;diagramming software	SE	-30.13734339804962	-12.012689017568317	91866
619e897b0df539c8fae9b1122f304ca6875ff909	visceral machines: reinforcement learning with intrinsic rewards that mimic the human nervous system		The human autonomic nervous system has evolved over millions of years and is essential for survival and responding to threats. As people learn to navigate the world, “fight or flight” responses provide intrinsic feedback about the potential consequence of action choices (e.g., becoming nervous when close to a cliff edge or driving fast around a bend.) We present a novel approach to reinforcement learning that leverages a task-independent intrinsic reward function that mimics human autonomic nervous system responses based on peripheral pulse measurements. Our hypothesis is that such reward functions can circumvent the challenges associated with sparse and skewed rewards in reinforcement learning settings and can help improve sample efficiency. We test this in a simulated driving environment and show that it can increase the speed of learning and reduce the number of collisions during the learning stage.	autonomic computing;feedback;modulation;peripheral;programming paradigm;reinforcement learning;sparse matrix	Daniel J.

In this paper we present the basic, generic structure of a game-like procedure description, based on a prototype game for conceptual (information) modeling. The procedure has been tested and refined in a modest design cycle and has been demonstrated to work realistically. Its generic structure is meant to be applicable for different types of conceptual modeling, e.g. process modeling, goal modeling, task modeling, and so on (requiring specific rules and configurations for the different types). However, in this paper we merely aim to present our basic approach. An illustrative example is provided.	goal modeling;process modeling;prototype	Stijn Hoppenbrouwers;Rob Thijssen;Jan Vogels	2013			social science;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;management science;communication;management	HCI	-22.997790231587402	-12.003299855244963	92362
c71535c8062f9e172abc9d34c27387480510b89a	limits on the human sentence generator	human behavior;natural language	Anthony S. Kroch University of Pennsylvania The problem of language generation is the problem of translating communicative intent into linguistic form. As such, it implicates the entire richness and complexity of human cognition because, to a close approximation, whatever a person can conceive, (s)he can express in language. Computational approaches to generation have, therefore, tightly concentrated on working out, in conjunction with the linguistic disciplines of discourse analysis and pragmatics, the regularities linking communicative intent to linguistic form. In this paper, however, we will address a different problem; namely, the limits on the capacity of the human language generation mechanism to translate preverbal messages into sentences of natural language. Often functional studies of human communicative competence give the impression that people are infinitely subtle and flexible in their ability to use form to signal meaning and intent. But so long as we assume that human behavior is ultimately reduceable to the output of a machine, however complex, it must be the case that there are limits to the competence we are trying to model. If we can find these limits and characterize them theoretically, we will make a contribution to the study of human cognition and will help to circumscribe the problem of language generation by computer. While it is certainly too early in the development of linguistic science to expect a general characterization of the limits on human sentence generation, we hope to show in the brief discussion to follow that some evidence as to their nature is available and that it is reasonable to hope for progress from future empirical work.	approximation;cognition;computation;natural language generation	Anthony S.

Different scaled worlds of the same task may preserve and pare away different functional relationships. In this paper we use the example of Ned to discuss the use of scaled worlds in applied cognitive research. Ned is based on a detailed cognitive task analysis of submarine approach officers as they attempt to localize an enemy submarine hiding in deep water. For Ned we attempted to preserve the functional relationships inherent in the approach officer's information environment while paring away other aspects of his task environment. Scaled worlds attempt to maintain the realism inherent in the preserved functional relationship while being tractable for the researcher and engaging to the participant.	attempt;biologic preservation;cobham's thesis;many-worlds interpretation;task analysis	Brian D.

We present Icarus, an architecture that represents control knowledge in terms of durative states and sequences of such states. The system operates in cycles, activating a state that matches the environmental situation and letting that state control behavior until its conditions fail or until nding another matching state with higher priority. Information about the probability that conditions will remain satissed minimizes demands on sensing, as does knowledge about the durations of states and their likely successors. Three statistical learning methods let the system gradually reduce sensory load as it gains experience in a domain. We report experimental evaluations of this ability on three simulated physical tasks: ying an aircraft, steering a truck, and balancing a pole. Our experiments include lesion studies that identify the reduction in sensing due to each of the learning mechanisms and others that examine the eeect of domain characteristics.	cycle (graph theory);experiment;machine learning;physical symbol system;simulation	Pat Langley	1997		10.1145/267658.267719	computer science;distributed computing	AI	-26.319389342704543	-22.705413375405886	93386
214a2e86e13c5dea2b0aeabe151c1ab73138606a	motion as manipulation: implementation of force–motion analogies by event-file binding and action planning		Tool-improvisation analogies are structure-mapping inferences implemented, in many species, by event-file binding and pre-motor action planning. These processes act on multi-modal representations of currently perceived situations and eventuate in motor acts that can be directly evaluated for success or failure; they employ implicit representations of force–motion relations encoded by the pre-motor system and do not depend on explicit, language-like representations of relational concepts. A detailed reconstruction of the analogical reasoning steps involved in Rutherford’s and Bohr’s development of the first quantized-orbit model of atomic structure is used to show that human force–motion analogies can in general be implemented by these mechanisms. This event-file manipulation model of the implementation of force–motion analogies is distinguished from the standard view that structure-mapping analogies require the manipulation of explicit, language-like representations of relational concepts.	bohr–einstein debates;modal logic;numerous;reasoning	Chris Fields	2012	Cognitive Processing	10.1007/s10339-012-0436-1	artificial intelligence;communication;algorithm	Robotics	-24.774842233973484	-17.51700723222997	93626

4d27bd5c0206555b159d5fd09eb5763557c35bc8	new approaches to the problem of conceptual change in the learning of science and math		Concepts are not static. They change in many ways from the most simple – as in cases where a new instance is added on to an existing concept – to the most radical – as in cases that involve belief revision, ontological category shifts and changes in causality. The purpose of the present symposium is to present some of the most recent attempts to describe and explain the more radical kinds of conceptual changes that take place when students are exposed to counterintuitive concepts in science and mathematics. One important issue in conceptual change research has focused on whether conceptual change requires the revision of concepts embedded in relatively coherent „framework theories‟ (e.g.,Vosniadou, Vamvakoussi & Skopeliti, 2008) or the integration of fragmented pieces (diSessa, 2008). According to the „framework theory‟ approach, students use enrichment mechanisms to incorporate scientific information to an incompatible naive theory. Because of the incompatibility between existing knowledge structures and the new, to-be-acquired, information, such learning processes may lead either to internal consistency (and, thus, to fragmentation) or to the formation of misconceptions. In recent work, Brown and Hammer (2008) propose that the knowledge system should be seen as consisting of dynamic cognitive structures which arise from the interactions of smaller conceptual elements. They claim that such a complex systems perspective can integrate the differences between the fragmentation vs. coherence accounts. Another recent debate in this area concerns Chi‟s (2008) categorical shift hypothesis vs. Ohlsson‟s (2011) resubsumption hypothesis to explain the processes thereby which learners abandon their prior beliefs because they are inconsistent with currently accepted scientific explanations. As noticed by Ohlsson (2009) such non-monotonic changes are difficult to promote with instruction and have a low probability of occurring spontaneously. According to the resubsumption hypothesis, when a learner comes to realize that an alternative theory, developed to make sense in one domain, may be preferable in order to explain a phenomenon which applies to some other domain, s/he will subsume the phenomenon under the alternative theory. This process depends on the recognition of similarities rather than on being confronted with anomalies. In contrast, according to the category shift hypothesis, a concept is categorized under the wrong category in the first place and conceptual change is brought about by noticing the anomalies caused by this mis-categorization. Even though these arguments are important for understanding conceptual change processes they have had little presence in the meetings of the Cognitive Science Society so far. The aim of this symposium is to bring some of the current discussions and different perspectives on conceptual change to the attention of the cognitive science audience. All the speakers are key developers of the different approaches and have led their development.	belief revision;categorization;causality;cognitive science;coherence (physics);complex systems;embedded system;fragmentation (computing);gene ontology term enrichment;interaction;knowledge-based systems;software incompatibility;theory	Stella Vosniadou;Michellene T.

26e2081a360a9a166c2eca90e7042db16e50d294	retracted article: from the human visual system to the computational models of visual attention: a survey		With the emerging interest in active vision, computer vision researchers have been increasingly concerned with the mechanisms of attention. Therefore, a number of visual attention computational models, inspired by the Human Visual System (HVS), have been developed. These models aim to detect regions of interest in images. In recent decades, psychologists, neurobiologists and engineers have investigated visual attention and their cooperation has resulted in considerable benefits. However, the interdisciplinarity of the subject has not only benefits but also difficulties, since the concepts of different fields are often difficult to access due to differences in vocabulary and lack of knowledge of relevant literature. The purpose of this paper is to bring together concepts and ideas from these different research areas. It provides an extensive survey of biological research on HVS, as well as the state-of-art on computational models of visual attention (bottom-up). The methods are presented depending on their classification: biological plausible, computational or hybrid.

Authorities argue that syndromic surveillance, or the monitoring of prediagnostic health-related data for early detection of nascent outbreaks, is crucial to preventing massive illness and death. Syndromic surveillance could prevent widespread illness and death, but public-health analysts face many technical barriers. To meet syndromic surveillance's complex operational and research needs, and as part of DARPA'S national biosurveillance technology program, we've developed BioSTORM (the biological spatio-temporal outbreak reasoning module). BioSTORM is an experimental end-to-end computational framework that integrates disparate data sources and deploys various analytic problem solvers to support public health analysts in interpreting surveillance data and identifying disease outbreaks. BioSTORM can help them by supporting ontology-based data integration and problem-solver deployment.	end-to-end principle;ontology-based data integration;software deployment;solver	Monica Crubézy;Martin J.

Since animats bear little structural resemblance to biological systems, it isn’t clear what animat models are models of. In this paper I identify and defend a central epistemic presupposition behind animat research; the claim that modellers can acquire new knowledge about biological systems without modelling their specific underlying mechanisms. I cast the critiques of animat research offered by Webb and Bechtel as forms of a general skeptical challenge to this presupposition and show how it could be met by an appeal to multiply-realisable behaviour types. I then outline a means of specifying such types dynamically.	animat;biological system;quantum information;scott continuity;theory	Derek Jones	2012	J. Exp. Theor. Artif.

Appearances can be deceiving; this course tackles serious issues in engineering and science education. In this course, students design, build, program and test their own autonomous robots that participate in a public competition. This course uses robotics to foster a hands-on, interdisciplinary, teamwork-oriented approach to the synthesis and analysis of integrated real-world systems, as well as teaching new approaches to robot control. Created in 1995, our Autonomous Robotics course grew out of ongoing research on biologically inspired robotics at CWRU [3]. The design of this course draws heavily on technology developed at MIT, first for K–12 education [11] and later for an undergraduate course similar to ours that has been offered since 1990 [8]. Related courses have been developed at the University of Edinburgh [7] and elsewhere. Two features of our course distinguish it from these other courses. First, our final competition is considerably more technically demanding. Second, we address a much broader set of educational goals. Our course attracts students from computer engineering and science, biology, electrical engineering, neuroscience, systems engineering, biomedical engineering, and physics. In this article, we describe the educational goals of the course, its overall design, the final competition, and student assessment.	autonomous robot;computer engineering;electrical engineering;hands-on computing;robot control;robotics;systems engineering;world-system	Randall D.

The cognition-based human intelligence, that is driven by emotion and feeling will definitely change the robot learning, memory, attention and decision making mechanism. The aim of paper is to give in depth investigation on how the robot learning based on emotion and feeling will give a new dimension to its performance. It means that self-learning is not just dependent upon a logical brain and proper embodiment; rather a feedback in terms of emotion and feeling based on experience is required for self-learning. It is the feedback in the form of feeling and emoti on that plays a vital role in a complete self-learning process and this makes the robot more human. Keywords: emotion, intelligence, service robot, dynamical system, feeling of pain, mobile-robot. 1 Introduction “Learning” is a beautiful word, but it's hard to implement into robots. Contextual decision-making is required in a dynamical environment when we are asked to take care of everything around the house. At home, everything is drastically changing including rules which family members had just shared it yesterday. The change of rules is sometime non-logical and may occur depending on emotional fluctuations in mum’s policy, or dad’s whims. Classifications of assumptions, parameters and variables are necessary to form a learning paradigm and provide its implementation method into engineering systems. In cognitive science and psychology, child’s cognitive development has been studied from observations of child’s behavior and acquisitions of various skills. Jean Piaget [1] focused on the transitions of learning schemes during the developmental process and noticed an organized pattern of thought and behavior, called “schema.” On the other hand, what factors exist in child’s mind subjectively, as well-established knowledge or ill-defined borders, remains unsolved. This is the gap between objective and subjective representations. Science basically needs repeatability, objectivity and quantitative assessment. Repeatability is the base to confirm whether it is true or not by reproduction of the	home safety;point of view (computer hardware company);robot;robotics	Gyanendra Nath Tripathi;David Chik;Hiroaki Wagatsuma	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-42054-2_66	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics	Robotics	-27.49892830398824	-16.17266541693824	95271

However, the interaction with these machines is still too artificial. Usually, these machines are insensitive to the emotional content being expressed by the communication partner, as well as incapable of expressing emotional content. This paper presents the architecture of a computational system to simulate emotional states. The simulator is split up in three modules that provide to the designer a great number of possibilities to model different aspects of a simulated emotional personality. The model of transition between different emotions is based on a Fuzzy Finite States Machine. This allows the system to be in several emotional states simultaneously with certain degree. As a demonstration of concept, we present a prototype where the emotional content is based on the environmental conditions of light and temperature.	avatar (computing);computation;human computer;human–computer interaction;natural language;prototype;simulation	Albert van der Heide;Gracián Triviño	2010	International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5583943	natural language processing;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;fuzzy set;finite-state machine;natural language	Robotics	-22.724235951047284	-19.71857155496983	95559

Dynamic and integrative epistemology uphold that knowing leads to accumulating insights though information processing. Knowing is a unified but fourfold process of experiencing, understanding, judging and acting (Lonergan, 1990). It occurs at four levels of consciousness: the empirical, the intellectual, the evaluative and the pragmatic (Lonergan, 1990). Dynamic and integrative epistemology extends rationality, knowledge and intelligence to non-humans because institutions have substantive, structural, behavior and teleological dimensions and processes that enable them to process information, i.e. to know.rnrnrnrnrnResearch limitations/implicationsrnrnrnrnrnTranslating a conceptual paper into practical action, organizational structuring or product design can be difficult.rnrnrnrnrnPractical implicationsrnrnrnrnrnExtending the concept of rationality to non-humans implies realizing that human abilities are limited and need to be augmented by proper institutional design and artificial tools.rnrnrnrnrnSocial implicationsrnrnrnrnrnThe design of intelligent organizations, societies and artificial tools.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality valuernrnrnrnrnNormative epistemology which considers reason and faith, empirical (experience) and rational (understanding), positive (facts) and ideal (principles, representations or wishes), physical (objects) and “mental” (ideas or concepts), practice and theory, knowledge (episteme) and opinion (doxa), reflection and action as opposed and mutually exclusive can be replaced by a dynamic and integrative epistemology which puts emotional, intellectual, evaluative and pragmatic dimensions of human knowing in an order of succession through a unified but yet differentiated process which can be augmented by non-human “experts”.	rationality	Stanislas Bigirimana	2017	Kybernetes	10.1108/K-10-2016-0275	normative;management science;social epistemology;formal epistemology;evolutionary epistemology;rationality;epistemology of wikipedia;meta-epistemology;episteme;mathematics	AI	-25.398627303348	-12.557329008819647	95610

However, I argue that computation is in fact incompatible with this alleged aspect of intentional explanation, and hence the foundational assumptions of orthodox cognitive science are mutually unstable. The most plausible way to relieve these foundational tensions is to relinquish the idea that the psychological level enjoys some special form of theoretical sovereignty. So, in contrast to well known antireductionist views based on multiple realizability, I argue that the primary goal of a computational approach to the mind should be to facilitate a translation of the psychological to the neurophysiological.	autonomy;cognitive science;computation;control theory;mind;programming paradigm	Paul Schweizer	2001	Synthese	10.1023/A:1005203928401	functionalism;computational theory of mind;reduction;philosophy;epistemology;mathematics;autonomy;neurophysiology	AI	-25.64694085654698	-12.749960169752462	95970

We pose a central question: Which is worse - a loss of available information due to stress, or the acquisition of misinformation due to stress? This question is addressed by modeling a modified IETAL agent in the MASIVE environment for which imitation-based learning is affected by stress. We present an algebraic representation of the modified agent, thus giving an extension of earlier work designed to explore learning phenomena in human subjects. Our goal is to break ground in a new direction in order to develop a richer theory based on our previous work in the domain of cognitive robotics and multiagent systems.	agent-based model;cognitive robotics;linear algebra;multi-agent system;theory	Goran P.

1cb274e49ec2c3f954657326f1ebf8ef37e41b5a	a stimulus-response framework for robot control	task switching;stimulus response model;intelligent interaction;behavior adaptation	We propose in this article a new approach to robot cognitive control based on a stimulus-response framework that models both a robot’s stimuli and the robot’s decision to switch tasks in response to or inhibit the stimuli. In an autonomous system, we expect a robot to be able to deal with the whole system of stimuli and to use them to regulate its behavior in real-world applications. The proposed framework contributes to the state of the art of robot planning and high-level control in that it provides a novel perspective on the interaction between robot and environment. Our approach is inspired by Gibson’s constructive view of the concept of a stimulus and by the cognitive control paradigm of task switching. We model the robot’s response to a stimulus in three stages. We start by defining the stimuli as perceptual functions yielded by the active robot processes and learned via an informed logistic regression. Then we model the stimulus-response relationship by estimating a score matrix that leads to the selection of a single response task for each stimulus, basing the estimation on low-rank matrix factorization. The decision about switching takes into account both an interference cost and a reconfiguration cost. The interference cost weighs the effort of discontinuing the current robot mental state to switch to a new state, whereas the reconfiguration cost weighs the effort of activating the response task. A choice is finally made based on the payoff of switching. Because processes play such a crucial role both in the stimulus model and in the stimulus-response model, and because processes are activated by actions, we address also the process model, which is built on a theory of action. The framework is validated by several experiments that exploit a full implementation on an advanced robotic platform and is compared with two known approaches to replanning. Results demonstrate the practical value of the system in terms of robot autonomy, flexibility, and usability.	action theory (philosophy);automated planning and scheduling;autonomous system (internet);experiment;high- and low-level;interference (communication);logistic regression;mental state;process modeling;programming paradigm;robot control;usability	Mario Gianni;Geert-Jan M.

The robot arm is a low-cost prototype, initially controlled with a joystick. The aim of the project is, first, to design and implement a full control system for the robot, including the necessary circuitry for microcomputer (ARM Cortex)-based control and, second, to pit the designed robot in competition against other students' robots. Incorporation of multidisciplinary PBL required changes in the organization of the course, which features various learning activities and their continuous evaluation; it also required knowledge of five other courses in the AEE program.

This is in sharp contrast with present approaches that detect deception based on physiological factors, as well as on verbal and non-verbal cues. Our approach attempts to model agents and their actions. This is achieved in a logic programming framework using a theory of agents, a theory of actions, and a theory of reasoning with respect to time. As a test case, a children's mystery is analyzed and implemented. The software correctly reasons about who the potential suspects are, and ultimately, correctly identifies the chief culprit. Further, it can correctly introspect with regard to previously held beliefs. Our approach is novel in that it attempts to identify deception on the basis of actions, and it does so in a high level, symbolic reasoning framework	high-level programming language;introspection;logic programming;symbolic computation;test case;theory	James D.

I ask what sort of things these computer-generated organisms are supposed to be (where are they, and what are they made of?). I consider four possible answers to this question: (a) The organisms are abstract complexes of pure information; (b) they are material objects made of bits of computer hardware; (c) they are physical processes going on inside the computer; and (d) they are denizens of an entire artificial world, different from our own, that the programmer creates. I argue that (a) could not be right, that (c) collapses into (b), and that (d) would make strong alife either absurd or uninteresting. Thus, virtual strong alife amounts to the claim that, by programming a computer, one can literally bring bits of its hardware to life.	artificial life;computer hardware;computer-generated holography;computers;emoticon;organism;physical phenomenon or property;physical object;programmer device component	Eric T.

Here, we present a new kind of representational change associated with analogical reminding called packing. We derived the algorithm in part from human data we have on packing. Here, we explain packing and its role in analogy making, and then present a computer model of packing in a micro-domain. We conclude that packing is likely used in human chance discoveries, and is needed if our machines are to make their own chance discoveries.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;categorization;cognition;cognitive science;computer simulation;constraint satisfaction;fits;fly-by-wire;humans;interface metaphor;kepler;mind;numerical weather prediction;p (complexity);reasoning system;relevance;sensitivity and specificity;set packing;structure mapping engine	Eric Dietrich;Arthur B.

2b157560e715bab787c63cd061fcfd9454d54ebd	beyond distributed cognition: towards a taxonomy of nonreductive social cognition		Studies of social cognition often assume a reductionist, computational-representational conceptual framework. Distributed cognition is one of the few extant conceptual frameworks for a nonreductive understanding of social cognition. This concept’s prototypical cases are exclusively of technical-scientific human institutions, including ships, cockpits, and the Hubble Space Telescope. In the first part of the paper, we outline the properties of distributed cognitive systems. We look at the case of wolf (Canis lupus) packs as an instance of distributed cognition in nonhuman systems. Nevertheless, a broad range of social cognitive phenomena across human and animal populations may not fit into this conceptual framework. We present a case study of bird flocks as a counterexample to distributed cognition. We propose “swarm intelligence” as an alternative concept of nonreductive social cognition. This is not to replace distributed cognition as a concept, but to add to and diversify the taxonomy of nonreductive social cognitive systems.	artificial intelligence;distributed cognition;flocking (behavior);population;reductionism;social cognition;swarm intelligence	Zachariah A.

12c8d7bba58b25c58663581ab5cab0ac12a22b6e	operations research methods in constraint programming	operations research;constraint programming	A number of operations research (OR) methods have found their way into constraint programming (CP). This development is entirely natural, since OR and CP have similar goals. OR is essentially a variation on the scientific practice of mathematical modeling. It describes phenomena in a formal language that allows one to deduce consequences in a rigorous way. Unlike a typical scientific model, however, an OR model has a prescriptive as well as a descriptive purpose. It represents a human activity with some freedom of choice, rather than a natural process. The laws of nature become constraints that the activity must observe, and the goal is to maximize some objective subject to the constraints. CP’s constraint-oriented approach to problem solving poses a prescriptive modeling task very similar to that of OR. CP historically has been less concernedwith finding optimal than feasible solutions, but this is a superficial difference. It is to be expected, therefore, that OR methods would find application in solving CP models. There remains a fundamental difference, however, in the way that CP and OR understand constraints. CP typically sees a constraint as a procedure, or at least as invoking a procedure, that operates on the solution space, normally by reducing variable domains. OR sees a constraint set as a whole cloth; the solution algorithm operates on the entire problem rather than the constraints in it. Both approaches have their advantages. CP can design specialized algorithms for individual constraints or subsets of constraints, thereby exploiting substructure in the problem that OR methods are likely to miss. OR algorithms, on the other hand, can exploit global properties of the problem that CP can only partially capture by propagation through variable domains.	algorithm;constraint (mathematics);constraint programming;feasible region;formal language;mathematical model;operations research;problem solving;software propagation;the superficial	John N.

126ce0bb9a2363f8b56fa00cad513755ea6e8d47	conceptual blending in el++		The cognitive theory of conceptual blending models human creativity as a mental process that combines two mental spaces into a new mental space, called a blend. According to this theory, a blend is constructed by taking the commonalities among the input mental spaces into account, to form a so-called generic space, and by projecting their non-common structure in a selective way to the novel blended space. In this paper, we apply this idea to blend input spaces modeled as complex EL concepts. To construct the generic space of two EL concepts, these need to be generalised in a controlled manner. For this, we propose an upward refinement operator that is used for finding common generalisations of EL concepts.	algorithm;alpha compositing;blended space;cognitive science;computational creativity;embedded system;essence;ontology (information science);recursion;refinement (computing);requirement	Roberto Confalonieri;Marco Schorlemmer;Oliver Kutz;Rafael Peñaloza;Enric Plaza;Manfred Eppe	2016				HCI	-25.767236098662003	-13.976877606995451	98638

Maes, among others, has argued against mechanisms of this type because of the top-down control and lack of robustness inherent in these hierarchical decision structures, or rigid switching mechanisms, in which decisions are made at every level. Two alternatives exist to these hierarchical decision structures: Maes and others have designed non-hierarchical action selection mechanisms, and Rosenblatt and Payton have outlined a hierarchical mechanism that does not make decisions at every level. In this article, use of the two types of hierarchies for action selection is discussed, and the Rosenblatt and Payton approach—with free flow of information, combination of evidence, and the ability to select compromise candidates—is supported. It is also argued that the problem of action selection is, by nature, intrinsically hierarchical, and so Rosenblatt and Payton-like hierarchies (f...	action selection	Toby Tyrrell	1993	Adaptive Behaviour	10.1177/105971239300100401	psychology;computer simulation;action selection;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;social psychology;hierarchy	Vision	-23.93518200221694	-15.221694611837378	98819

In our approach the environment is described, from a symbolic point of view, by means of a graph; clustering techniques allow for further levels of abstraction to be defined, leading to a multi-layered representation. In this work we propose an unsupervised exploration algorithm in which several agents cooperate to acquire knowledge of the environment at the different abstraction levels; a broadcast model is adopted for inter-agent communication. All agents are structurally equal and pursue the same local exploration strategy; nevertheless, the existence of multiple levels of abstraction in the environment representation allows for the agents' behaviours to differentiate. Agents carry out exploration at different abstraction levels, aimed at reproducing an ideal exploration profile; each agent selects dynamically its exploration level, based on the current demand.	abstraction layer;algorithm;autonomous agent;autonomous robot;cluster analysis;graph (discrete mathematics);inter-process communication;multi-agent system;principle of abstraction;term (logic);unsupervised learning	Dario Maio;Stefano Rizzi	1995			simulation;computer science;machine learning;communication	AI	-19.324484689735915	-14.64685507841129	99028
6d24eb79f6d6808c5e6257734ab0fee2f854d7fc	unified learning to enhance adaptive behavior of simulation objects		Modeling and simulation are methods of validating new systems that are risky to be directly deployed in the real world. During the simulation, the simulation environment continuously changes and simulation objects correspondingly behave according to the changing situations. In general, modeling the behavior for all possible situations is extremely difficult when the rationale is unknown. Therefore, in order to adapt to the changing situation, it is important to recognize the rationale behind the behaviors of the simulation object. However, in many cases, even though the rationale is unknown or difficult to recognize, the simulation requires reasonable behaviors such as a commander’s decision in a war game simulation and a driver’s behavior in rush hours. In this study, we propose a new approach to determine the behavior of simulation objects under changing situations. The proposal is a unified learning approach that integrates two methods, data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches, which allow simulatio...	adaptive behavior;simulation	Hyo-Cheol Lee;Seok-Won Lee	2018	Simulation	10.1177/0037549717753880	real-time computing;human–computer interaction;case-based reasoning;adaptive behavior;computer science;modeling and simulation	Robotics	-23.544750540483925	-20.428311019779464	99309

Our research aims at improving requirements engineering for such networks by not just representing these goals and dependencies statically, but also by studying the dynamic interactions between both. In previous work, we proposed the prototype environment SNet for the representation and dynamic simulation of agent-based designs for inter-organizational networks. A key feature of SNet was the automatic translation of extended i* models into the action language ConGolog. While this allowed the simulation of agent networks specified in i*, the resulting agents were purely reactive. In this paper we explicitly incorporate deliberation into the agent design of SNet. At the level of i*, deliberation is represented in terms of goals which are satisfiable by different tasks or agents. Utilities are modeled, in part, using the existing concept of softgoals, which are given a quantitative interpretation. At the level of ConGolog, decisiontheoretic features are built into the interpreter, which drives the simulations, and the process of delegating tasks to other agents is explicitly represented.	action language;agent-based model;business process;database;intelligent agent;interaction;machine translation;prototype;requirements engineering;simulation	Günter Gans;Matthias Jarke;Gerhard Lakemeyer;Dominik Schmitz	2005	Inf.

d72f33e4f9ce21aa6e3042cf94c5feda3ac61c2d	modelling prior and retrospective awareness of actions		Agents often may prepare for and perform actions without being conscious of these processes. However, in other cases, at some point in time the agent can develop some awareness state relating to the action. This can be an awareness state prior to the execution of the action. An awareness state can also develop in retrospect, after the action was performed. In this paper a neurologically inspired agent model is introduced that is able to make such distinctions. Scenarios are covered in which actions are prepared without being conscious at any point in time. Also scenarios are covered in which the agent develops proir awareness or retrospective awareness, or both. When prior awareness is developed it may be the case that this awareness has a decisive effect on actually executing the action, but it may equally well be the case that the awareness state has no effect on whether the action is performed. All these variations have been illustrated by a wide variety of simulation experiments.	experiment;retrospect (software);simulation	Dilhan J.

The concept applies to any sensorimotoric apparatus. Empowerment as a measure reflects the properties of the apparatus as long as they are observable due to the coupling of sensors and actuators via the environment.	as-interface;information theory;observable;utm theorem	Alexander S.

This paper will show that the use of `subcognitive ’ questions allows the standard Turing Test to indirectly probe the human subcognitive associative concept network built up over a lifetime of experience with the world. Not only can this probing reveal diŒerences in cognitive abilities, but crucially, even diŒerences in physical aspects of the candidates can be detected. Consequently, it is unnecessary to propose even harder versions of the Test in which all physical and behavioural aspects of the two candidates had to be indistinguishable before allowing the machine to pass the Test. Any machine that passed the `simpler ’ symbols-in}symbols-out test as originally proposed by Turing would be intelligent. The problem is that, even in its original form, the Turing Test is already too hard and too anthropocentric for any machine that was not a physical, social and behavioural carbon copy of ourselves to actually pass it. Consequently, the Turing Test, even in its standard version, is not a reasonable test for general machine intelligence. There is no need for an even stronger version of the Test.	artificial intelligence;cognition;experience;humans;soft-in soft-out decoder;turing machine;turing test	Robert M. French	2000	J. Exp. Theor.

695803ca5bc617a90e4e3a8269aaa0181a78c03d	interfacing a cognitive agent platform with second life	discussion paper	Second Life is a multi-purpose online virtual world that provides a rich platform for remote human interaction. It is increasingly being used as a simulation platform to model complex human interactions in diverse areas, as well as to simulate multi-agent systems. It would therefore be beneficial to provide techniques allowing high-level agent development tools, especially cognitive agent platforms such as belief-desire-intention (BDI) programming frameworks, to be interfaced to Second Life. This is not a trivial task as it involves mapping potentially unreliable sensor readings from complex Second Life simulations to a domain-specific abstract logical model of observed properties and/or events. This paper investigates this problem in the context of agent interactions in a multi-agent system simulated in Second Life. We present a framework which facilitates the connection of any multi-agent platform with Second Life, and demonstrate it in conjunction with an extension of the Jason BDI interpreter.	belief–desire–intention software model;cognitive module;high- and low-level;interaction;jason;multi-purpose viewer;multi-agent system;programming tool;second life;simulation;virtual world	Surangika Ranathunga;Stephen Cranefield;Martin K.

Finally, we present the performance of our algorithm on the four major variants of the RPM tests, illustrating the impact of confidence.

It proposes to replace the conventional metaphor—a sequence of steps—with the notion of a community of interacting entities, and examines the ramifications of such a shift on these various ways in which we think. 1 Computation's Central Metaphor In every endeavor that we undertake, we rely on a set of implicit or explicit principles that guide our understanding and shape our course of action. In computer science, one such idea is what I will call the computational metaphor. The computational metaphor is an image of how computing works—or what computing is made of—that serves as the foundation for our understanding of all things computational. Perhaps because computation plays a central role in modern culture, the computational metaphor extends beyond computer science and plays a role both in other disciplines and in our everyday understanding of the world around us. This paper addresses the need for a fundamental shift in the computational metaphor. This shift is motivated by changes in the nature of computation as practiced and the inefficacy of the traditional computational metaphor in describing current practice. We are standing at the cusp of what Thomas S. Kuhn called a paradigm shift, in which the very foundations of our field are being reconceived. This has profound implications for all aspects of our understanding of computational science and, given its central role in modern thought, for our broader understanding as well. What is the computational metaphor? I think that it goes something like this: Computation is a function from its inputs to its output. It is made up of a sequence of functional steps that produce—at its end—some result that is its goal. This is what I was taught when I was trained as a computer scientist. It is a model that computer scientists by and large take for granted. It is something the members of the field share. Sometimes we refer to it as Turing's or von Neumann's model; both men were influential in elucidating this particular way of thinking about computation. Although Turing’s machine was abstract and von Neumann’s concrete, each outlined a Lynn Andrea Stein Challenging the Computational Metaphor 2 mechanism of execution that was strikingly centralized, sequential and result-oriented (Turing 1936; von Neumann 1945). Figure 1 depicts this image of computation iconically, highlighting several of its major features. Computation is composed of steps. These steps are combined by temporal sequencing. The computational process is evaluated by looking at its result (and, to some extent, its resource utilization). To a first approximation, the computation's result characterizes the computation. Throughout this paper, I shall refer to this as the calculation model of computation. This computational metaphor is an image by which we understand our field. It is a common reference model that encodes how computer scientists see what we do and how we think about our work. Computer scientists frequently use this model even when talking about systems that are not, strictly speaking, sequential. The traditional computational metaphor preaches that—for almost all purposes—there is a single thread of control and the programmer owns it. The programmer’s problem is to figure out what happens next. The metaphor encourages us to ignore the fact that computers are actually built out of analog components. It obscures the fact that each component is fallible. It hides the ways in which the computer is physically coupled into the world, and largely ignores any systems—social or mechanical or otherwise—within which the computation is embedded. As seen through this sequentialist metaphor, computation is a sort of glorified calculation. A computer is, in this view, an extremely sophisticated (symbol-processing) abacus. Historically, this is entirely appropriate. The first “computors” were people assigned to perform mathematical calculations; mechanical computers were machines that simulated the mathematical processing of these human calculators. Although some early computers were used in actual physically coupled control systems, more frequently they were used to provide data to human decision makers. The calculation model of computation goes hand-in-hand with the idea of black box (or procedural) abstraction. This is the equation of a computation with the functional result that it computes over its input. Black-box abstraction is a powerful technique that permits reasoning about systems at a fairly high level, e.g., combining functional pieces without considering the details of their implementations. Without black-box abstraction, it is difficult to imagine that much of the history of modern software development would have been possible. 1 This is, of course, an exaggeration. Both resource utilization and side effects play a significant role in our evaluation of a computation. Nonetheless, the functional behavior of a computation is generally taken to be its most salient identifying characteristic. Further, taking a suitably broad reading of the term """"result""""—subsuming both resource utilization and side effects—does not materially affect the point I wish to make here. 2 In an otherwise forward-thinking book, Carriero and Gelernter explicitly equate programming and problem-solving at the beginning of their How to Write Parallel Programs (1990). This is in spite of the fact that the book discusses techniques that the authors believe to be at least as well suited to interactive, distributed, and endpoint-less computation. Lynn Andrea Stein Challenging the Computational Metaphor 3 A corollary of this approach is modular-functionalism. Since a computation is defined in terms of the functional result that it computes over its input, each piece of calculation can be identified with its associated function. Modular-functionalism is a method for constructing systems in which the problem is decomposed into its constituent functions and a solution is constructed by sequencing calculations associated with each of the constituent functions. That is, the structural decomposition of the program is identical to the functional decomposition of the problem that it solves. Within the context of computation-as-calculation, modular-functionalism seems almost tautological. Later in this paper, we will see an alternate view of computation in which modular-functionalism is only one possible approach. This approach is also consonant with Turing's abstract machine, with its step-at-a-time processing, or von Neumann's architecture for manipulating memory-based data. Hendriks-Jansen (1996) has observed that Turing worked at the time of, and was quite possibly influenced by, the advent of assembly line manufacturing. Von Neumann maintained a clean separation between instruction and data while placing both squarely within the machine’s memory. This prefigures the 1960s and 70s notions of pure “thought” (process) operating on memory-based data, and stands in stark contrast to the messy intertwining more typical of 1940s and 50s cybernetics and early control systems. 2 The Power o f the Paradigm The tremendous simplifications afforded by the traditional computational metaphor were historically crucial. From the digital abstraction to procedural abstraction, from high level languages to abstract program design, the conceptual vocabulary of computer science today was facilitated by the computational metaphor. As a consequence, computer technology has revolutionized much of the world. Certainly, the computational metaphor enabled computer science to focus on the organization of sequences of steps into larger functional units without worrying about transient voltage levels or multiple simultaneous transitions within the hardware. This way of thinking about computation also let us ignore the occasional power fault, the mechanical misfire, delays in operator feedback, or other human activities. By hiding the details of hardware's actual behavior behind artifices such as the digital abstraction, tremendous advances in computational science were made possible. If we had to directly manage the variations in voltage across each individual component in our computer’s motherboard, we would be hard pressed to write even small programs. The digital abstraction—looking at those voltages only when in stable configurations and even then regarding them as ones and zeros—allows us to treat the computer as a discrete logical artifact. The von Neuman machine architecture and, in turn, higher level programming languages, were subsequent advances that removed us still further from the actual analog machine. Memory mapping is a technique that allows us to access complex peripheral devices—often containing their own processors—as though they were simple storage cells. Lynn Andrea Stein Challenging the Computational Metaphor 4 Or consider parallel programming. Parallel processors today are benchmarked on how well they emulate the ideal of a sequential machines (while improving its performance). A particularly extreme example of this approach is automatic program parallelization. This is an attempt to make multiple processors look, to the programmer, like a single sequential machine of much the sort that the computational metaphor prescribes. That is, it is a way to enable a programmer to harness the power of multiple processors without ever knowing that there are many things going on at once. The structures contributed by Turing's and von Neumann's machines were tremendously empowering during computation’s first half-century, and not just for computer science itself. The computational metaphor also plays a major role in shaping how we, our students, and colleagues in other disciplines, see computation.

Since decisions are based on an individualâ€™s mental model, improving decision quality is a function of discovering the decision makerâ€™s mental model, and updating and/or enhancing it with new knowledge; that is, the purpose of decision support is knowledge creation. This article suggests that BI techniques can be applied to knowledge creation as an enabling technology. Specifically, the authors propose a business intelligence design theory for DSS as knowledge creation, a prescriptive theory based on Nonakaâ€™s knowledge spiral that indicates how BI can be focused internally on the decision maker to discover and enhance his/her mental model and improve the quality of decisions.

Further, evolutionary progress can be measured in real time instead of in generation based evaluation cycles. By combining embodied evolution with lifetime learning, we investigated a largely neglected aspect with respect to the common assumption that learning can guide evolution, the influence of maturation time during which an individual can develop its behavioral skills. Even though we found only minor differences between the evolution with and without learning, our results, derived from competitive evolution in predatorprey systems, demonstrate that the right timing of maturation is crucial for the progress of evolutionary success. Our findings imply that the time of maturation has to be considered more seriously as an important factor to build up empirical evidence for the hypothesis that learning facilitates evolution.	evolution;real-time computing;robot	Steffen Wischmann;Kristin Stamm;Florentin Wörgötter	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74913-4_29	empirical evidence;computer science;artificial intelligence	AI	-19.812014490562877	-18.732442312748624	101572

To be useful for a purposeful agent, these explanations must also capture the scene in terms of the functional properties of its objects|their purposes, uses, and a ordances for manipulation. Design knowledge describes how the world is organized to suit these functions, and causal knowledge describes how these arrangements work. We have been exploring the hypothesis that vision is an explanatory process in which causal and functional reasoning plays an intimate role in mediating the activity of low-level visual processes. In particular, we have explored two of the consequences of this view for the construction of purposeful vision systems: Causal and design knowledge can be used to 1) drive focus of attention, and 2) choose between ambiguous image interpretations. Both principles are at work in SPROCKET, a system which visually explores simple machines, integrating diverse visual clues into an explanation of a machine's design and function. Visual understanding A fundamental purpose of vision is to relate a scene to the viewer's beliefs about how the world ought to be|to \make sense"""" of the scene. Understanding is the preparation we make for acting, hence our beliefs are fundamentally causal in nature; they describe the world's capacity for action and change. \Making sense"""" of a scene means assessing its potential for action, whether instigated by the agent, or set in motion by forces already present in the world.

On one hand, some fundamental requisites for a theory of mind in society are presented in the paper. On the other, the role of objective social consequences of social action are argued to multiply agents’ mental properties. Starting from the problems posed by social situatedness the main mental ingredients necessary for solving these problems are identified. After an operational definition of a socially situated agent, a variety of tasksor demands will be shown to impinge on socially situated agents. The specific cognitive requirements needed for individual agents to accomplish these tasks will be identified. However, these cognitive requirements are shown insufficient to answer the social demands previously identified. In particular, the effective execution of individual social action seems to produce a number of interesting social consequences which extend to and empower the individual action. The follow-up hypothesis is that further cognitive properties consequently arise at the individual level, and contribute to reproduce and reinforce multiple agents’ intelligence.	artificial intelligence;mental property;operational definition;requirement;situated;theory	Rosaria Conte	1999	Computational & Mathematical Organization Theory	10.1023/A:1009634206383	psychology;social learning;developmental psychology;social competence;computer science;artificial intelligence;autonomous agent;software agent;social heuristics;social intelligence;communication;social psychology	AI	-23.759169775525873	-12.89381008753906	103212

a263454ab0c40cef8cbd03e8167fd4be7b056187	autonomous agents research in robotics: a report from the trenches		This paper surveys research in robotics in the AAMAS (Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems) community. It argues that the autonomous agents community can, and has, impact on robotics. Moreover, it argues that agents researchers should proactively seek to impact the robotics community, to prevent independent re-discovery of known results, and to benefit autonomous agents science. To support these claims, I provide evidence from my own research into multirobot teams, and from others’. This paper is a short version of a more detailed survey (Kaminka 2012). Rise of the Machines Today, there is a resurgent interest and recognition of the importance of robotics research framed within areas of research familiar to autonomous agents and multi-agent systems researchers. The AAMAS community is investing efforts to encourage robotics research within itself. An annual robotics special-track, an associated robotics workshop (ARMS: Autonomous Robots and Multirobot Systems), and a series of exciting AAMAS-sponsored plenary speakers and awards over a number of years are drawing roboticists in. There are fruitful interactions with the other communities within AAMAS, such as virtual agents , game theory, and machine learning. Robots are being used both to inspire AAMAS research as well as to conduct it. I posit that this growing success is due not only to the nurturing efforts of the AAMAS community, but mainly to the increasing recognition of an important, deeper, truth: Robots are Agents. In other words, it is scientifically useful to think of robots as agents. Research in agents raises challenges in integrated capabilities for intelligence, such as planning and execution, learning exploration and exploitation, strategic decision making in multi-agent settings, and more. It requires us to consider deeply and critically what we mean by calling a system “autonomous”. It raises challenges in the software architectures needed for such capabilities. Many roboticists share these challenges. Robotics, by nature of the research, requires its practitioners to evaluate not ∗Currently at the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study, Harvard University.

Moreover, many roboticists are increasingly setting their goals higher than what we in AI (sometimes arrogantly) refer to as “low level control”. The stability of platforms have made it possible for roboticists to examine complex tasks, in which there is need for intelligence and knowledge, and for considering multiple robots. Agenticists have a wide variety of tools and techniques which can be brought to bear in facing both singleand multiplerobot challenges. And similarly, agenticists increasingly realize that it is useful for them to think of robots as agent exemplars. To agents researchers, working with real robots (made of plastic, metal, electronics, and the sweat of graduate students) brings out important challenges to our current theory and practice. Robots make us fail in interesting ways, and give opportunity for gaining insights otherwise unattainable. They extend the system perspective to go beyond the conceptual perception and actuation to consider sensors and motors (with their uncertainties, faults, and latencies), imperfect communications, and multiple bodies (each with its twoor threedimensional geometry). Roboticists know much about these challenges, and can greatly influence intellectual development within agents. To support my argument, I report from the trenches of ongoing robotics work within the AAMAS community, highlighting success stories in which robotics research benefited from AAMAS research, and vice versa. I therefore admit in advance to a bias towards work appearing in AAMAS conferences and journals. This bias is intended to highlight robotics in the context of research areas appearing in AAMAS. However, the unfortunate result of this bias is that ground-breaking work in AI and robotics appearing elsewhere (e.g., Thrun, Burgard and Fox’s game-changing work on probabilistic robotics (Thrun, Burgard, and Fox 2005)) will not receive proper treatment here. This, despite such work being excellent evidence for the generality of my argument as to the usefulness of AI to robotics, and vice versa. Building Architectures Robotics research today must address increasingly complex missions that the robots should carry out. Previously the problem of controlling a robot could be addressed by a carefully designed controllers.

Thus, the paper argues, given the current state of science, we can indeed establish a fruitful scientific notion of a cognitive process. Nevertheless, it is left open whether the example-based characterization ends up as merely highlighting a fruitful convention within the early-twentyfirst century interdisciplinary investigation of intelligent behaviour in humans, animals, and robots, or whether the examples determine a natural kind or a property cluster.	cognition;comparator;feedforward neural network;humans;mind;robot	Albert Newen	2015	Synthese	10.1007/s11229-015-0812-3	artificial intelligence;epistemology;natural kind;convention;feed forward;cognition;efference copy;computer science	AI	-26.013243473360596	-14.267751945998128	103447
68eb7855e4b532b7dbe79a4a9f552d1ba95aa33b	constructing symbolic representations for high-level planning	representation;learning;reinforcement learning;planning	We consider the problem of constructing a symbolic description of a continuous, low-level environment for use in planning. We show that symbols that can represent the preconditions and effects of an agent’s actions are both necessary and sufficient for high-level planning. This eliminates the symbol design problem when a representation must be constructed in advance, and in principle enables an agent to autonomously learn its own symbolic representations. The resulting representation can be converted into PDDL, a canonical high-level planning representation that enables very fast planning. Introduction A core challenge of artificial intelligence is creating intelligent agents that can perform high-level learning and planning, while ultimately performing control using low-level sensors and actuators. Hierarchical reinforcement learning approaches (Barto and Mahadevan 2003) attempt to address this problem by providing a framework for learning and planning using temporally abstract high-level actions. One motivation behind such approaches is that an agent that has learned a set of high-level actions should be able to plan using them to quickly solve new problems, without further learning. However, planning directly in such highdimensional, continuous state spaces remains difficult. By contrast, high-level planning techniques (Ghallab, Nau, and Traverso 2004) are able to solve very large problems in reasonable time. These techniques perform planning using pre-specified symbolic state descriptors, and operators that describe the effects of actions on those descriptors. Although these methods are usually used for planning in discrete state spaces, they have been combined with lowlevel motion planners or closed-loop controllers to construct robot systems that combine high-level planning with lowlevel control (Nilsson 1984; Malcolm and Smithers 1990; Cambon, Alami, and Gravot 2009; Choi and Amir 2009; Dornhege et al. 2009; Wolfe, Marthi, and Russell 2010; Kaelbling and Lozano-Pérez 2011). Here, a symbolic state at the high level refers to (and abstracts over) an infinite set of low-level states. However, in all of these cases the robot’s symbolic representation was specified by its designers. Copyright c © 2014, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. We consider the problem of constructing a symbolic representation suitable for evaluating plans composed of sequences of actions in a continuous, low-level environment. We can create such a representation by reasoning about potential propositional symbols via the sets of states they reference. We show that propositional symbols describing lowlevel representations of the preconditions and effects of each action are both sufficient and necessary for high-level planning, and discuss two classes of actions for which the appropriate symbols can be concisely described. We show that these representations can be used as a symbol algebra suitable for high-level planning, and describe a method for converting the resulting representation into PDDL (McDermott et al. 1998), a canonical high-level planning representation. Our primary contribution is establishing a close relationship between an agent’s actions and the symbols required to plan to use them: the agent’s environment and actions completely determine the symbolic representation required for planning. This removes a critical design problem when constructing agents that combine high-level planning with lowlevel control; moreover, it in principle enables an agent to construct its own symbolic representation through learning. Background and Setting Semi-Markov Decision Processes We assume that the low-level sensor and actuator space of the agent can be described as a fully observable, continuousstate semi-Markov decision process (SMDP), described by a tuple M = (S,O,R, P, γ), where S ⊆ R is the ndimensional continuous state space; O(s) returns a finite set of temporally extended actions, or options (Sutton, Precup, and Singh 1999), available in state s ∈ S; R(s′, t|s, o) is the reward received when executing action o ∈ O(s) at state s ∈ S, and arriving in state s′ ∈ S after t time steps; P (s′, t|s, o) is a PDF describing the probability of arriving in state s′ ∈ S, t time steps after executing action o ∈ O(s) in state s ∈ S; and γ ∈ (0, 1] is a discount factor. An option o consists of three components: an option policy, πo, which is executed when the option is invoked; an initiation set, Io = {s|o ∈ O(s)}, which describes the states in which the option may be executed; and a termination condition, βo(s) → [0, 1], which describes the probability that an option will terminate upon reaching state s. The combination of reward model, R(s′, t|s, o), and transition model, P (s′, t|s, o), for an option o is known as an option model. An agent that possesses option models for all of its options is capable of sample-based planning (Sutton, Precup, and Singh 1999; Kocsis and Szepesvári 2006), although doing so in large, continuous state spaces is very difficult.	automated planning and scheduling;high- and low-level;planning domain definition language;precondition	George Konidaris;Leslie Pack Kaelbling;Tomás Lozano-Pérez	2014			planning;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;representation;reinforcement learning	AI	-24.000754599974016	-18.4631540586984	103649

We consider a proposal from Villalobos and Dewhurst (2018) for enactive computation on the basis of organizational closure.

a001fb7408deba3de4c8e91259c412bf4b707810	game semantics and linear logic in the cognition process		A description of the environment cognition process by intelligent systems with a fixed set of system goals is suggested. Such a system is represented by the set of its goals only without any models of the system elements or the environment. The set has a lattice structure and a monoid structure; thus, the structure of linear logic is defined on the set. The cognition process of some environment by the system is described on this basis. The environment is represented as a configuration space of possible system positions which are estimated by an information amount (by corresponding sets). This information is supplied to the system by the environment. Thus, it is possible to define the category of Conway games with a payoff on the configuration space and to choose an optimal system's play (i.e., a trajectory). The choice is determined by the requirement of maximal information increasing and takes into account the structure of the system goal set: the linear logic on the set is used to determine the priority of possible different parallel processes. The survey may be useful to describe the behavior of robots and simple biological systems, e.g., ants.		Dmitry Maximov	2018	CoRR			Logic	-21.936108049760037	-10.866892667111614	104444
1c401566391434832fed847c55eb6b1e57ed55f5	lessons from the large hadron collider for model-based experimentation: the concept of a model of data acquisition and the scope of the hierarchy of models	models and idealization;data;experimentation	According to the hierarchy of models (HoM) account of scientific experimentation developed by Patrick Suppes and elaborated by Deborah Mayo, theoretical considerations about the phenomena of interest are involved in an experiment through theoretical models that in turn relate to experimental data through data models, via the linkage of experimental models. In this paper, I dispute the HoM account in the context of present-day high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. I argue that even though the HoM account aims to characterize experimentation as a model-based activity, it does not involve a modeling concept for the process of data acquisition, and it thus fails to provide a model-based characterization of the theory-experiment relationship underlying this process. In order to characterize the foregoing relationship, I propose the concept of a model of data acquisition and illustrate it in the case of the ATLAS experiment at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, where the Higgs boson was discovered in 2012. I show that the process of data acquisition in the ATLAS experiment is performed according to a model of data acquisition that specifies and organizes the experimental procedures necessary to select the data according to a predetermined set of selection criteria. I also point out that this data acquisition model is theory-laden, in the sense that the underlying data selection criteria are determined by considering the testable predictions of the theoretical models that the ATLAS experiment is aimed to test. I take this sense of theory-ladenness to indicate that the relationship between the procedures of the ATLAS experiment and the theoretical models of the phenomena of interest is first established, prior to the formation of data models, through the data acquisition model of the experiment, thus not requiring the intermediary of other types of models as suggested by the HoM account. I therefore conclude that in the context of present-day HEP experiments, the HoM account does not consistently extend to the process of data acquisition so as to include models of data acquisition.

The ability to reason about how others’ observable actions relate to their unobservable intentions is an important part of interpreting and responding to social behavior. It is also often necessary to observe the timing of actions in order to disambiguate others’ intentions. Therefore, our proposed approach is to model these interactions as time-indexed partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The intentions of humans are represented as hidden state in the POMDP models, and the time-dependence of actions by both humans and the robot are explicitly modelled. Our hypothesis is that planning for these interactions with a model that represents time dependent action outcomes and uncertainty about others’ intentions will achieve better results than simpler models that make fixed assumptions about people’s intentionality or abstract away time-dependent effects. A driving interaction governed by social conventions and involving ambiguity in the other driver’s intent was used as the scenario with which to test this hypothesis. A robot car controlled by F.

The time-dependent POMDP policies achieved better results than those of the models without explicit time representation or human intention as hidden state, both according to the reward obtained and to people’s subjective impressions of how socially appropriate and natural the robot’s behavior was. These results demonstrate both the relative superiority of these representation choices and the effectiveness of this approach to planning for socially situated tasks.	autonomous car;date and time representation by country;driving simulator;email;human–robot interaction;intentionality;markov chain;partially observable markov decision process;partially observable system;plymouth;robot;robotics;simulation;situated	Frank Broz;Illah R.

Study 1 found a large negative correlation between clinicians' beliefs about biological bases and environmental/psychological bases, suggesting that clinicians conceptualize mental disorders along a single continuum spanning from highly biological disorders (e.g., autistic disorder) to highly nonbiological disorders (e.g., adjustment disorders). Study 2 replicated this finding by having clinicians list what they thought were the specific causes of nine familiar mental disorders and rate their bio-psycho-environmental bases. Study 3 further found that clinicians believe medication to be more effective for biologically based mental disorders and psychotherapy to be more effective for psychosocially based mental disorders. These results demonstrate that even expert mental health clinicians make strong distinctions between psychological and biological phenomena.	adjustment disorders;apache continuum;autistic disorder;base;biological science disciplines;british informatics olympiad;causality;dsm-iv;experiment;file spanning;mental disorders;psychotherapy;mental health;nervous system disorder	Woo-kyoung Ahn;Caroline C.

Also discussed are the image codes linked to the mixed emotional words and the way to realize a mechanism using fuzzy inference, in which the internal emotion of a simulated person reacts on a sequence of inputted terms and evokes some emotional change. It is shown that the fuzzy inference technique is very useful and applicable even to such a flexible human life system as emotion. In the next section, the relevant part of the theory for the subjective observation model (Yanaru et al. [1]) to the application of the emotion-processing system is briefly explained. The construction methodology of the system, which has two functions, is described; one function is that the evoked emotion is transitive depending on the observation, and the other is that the aggregated emotion by the several subjective observations settles to the objective emotion. In conclusion, some attractive results obtained from the simulated emotion-processing system are shown: what tdnds of emotions are evoked and how the emotional transition is done by subjective observations, when a poem is used for the input signal.

f32dde3217865bc4cdfff3080e5852fe12ddfa45	qualitative trust model with a configurable method to aggregate ordinal data	trust;multi agent system;ordinal;data aggregation;qualitative	Trust models are mechanisms that allow agents to build trust without relying on a trusted central authority. Our goal was to develop a trust model that would operate with values that humans easily understand and manipulate: qualitative and ordinal values. The result is a trust model that computes trust from experiences created in interactions and from opinions obtained from third-party agents. The trust model, termed qualitative trust model (QTM), uses qualitative and ordinal values for assessing experiences, expressing opinions and estimating trust. We treat such values appropriately; we never convert them to numbers, but merely use their relative order. To aggregate a collection of such values, we propose an aggregation method that is based on comparing distributions and show some of its properties; the method can be used in other domains and can be seen as an alternative to median and similar methods. To cope with lying agents, QTM estimates trustworthiness in opinion providers with a modified version of the weighted majority algorithm, and additionally combines trustworthiness with social links between agents; such links are obtained implicitly by observing how agents provide opinions about each other. Finally, we compare QTM against a set of well-known trust models and demonstrate that it consistently performs well and on par with other quantitative models, and in many cases even outperforms them, particularly when the number of direct experiences is low.	aggregate data;experience;interaction;norm (social);object composition;ordinal data;quantum turing machine;trust (emotion);weighted majority algorithm	David Jelenc;Denis Trcek	2013	Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems	10.1007/s10458-013-9239-8	data aggregator;ordinal number;computer science;qualitative research;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;data mining;management science;trustworthy computing	AI	-21.34271903266073	-11.168795980575997	105760

Category theory is used for studying and formalizing organizations and collective phenomena in human societies   with the aim of capturing their logics into categorical models. Afterward, the captured models are mapped categorically to categorical MAS organizational models.   This way of thinking allows studying properties of result MAS organizational models as well as properties of organizations in human societies such as stability and adaptation before taking them as landmarks for developing MAS organizational models.

Four teams responded to the WTC disaster through the auspices of the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue (CRASAR), directed by John Blitch. The four teams were Foster-Miller and iRobot (both robot manufacturers from the Boston area), the United States Navy’s Space Warfare Center (SPAWAR) group from San Diego, and the University of South Florida (USF). Blitch, through his position as program manager for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Tactical Mobile Robots Program, was a supporter of the competition; he also served as a member of the rules committee and a judge. USF participated by chairing the rules committee, judging, assisting with the logistics, providing commentary, and demonstrating tethered and wireless robots whenever entrants had to skip around during the competition. Based on our experiences and history, we were asked to comment on the validity of the competition. The CRASAR collective experience suggests that most of the basic rules of the competition matched reality because the rules accurately reflected deployment scenarios, but the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Test Course, and hardware or software approaches forwarded by competitors in last summer’s event, missed the mark. This article briefly reviews the types of robots and missions used by CRASAR at the WTC site, then discusses the robotassisted search and rescue effort in terms of lessons for the competition.	experience;google summer of code;logistics;mobile robot;program manager;software deployment	Robin R.

In particular, the number of features along the route (e.g. landmarks) and the structuring of the route into stretches have been shown to influence distance estimates, usually increasing them (feature accumulation, route structuring). However, the two effects have not been related to one another yet. What is the relation between them? We have approached this question from two perspectives. The paper describes a cognitive model of route representation and processes, which produces both effects as the outcomes of task-specific retrieval procedures. It also describes an experiment whose results support the hypothesis that route structuring, if induced by segmentation, is a special case of feature accumulation. We relate the empirical results to the model, show how they support and constrain each other, and outline what further research is needed.	cognitive model;tree accumulation	Bettina Berendt;Petra Jansen-Osmann	1997		10.1007/3-540-63623-4_56	cognitive model;qualitative reasoning;information theory;cognitive map;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;geographic information system;statistics;cumulant	ML	-28.083896023075226	-12.014711140901936	106144

Current approaches either use human experts or a completely centralized approach for this adaptation. Where agents are increasingly used in serious game implementations as a means to reduce complexity and increase believability, their use for adaptation can lead to situations in which the lack of coordination between the agents makes it practically impossible to follow the intended storyline of the game and select suitable difficulties for the trainee. In this paper we propose an architecture for game design that introduces a monitoring module to check the development of user skills and direct coordinated agent adaptation. Agents propose possible courses of action that are fitting their role and context, and the monitor module uses this information together with its evaluation of user level and storyline progress to determine the most suitable combination of proposals.	2apl;agent-based model;centralized computing;complexity;mathematical optimization;scalability;software agent	Joost Westra;Frank Dignum;Virginia Dignum	2010	Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games	10.1109/ITW.2010.5593322	game design;games;simulation;computer science;organization;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;software agent;multimedia	AI	-27.628260309314605	-22.900425851854546	106173
c3d57ef3cc243b25dfd96852f090d5fcafbcafdc	what can artificial life offer the development of methodologies in the field of socio-ecological sustainability?		Issues of sustainability involve the dynamics and interactions of multiple complex adaptive systems at a variety of scales: climatic; ecological; economic; technological; political and social. Some of the most pressing challenges for society are inherently concerned with gaining a better ability to understand and manage the interacting systems upon which we rely. While there is widespread acknowledgement that the science of complex adaptive systems can provide key tools to address these challenges, there is little consensus on how to develop and apply these tools effectively. New approaches are therefore needed before effective policymaking can be informed by well-founded scientific modelling. Concepts and terminology such as complexity, complex adaptive systems, whole systems thinking, non-linear dynamics, co-evolution, autopoeisis, and self-organisation enjoy common currency in movements such as resilience thinking, sustainable systems approaches and permaculture (amongst others), which share a common ancestry with A-Life in systems theory. The use of such ideas as metaphors to guide thinking is valuable up to a point. For example, the concept of non-linear response to change, including at the extreme system tipping points, is an important understanding which must certainly guide policy in areas such as climate change. A large array of complex systems metaphors are also used as sources for design and management heuristics. However, there are presently enormous methodological leaps to be made before their full potential usefulness can be realised, and the availability of clear quantitative or qualitative measures and methodologies connecting theory with practice is extremely limited. A clear opportunity exists for the field of Artificial Life to contribute in this domain at this key time. In this talk I will give an overview of the current use of complex and dynamical systems concepts within the sustainability movement and associated challenges. I will detail practical tools being developed to measure the qualitative or quantitative behaviour (or health) of dynamical systems such as ecosystems, and discuss how we can move from a metaphorical understanding of such systems as complex, dynamical or adaptive, towards strategic intervention in or interaction with them with the goal of sustainability in mind. I will focus on what I consider to be three key areas in which A-Life methodology can contribute: 1) The use of modelling to predict the gross behaviour of systems, with a particular emphasis on the incorporation of evolutionary processes, network dynamics, and agent-based modelling into current resilience approaches; 2) The development of quantitative indicators of systems’ “health” with regard to their ability to self-maintain; 3) The development of tools for management or steering of complex systems undergoing rapid change, including the potential for “engineering” or “programming” self-organisation of complex adaptive systems for increased resilience, robustness and “sustainability”. The aim of this talk is to initiate dialogue between theoreticians and practitioners towards practical use of A-Life methodologies in frontline sustainability.	agent-based model;artificial life;complex adaptive system;complex systems;dynamical system;ecosystem;heuristic (computer science);interaction;nonlinear system;permaculture;self-organization;systems concepts;systems theory	Alexandra S.

In this paper we discuss the fact that many real phenomena require strong relaxation of classical CA assumptions in order to be adequately modelled, and that brings about limitations of existing modelling and simulation environments, often based on insufficiently generalised CA formulations. These considerations have induced us to develop a modelling environment based on a largely generalised CA formulation. The environment has proven to be particularly suitable for modelling and simulation of spatial urban, territorial and environmentally-oriented phenomena.	cellular automaton;computer simulation	Ivan Blecic;Arnaldo Cecchini;Giuseppe A.

Nowhere is this more significant than in AI, where we are attempting to emulate some of the most sophisticated and complex forms of behavior. It is a reasonable assertion that intelligent systems cannot be simplified-that their behavior is necessarily a result of their immense complexity. If we are to make intelligent computer programs, they must be complex. If that complexity exceeds our ability to manage it by conventional top-down modes of thought, then we must find another way. To do this, we need to understand how anarchy works. One of the largest anarchies on the face of this planet is your own body. Perhaps the most striking feature of complex organisms is their cellularity. A cell's most significant feature is its membrane. The membrane's purpose is to keep the outside out and the inside in. Modern software uses a similar concept to isolate components from each other, through the object-oriented programming methodology. In many respects, the biological concept of cellularity is applicable to computer software, especially if you have a predilection for designing bottom-up, massively parallel simulations for creating intelligent artificial life-forms.	anarchy	Stephen Grand	1998	IEEE Intelligent Systems	10.1109/5254.653217	computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;top-down and bottom-up design;biocybernetics	Robotics	-29.068444134834834	-15.778313569035875	106771
1931f9bedc86c20914512e032f1cd4ebd8aac357	a common framework for learning causality		Causality is a fundamental part of reasoning to model the physics of an application domain, to understand the behaviour of an agent or to identify the relationship between two entities. Causality occurs when an action is taken and may also occur when two happenings come undeniably together. The study of causal inference aims at uncovering causal dependencies among observed data and to come up with automated methods to find such dependencies. While there exist a broad range of principles and approaches involved in causal inference, in this position paper we argue that it is possible to unify different causality views under a common framework of symbolic learning.	application domain;causal inference;causality;entity;existential quantification;observable	Eva Onaindia;Diego Aineto;Sergio Jiménez Celorrio	2018	Progress in Artificial Intelligence	10.1007/s13748-018-0151-y	position paper;computer science;causal inference;machine learning;artificial intelligence;application domain;causality	AI	-23.070614540321714	-13.603624817740934	107091

In this work, we review developments in which complex systems are promoted through: 1) the evolution of teams of programs, and then 2) the context specific reuse of previously evolved code. To do so, two classes of diversity are identified: intra-team diversity and inter-team diversity. Intra-team diversity promotes task decomposition/cooperative coevolution between multiple programs, i.e. teams of programs. A fundamental requirement is that programs can learn context. Inter-team diversity is promoted through maintaining model and task diversity during evolution. The combination of both result in the ability to identify teams of programs and associate them with specific contexts, and then organize teams of programs hierarchically so solve multiple tasks. Finally, the concept of cumulative population wide performance is used to illustrate how inter model diversity in particular introduces useful biases into the types of solutions evolved.	code bloat;complex systems;cooperative coevolution;genetic programming;synergy	Jessica P.

The architecture --which is modeled as a multi-agent system --exploits a sound formal model to relate numerical data to symbolic representations, thus being able to reason about predicates, situations and contexts. In particular, agents collaborate to perform an intelligent multi-sensor data fusion according to the guidance of an active classification layer.

Because of their support for inference, KR systems appear to have potential to enrich the kind of retrievals that IR systems might make. Ironically, however, the most useful KR systems are limited to reasoning based on a rigid notion of validity, and thus are awkward to use when relevant but inexact retrievals are desired. We have been exploring the potential of a “connectionist” model—the Boltzmann Machine—to overcome this limitation. We report on a number of experiments in which we use a connectionist simulator to support similarity-based reasoning in a frame representation. We draw some tentative, mixed conclusions on the potential for a union of KR, IR, and connectionism.	artificial intelligence;boltzmann machine;connectionism;experiment;knowledge representation and reasoning	Ronald J.

8efbc664db0f6d0286daefaf9003d068ec1cbaa9	music, intelligence and artificiality	m music	The discipline of Music-AI is defined as that activity which seeks to program computers to perform musical tasks in an intelligent, which possibly means humanlike way. A brief historical survey of different approaches within the discipline is presented. Two particular issues arise: the explicit representation of knowledge; and symbolic and subsymbolic representation and processing. When attempting to give a precise definition of Music-AI, it is argued that all musical processes must make some reference to human behaviour, and so Music-AI is a central rather than a peripheral discipline for musical computing. However, it turns out that the goals of Music-AI as first expressed, the mimicking of human behaviour, are impossible to achieve in full, and that it is impossible, in principle, for computers to pass a musical version of the Turing test. In practice, however, computers are used for their non-human-like behaviour just as much as their human-like behaviour, so the real goal of Music-AI must be reformulated. Furthermore, it is argued that the non-holistic analysis of human behaviour which this reformulation entails is actually informative for our understanding of human behaviour. Music-AI could also be fruitfully concerned with developing musical intelligences which were explicitly not human. Music-AI is then seen to be as much a creative enterprise as a scientific one.	artificial intelligence;computer;holism;information;musical cryptogram;peripheral;turing test	Alan Marsden	2000			music psychology;music	AI	-29.194339279907975	-14.978013275002917	108352

Nevertheless, tweaking the behavior parameters of a character to achieve crowd heterogeneity is frequently hard. In particular, it is typically unclear how tuning some non-intuitive parameters at the agent level will eventually affect both the microscopic or macroscopic scale of the crowd. This paper proposes an activity-centric framework for authoring functional, heterogeneous virtual crowds in semantically meaningful environments. The specification of locations as environmental attractors and agent desires are used to compute """"influence maps"""", which allow the emergence of heterogeneous behaviors in a large virtual crowd in a complex scene. The same framework can also facilitate the authoring of complex group behaviors, such as following behaviors or families, by treating moving agents as attractors. Accompanying results demonstrate the framework's potential by authoring crowds in different environments. The experiments highlight the ability to easily orchestrate purposeful, heterogeneous crowd activities both at a macroscopic and microscopic level with minimal parameter tuning."""	crowdsourcing;emergence;experiment;map;simulation;tweaking;visual effects	Athanasios Krontiris;Kostas E.

There is no doubt that the complexity of this functionality is connected to the randomness of the agents’ work. What comes increasingly clear is that this randomness is a guarantee of success, not a drawback, provided we avoid falling in the ordinary Gaussian phenomenology in the province of the central limit theorem. We envisage a jointly biased asymmetry of the agents’ actions to be the main feature distinguishing them from the molecules of a gas in Brownian motion, and toss this idea in the paper through specific statistical models we elaborated in recent works.	anarchy;brownian motion;brute-force search;computation;computational intelligence;connectionism;decision tree;emergence;expert system;gaussian (software);intentionality;mathematical optimization;programming paradigm;randomness;semiconductor industry;simulation;social computing;statistical model;top-down and bottom-up design	Bruno Apolloni;Simone Bassis	2009	IJCIStudies	10.1504/IJCISTUDIES.2009.025336	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computational intelligence;compatibility;randomness;social computing;asymmetry	AI	-25.146011391613133	-12.246420797942758	108485

Even when a user acts the same behavior, its intention may be different according to the user's context. It means that user intention recognition involves the uncertainties, and by minimizing the uncertainties can improve the accuracy of the user intention recognition. This paper suggests a novel ontology-based approach for user intention recognition. We propose a method of minimizing the uncertainties that are the main obstacles against the precise recognition of user intention. This approach creates an ontology for user intention, makes a hierarchy and relationship among user intentions, and precisely recognizes user intention by using the gathered sensor data such as temperature, humidity, vision, and auditory.

837e54a8bb8c3cf6887ea75e5780b41d8eb9c543	semantic reliability of multi-agent intelligent systems	intelligent system	Generally the concept of reliability has been interpreted as applied to hardware and software and has been based upon the assumption that a system can be decomposed into subsystems or components to which success or failure probabilities can be assigned assuming perfect semantic transactions between them, i.e., with no consideration to variation in the interpretation of the meanings of messages between various components. In multi-agent intelligent systems, where the agents interact with each other in capacities other than merely sending and receiving messages, cooperative decisions are made based upon beliefs, desires, intentions, and the autonomy of individual agents. In such cases, even if the components as well as the interconnections are error-free in the classical sense, there can be serious failures due to semantic variability and consequently the concept of reliability needs to be extended to semantics as well. This paper attempts to establish this new concept of semantic reliability and explore its relationship to the system reliability and information extraction processes. Here we examine the communication between agents and semantic error modes in multi-agent systems using Rao and Georgeff's belief-desire-intention (BDI) model of intelligent agents to decompose the semantic variation into its contributing parts from various subsystems comprising the agents. From this, the impact and the risk management strategies including fault tolerance are evolved. World representation, domain ontologies, and knowledge representation are brought out as important determinants of error control. A fault tolerance design based on goal hierarchy is suggested.	artificial intelligence;autonomous system (internet);belief–desire–intention software model;consortium;error detection and correction;fault tolerance;information extraction;intelligent agent;knowledge representation and reasoning;logic error;multi-agent system;ontology (information science);risk management;semantic web;software system;spatial variability;world wide web	Tippure S.

b837e40315f81d26fe7ce6b0a936a259cd022855	the use of clp(fd) extended with chrs for qualitative spatial reasoning and qualitative robot navigation		With the aim of simulating the human spatial reasoning capabilities, several qualitative models have been developed in the recent years. Most of these models deal with one or, at most, two aspects of space and, the more cognitive models, simplify spatial objects to points. In this paper we present a new approach that uses Constraint Logic Programming instantiated to Finite Domains extended with Constraint Handling Rules as tool for integrating several spatial aspects into the same qualitative model using point as well as extended objects as primitive of reasoning. The qualitative concepts of orientation, position (i.e. orientation + distance), and cardinal directions on points and extended objects are successfully integrated using this approach. As example, the integration of the concept of orientation into the model is explained in this paper. The resulting model is applied to build a demonstrator of a Qualitative Navigation Simulator on the structured environment of the city of Castellon.	robotic mapping;spatial–temporal reasoning	M.

New exciting results concerning modelling issues, diagnostic inference patterns and inferential power have emerged. A state of the art diagnosis agent now has a considerable toolset at hand. A main obstacle for building large diagnosis systems, however, remains. How can we controlwhen to usewhich inference pattern or representation? We argue that the actions available to a diagnosis agent can be understood in terms of change ofworking hypotheses. The control problem then becomes a belief revision problem: when to adopt or drop beliefs. Our approach proceeds in two steps. First, we adopt the principle of informational economy from Gärdenfors, Knowledge in Flux (MIT Press, 1988) as kind of a law of inertia for diagnostic processes, that helps us identify candidates for revised belief states. In a second step we employ specificdiagnostic knowledge to actually choose the next belief state. We demonstrate the use of our concepts on an example in the domain of ballast tank systems as e.g. used in offshore plants.	belief revision;inferential theory of learning	Claudia Böttcher;Oskar Dressler	1994	Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence	10.1007/BF01530744	mathematical optimization;simulation;informal sector;computer science;artificial intelligence;weed control;machine learning;mathematics;belief revision;algorithm	AI	-28.38102873891901	-17.00554429664208	109377

The thermodynamic concept of entropy is also associated with such systems, although in an inverse relationship. When we attempt to put these two apparently coordinated schemas of order and disorder together, all kinds of difficulties arise. I will briefly examine contemporary efforts to unify these two ways of conceiving order and show that they are substantially incompatible. In this process I will draw some distinctions that will lead to a broader reconciliation of the concepts of order and information. I will then attempt to reevaluate the fundamental models behind these dissonant traditions for formulating order in an attempt to reframe a synthesis of conceptual structures that are mutually reconcilable. I will try to show that such a synthesis can finally make sense of the stubborn inconsistencies that persist in the ways Newtonian dynamics, thermodynamics and biology utilize the implicitly conflicting arrows of time.

We first argue that, although the phenomenon of life manifests itself as highly complex and multidimensional, requiring various levels of description, individual organisms constitute the core of this multifarious phenomenology. Thereafter, our discussion focuses on the nature of the organization of individual living entities, proposing autonomy as the main concept to grasp it. In the second part of the article we show how autonomy is also fundamental to explaining major evolutionary transitions, in an attempt to rethink evolution from the point of view of the organizational structure of the entities/organisms involved. This gives further support to the idea of autonomy not only as a key to understanding life in general but also the complex expressions of it that we observe on our planet. Finally, we suggest a possible general principle that underlies those evolutionary transitions, which allow for the open-ended redefinition of autonomous systems: namely, the relative dynamic decoupling that must be articulated among distinct parts, modules or modes of operation in these systems.	autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);autonomy;biological organisation;biological system;block cipher mode of operation;cartesian closed category;cognition;complex network;consciousness;coupling (computer programming);ecology;emily howell;entity;fundamental interaction;humans;intentionality;interdependence;irreducibility;mind;nonlinear gameplay;physicalism;rationality;self-organization;theory;unfolding (dsp implementation);value (ethics)	Kepa Ruiz-Mirazo;Alvaro Moreno	2011	Synthese	10.1007/s11229-011-9874-z	agency;autonomy;function	AI	-24.969978125296443	-13.473820363108462	109625

Automated players in academic and commercial team sports simulations have traditionally been driven by complex externally motivated value functions with heuristics based on knowledge of game tactics and strategy. Empowerment is an information-theoretic measure of an agent’s potential to influence its environment, which has been shown to provide a useful intrinsic value function, without the need for external goals and motivation, for agents in single agent models. In this paper we expand on the concept of empowerment to propose the concept of team empowerment as an intrinsic, generic utility function for cooperating agents. We show that agents motivated by team empowerment exhibit recognizable team behaviors in a simple team sports simulation based on Ultimate Frisbee.	simulation;utility	Marcus Clements;Daniel Polani	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-66471-2_5	instrumental and intrinsic value;heuristics;knowledge management;team sport;ultimate frisbee;empowerment;engineering	ECom	-20.60026927618669	-14.294545433189358	109761

Contrary to other previous similar studies, in this work the decision-making is uniquely controlled by the time-dependent structures of the agent controller, which in turn, are tightly linked to the mechanisms for sensory-motor coordination. The results of this work show that a single dynamic neural network, shaped by evolution, makes an autonomous agent capable of ‘feeling’ time through the flow of sensations determined by its actions. Further analysis of the evolved solutions reveals the nature of the selective pressures which facilitate the evolution of fully discriminating and signalling agents. Moreover, we show that, by simply working on the nature of the fitness function, it is possible to bring forth discrimination mechanisms which generalise to conditions never encountered during evolution.	artificial neural network;autonomous agent;autonomous robot;fitness function;khepera mobile robot;sensor	Elio Tuci;Vito Trianni;Marco Dorigo	2004	Connect.

a2c89a8341b3e4bb6f3c6a69f52ae203164af635	benchmarking projective simulation in navigation problems		Projective simulation is a model for intelligent agents with a deliberation capacity that is based on episodic memory. The model has been shown to provide a flexible framework for constructing reinforcement-learning agents, and it allows for quantum mechanical generalization, which leads to a speedup in deliberation time. Projective simulation agents have been applied successfully in the context of complex skill learning in robotics and the design of the state-of-the-art quantum experiments. In this paper, we study the performance of projective simulation in two benchmarking problems in navigation, namely, the grid world and the mountain car problem. The performance of projective simulation is compared to standard tabular reinforcement learning approaches, Q-learning, and SARSA. Our comparison demonstrates that the performance of projective simulation and standard learning approaches are qualitatively and quantitatively similar, while it is much easier to choose optimal model parameters in the case of projective simulation with reduced computational effort of one to two orders of magnitude. Our results show that the projective simulation model stands out for its simplicity in terms of the number of model parameters, which makes it simple to set up the learning agent in unknown task environments.	ap computer science a;experiment;intelligent agent;mountain car;q-learning;quantum mechanics;reinforcement learning;robotics;simulation;speedup;table (information)	Alexey A.

8f6d64b2a8d48cad5edd4759109deb3c71da626d	physical scaffolding accelerates the evolution of robot behavior	reality gap;evolution;minimal cognition;scaffolding;simulation	In some evolutionary robotics experiments, evolved robots are transferred from simulation to reality, while sensor/motor data flows back from reality to improve the next transferral. We envision a generalization of this approach: a simulation-to-reality pipeline. In this pipeline, increasingly embodied agents flow up through a sequence of increasingly physically realistic simulators, while data flows back down to improve the next transferral between neighboring simulators; physical reality is the last link in this chain. As a first proof of concept, we introduce a two-link chain: A fast yet low-fidelity (lo-fi) simulator hosts minimally embodied agents, which gradually evolve controllers and morphologies to colonize a slow yet high-fidelity (hi-fi) simulator. The agents are thus physically scaffolded. We show here that, given the same computational budget, these physically scaffolded robots reach higher performance in the hi-fi simulator than do robots that only evolve in the hi-fi simulator, but only for a sufficiently difficult task. These results suggest that a simulation-to-reality pipeline may strike a good balance between accelerating evolution in simulation while anchoring the results in reality, free the investigator from having to prespecify the robot's morphology, and pave the way to scalable, automated, robot-generating systems.	biological evolution;computation;controllers;embodied agent;evolutionary robotics;experiment;flow;generalization (psychology);mathematical morphology;robot (device);scalability;simulation;simulators;scaffold	David Buckingham;Josh C.

Here we explore the influence of Kolmogorov complexity in the determination, not only of moral judgment, but also of the associated narrative interest. We designed an experiment to test the predictions of our complexity-based model when applied to moral dilemmas. It confirms that judgments about interest and morality may be explained in part by discrepancies in complexity. This preliminary study suggests that cognitive computations are involved in decision-making about emotional outcomes.	cognitive architecture;computation;kolmogorov complexity	Antoine Saillenfest;Jean-Louis Dessalles	2012			cognitive psychology;moral reasoning;simplicity theory;moral psychology;psychology;morality;social psychology;social cognitive theory of morality;lawrence kohlberg's stages of moral development;moral disengagement;moral development	AI	-24.262361341409935	-14.595899324003849	111777

Using the augmented anchoring framework that employs complex symbolic knowledge from a commonsense knowledge base, we attempt to ground and integrate symbolic and perceptual data that are available on the web. We introduce conceptual anchors which are representations of general, concrete conceptual terms. We show in an example scenario how conceptual anchors can be coherently integrated with perceptual anchors and commonsense information for the acquisition of novel concepts.	cognitive robotics;commonsense knowledge (artificial intelligence);html element;knowledge base;robot	Marios Daoutis;Silvia Coradeschi;Amy Loutfi	2012	Intelligent Service Robotics	10.1007/s11370-012-0117-z	computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;categorical perception;anchoring;robotics;commonsense knowledge	AI	-27.336636109796707	-19.37636103830063	111805
1562ae8c45875f2d36fe55ba55559daad466eca8	planning with task-oriented knowledge acquisition for a service robot		We propose a framework for a service robot to behave intelligently in domains that contain incomplete information, underspecified goals and dynamic change. Human robot interaction (HRI), sensing actions and physical actions are uniformly formalized in action language BC. An answer set solver is called to generate plans that guide the robot to acquire task-oriented knowledge and execute actions to achieve its goal, including interacting with human to gather information and sensing the environment to help motion planning. By continuously interpreting and grounding useful sensing information, robot is able to use contingent knowledge to adapt to unexpected changes and faults.

The lessons learned in the creation of a competitive team are instructive for a wide range of applications of robotics. We describe the development of vision and localisation procedures for robot soccer, as well as innovations in locomotion and the design of game play strategies. Since all teams in the competition are required to use identical hardware, the key factor to success in this league is the creativity of the software designers in programming the robots to perform skills that the robots were not originally intended to do and to perform them in a highly dynamic and non-deterministic environment.	artificial intelligence;entity–relationship model;integrated development environment;machine learning;programmer;robot;robotics;sensor;software development;tom;tracing (software)	Claude Sammut;Bernhard Hengst	2001		10.1007/3-540-36460-9_34	simulation	Robotics	-31.741105401020143	-21.00604281159179	111987
d058aaad867a5e3e9895de89196e80a6ece9297e	from spreading of behavior to dyadic interaction - a robot learns what to imitate	robot learning	Imitation learning is a promising way to learn new behavior in robotic multiagent systems and in human-robot interaction. However, imitating agents should be able to decide autonomously which behavior, observed in others, is interesting to copy. This paper shows a method for extraction of meaningful chunks of information from a continuous sequence of observed actions by using a simple recurrent network (Elman Net). Results show that, independently of the high level of task-specific noise, Elman nets can be used for learning through prediction a reoccurring action patterns, observed in another robotic agent. We conclude that this primarily robot to robot interaction study can be generalized to human-robot interaction and show how we use these results for recognizing emotional behaviors in human-robot interaction scenarios. The limitations of the proposed approach and the future directions are discussed.

We do so by developing and applying a network model, namely Memenets, where human knowledge and reasoning are combined with machine computation to achieve problem-solving. The development of a Memenet is done in three steps: first, we simulate a machine-only network, as previous results have shown that memenets are efficient problem-solvers. Then, we perform an experiment with human agents organized in a online network. This allows us to investigate human behavior while solving problems in a social network and to postulate principles of agent communication in Memenets. These postulates describe an initial theory of how human-computer interaction functions inside social networks. In the third stage, postulates of step two allow one to combine human and machine computation to propose an integrated Memenet-based problemsolving computing model.	computation;computer;human–computer interaction;memetics;network model;problem solving;simulation;social network;software framework	Daniel S.

What’s more interesting is that the use of robots is not limited to traditional engineering departments but has also found its way into a variety of arts and science courses. The use of robotics by nonengineering, nontechnical instructors has been termed a “robotic revolution” [1]. The success of robots in education has come about as a result of a combination of factors. First, robotics provides a unique learning experience. Robots are a physical embodiment of computation. The students receive strong, visceral feedback from physically experiencing their work. There is a wide design space for students to explore, make hypotheses about how things work, and conduct experiments to validate their beliefs and assumptions. Early work by Seymour Papert, which led to the development of educational robot platforms, termed this style of learning “constructionism” [2]. Another important aspect of robotics is its systems nature. It provides an excellent design experience of an integrated system that includes mechanics, electronics, and computation. A second factor in the success of robots in education is the cost. The cost of computation has dropped exponentially over the last decade. The result has been the ability to design and market robot controllers at prices that are accessible to schools with even modest budgets [3]. Low-cost mechanical parts and electronic sensors have been marketed in combination. While these do not provide the same precision that would be needed in an industrial robot, they are sufficient for educational purposes. The final important factor is the plug-and-play feel of the new robot platforms. The multidisciplinary nature of robotics has previously relegated its study to larger research institutions that have had the range of prerequisite knowledge to engineer complex systems. Robot controllers, such as the Handy Board and the LEGO Mindstorm RCX, have mitigated this need by making it relatively simple to plug in motors and sensors and use well-known or simple programming environments. The development of specialized LEGO parts has made the construction of mechanical components accessible [4], [5]. In this first of two special issues, we present a group of articles that use available inexpensive platforms in secondary school courses, undergraduate school courses, and graduate study courses. These articles focus on the use of the Handy Board and the LEGO Mindstorm RCX plus LEGO construction pieces. The Handy Board, which was developed at MIT, was a predecessor of the LEGO RCX and was used in the innovative MIT 6.270 design course. The LEGO Mindstorm RCX was developed for the toy market but quickly found its way into educational settings. Many academics and hobbyists have been pushing the limits of the RCX through the development of new operating systems, programming environments, and sensors. The use of the RCX is going beyond behavior-based mechanisms to embrace control systems	complex systems;computation;control system;experiment;game mechanics;handy board;industrial robot;lego mindstorms;operating system;plug and play;robotics;sensor	Jerry B.

But how the natural and artificial are related across wide-ranging research areas is not always clear. Relations differ further for bioengineering fields. We propose a taxonomy which would serve to elucidate distinct relations; there are three ways in which the natural is linked to the artificial, corresponding with distinct methods of investigation: i) a comparative approach (natural vs artificial) in which artificial systems are treated in the same way as natural systems, ii) a modeling approach (natural via artificial) in which we use artificial systems to learn about features of natural ones, and iii) an engineering approach (natural pro artificial) in which natural systems are used to draw inspiration for artefacts. Ambiguities about and between these approaches limit the development of fields and impact negatively on interdisciplinary communication.

The work is, for one, a manifesto of the essential complexity inherent in universal order, and against a reduction of scholarship to the pure sciences, in which elimination is key. Vico proposed a structure that afforded the organic integration of the humanities within the laws of physics as parts of “a tree of knowledge” whose trunk branched out into a progression toward certainty, drawn out of the most fluid humanities at the roots, in an order of premise and conclusion. The tree metaphor is the juncture of early moments of disparity and interdependence between complexity, on the one hand, and certainty on the other. Starting at the unknown, the immeasurably immense ultimate uncertainty, perception is shaped through fear, self-protection and subject to survival instincts. And so, crude metaphysics makes the trunk rooted in “poetic wisdom” with a natural mixture of limited sensuous cognition and unlimited imagination—or one striving beyond the fetters of immediate reality, logic, ethics, economics and politics which are all poetic sciences to Vico—branch out. On the other side of those branches, physics extends into chronology and geography—the most certain—in agreement that the faculties of the human mind, including imagination, may not be outside of physics: the trunk from whence all knowledge cometh, and by the laws of which life is governed. Past validating human uncertainty as a measure of complexity—not lack of knowledge—in scientific inquiry, key concepts in Vico’s The New Science, such as imagination, reason, creativity and science, maintain pressing relevance to examining complexity today, enabling consideration of their relevance between Vico’s time and today, while maintaining that the uncertainty of imagination and the pragmatism of physics are but facets of the equally plausible constitution of a universal order.	binocular disparity;blum axioms;cartesian closed category;circumscription (logic);cognition;color gradient;essential complexity;interdependence;mind;relevance;tree of knowledge system;unique name assumption	Taha A.

In GOMASE, an agent is supplied with a goal hierarchy, activity digraph, and a motivational mechanism in an attempt to simulate the goal's activation and attempted satisfaction. The attractiveness of this approach is that all the goals possessed by the agent are related via the ultimate life goals (i.e., self-preservation and species preservation). By using GOMASE to model enterprises, the enterprise modeller can gain an insight into the complex behavior of human workers and how they set, prioritize, and execute their goals. In this article, we also provide several sample runs of our system, with a brief explanation on the agent's behaviors.	intelligent agent	Penny Baillie de Byl;Dickson Lukose	2001	Cybernetics and Systems	10.1080/019697201317080925	computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;intelligent agent	AI	-20.892375920781564	-14.419450332616597	112372

We have implemented an AI-bot that uses these techniques to form a novel approach for planning fleet movements and attacks in DEFCON, a nuclear war simulation strategy game released in 2006 by Introversion Software Ltd. The AI-bot retrieves plans from a case-base of recorded games, then uses these to generate a new plan using a method based on decision tree learning. In addition, we have implemented more sophisticated control over low-level actions that enable the AI-bot to synchronize bombing runs, and used a simulated annealing approach for assigning bombing targets to planes and opponent cities to missiles. We describe how our AI-bot operates, and the experimentation we have performed in order to determine an optimal configuration for it. With this configuration, our AI-bot beats Introversion’s finite state machine automated player in 76.7% of 150 matches played.

We also propose a hypothesis on the possibility of Cantor coding for  the formation of episodic memory in the hippocampus and also for the category formation of episodic memory. Smale’s horseshoe  map defines Cantor coding as a conjugacy of expanding dynamics embedded within the map. On the other hand, in the real world,  this type of conjugacy does not always exist. We demonstrate the use of Cantor coding in a mathematical model of the hippocampus.  The computational results suggest a dynamic mechanism for the formation of episodic memory and category formation of episodic  memory.

As these operations become increasingly complex, the wargames similarly become more complex. Complex wargames are difficult to design and execute. As such, computer-based modeling and simulation can aid the wargame development, ensuring smooth execution. In particular, computer-based modeling and simulation can develop and validate the processes, determine initial conditions, evaluate the rules, and aid in validation.

Such software libraries have traditionally focused on simulating the rigid body dynamics robustly, quickly, and accurately toward obtaining consistent dynamics performance between simulation and in situ. However, simulation practitioners have generally yet to investigate maintaining temporal consistency within the simulation: given that simulations run at variable rates, how does the roboticist ensure the robot’s control software (controller, planners, and other user-level processes) runs at the same rate that it would run in the physical world? This paper describes an intersection of research between Robotics and Real-Time Operating Systems that investigates mechanisms for addressing this problem.	autonomous robot;content-control software;library (computing);real-time transcription;simulation;user space	Davide Brugali;Jan F.

61a0650f3723fe28655b0b0771470b1a40ae8741	constraining bayesian inference with cognitive architectures: an updated associative learning mechanism in act-r		Bayesian inference has been shown to be an efficient mechanism for describing models of learning; however, concerns over a lack of constraint in Bayesian models (e.g., Jones & Love, 2011) has limited their influence as being a description of the ‘real’ processes of human cognition. In this paper, we review some of these concerns and argue that cognitive architectures can address these concerns by constraining the hypothesis space of Bayesian models and providing a biologically-plausible mechanism for setting priors and performing inference. This is done in the context of the ACT-R functional cognitive architecture (Anderson & Lebiere, 1998), whose sub-symbolic information processing is essentially Bayesian. To that end, our focus in this paper is on an updated associative learning mechanism for ACT-R that implements the constraints of Hebbian-inspired learning in a Bayesian-compatible framework.	act-r;artificial intelligence;cognition;cognitive architecture;hebbian theory;information processing;jones calculus;jones polynomial	Robert Thomson;Christian Lebiere	2013			cognitive psychology;prior probability;inference;artificial neural network;bayesian statistics;cognitive architecture;bayes' theorem;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;bayesian inference;bayesian probability	ML	-23.98652986179852	-14.41506859251839	113997

12ce6281bdfaa8334a4a42850b28d7f6eb737705	cognitive architectures: innate or learned?		Cognitive architectures are generally considered to be theories of the innate capabilities of the (human) cognitive system. Any knowledge that is not innate is encoded in the architectures memory systems, either by the modeler or learned by the architecture itself. However, in human intelligent behavior few things are innate. An alternative is to acknowledge that learning occurs at different levels of abstraction. A standard model of the mind should therefore span multiple levels of abstraction, encouraging research efforts to establish learning mechanism that connect them. Human babies are born almost completely helpless. Although developmental psychology has a lot to say about what newborns are already capable of, they acquire almost everything they need to know at some stage in life. This is why the human species is so successful: it can adapt to many different circumstances, and is therefore, with the same genome, successful in current day’s society just as well as, say, the time that we were still hunter-gatherers. Piaget (1952) argued that child development goes through a number of stages, starting with a sensorimotor stage, and progressing to more cognitive and abstract stages with age. Even though developmental psychologists still debate the existence of concrete stages, it is clear that learning in an infant is quite different from learning in an adult. Current cognitive architectures, such as ACT-R (Anderson 2007), Soar (Laird, Newell, and Rosenbloom 1987) and PRIMs (Taatgen 2013), have a somewhat more simple view of development. The assumption is that the cognitive architecture represents the innate cognitive capabilities of intelligence, and that everything that is learned is represented as knowledge and skills in the memory systems of the architecture (Laird, Lebiere, and Rosenbloom in press). This may seem a reasonable assumption, but it carries along a big problem. Whenever we want to create a model of a specific task, we have to encode the knowledge to perform that task in terms of knowledge in the memory of the architecture. However, the architecture’s memory is empty, which means that there is a gap between what the architecture can do by itself, and the requirements of the task. The modeler has to fill this gap with ad hoc solutions that are probably not completely justified, but that help to achieve the particular goal of modeling the particular task. However, this approach means that many models, even within the same architecture, are completely incompatible with one another. Therefore, it has the danger that it runs into the same problem that Newell (1973) signaled in psychology in general: that it produces a collection of micro-theories for specific phenomena, but that it fails to achieve a unified theory of cognition. Moreover, certain domains that are relatively late in development, such as language and social cognition, are very hard to model in an architecture where knowledge starts from scratch, because they require large amounts of prerequisite knowledge. If cognitive architectures want to break new grounds, they have to acknowledge this problem, and look for new solutions. Horizontal vs. Multilevel Architectures Newell (1973) identified multiple levels of abstraction to study human cognition, ranging from the level of organelles that operate in the 100 μs time range to social cognition that operates at a time scale of months. What Newell considered the levels that are most interesting for cognition are in between these extremes: the level of deliberate acts (100 ms), operations (1 sec), and unit tasks (10 sec). It is tempting, and consistent with ideas that go back to Turing (1950), to pick a level of abstraction as the base level to model human cognition, consider all levels below that level as implementation, and build up the theory from that level. I call this a horizontal architecture, because it focusses on a single level of abstraction as a starting point both up and down (Figure 1). The developmental literature suggests another approach, in which we take into account that learning takes place at each level of abstraction. I call this a multilevel architecture. The central idea in the multilevel architecture is that there is not a particular level of abstraction that is “special”. Depending on the phenomenon we want to model, we have to select one or more levels of abstraction that are most appropriate. Therefore, the neural level is not the most appropriate to model learning the past tense (Taatgen and Anderson 2002), and object recognition is hard to model at a symbolic level. Multiple Levels of Learning Human learning can takes many different forms.

We present some of our recent work that has been motivated by that view and that is centered around the study of various aspects of hand actions since these are intimately linked with many higher cognitive abilities. As examples, we report on the development of a modular system for the recognition of continuous hand postures based on neural nets, the use of vision and tactile sensing for guiding prehensile movements of a multifingered hand, and the recognition and use of hand gestures for robot teaching. Regarding the issue of learning, we propose to view real-world learning from the perspective of data-mining and to focus more strongly on the imitation of observed actions instead of purely reinforcement-based exploration. As a concrete example of such an effort we report on the status of an ongoing project in our laboratory in which a robot equipped with an attention system with a neurally inspired architecture is taught actions by using hand gestures in conjunction with speech commands. We point out some of the lessons learnt from this system, and discuss how systems of this kind can contribute to the study of issues at the junction between natural and artificial cognitive systems.	architecture as topic;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;body position;brain;cdisc adas-cog - commands summary score;cognition disorders;cognitive robotics;data mining;gain;inspiration function;movement;robot;speech synthesis	Helge J.

This paper presents the cognitive foundations of amusement and a general theory of humor based on the recent advances in cognitive informatics, cognitive linguistics, cognitive computing, and fuzzy causal analyses. A theory of fuzzy false causation (FFC) is introduced that reveals humor and jokes as false causations in fuzzy causal inferences. Base on the FFC theory, a general pattern of humor (GPH) is formalized for analyzing the settings and appreciations of a set of sample jokes. A formal measurement of the degree of amusement in jokes and humor is quantitatively described towards the rational explanation of jokes based on cognitive affective assessment. The formal models of humor and jokes enable machines for humor comprehension and appreciation in artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, computational intelligence, and cognitive robots.

Such human-like behavior is not guaranteed with e.g. basic reinforcement learning schemes. Cognitive models can be very useful to establish human-like behavior in an agent. However, they require ample domain knowledge that might be difficult to obtain. In this paper, a cognitive model is taken as a basis, and the addition of scenario specific information is for a large part automated by means of machine learning techniques. The performance of the approach of automatically adding scenario specific information is rigorously evaluated using a case study in the domain of fighter air combat. An evolutionary algorithm is proposed for automatically tailoring a cognitive model for situation awareness of fighter pilots. The standard algorithm and several extensions are evaluated with respect to performance in air combat. The results show that it is possible to apply the algorithm to optimize belief networks for cognitive models of intelligent agents (adversarial fighters) in the aforementioned domain, thereby reducing the effort required to elicit knowledge from experts, while retaining the required ‘human-like’ behavior.	bayesian network;cognitive model;evolutionary algorithm;intelligent agent;machine learning;reinforcement learning;scenario planning	Richard Koopmanschap;Mark Hoogendoorn;Jan Joris Roessingh	2014	Applied Intelligence	10.1007/s10489-014-0584-3	cognitive model;situation awareness;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;artificial neural network	AI	-23.665034725928727	-20.331234378910715	115468

As is widely recognized, the point applies to electronic commerce and to communications by artificial agents in general. Some progress has been made in this direction, but very much work remains to be done. In this paper we introduce and discuss thespanning hypothesis for agent (or, e.g.,EDI or electronic commerce) communication languages. The spanning hypothesis is a claim about the semantics for a given communication language, and we think it represents a necessary condition for truly successful artificial communication in electronic commerce. After discussing and clarifying the hypothesis, and how it might be confirmed, we present evidence in its favor from an analysis of several EDIFACT transaction sets.	e-commerce;edifact;electronic data interchange;file spanning;intelligent agent	Steven Orla Kimbrough;Scott A.

The robot's controller is composed of over 40 separate processes which run on a loosely connected network of 24 processors. Together this ensemble helps the robot locate empty soda cans, collect them with its arm, and bring them back home. A multi-agent system such as this has many advantages over classic monolithic controllers. For instance, it can be developed in stages, each new layer building on the last. It can also be split among several processors or agents, so as new capabilities are required new hardware can be easily added. Furthermore, its performance degrades gracefully if a single agent fails the robot continues to function, albeit at a lower level of competence. However, in order to achieve these goals the system must be decomposed following certain guidelines. First, the internal workings of each agent should be isolated from all other agents. This improves the modularity of the system and helps prevent implementation dependencies. Second, all decisions should be based on spatially and temporally local information. This keeps the robot from relying on incorrect models of its dynamically changing world and allows it to operate with incomplete sensory input. Unfortunately, these restrictions make it nearly impossible to use conventional techniques to perform tasks requiring spatial reasoning. The can collection task is particularly difficult because it requires three different types of spatial knowledge. The robot must be able to navigate through its environment, recognize the shape of a can, and determine how to move its arm for grasping. To build a functional robot we had to develop new ways of thinking about these operations. The rest of this report details the development of suitable strategies, discusses principles for achieving a satisfactory task decomposition, and examines the limitations of such a system.

On the other hand, quantum mind and quantum cognition approaches find no logical unification due to the illogical nature of quantum theory. Based on a bipolar geometrical and logical unification of mind, light, and matter, quantum neurobiology is proposed for neural ensemble formation and cognition. It is shown that the new model can bridge the gap of quantum mind and cognition with logically definable quantum superposition and entanglement to form an equilibrium-based paradigm of information conservational neuroscience.	mind;neural ensemble;programming paradigm;quantum cognition;quantum entanglement;quantum mechanics;quantum superposition;unification (computer science)	Wen-Ran Zhang	2017	2017 IEEE 16th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC)	10.1109/ICCI-CC.2017.8109763	neuroscience;quantum entanglement;quantum superposition;quantum computer;quantum cognition;quantum;cognition;quantum mind;unification;mathematics	Robotics	-26.46472221388674	-14.117163679462525	116272

Scientific discourse about such architectures requires means to compare approaches and identify common directions. In this contribution we put forth the hypothesis that a meaningful comparison is possible only by translation to a common language. We present SYSTEMATICA 2D as such a common language, suitable for translation and comparison of architectures because it is both formal in its description and flexible in the range of systems which can be expressed. Main result of this contribution is the translation and comparison of three recent popular system architectures: the CogX George system[1], the ALIS3 system running on the Honda humanoid robot[2] and the iCub Cognitive Architecture[3]. Common patterns in all three systems become apparent from the two-dimensional ordering inherent in their SYSTEMATICA 2D translations and allow more founded discussions about architecture approaches and the exchange of concepts between real systems.	architectural pattern;artificial intelligence;automated planning and scheduling;cognition;control flow;high- and low-level;icub;modular programming;modulation;preprocessor;simulation;software system;type system	Benjamin Dittes;Christian Goerick	2011	2011 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2011.6094442	computer vision;simulation;intelligent decision support system;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;systems architecture	Robotics	-27.006324446334368	-18.68239591961083	116768

Limited cognitive processing capabilities, however, impede an exhaustive search of the problem space. Thus, planning problems of the same size may require a different cognitive effort. Formal complexity aspects are inherent to a problem and set computational limits that a solver must deal with. For a measure of cognitive complexity, operational aspects of human cognition must be taken into account. We present a structural complexity measure for predicting human planning performance. This measure is based on the number and connectedness of subgoals necessary to solve a problem. This measure is evaluated on the PSPACE-complete puzzle game Rush Hour and is able to capture empirically measured difficulty for this game.	blum axioms;brute-force search;cognition;cognitive complexity;computation;computational complexity theory;humans;pspace-complete;problem domain;rush hour (board game);solver;structural complexity (applied mathematics)	Marco Ragni;Felix Steffenhagen;Thomas Fangmeier	2011			psychology;knowledge management;management science;social psychology	AI	-22.964461841942683	-16.47075572718638	116778

Although completely unsupervised, the program progressively learns to recognize more and more complex rhythms struck on the user’s keyboard. It does so without any recording of the input flow, and without any pattern matching in the usual sense. On the contrary, internal processes are dynamically constructed to follow and anticipate the user’s actions. We show that these processes are representations of the rhythms in the interactivist sense, and that they emerge from non representational grounds, avoiding the symbol-grounding problem. They are not copies or transductions of reality, but ideal internal constructions of the agent, avoiding the circularity pointed out by Piaget. In practice, the active nature of this recognition process allows it to work even with noisy and complex input flows. © 2003 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.

3eebc7531d4d2b6a3ac0311e3b0e08efb3f60227	abduction in context - the conjectural dynamics of scientific reasoning		This book offers a novel perspective on abduction. It starts by discussing the major theories of abduction, focusing on the hybrid nature of abduction as both inference and intuition. It reports on the Peircean theory of abduction and discusses the more recent Magnani concept of animal abduction, connecting them to the work of medieval philosophers. Building on Magnani's manipulative abduction, the accompanying classification of abduction, and the hybrid concept of abduction as both inference and intuition, the book examines the problem of visual perception together with the related concepts of misrepresentation and semantic information. It presents the author's views on caricature and the caricature model of science, and then extends the scope of discussion by introducing some standard issues in the philosophy of science. By discussing the concept of ad hoc hypothesis generation as enthymeme resolution, it demonstrates how ubiquitous the problem of abduction is in all the different individual scientific disciplines. This comprehensive text provides philosophers, logicians and cognitive scientists with a historical, unified and authoritative perspective on abduction.

The system is based on J. Piaget's theory of social exchanges and consists of an algebra of exchange values, a social-reasoning mechanism based on that algebra, and the specification of structures for storing and manipulating such values. We use exchange values both as motivational elements and as regulatory elements that help to guarantee the continuity of the social interactions. We argue that this model can improve the modelling of social agents' interactions and capture more subjective aspects of their social behavior. To elucidate such statement, we use the proposed system to briefly model the political process of lobbying through campaign contributions and draw some conclusions on the dynamics of such scenario.	interaction	Maíra Ribeiro Rodrigues;Antônio Carlos da Rocha Costa	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-24613-8_5	continuous function;social relation;social science;social behavior;society;social psychology;specification	AI	-22.72377800583129	-11.219625103516064	117551

The design was inspired by the flexibility and scalability of the real-time strategy (RTS) game interface paradigm. However, the basic RTS architecture had to be substantially adapted to accommodate the constraints of field robot oper ation.

a2d6efccc9434b75a19e8fe9acb1a801892063b9	let the explanation fit the theorist - enactive explanatory pluralism and the representation debate		Discourse in the representation debate within cognitive science employs a problematic model of explanations, which needs to be challenged. What makes a good explanation, even on a philosophically realist interpretation, depends not only on the agreed facts regarding a phenomenon, but also intrinsically on the purposes of the theorist. While one might expect traditional cognitivists to be oblivious to these considerations, it is ironic that outspoken proponents of enactivism ignore them. It is also open for debate whether there is any objective fact of the matter regarding whether a given system makes use of representational content or not. Intentional systems theory is compatible with anti-realism regarding representations, as are philosophies of science such as constructive empiricism. I argue that, due to the diversity of the discipline, different theorists within cognitive science have legitimately different explanatory needs, and that this merits both nonrepresentational and representational explanations of the very same system.	abductive reasoning;artificial intelligence;bloom (shader effect);cognitive science;constructivist epistemology;enactivism;entity;mind;pluralism (philosophy);social constructivism;systems theory	Simon McGregor	2017		10.7551/ecal_a_049	systems theory;cognitivism (psychology);artificial intelligence;pluralism (political theory);epistemology;computer science;anti-realism;enactivism;constructive empiricism;phenomenon	AI	-25.840294750345922	-12.273899811383572	118543

As a result, our goal becomes that of providing a foundation upon which we can assess how well the human and the robot perform as a team. Toward the efficient modelling of such metrics, we attempt to determine the true amount of time that an operator has to dedicate to the robot. Therefore, we define the robot attention demand (RAD) as a function of both direct interaction time (DIT) and indirect interaction time (IIT), where the IIT is a direct consequence of the human trust in automation. We propose a two-level fuzzy temporal model to evaluate the human trust in automation while collaborating with robots to complete some tasks. The model combines the advantages of fuzzy logic and finite state machines to best model this phenomenon, and reduces the system complexity and the size of the knowledge base by grouping perceptions into first- and second-order perceptions. The fuzzy knowledge base is further updated by implementing an application robotic platform where robots and users interact via natural language to complete tasks with varying levels of complexity. User feedback is noted and used to tune the knowledge base where needed.	automata theory;automaton;directory information tree;finite-state machine;fuzzy logic;human–computer interaction;human–robot interaction;integrated information theory;knowledge base;natural language;rapid application development;robot	Jamil Abou Saleh;Fakhri Karray;Michael Morckos	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2012.6250792	fuzzy logic;productivity;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;automation;machine learning;fuzzy set;finite-state machine;natural language;computational complexity theory;trustworthy computing;robot kinematics;server	Robotics	-21.90179819907057	-18.768491821173825	118903

b18fb97b3bab7a59d90e75709a486bd94a407771	simulation of the introduction of new technologies in air traffic management	distributed artificial intelligence;multiagent learning;emergent behaviour	Accurate simulation of the effects of integrating new technologies into a complex system is critical to the modernisation of large infrastructure problems. This is especially true in the modernisation of our antiquated air traffic system, where there exist many layers of interacting procedures, controls, and automation all designed to cooperate with human operators. Additions of even simple new technologies may result in unexpected emergent behaviour due to complex human/machine interactions. One approach is to create high-fidelity human models coming from the field of human factors that can simulate a rich set of behaviours. However, such models are difficult to produce, especially to show unexpected emergent behaviour coming from many human operators interacting simultaneously within a complex system. Instead, we introduce an alternate approach. Instead of engineering complex human models, we directly model the emergent behaviour with relatively simple goal-directed agents. In this model, each autonomous agent in a system pursues individual goals, and the high-level behaviour of the system emerges from the interactions, foreseen or unforeseen, between the agents/actors. We show that this method is capable of reflecting the integration of new technologies in a historical case, and apply the same methodology for a possible future technology. Finally, we show how these high-level simulated behaviours compare to actual deployed air traffic control mechanisms in use today.	simulation	Logan Michael Yliniemi;Adrian K.

Deliberation is meant to endow a robotic system with extended, more adaptable and robust functionalities, as well as reduce its deployment cost. The ambition of this survey is to present a global overview of deliberation functions in robotics and to discuss the state of the art in this area. The following five deliberation functions are identified and analyzed: planning, acting, monitoring, observing, and learning. The paper introduces a global perspective on these deliberation functions and discusses their main characteristics, design choices and constraints. The reviewed contributions are discussed with respect to this perspective. The survey focuses as much as possible on papers with a clear robotics content and with a concern on integrating several deliberation functions.		Félix Ingrand;Malik Ghallab	2017	Artif.

Taken in isolation, cortical dominance would easily be a detriment to fitness. Whatever central nervous systems animals without such cortices employ, interpretations of what one senses, and motor schema for reacting are formulated in an unambiguous, monological manner (though we do not claim there need be any 'language of thought'). The trance state is but one means of coordinating conflicting signals from the neocortex ('new brain') and the paleoencephalon ('old brain'). We discuss how trance relates to ritual, and thus to artefact-as-art (both impulses for making and attending thereto). We thus consider the impulse for art, as with hunger or a sex drive, as a means evolution has provided for 'fine tuning' the minds of Homo sapiens.	internet art	Judson Wright	2017	IJART	10.1504/IJART.2017.10004728	psychology;impulse;visual arts;hypnosis;art;aesthetics;cognition;developmental psychology;computer science;artificial intelligence;music;evolution;linguistics;communication;management;musicality;adaptation	NLP	-25.76741306012658	-13.611229460024159	120014

Experiments in the emergence of grammar should hence start from a simulation of communicative exchanges between embodied agents, and then show how a particular issue that arises can be solved or partially solved by introducing more grammar. This paper shows a case study of this approach, focusing on the issue of search during parsing. Multiple hypotheses arise in parsing when the same syntactic pattern can be used for multiple purposes or when one syntactic pattern partly overlaps with another one. It is well known that syntactic ambiguity rapidly leads to combinatorial explosions and hence an increase in memory use and processing power, possibly to a point where the sentence can no longer be handled. Additional grammar, such as syntactic or semantic subcategorisation or word order and agreement constraints can help to dampen search because it provides information to the hearer which hypotheses are the most likely. The paper shows an operational experiment where avoiding search is used as the driver for the introduction and negotiation of syntax. The experiment is also a demonstration of how Fluid Construction Grammar is well suited for experiments in language evolution.	autonomous robot;combinatorial search;curse of dimensionality;embodied agent;emergence;experiment;expressive power (computer science);fluid construction grammar;functional approach;parsing;simulation	Luc Steels;Pieter Wellens	2006		10.1007/11880172_7	grammar systems theory;natural language processing;generative grammar;link grammar;syntax;operator-precedence grammar;computer science;affix grammar;parsing;regular tree grammar;phrase structure rules;emergent grammar;linguistics;relational grammar;attribute grammar;word grammar;communication;adaptive grammar;mildly context-sensitive grammar formalism;lexical grammar	NLP	-23.841990222314717	-11.312001863883081	120364

In TCFs, agent communication interfaces render their subdomains conditionally independent. In LCFs, either agents do not communicate or their messages are semantically less restricted. SVFs do not address the privacy issue well. LCF agents cannot draw from collective knowledge as well as TCF agents. However, disproportional effort has been dedicated to SVFs and LCFs, which can be attributed partially to unawareness of the computational advantages of TCFs over performance, efficiency and privacy. This work aims to provide empirical evidence of such advantages by comparing recursive modeling method (RMM) from LCFs and collaborative design network (CDN) from TCFs, both of which are decision-theoretic and the latter of which is a graphical model. We apply both to multiagent expedition (MAE), resolve technical issues encountered, and report our experimental evaluation.	agent-based model;computation;content delivery network;graphical model;intelligent agent;loose coupling;multi-agent system;recursion;theory;tor carding forum	Yang Xiang;Franklin Hanshar	2010	Int.

RTC was created by NASA-JSC in conjunction with General Motors for use with the Robonaut-2 and Valkyrie humanoid robot platforms. RTC provides a robot programming syntax and an IDE appropriate for use by experts and non-experts for implementation and execution. An expert developer can implement a new application with a combination of scripts, called process nodes, and state machines that set the control mode of the robot. A non-expert developer can assemble process nodes and controller state machines into novel hierarchical applications using a visual programming language (VPL). This VPL also allows developers to interface with other RTC applications or with third-party software packages using a variety of network transport mechanisms (ROS, TCP, shared memory, etc.). RTC represents an advantage over other robot programming frameworks by providing multiple levels of flexibility for development. The efficacy of RTC is demonstrated through examples of sophisticated behaviors, such as programming the Valkyrie robot to grab objects and turn a valve.	humanoid robot;integrated development environment;robonaut;robot operating system;shared memory;third-party software component;turned a;vpl research;visual programming language	Stephen Hart;Paul Dinh;John D.

The understanding and development of such advanced robotic systems demand extensive knowledge in engineering and computer science. In this paper, we describe the concept of a distributed educational system as a valuable tool for introducing students to interactive parallel and distributed processing programming as the foundation for distributed robotics and human-robot interaction development. This is done by providing an educational tool that enables problem representation to be changed, related to multirobot control and human-robot interaction control from virtual to physical representation. The proposed system is valuable for bringing a vast number of issues into education – such as parallel programming, distribution, communication protocols, master dependency, connectivity, topology, island modeling software behavioral models, adaptive interactivity, feedback, and user interaction. We show how the proposed system can be considered a tool for easy, fast, flexible hands-on exploration of these distributed robotic issues. Through examples, we show how to implement interactive parallel and distributed processing in robotics with different software models such as openloop, randomness-based, rule-based, user-interactionbased, AIand ALife-based, and morphology-based control.	artificial life;computer science;distributed computing;galaxy morphological classification;hands-on computing;human–robot interaction;interactivity;logic programming;parallel computing;randomness;robotics;self-reconfiguring modular robot	Henrik Hautop Lund;Luigi Pagliarini	2011	JRM	10.20965/jrm.2011.p0859	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;robotic paradigms;adaptable robotics;geography of robotics;future of robotics;computer engineering	Robotics	-25.72118436602048	-20.64913784779115	120770

The main profit of this approach is that the sonification can be used as a first insight for two models: a quantum mechanical system model and a quantum computation model.	interaction;model of computation;quantum computing;quantum harmonic oscillator;quantum information;quantum mechanics;sonification	Anna Saranti;Gerhard Eckel;David Pirrò	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-12439-6_10	quantum simulator;quantum operation;quantum information;systems modeling;quantum probability;harmonic oscillator;amplitude damping channel;quantum network;open quantum system;quantum geometry;quantum dissipation;quantum computer;quantum process;quantum dynamics;quantum statistical mechanics;profitability index	Theory	-31.305798627815445	-17.21468257496756	121036
6ae89dfee96d8057604e55a7d057ece81eae0ba2	norm and social compliance: a computational study	norm stabilization;agent based simulation;social simulation;cognitive architectures	The necessity to model the mental ingredients of norm compliance is a controversial issue within the study of norms. So far, the simulation-based study of norm emergence has shown a prevailing tendency to model norm conformity as a thoughtless behavior, emerging from social learning and imitation rather than from specific, norm-related mental representations. In this article, the opposite stance-namely, a view of norms as hybrid, two-faceted phenomena, including a behavioral/social and an internal/mental side-is taken. Such a view is aimed at accounting for the difference between norms, on one hand, and either behavioral regularities conventions on the other. After a brief presentation of a normative agent architecture, the preliminary results of agent-based simulations testing the impact of norm recognition and the role of normative beliefs in the emergence and stabilization of social norms are presented and discussed. We focused our attention on the effects which the use of a cognitive architecture namely a norm recognition module produces on the environment.	computation	Marco Campennì;Federico Cecconi;Giulia Andrighetto;Rosaria Conte	2010	IJATS	10.4018/jats.2010120104	artificial intelligence;social simulation;social psychology;norm	NLP	-22.096953918610883	-14.747517721786085	121308

In developing such a conceptual framework, it is necessary to distinguish between the underlying stable roots of behavior, which we term a genotype, and the possibly adaptive expression of those genetic roots, which we term the phenotype. Selection occurs over expressed behavior. As a result, plasticity, the capacity to adapt behavior, poses a tradeoff as it both offers the possibility of adaptive learning, but at the same time mitigates the effectiveness of selection processes to identify more or less superior genetic roots of behavior. These issues are explored in the context of a computational model which examines the interrelationship among processes of variation and selection, and plasticity.	chromosome (genetic algorithm);computation;computational model;ecology	Daniel A.

Given a set of sounds containing a priori desired qualities and a population of agents interacting locally, the method generates both musical form and matter resulting from sonic trajectories. This proposal involves the use of bio-inspired algorithms, which possess intrinsic features of adaptive, self-organizing systems, as definers of generating and structuring processes of sound elements. Self-organization makes viable the temporal emergence of stable structures without an external organizing element. Regarding musical performance as a creative process that can be described using trajectories through the compositional space, and having the simultaneous emergence of musical matter and form resulting from the process itself as the final objective, the conception of a generative paradigm in computer music that does not contemplate a priori external organizing elements is the main focus of this proposal.	algorithm;biological system;british informatics olympiad;definition;emergence;organizing (structure);programming paradigm;self-organization;sonic interaction design;time series	Marcelo F.

In particular, we discuss a novel form of abduction, called creative abduction, where new knowledge is generated in the process of explaining observed events, and demonstrate its relevance to knowledge discovery. The main contribution of this paper is twofold: First, we show that creative abduction can be used to infer a disposition explaining local temporal regularities. In the presence of multiple correlated regularities, this form abduction may significantly unify a given corpus of knowledge, corresponding to theory formation in scientific discovery. Second, we present a weaker form of creative abduction that infers a goal (e.g. interest) from simple ‘condition-effect’ rules called ‘transitions’. If multiple transitions are correlated, the weaker form of creative abduction can be used to identify, e.g. clusters of Web users, as done in Web usage mining. We will focus on the formal underpinnings of this new form of abduction that seems readily applicable to a wide range of practical knowledge discovery problems. q 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.	abductive reasoning;concept learning;data mining;mirai;relevance;web mining	Helmut Prendinger;Mitsuru Ishizuka	2005	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2004.12.003	web mining;abductive reasoning;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;data mining;knowledge extraction	ML	-27.332019819151355	-11.485176233779756	121526

Cognitive support systems allow for the integration of qualitative and quantitative representations, support basic approaches to decision making, and provide descriptions of alternative realities. The development of representations and the process of their modifications are illustrated with Canada-U.S. Sofiwood Lumber Negotiations. Several experiments were conducted to show the flexibility and expressive power of restructurable modeling and its computer implementation, the Negoplan system. The approach allows for the stability analysis of alternative proposals and use of different prescriptive methods and descriptive models for a more comprehensive simulation and analysis of negotiation processes.	experiment;simulation	Gregory E.

Automatic search for similar parts is an effective solution for design reuse. Previous studies have only concerned similarity assessment based on complete 3D models, which may produce unsatisfactory result in practice. This paper proposes a novel scheme which incorporates the concept of LOD (levels of detail) into 3D part search. The scheme allows searching with different LOD variants created from the negative feature tree (NFT) of a solid model. A back-propagation artificial neural network is established to combine the D2-based similarity evaluation at each level of NFT. A human cognition model (HCM) is obtained by training the network with a set of data generated from a human experiment of similarity ranking. Search examples based on HCM show that the proposed scheme provides a practical tool for retrieval of similar part models. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ad6bab821158c9f3bf1869f74b13424676d17ca6	the consciousness prior		A new prior is proposed for representation learning, which can be combined with other priors in order to help disentangling abstract factors from each other. It is inspired by the phenomenon of consciousness seen as the formation of a low-dimensional combination of a few concepts constituting a conscious thought, i.e., consciousness as awareness at a particular time instant. This provides a powerful constraint on the representation in that such low-dimensional thought vectors can correspond to statements about reality which are true, highly probable, or very useful for taking decisions. The fact that a few elements of the current state can be combined into such a predictive or useful statement is a strong constraint and deviates considerably from the maximum likelihood approaches to modelling data and how states unfold in the future based on an agent's actions. Instead of making predictions in the sensory (e.g. pixel) space, the consciousness prior allows the agent to make predictions in the abstract space, with only a few dimensions of that space being involved in each of these predictions. The consciousness prior also makes it natural to map conscious states to natural language utterances or to express classical AI knowledge in the form of facts and rules, although the conscious states may be richer than what can be expressed easily in the form of a sentence, a fact or a rule.	consciousness;feature learning;machine learning;natural language;pixel;word embedding	Yoshua Bengio	2017	CoRR		abstract space;machine learning;mathematics;artificial intelligence;natural language;prior probability;consciousness;instant;sentence;feature learning;phenomenon	AI	-22.904298568751067	-18.08971242927886	122716

Therefore, robots should be equipped with a knowledge representation system that is able to soundly handle both aspects. In this paper, we thus introduce an architecture that provides a coupling between plan-based robot controllers and a probabilistic knowledge representation system based on recent developments in statistical relational learning, which possesses the required level of expressiveness and generality. We outline possible applications of the corresponding models in the context of robot control, discussing suitable representation formalisms, inference and learning methods as well as transparent extensions of a robot planning language that allow robot control programs to soundly integrate the results of probabilistic inference into their plan generation process.	artificial intelligence;attribute-value system;autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);cognition;declarative programming;first-order predicate;knowledge representation and reasoning;robot control;service robot;statistical relational learning	Dominik Jain;Lorenz Mösenlechner;Michael Beetz	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152676	robot learning;computer vision;statistical relational learning;computer science;control system;artificial intelligence;machine learning;probabilistic logic;personal robot	Robotics	-27.926724149068363	-20.460776364490254	122721

It is argued that the basic language for describing psychological phenomena, shared by both behavioral and cognitive approaches, that of stimulus and response, is not adequate for the situational approach. Two examples, one drawn from published research in animal learning and one illustrating a re-analysis of standard tasks used in studies of problem solving, demonstrate differences between characterizing tasks in traditional stimulus-response terms as opposed to characterizing tasks in terms of situations, deeds, and observations.

In the last decades, the focus on the research in machine learning has hovered pendulum-like from biologically inspired to artificial models with different degree of cognitive plausibility. As the time goes by and research evolves, we will likely see men and machines facing an increasingly number of similar learning tasks. Now, regardless of the extent to which they share biological principles, one might be interested in studying human and artificial cognitive processes under the same umbrella. In this paper we claim that the principles of cognitive development stages, that have been the subject of an in-depth analysis in children by Jean Piaget [1, 2] are likely to inspire important advances in machine learning. He pointed out that we can identify four major stages or periods of development in child learning, where each stage is self-contained and builds upon the preceding stage. In addition, children seem to proceed through these stages in a universal, fixed order. They start developing sensorimotor and preoperational skills, in which the perceptual interactions with the environment dominate the learning process, and evolve by exhibiting concrete and formal operational skills, in which they start to think logically and develop abstract thoughts. When observing human and nowadays artificial minds on the same play, one early realizes that machines do not take into account most of the rich human communication protocols. In most of the studies of machine learning, the agent is expected to learn from labelled and/or un-labelled examples finalized to a specific task. There are, however, a number of other crucial interactions of the agent that are rarely taken into account. Human learning experiences witness the importance of asking questions and of learning under a of teaching plan. While the first interaction has been considered in a number of machine learning models, apart from a remarkable exception [3], to the best of our knowledge, teaching plans have not been significantly involved in learning algorithms. What is often neglected in machine learning is that most intriguing human learning skills are due, to a large extent, to the acquisition of relevant semantic attributes and to their relations. This makes learning a process which goes well beyond pure induction; the evidence provided by the induction of a semantic attribute is typically propagated to other attributes by formal rules, thus giving rise to a sort of reinforcement cyclic process. ∗When I was in high school, my physics teacher whose name was Mr. Bader called me down one day after physics class and said, “you look bored; I want to tell you something interesting. Then he told me something which I found absolutely fascinating, and have, since then, always found fascinating. Every time the subject comes up, I work on it.

Machine Learning can help by generating partial or preliminary versions of the agent low-level behavior. However, for actually being useful for the human modeler the results should be interpretable, which may require some post-processing step after the actual behavior learning. In this contribution we test the sensitivity of the resulting, interpretable behavior program with respect to parameters and components of the function that describes the intended behavior.	agent-based model;high- and low-level;loss function;machine learning;optimization problem;simulation;user error;video post-processing	Robert Junges;Franziska Klügl-Frohnmeyer	2012			error-driven learning;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	AI	-23.58291345984853	-20.161385241532734	123136

Our research is based on language of conceptual graphs, modal attitudes from BDI and BOID agent architectures and general notions from computational linguistics. Criminal liability is an important part of criminal law whereupon other institutes of criminal law are built. Liability, as description of when legal subject is liable for some act he committed, rests upon notions of agent's knowledge and intent to commit the act, as well as notions of external obligations, which prescribe subject what to do and what to avoid, and his internal intimate desires about the possible future states of the world. Legal subjects can be taken to be autonomous agents whose mental attitudes can be modeled with different modal logics. Conceptual graphs are used to graphically model legal norms which define criminal liability.	autonomous agent;autonomous robot;computational linguistics;conceptual graph;decision theory;modal logic	Bostjan Bercic	2003		10.1145/1047788.1047802	modal logic;conceptual graph;agent architecture;knowledge representation and reasoning;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;autonomous agent;software agent;graphical model	AI	-22.088428155426776	-10.994808891712607	123282

In this sense, the anticipatory perspective has yet to contribute to more adequate predictions. For purely physics-based phenomena, predictions are as good as the science describing such phenomena. For the dynamics of the living, the physics of the matter making up the living is only a partial description of their change over time. The space of possibilities is the missing component, complementary to physics and its associated predictions based on probabilistic methods. The inverse modeling problem, and moreover the reverse computation model guide anticipatory-based predictive methodologies. An experimental setting for the quantification of anticipation is advanced and structural measurement is suggested as a possible mathematics for anticipation-based risk assessment.	model of computation;relevance;reverse computation;risk assessment	Mihai Nadin	2009	Risk and Decision Analysis	10.3233/RDA-2009-0009	psychology;simulation;artificial intelligence;social psychology	ML	-24.21057105601785	-14.301882884693313	123625

Supporting decision-makers that participate in group decision-making processes is a complex task, especially when decision-makers have no opportunity to gather at the same place and at the same time. In this work, we propose a Web based Group Decision Support System (WebGDSS) which intends to support decision-makers anywhere, anytime and through almost any kind of devices. Our system was developed under a SOA architecture and we used a multi-criteria algorithm that features decision-makers’ cognitive aspects, as well as a component of generation of intelligent reports to provide feedback of decision-making processes to the decision-makers.	decision support system	Luís Conceição;João Carneiro;Goreti Marreiros;Paulo Novais	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-65340-2_6	web application;human–computer interaction;architecture;artificial intelligence;machine learning;decision support system;group decision-making;affective aspects;cognition;computer science	HCI	-31.527720034037017	-10.353085044272921	123655

To aid navigation, many people take advantage of route directions, either provided by other people or by electronic navigation services. However, their effectiveness may be hampered if they are overly complex. While most people are generally good at focusing on important information, this is a challenge for navigation services. Thus, being able to automatically determine important points along a route that need to be included in route directions would provide a further step towards cognitively ergonomic navigation services. In the present study, methods for calculating the salience--or importance--of decision points are correlated with the frequency of decision points appearing in route directions. Results show that metrics based on the probability of a decision point being traversed and information-theoretic quantities of decision points correlate significantly with incidence in route directions, indicating that it is possible to identify crucial decision points in advance. This has implications for the design of navigation services that are able to adapt their assistance in real time.	computation	Makoto Takemiya;Kai-Florian Richter;Toru Ishikawa	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-32732-2_25	turn-by-turn navigation;computer vision;simulation;geography;operations management;route planning software	HCI	-19.3884197607115	-22.891659425118178	123910

With current computational aids to science work, the human knowledge that creates meaning out of analyses is often only recorded when work reaches publication – or worse, left unrecorded altogether – for lack of an ontological model for scientific concepts that can capture knowledge as it is created and used. We argue for an approach to representing scientific concepts computationally that reflects (1) the situated processes of science work, (2) the social construction of knowledge, and (3) the emergence and evolution of understanding over time. In this model, knowledge is the result of collaboration, negotiation, and manipulation by teams of researchers. Capturing the situations in which knowledge is created and used helps these collaborators discover areas of agreement and discord, while allowing individual inquirers to maintain different perspectives on the same information. The capture of provenance information allows historical trails of reasoning to be reconstructed, revealing the process by which knowledge is adopted, revised, and reused in a community; as a result, end users can evaluate the utility and trustworthiness of knowledge representations. We present a proof-of-concept system, called Codex, based on this situated knowledge model. Codex supports visualization of knowledge structures through concept mapping, and enables inference across those structures. The proof-of-concept is deployed in the domain of geoscience to support distributed teams of learners and researchers by encouraging greater appreciation for shared understanding.	application domain;cognition;computation;computer-supported cooperative work;concept map;emergence;ibm notes;information system;knowledge representation and reasoning;middleware;ontology (information science);open-source license;open-source software;report;sensemaking;sensor;situated;top-down and bottom-up design;trust (emotion)	William Pike;Mark Gahegan	2007	International Journal of Man-Machine Studies	10.1016/j.ijhcs.2007.03.002	concept map;knowledge base;visualization;data structure;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;body of knowledge;knowledge-based systems;ontology;data mining;knowledge extraction;personal knowledge management;knowledge value chain;domain knowledge	AI	-32.89268483375075	-15.761357746849502	124136

bfa6322b872478ddcebff56f40969fe771f73b9f	citizen social lab: a digital platform for human behavior experimentation within a citizen science framework		Cooperation is one of the behavioral traits that define human beings, however we are still trying to understand why humans cooperate. Behavioral experiments have been largely conducted to shed light into the mechanisms behind cooperation-and other behavioral traits. However, most of these experiments have been conducted in laboratories with highly controlled experimental protocols but with limitations in terms of subject pool or decisions' context, which limits the reproducibility and the generalization of the results obtained. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, some experimental approaches have moved human behavior experimentation from laboratories to public spaces, where behaviors occur naturally, and have opened the participation to the general public within the citizen science framework. Given the open nature of these environments, it is critical to establish the appropriate data collection protocols to maintain the same data quality that one can obtain in the laboratories. In this article we introduce Citizen Social Lab, a software platform designed to be used in the wild using citizen science practices. The platform allows researchers to collect data in a more realistic context while maintaining the scientific rigor, and it is structured in a modular and scalable way so it can also be easily adapted for online or brick-and-mortar experimental laboratories. Following citizen science guidelines, the platform is designed to motivate a more general population into participation, but also to promote engaging and learning of the scientific research process. We also review the main results of the experiments performed using the platform up to now, and the set of games that each experiment includes. Finally, we evaluate some properties of the platform, such as the heterogeneity of the samples of the experiments, the satisfaction level of participants, or the technical parameters that demonstrate the robustness of the platform and the quality of the data collected.	citizen science;data quality;experiment;mortar methods;scalability	Julián Vicens;Josep Perelló;Jordi Duch	2018		10.1371/journal.pone.0207219	software;citizen science;scientific method;data science;robustness (computer science);rigour;modular design;population;computer science;data quality	ML	-21.24298423544148	-16.88001790772207	124374

The recent introduction and evolution of semantic mapping motivated this survey, in which an explicit analysis of the existing methods is sought. The several algorithms are categorized according to their primary characteristics, namely scalability, inference model, temporal coherence and topological map usage. The applications involving semantic maps are also outlined in the work at hand, emphasizing on human interaction, knowledge representation and planning. The existence of public available validation datasets and benchmarking, suitable for the evaluation of semantic mapping techniques is also discussed in detail.

Our project uses a different approach. We try to model a human driver‘s behaviour by modelling her or his cognitive information processing in a simulated environment. While several papers about experiments concerning single phenomena exist, this approach is meant to describe the whole information processing of a driver on a high abstraction level.

PaGR is a knowledge recognition component within a decision-making agent that controls simulated unmanned air vehicles in Beyond Visual Range combat. PaGR stores in a case the goal, observations, and policy of a hostile aircraft, and uses cases to recognize the policies and goals of newly-observed hostile aircraft. In our empirical study of PaGR’s performance, we report evidence that knowledge of an adversary’s goal improves policy recognition. We also show that PaGR can recognize when its assumptions about the hostile agent’s goal are incorrect, and can often correct these assumptions. We show that this ability improves PaGR’s policy recognition performance in comparison to a baseline algorithm.	adversary (cryptography);agent-based model;algorithm;baseline (configuration management);finite-state machine;object storage;subject matter expert turing test;subject-matter expert;unmanned aerial vehicle	Hayley Borck;Justin Karneeb;Michael W.

The adaptation is due to a need to maintain a desired or a reference relationship between a set of input and output signals. We may loosely divide SAS into adaptor and adapted components. The adapted component has an ongoing relationship with the environment. The adaptor detects and evaluates the need for change in the operation of the adapted component. In anthropomorphic terms, this detection and evaluation involves the cognitive processes of introspection and assimilation. However, an artifact may only need a supervisory control module. In a hierarchical system, the idea of adapted and adaptor can be extended to several levels with the higher level adapting the function of lower level. Hierarchical architectural systems are well studied. However, self-adaptive software is more than hierarchical control or application of adaptive techniques such as neural nets or genetic approaches.	action selection;agent communications language;autonomy;encode;fits;hard coding;systems engineering	Henry Hexmoor	2001		10.1007/3-540-36554-0_16	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence	ML	-22.028484369712253	-17.725421637896037	125888

The virtual laboratory INSIGHT allows the user to design and run a great variety of experiments in a timeand cost-saving manner. The peculiarity of INSIGHT is the visualization of the internal dynamics, thus the \inner life"""" of the agent can be made transparent to the user during the run. The virtual laboratory Veri able scienti c experiments require that they can be repeated independent from time and space. The experimenter needs to keep certain parameters at constant values while varying others systematically in order to study the e ects of those parameters on the whole system. Unfortunately, those requirements cannot be ful lled in experiments with physical agents. In general, it is impossible to run exactly the same experiment a second time. Di erent lighting conditions on di erent days or di erent times of day can lead to serious changes in the behavior of the agent. The test environment as well as the sensor con guration of the agent can change during a run. The systematic variation of the environment (size, number and variety of features) and the agents body (size, sensorposition and -orientation, actuators) for experimental reasons is only feasible in very simple experimental setups.

Agents '97 Marina del Rey CA USA (c) 1997 ACM Furthermore experiments with physical behavior-based agents are very time and cost consuming. About 80% of experimentation time is spent struggling with sensor calibration and hardware aws, only 20% ows into the design of the control program. Analysing the results of the experiments is even worse. The distributed nature of control makes it very di cult to tell exactly what processes have been responsible for an observed behavior. Motivated by those problems we developed INSIGHT, a virtual laboratory which allows scientists to easily run (and repeat) a large number of controlled experiments. One can design the test environment, attach sensors and actuators to an agent, and program arbitrary control programs. Instead of spending a lot of e ort on the physical peculiarity of sensors and hardware, the user can concentrate exclusively on the design and dynamics of the control programs."""	as-interface;autonomous robot;deployment environment;experiment;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;open road tolling;requirement;sensor;simulation	Simone Strippgen	1997		10.1145/267658.267774	computer science;artificial intelligence;autonomous agent	Robotics	-30.113772086065	-22.61615125992978	126031

The testbed provides a reusable simulation framework, and a particular model for PDP environments. The demo illustrates the testbed by showing two MASbased solutions, one based on gradient field coordination, a second solution based on the coordination mechanism called ‘delegate MAS’.

There are many approaches to incorporating moral values in autonomous decision-making that are based on some sort of logical deduction. However, we argue here, in order for decision-making to seem persuasive to humans, it needs to reflect human values and judgments. Employing some insights from our ongoing researchusing features of the blackboard architecture for a context-aware recommender system, and a legal decision-making system that incorporates supra-legal aspects, we aim to explore if this architecture can also be adapted to implement a moral decision-making system that generates rationales that are persuasive to humans. Our vision is that such a system can be used as an advisory system to consider a situation from different moral perspectives, and generate ethical pros and cons of taking a particular course of action in a given context.

A field experiment was conducted in which twenty-four auditors (partners in international public accounting firms) were asked to review four cases describing real companies that, unknown to the auditors, had perpetrated financial frauds. While many of the auditors failed to detect the manipulations in the cases, a small number of auditors were consistently successful. Since the detection of frauds occurs infrequently in the work of a given auditor, we explain success by the application of powerful heuristics gained from experience with deceptions in everyday life. These heuristics implement a variation of Dennett’s intentional stance strategy, which is based on interpreting detected inconsistencies in the light of the Deceiver’s (i.e., management’s) goals and possible actions. We explain failure to detect deception by means of perturbations (bugs) in the domain knowledge of accounting needed to apply these heuristics to the specific context of financial statement fraud. We test our theory by showing that a computational model of fraud detection that employs the proposed heuristics successfully detects frauds in the cases given to the auditors. We then modify the model by introducing perturbations based on the errors made by each of the auditors in the four cases. The resulting models account for 84 of the 96 observations (i.e., 24 auditors x four cases) in our data. © 2001 Cognitive Science Society, Inc. All rights reserved. * Corresponding author.

Traditionally, the recognition of team formations is carried-out without taking into account an expressive representation of relations between players. This kind of approaches are not able to manage the constant changes occurring in the soccer domain, which results in an inefficient way of recognizing formations immerse in dynamic environments. It is presented in this work an efficient model to recognize formations based on a representation that takes into account multiple relations among defender, midfielder and forward players. The proposed model has been tested with different teams in off-line mode showing that it is able to recognize the different main formations used by a team during a match.	agent-based model;multi-agent system;robotics	Huberto Ayanegui-Santiago	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04441-0_14	simulation;artificial intelligence;structural analysis	AI	-23.960155225723813	-21.062654009578484	126880

Although they have different emphases, these frameworks each provide coherent, high-level views of intelligent agency. However, more pragmatically, much of the complexity of building intelligent agents is in the low-level details, especially when building agents that exhibit high degrees of competence while interacting in complex environments. We call such agents “heavy”, to distinguish them from “light”, single-task agents (e.g., service brokers) that are often fielded in multi-agent systems. Good examples of fielded heavy agents include a real-time fault diagnosis system on the Space Shuttle [1] and a real-time model of combat pilots [4].	coherence (physics);high- and low-level;intelligent agent;interaction;multi-agent system;real-time clock;real-time transcription	Randolph M.

The first one is Riesbeck's parser for Schank's conceptual dependency; the second is the 'LNR' parser for Norman and Rume hart's active semantic networks. Both are described in terms of Kaplan's General Syntactic Processor formalism. This analysis shows that 'conceptual dependency' and 'active semantic networks' have little or nothing to do with the actual functioning of the parsers. Computationally, the two parsers differ only in terms of (a) effective use of interrupts and (b) reliance on selectional restrictions to guide parsing. A synthesis of the best features of both is suggested.	parsing	Marc Eisenstadt	1979			natural language processing;computer science;programming language;algorithm	HCI	-32.68067332474947	-14.750809952083793	127288

Dependency inherently exists in a system where agents do not have selfsufficient sensing or data collection capabilities. In other words, an agent requires information from others to achieve its goals. Finding the best partners to form an information sharing network using the notion of trustworthiness can be triggered by dependency adaptation. The research experimentally demonstrates that dependency adaptation can lead a system to form an information sharing network which results in high efficiency and information quality.	experiment;information quality;intelligent agent;multi-agent system;trust (emotion)	K.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a new computational model of human chess cognition. We suggest that analogies and abstract roles are crucial to understanding a chess scenario. We present a proof-of-concept model, in the form of a computational architecture, which may be able to account for many crucial aspects of human play, such as (i) concentration of attention to relevant aspects, (ii) how humans may avoid the combinatorial explosion, (iii) perception of similarity at a strategic level, (iv) a state of meaningful anticipation over how a global scenario may evolve, and (v) the architecture’s choice as an emergent phenomenon from the actions of subcognitive processes.	cognition;computation;computational model;emergence;emoticon;mind	Alexandre Linhares	2014	Inf.

dfc4fba6ea8a35f7ca7366296d5d1788b7532c32	a probabilistic implementation of emotional bdi agents	occ;emotions;appraisal;bdi	A very well known reasoning model in Artificial Intelligence is the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention). A BDI agent should be able to choose the more rational action to be done with bounded resources and incomplete knowledge in an acceptable time. Although humans need emotions in order to make immediate decisions with incomplete information, traditional BDI models do not take into account affective states of the agent. In this paper we present an implementation of the appraisal process of emotions in BDI agents using a BDI language that integrates logic and probabilistic reasoning. Specifically, we implement the event-generated emotions with consequences for self based on the OCC cognitive psychological theory of emotions. We also present an illustrative scenario and its implementation. One original aspect of this work is that we implement the emotions intensity using a probabilistic extension of a BDI language. This intensity is defined by the desirability central value, as pointed by the OCC model. In this way, our implementation of an emotional BDI allows to differentiate between emotions and affective reactions. This is an important aspect because emotions tend to generate stronger response. Besides, the intensity of the emotion also determines the intensity of an individual reaction.	artificial intelligence;mental state;optimistic concurrency control	João Carlos Gluz;Patrícia Augustin Jaques	2014		10.5220/0004815501210129	emotion;valuation;computer science;artificial intelligence	AI	-21.837525707949585	-11.223047294174055	127833

Knowledge can be seen as the mental phenomenon that documents (combining signs into text, depending on the state of knowledge of the recipient) can cause through interpretation. The examination of these “correct circumstances” is an important part of information science. This article represents the following developments in the concept of information: Information is understood as potential until somebody interprets it. The objective carriers of potential knowledge are signs. Signs need interpretation to release knowledge in the form of interpretants. Interpretation is based on the total semantic network, horizons, worldviews, and experience of the person, including the emotional and social aspects. The realm of meaning is rooted in social-historical as well as embodied evolutionary processes that go beyond computational algorithmically logic. The semantic network derives a decisive aspect of signification from a person’s embodied cultural worldview, which, in turn, derives from, develops, and has its roots in undefined tacit knowledge. To theoretically encompass both the computational and the semantic aspects of document classification and retrieval, we need to combine the cybernetic functionalistic approach with the semiotic pragmatic understanding of meaning as social and embodied. For such a marriage, it is necessary to go into the constructivistic secondorder cybernetics and autopoiesis theory of von Foerster, Maturana, and Luhmann, on the one hand, and the pragmatic triadic semiotics of Peirce Søren Brier, Copenhagen Business School, Department for Management, Politics, and Philosophy, Blaagaardsgare BB. DK–2200 Koebenhaven 630 library trends/winter 2004 in the form of the embodied Biosemiotics, on the other hand. This combination is what I call Cybersemiotics. Introduction Library information science (LIS) devotes itself primarily to the study of systems and methods for classification, indexing, storing, retrieval, and mediation of documents that can cause the creation of information in the user’s mind. The aim is to create information in the user’s mind to be understood as meeting social, cultural, or existential needs. The crucial question is that of the interpretation of the document’s meaning for the individual in a given organizational or institutional connection, and in a given historical situation. Ingwersen (1996) describes the information need as built from a cognitive state (including previous knowledge), a work task, interest, and a domain. These social-pragmatic circumstances form the context for understanding our informational desires and problems. He develops a matrix with four distinct cognitive forms of information needs relevant for determining search behavior and types of polyrepresentation. But thus far, we do not have an explicit theoretical treatment of how varying forms of aboutness come into existence and function in a social context. As information, in this view, develops primarily in an individual mind in front of a document-mediating system, there are no explicit theories about how information develops in social practice. We still have difficulties with the construction of a comprehensive theoretical framework, which can improve consistency in our use of scientific concepts within LIS, guide our research and development of research methods, and finally, provide the background for the interpretation of empirical research. As in Machlup’s (1983) theory of information, the cognitive viewpoint focuses on the individual. Hjørland and Albrechtsen (1995) describe the influence of knowledge domains on concept formation and interpretation in the domain analytic paradigm. They give theoretical reasons why classification and indexing should be directed toward the ways signification is created in discourse communities related to different knowledge domains, especially within the different fields of science. This is followed up in a book by Hjørland (1997) that has an activity approach to information science. But as Blair (1990) points out in his foundational book Language and Representation in Information Retrieval, then we need to add a pragmatic semiotic and language game– based theory of interpretation to make the above-mentioned new developments function in a common framework and get access to the mystery of meaning in human language that goes beyond computational approaches (Fodor, 2001, points out that mystery). See also Bowker and Star’s (1999) development of a pragmatic semantic embodied theory of classification. This insight leads to the need for a general semiotic framework of communication and sign interpretation. We need to open LIS to the results and constructive thinking of a more general theory of how signs—such as words 631 brier/cybersemiotics and symbols—acquire their meaning through communication, be it oral or written (Warner, 1990; Suominen, 1997; Thellefsen, Brier, & Thellefsen, 2003). Semiotics should encompass not only social and cultural communication but also should be able to address natural phenomena such as the communication of biological systems. It should have categories for technical information processing. At the same time, this transdisciplinary theory should distinguish between physical, biological, mental psychological, and social-inguistic levels and not reduce them to the same process of information. Thus, LIS requires a theory of the cognition and communication of signification by different types of systems. Neither the objective syntactic approach of the information-processing paradigm nor the personal phenomenological approach of Machlup can deliver a framework encompassing communication processes in social, biological, and technical systems. As Buckland (1991) points out, we also must draw on systems theory and cybernetics, and I especially will point to the new second-order cybernetics and autopoiesis theory. In contrast to Suominen (1997), who builds on the French culture-centered structualistic semiology originating in Saussure’s work, I chose to build on the American pragmatic transdisciplinary semiotics founded by Charles Sanders Peirce as it promises to cover nature and technology as well. More than anything LIS—and many other informational fields—needs a theory that can dissolve the mutual ignorance and hostility between Snow’s two cultures. See, for instance, the work of Zadeh (1999) and Sinha et al. (2000),2 making computing with words possible. The great conceptual and methodological differences between the computational and semantical approaches to communication divide LIS in two paradigms to a degree that one can hardly talk about one knowledge domain—a problem that psychology, computer science/informatics, and medicine, to name a few, also have. Analyzing the Possibility of an Information Science Science—especially natural science—has a double role as both developer of technology and worldview producer. Reliance on science as an instrument for obtaining knowledge is an important part of our faith in technology as the correct means for developing society. Science is also the foundation of “the modern worldview,” indicated by rationalism and physicalism and embedded in a theory of evolution. Science is therefore an important element in the system world’s strengthening of its self-conscious belief of having special access to the truth about reality and holding the key to perpetual progress based on the steadily increasing control of nature. The ideological tendency to view the acquisition of scientific knowledge as a unique and privileged path to truth and reality is, in my opinion, one of the main problems of the modern information society. All knowledge other than the “laws of nature” determined by physics and mathematics is 632 library trends/winter 2004 regarded as uncertain and subjective. Part of our cultural project is to uncover all “laws of nature” to fulfill the desire to display the ultimate safe basis for the construction of objective, true, and provable knowledge. Stone by stone, we will erect the cathedral of truth and reach the final realization and control of our own selves and surrounding nature, and with this we hope to liberate the human intellect from natural and material forces. This is the project that—according to our self-understanding—separates us from, and raises us above, other human cultures and is central to our view of ourselves as “modern.” Today this idea is embraced by great scientific thinkers like Stephen Hawkins (1989) and E. O. Wilson (1999) but questioned by philosophers and sociologists of science like Thomas Kuhn (1970) and Bruno Latour (Latour, 1993). The latter argues, “we have never been modern.” One characteristic of modernity is faith in rationalism as the highest value and the associated tendency to see science as a “meta-narrative.” The empirical-mathematical science, formulated by Galileo among others, has come to play a great role in our cultural self-understanding and worldview. In the mechanical physics that consequently gradually developed lies a vision that Laplace clearly articulated about the possibility of achieving a complete mathematical description of the collective expression for “The Laws of Nature,” in short, a World Formula. This belief in science and technology, where science becomes a “great story,” has much in common with the myth of dogma-based cultures where myth defines true knowledge, true values, and real beauty. Instead of becoming true liberating knowledge, science is, to a certain degree, finding its limited viewpoint raised to a dogma called “the scientific worldview” that promises to uncover the algorithms behind language and intelligence and implement them in the computer.

Sponsored by U.S. Army Research Institute (ARI), the objective of this research is to make the decision-making process of complex agents less predictable and more realistic, by incorporating emotional factors that affect humans. In tune with modern theories of emotions, we regard emotions essentially as subconscious signals and evaluations that inform, modify, and receive feedback from a variety of sources including higher cognitive processes and the sensorimotor system. Thus, our work explicitly distinguishes the subconscious processes (in a connectionist implementation) and the decision making that is subject to emotional influences (in a symbolic cognitive architecture).It is our position that """"emotional states"""" are emergent patterns of interaction between decision-making knowledge and these emotional signal systems. To this end, we have adopted an approach that promotes the emergence of behavior as a result of complex interactions between factors affecting emotions, integrated in the connectionist-style model, and factors affecting decision making, represented in the symbolic model.This paper presents the implementation of emotions architecture and explains how we evaluated the system. This includes a description of the behaviors we used in our prototype, the design of our experiments, a representative set of behavior patterns that emerged as a result of exercising our model over the design space, and our project's lessons learned."""	cognition;cognitive architecture;connectionism;emergence;experiment;feedback;interaction;prototype;theory	Amy E.

165075802c317f9b314412b100881f32cb868ca0	an enhanced mental model elicitation technique to improve mental model accuracy	journal article	The causal mental model representation has been used extensively in decision support. Due to limited information requirements of this representation, that is concepts and relationships, the users are required to articulate only the mental models, without invoking the corresponding experiential knowledge stored in associative memory. The elicitation of mental models without being endorsed by experiential knowledge may lead to inaccurate, invalidated or biased mental models, and espoused theories, being stored for decision making. We introduce SDA articulation/ elicitation cycle, which invokes a user’s associative memory during the articulation/elicitation process to validate mental models. It is argued in this paper that by engaging associative memory during the mental model articulation/elicitation process, the accuracy and validity of mental models can be improved, the biases can be reduced, and the theories-in-use can be elicited rather than the espoused theories. A case study is presented to demonstrate the working and contributions of the SDA articulation/elicitation cycle.	mental model	Tasneem Memon;Jie Lu;Farookh Khadeer Hussain	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-42054-2_11	computer science	HCI	-30.639110848306125	-10.74011992968541	128426
3ff7ca9d81fdab21ec192c7a598bc26a97b733b9	data-driven conceptual spaces: creating semantic representations for linguistic descriptions of numerical data		There is an increasing need to derive semantics from real-world observations to facilitate natural information sharing between machine and human. Conceptual spaces theory is a possible approach and has been proposed as mid-level representation between symbolic and sub-symbolic representations, whereby concepts are represented in a geometrical space that is characterised by a number of quality dimensions. Currently, much of the work has demonstrated how conceptual spaces are created in a knowledge-driven manner, relying on prior knowledge to form concepts and identify quality dimensions. This paper presents a method to create semantic representations using data-driven conceptual spaces which are then used to derive linguistic descriptions of numerical data. Our contribution is a principled approach to automatically construct a conceptual space from a set of known observations wherein the quality dimensions and domains are not known a priori. This novelty of the approach is the ability to select and group semantic features to discriminate between concepts in a data-driven manner while preserving the semantic interpretation that is needed to infer linguistic descriptions for interaction with humans. Two data sets representing leaf images and time series signals are used to evaluate the method. An empirical evaluation for each case study assesses how well linguistic descriptions generated from the conceptual spaces identify unknown observations. Furthermore, comparisons are made with descriptions derived on alternative approaches for generating semantic models.	artificial intelligence;description;dimensions;inference;level of measurement;linguistics;numerical analysis;semantic data model;semantic interpretation;spaces;time series	Hadi Banaee;Erik Schaffernicht;Amy Loutfi	2018	J.

Some philosophers have thought that science gives us compelling evidence against nihilism. In this article I respond to this concern. An initial challenge for nihilism stems from the fact that composition is such a ubiquitous feature of scientific theories. In response I motivate a restricted form of scientific anti-realism with respect to those components of scientific theories which make reference to composition. A second scientifically based worry for nihilism is that certain specific scientific phenomena (quantum entanglement, natural selection) might require ineliminable quantification over composite objects. I address these concerns, and argue that there seem to be nihilist-friendly construals of the scientific phenomena in question.	composite pattern;entity–relationship model;jim christy;justin (robot);mereological nihilism;mereology;quantum entanglement;resources, events, agents (accounting model);theory;vagueness	Andrew Brenner	2016	Synthese	10.1007/s11229-016-1234-6	philosophy;epistemology;mathematics	NLP	-25.958366691812063	-12.993628790089108	129028

Yet for this promise to become reality, the Artificial Intelligence community will need to address two important issues. The first is how to determine that the assistants we build will, in fact, behave appropriately and safely. The second issue is how to convince society at large that these assistants are useful and reliable tools that should be trusted with important tasks. In this paper, we argue that both of these issues are be addressed by behavior metamodels (i.e., abstract models of how the agent behaves). Our argument is 1) based on experimental evidence of how metamodels can improve debugging/validation efficiency, and 2) based on how metamodels can contribute to three fundamental components of trusting relationships established in previous literature.	artificial intelligence;debugging;metamodeling;norm (social);trust (emotion)	Scott A.

eb88a8797ddccda443801bb5d3c9663a2c32a6c7	human-extended machine cognition		Human-extended machine cognition is a specific form of artificial intelligence in which the casually-active physical vehicles of machine-based cognitive states and processes include one or more human agents. Human-extended machine cognition is thus a specific form of extended cognition that sees human agents as constituent parts of the physical fabric that realizes machine-based cognitive capabilities. This idea is important, not just because of its impact on current philosophical debates about the extended character of human cognition, but also because it helps to focus scientific attention on the potential role of the human social environment in realizing novel forms of artificial intelligence. The present paper provides an overview of human-extended machine cognition and situates the concept within the broader theoretical framework of active externalism. The paper additionally shows how the concept of human-extended machine cognition can be applied to existing forms of human–machine interaction, especially those that occur in the context of the contemporary Internet and Web.	artificial intelligence;cognition	Paul R.

Current approaches either use human experts or a completely centralized approach for this adaptation. These centralized approaches become very impractical and will not scale if the complexity of the game increases. Agents can be used in serious game implementations as a means to reduce complexity and increase believability but without some centralized coordination it becomes practically impossible to follow the intended storyline of the game and select suitable difficulties for the trainee. In this abstract we show that using agent organizations to coordinate the agents is scalable and allows adaptation in very complex scenarios while making sure that both the storyline and the right difficulty level for the trainee are preserved.

A core question for cognitive science is what mental representations support this ability. We offer one proposal based on the framework of influence diagrams, an extension of Bayes nets that is suited for representing intentional goal-directed agents. We evaluate this framework in two experiments that require participants to make inferences about what another person knows or values. In both experiments, participants’ judgments were better predicted by our influence diagrams account than by several alternative accounts.	bayesian network;cognitive science;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;influence diagram;mental state;petri net	Alan Jern;Charles Kemp	2011			decision problem;social psychology;computational model;social cognition;mental representation;bayes' theorem;influence diagram;artificial intelligence;mathematics;psychological intervention;natural history	HCI	-23.47331284250847	-13.942637652818336	129608

This perspective is motivated by evidence from cognitive research supporting the view that organizational problem solvers rely to a large extent on episodic knowledge gained from similar problem solving experiences. In addition, research indicates that organizational workers tend to cooperate and seek others' experiences, especially as task domains become more complex and relevant knowledge becomes more sparse. To this end we propose a decision support architecture using a combined approach of Case-Based Reasoning and Analogical Reasoning, which utilizes previous decision making results to aid in current problem solving activities, and distributed case management, which facilitates the exchange of computer-mediated experiences among organizational workers. A prototype implementation that demonstrates the feasibility of this approach is also described.		T. H. Hofbauer;Carson C. Woo;C. D. Martens	1994	Int. J. Cooperative Inf.

f4c029044afa6cb3b08d5e47701d532b3aed9a40	a clustering based approach for realistic and efficient data-driven crowd simulation		In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to generate realistic steering behaviors for virtual crowds in crowd simulation. We take advantage of both rule-based models and data-driven models by applying the interaction patterns discovered from crowd videos. Unlike existing example-based models in which current states are matched to states extracting from crowd videos directly, our approach adopts a hierarchical mechanism to generate the steering behaviors of agents. First, each agent is classified into one of the interaction patterns that are automatically discovered from crowd video before simulation. Then the most matched action is selected from the associated interaction pattern to generate the steering behaviors of the agent. By doing so, agents can avoid performing a simple state matching as in the traditional example-based approaches, and can perform a wider variety of steering behaviors as well as mimic the cognitive process of pedestrians. Simulation results on scenarios with different crowd densities and main motion directions demonstrate that our approach performs better than two state-of-the-art simulation models, in terms of prediction accuracy. Besides, our approach is efficient enough to run at interactive rates in real time simulation.	cluster analysis;cognition;crowd simulation;interaction design pattern;logic programming;reactive planning;real-time clock	Mingbi Zhao	2015	CoRR		computer vision;simulation;crowd simulation;multimedia	AI	-21.703637642070518	-21.323087885151512	129747

This has serious implications for applied disciplines such as information retrieval, artificial intelligence and robotics. Inspired by a mathematical formalism that generalizes quantum mechanics the authors have constructed a contextual framework for both concept representation and decision making, together with quantum models that are in strong alignment with experimental data. The results can be interpreted by assuming the existence in human thought of a double-layered structure, a classical logical thought and a quantum conceptual thought, the latter being responsible of the above paradoxes and nonclassical effects. The presence of a quantum structure in cognition is relevant, for it shows that quantum mechanics provides not only a useful modeling tool for experimental data but also supplies a structural model for human and artificial thought processes. This approach has strong connections with theories formalizing meaning, such as semantic analysis, and has also a deep impact on computer science, information retrieval and artificial intelligence. More specifically, the links with information retrieval are discussed in this paper.	artificial intelligence;cognition;cognitive science;computer science;decision theory;information retrieval;quantum mechanics;robotics;semantic analysis (compilers);semantics (computer science)	Diederik Aerts;Liane Gabora;Sandro Sozzo;Tomas Veloz	2011	CoRR		probability theory;classical logic;quantum cognition;quantum information science;decision theory;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;categorical quantum mechanics;double layer;coherent information;statistics	AI	-27.050856506707017	-13.321657275337103	130262

64df16c27d7ac75c728c9b29f489149f17b1e076	modeling believable virtual characters with evolutionary fuzzy cognitive maps in interactive storytelling		To generate believable virtual characters in real-time is a key issue to improve users’ engaging experience in the interactive storytelling. In real life, the emotions and behaviors of characters evolve inductively according to the mutual causal relationships, with some stochastic variations. This is not addressed well in the virtual environment with conventional models, e.g. rule-based expert system, Fuzzy Cognitive Map and so on. In this paper, we use a computational model, namely Evolutionary Fuzzy Cognitive Map (E-FCM), to model the attributes of characters (such as emotions and behaviors) as concepts with the dynamic causal relationships among them. As an extension to FCM, E-FCM models not only the fuzzy causal relationships among the variables, but also the stochastic causal relationships, and asynchronous activity update of the concepts, so that the variables evolve in a dynamic manner with their respective evolving time schedules. As a result, the characters are presented with more realistic and dynamic emotions and behaviors, which enhances the user experience at last. Introduction Interactive storytelling in the virtual environment has gained a lot of interests from both industry and academy research as a new genre of interactive entertainment. In Aristotle’s Poetics (Aristotle 300BC), character is the most important factor other than plot in a story. People can remember a story easily though a vivid character, such as Hamlet in the drama “Hamlet”. Dynamic and realistic virtual characters are very important for users to gain an immersive or engaging experience. Two most important aspects of character modeling includes: emotion modeling and behavior modeling. Because the characters inhabit and present in the virtual environment, the behaviors and emotions of the virtual characters are evolving in real-time. Prior works (Mateas 1997; Mateas & Stern 2003; Cavazza, Charles, & Mead 2002; Magerko & Laird 2003), have studied believable characters with reasonable planning of their behaviors and the modeling of the behaviors or emotions. Compared to conventional storytelling, the character modeling in interactive virtual storytelling become complex, which have the following properties: Copyright c © 2009, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. 1. Complex Causal Relationships: The causal relationships are complex causal related, which include the mutual causal relationships between the characters and environment and the causal relationship between the emotions and behaviors, especially when the story scenario is complex and in large scale and a lot of context, emotion and behavior variables need to be modeled. 2. Dynamic: In order to bridge the experience in virtual world and real world, the emotions and behaviors of characters keep on changing as the story is going on. The characters need to respond rationally to the story changes, and show correctly from the behaviors and emotions. 3. Randomness: The virtual characters do not perform in a deterministic way always. There are some stochastic behaviors of the variables. Currently, there have been a lot of researches done on modeling the dynamic causal relationships among a set of variables, e.g. rule-based expert system, Fuzzy Cognitive Maps etc. Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) (Kosko 1986) by Kosko is an efficient inference engine to model such complex causal relationships. Kosko and Dickerson (Dickerson & Kosko 1994) also make a simple study to model the characters (Fish, Shark etc) in a virtual world. However, as a generic model, FCM is not powerful or robust enough to model a dynamic and evolving virtual world. Based on FCM, numerous extensions are proposed to enhance its capabilites. Miao et. al. (Miao, Liu, & Miao 2001) proposed Dynamic Causal Network to model the concepts quantitatively with time variables. Moreover, the causality between two variables might be probabilistic rather than deterministic, beyond the fuzziness. Song et. al. (Song et al. 2006) proposed probabilistic events to model the uncertain concepts. In order to describe the general rulebased (AND/OR) inference, rule-based FCM is also proposed (Carvalho & Tom 2000). In addition, Evolutionary Multilayered Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (ECNFCM) (Mateou, Andreou, & Stylianou 2006) is also proposed as an inference tool for a real-time system with evolutionary strategy. However, the models above are mostly used as inference engines rather than real-time simulation modeling. Currently, there is not a solution that combines all the above features of the FCM extensions in order to model real-time character variables, e.g. behaviors and emotions.	academy;artificial intelligence;bayesian network;behavior model;causal filter;causality;computation;computational model;expert system;fuzzy cognitive map;granular computing;inference engine;interactive storytelling;interactivity;logic programming;minimum-weight triangulation;randomness;real life;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;schedule (computer science);simulation;stern–brocot tree;stochastic matrix;tom gilb;user experience;virtual reality;virtual world	Yundong Cai;Chunyan Miao;Ah-Hwee Tan;Zhiqi Shen	2009			artificial intelligence;machine learning;simulation modeling;fuzzy logic;probabilistic logic;fuzzy cognitive map;computer science;inference;inference engine;storytelling;interactive storytelling	AI	-22.114469468856374	-20.215185675858066	130542

The model maintains three parallel representations of the entire live/virtual system: wavespace, symbol space and performance space. The cross-modal analysis and representation of behavior is important to the evolution of the system, which displays emergence on multiple levels of structure. Micro-evolution takes place within the population of wave-emitting and –listening agents. A higher level of structure emerges from their aggregate in interaction with the live performer, and a formal level as symbol space learns from the performer. Cross-modal representation is seen as a significant factor in the evolution of Western art music, in the development of multi-leveled structure and of work that affords many dimensions of engagement. We discuss the nature of knowledge produced through working with such systems and the role of the subject in ALife-generated knowledge.

An interesting problem that arises in this context, and that has received little attention to date, is whether we can predict the complexity of a steering scenario by analyzing the configuration of the environment and the agents involved. We statically analyze an input scenario and compute a set of novel salient features which characterize the expected interactions between agents and obstacles during simulation. Using a statistical approach, we automatically derive the relative influence of each feature on the complexity of a scenario in order to derive a single numerical quantity of expected scenario complexity. We validate our proposed metric by demonstrating a strong negative correlation between the statically computed expected complexity and the dynamic performance of three published crowd simulation techniques.	autonomous robot;crowd simulation;interaction;numerical analysis;population;virtual world	Glen Berseth;Mubbasir Kapadia;Petros Faloutsos	2013		10.1145/2522628.2522650	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;crowd simulation	AI	-20.952847638036026	-20.93622450335695	130866

However, different theories require different structures in the agent architecture, reflecting on the way they influence agent behavior. This paper presents a flexible framework to generalize the influence of personality traits on the behavior of the agents. The framework provides an easy way to test and compare different personality models.

Using this model, it is straight forward to model agents' social commitments (obligations) based solely on observation of messages passed between the agents (such observation is supported by our agent infrastructure system). Furthermore, owing to the performatives being in a subsumption lattice, it is relatively easy for an observer to infer social commitment relationships even if the observer does not understand the details of messages or even the exact performatives used (so long as the observer has access to the performatives ontology).Although social commitment modelling of agent behaviour does not demand that agents are implemented using the social commitment model, our model nonetheless can be used in agent implementation to simplify the specification of agent behaviour through the use of """"commitment operators"""" attached to the performatives (as policies) in the subsumption lattice.The primary contribution of this paper is to show how FIPA's performatives can be mapped onto a theory of social commitment to allow observable social behaviour and conformance to social norms."""	conformance testing;norm (social);observable;ontology (information science);subsumption architecture;subsumption lattice;theory	Robert C.

However, this role is not one of identifying scientifically respectable states of the world. Rather, I argue that intentional psychology acts as a type of phenomenological model, as opposed to a mechanistic one. I demonstrate that, like other phenomenological models in science, intentional psychology is a methodological tool with its own benefits and insights that complements our mechanistic understanding of systems. As a result, intentional psychology’s distinctive scientific benefit is its ability to model systems in unique, non-mechanistic, ways. This allows us to generate predictions that we cannot otherwise generate using the mechanistic models of neuroscience and cognitive psychology necessary for various scientific tasks.	complement (complexity);computer simulation;feedback;gestalt psychology;michael jackson's moonwalker;noise shaping;phenomenological model;predictive modelling;quantum mechanics	Eric Hochstein	2012	J.

This allows us to see how this most basic law of physics determines the development of the system towards states with less action — organized states. Also we state that the metric tensor can describe the specific state of the constraints of the system, which is its actual organization. With this the organization is defined in two ways: 1. quantitative: the action I; 2. qualitative: the metric tensor gmn. These two measures can describe the level of development and the specifics of the organization of a system.

aa3f7f7c1eba8b17e24afed17a8836131ff11afd	a framework for constructing cognition ontologies using wordnet, framenet, and sumo	attention;cognition;taxonomy;language;ontology	Psychoinformatics is an emerging discipline that uses tools from the information sciences to organize psychological data. This article supports that objective by proposing a framework for constructing cognition ontologies by using WordNet, FrameNet, and the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO). The first section describes the major characteristics of each of these tools. WordNet is a large lexical data base that was begun in the 1980s by George Miller. FrameNet is a database of event schemas based on a theory of frame semantics developed by the linguist Charles Fillmore. SUMO is a formal ontology of concepts expressed in mathematical logic that supports deductive reasoning. The next section discusses the objectives of science ontologies and includes examples for psychoses and for emotion. The article then describes potential applications of cognition ontologies for (1) studying how people organize knowledge, (2) analyzing major theoretical concepts such as abstraction, and (3) formulating premises that can serve as a link between informal taxonomies and formal ontologies. The final section discusses extending cognition ontologies to related domains such as artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience.		Stephen K.

The ontology was developed to support reasoning about tasks, such as task recognition and relocation. Our proposal is formalized in OWL (Web Ontology Language) and SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language). We show one scenario to exemplify reasoning situations based on the axioms and rules of our ontology. This knowledge-level representation of tasks can be explored to support reasoning about activities for groups of people. The knowledge asserted and inferred in the ontology is useful in multi-agent systems to enhance agent coordination and collaboration through reasoning over tasks.

1ee25a9175f383f7e8632fab76e34ee78ac87ca8	natural language research at the university of pennsylvania	natural language research	"""This is an ongoing research project whose goal is to build a system for tutoring students to interpret and solve high school algebra level word problems. Until now, the major emphasis has been on the development of a model of problem solving based on protocols between tutors and students. Our model currently consists of four sets of production rules which account for strategies, computations on problem entities, algebraic manipulations, and semantics of the problem statement. The next phase of this research will investigate student-tutor interaction. Our protocols indicate that tutor's utterances fall into several categories. Among these are suggestions, examples, analogies, reinforcements, and """"fillers"""" which serve to keep a dialog ..going. Students, during the qualitative, or interpretive, phase of processing a word problem, make statements about problem entity relationships, state equations, and ask questions which must be interpreted and responded to by the tutor. What the tutor says, category and content, is predicated to be based on 1) the set of goals a tutor is attempting to satisfy, 2) the tutor's perception of the student's plan and goals, and 3) the tutor's diagnoses of student difficulties. Clearly, each of the three tutorial i%nctions mentioned above requires the interpretation of student inputs and the subsequent generation of appropriate remarks. Some of the problems in dealing with inputs have been investigated by Burton (1976). These include ellipsis, anaphora, and other forms of fragmented sentence construction. Tutorial responses should be constructed in such a way as to provide appropriate guidance withour appearing mechanized. The fundamental issues involve both questions of representation and language generation. Given a representation of a problem statement, for example, how does the tutorial component make access to the correct entities, plan a response, and generate language which is acceptable. Questions about proper pronominal reference and generation of different responses with the same meaning to reinforce or clarify a point must be addressed. We currently have defined an internal representation and a model of tutorial responses (Brcgar and Farley, in preparation) as part of the existing system for solving algebra word problems. Not all of it is implemented; however the tutorial function will have to interact with elements of this model as well as its own knowledge of language to prodnce the desired behavior.

However, to do so, decentralized approaches have to take into account the simultaneous evolution of the agents, and to face the issue of credit assignment. The usual monoagent methods where selfish agents are driven by a single reward cannot be applied anymore [5]. New concepts must be added to consider the global reward and the actions of other agents in the system, like empathy [3] or elaborate communication [4]. The approach we propose is to get inspiration from biological systems to find new ways of coordinating independent learners at low costs and on the sole basis of local rewards. The Interac-DEC-MDP formalism is based on the introduction of an interaction module inspired by ethological experiments in order to profit from simple individual learnings. It is an extension of the DEC-MDP model where each agent has total observability and where the global reward is only partially perceived by each agent. The originality of Interac-DEC-MDP relies in the adding of an interaction module. Our interactions are defined as reactive mutual influences exerted by two agents. Thus, the resolution of interactions does not consider only selfish interests but is based on an assessment, made by the two involved agents, of more global interests and can thus produce altruistic behaviors that can improve the global efficiency of the system. The idea we have followed is that, if the interactions are well chosen, they can reduce the conflicts between agents at low costs.	biological system;computation;experiment;interaction;markov chain;markov decision process;semantics (computer science)	Vincent Thomas;Christine Bourjot;Vincent Chevrier	2004	Proceedings of the Third International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, 2004.

We have undertaken several case studies where formal and/or computational models of stem cell systems, have been re-developed using an agent-based approach. This paper presents details of one of these case studies where we have used an agent-based approach as opposed to a cellular automata approach. A formalisation of the non-agent and agent-based approach is given, and from the results of this investigation, we aim to demonstrate the advantages of the agent-based approach for developing biologically plausible models with emergent self-organising dynamics. The aim of this paper first to discuss the importance of modelling and simulating stem cells, because of certain experimental limitations, but also to demonstrate that the multi-agent approach to modelling is the most appropriate.	agent-based model;automata theory;cellular automaton;computation;computational model;emergence;multi-agent system;niche blogging;self-organization;simulation	Mark d'Inverno;Rob Saunders	2004		10.1007/11494676_4	simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;management science	AI	-19.7854829873758	-16.471133075419292	132997

Its current phase brings together four robotic and research-creation labs with various expertises in unstable and dynamic environments. The first group, under the direction of professor Inna Sharf, is based at the department of mechanical engineering at University McGill. It works on control and modeling of autonomous blimps for satellite emulation. The second group is headed by professor Philippe Giguere from University Laval. It focuses on localization systems for robots operating in unknown outdoor environments. The third group is also from McGill, but this time from the computer science department. Headed by professor Gregory Dudek, it investigates the challenges presented by autonomous underwater robots, and by their interactions with human divers. The last team is based at the UQAM school of design. It is headed by professor Nicolas Reeves and engineer David St-Onge. It works on installations and performances in digital and algorithmic arts, and on the impact of new medias and technologies on the fields of art, architecture and design. The Aerostabile project pushes the boundaries of engineering and art by proposing a close hybridization of the two disciplines. It redefines the human-robot interaction paradigm, working specifically on the new interfaces required by the specific nature and context of emerging robotic systems. Multidisciplinary approaches are required to seamlessly integrate aesthetics, grace and precision. Amongst the tools and strategies developed by the research team, one of the most important is the organization of regular meetings similar to art residencies, which are structured around the framework of engineering software and hardware integration workshops. During such meetings, which occur twice a year, the four groups work together with engineers and artists from different disciplines. These intense collaborative events happen in spaces large enough to fit at least two 225-cm floating robotic cubes called """"Tryphons"""", the latest models of a series of flying automata developed by Reeves and St-Onge. Fruitful questions and discussions emerge from these residencies, leading to new questions and development axis both in art and engineering. Whenever possible, they happen in public spaces, allowing direct contact with all kinds of audiences and with inspiring media artists and creators-researchers. The specific constraints of out-of-the-lab environments raise new problematics for all engineers, while the encounter between different academic cultures influence the development priorities. At the end of our journey, on top of the engineering papers that will be published, we aim to produce the first hybrid performance involving four performers interacting with four fully autonomous aerobots."""	algorithm;apache axis;automata theory;autonomous robot;computer science;control theory;definition;emulator;human–robot interaction;internationalization and localization;olap cube;performance;philippe kruchten;programming paradigm	David St-Onge;Nicolas Reeves;Philippe Giguère;Inna Sharf;Gregory Dudek;Ioannis M.

1d9ce19b8a9a589b637ef50815aa8b7550fe8e0d	the atoms of language: the mind's hidden rules of grammar, by mark c. baker; foundations of language: brain, meaning, grammar, evolution, by ray jackendoff	mark c. baker;hidden rule;basic book	Over the last few years, interest in modeling language has risen within the artificial life community (e.g., [3]). This work has to do with understanding the evolution of language, the dynamics of language in a population, and how language functions in an individual. Unfortunately, this work is little known within the linguistics community, and what little of it is known is often criticized as being simplistic. This has to do with the fact that linguists do not know much about the problems of modeling, but also with the fact that more than a few modelers know very little of (general) linguistics. Two recent books that are of interest to researchers (especially those without much formal linguistic training) interested in modeling language are The Atoms of Language by Mark C. Baker and Foundations of Language by Ray Jackendoff. Although the two books have rather similar titles, their approaches to the problems of linguistics differ considerably. Baker’s book, The Atoms of Language: The Mind’s Hidden Rules of Grammar, explores one particular theory about language, and tries to make it accessible to an audience of relatively lay readers. It starts with the observation that languages can be astonishingly different, but still translatable into each other. He illustrates this with the story of the Navajo code talkers of the Second World War: the US used speakers of the Navajo language to communicate confidential information about military operations by radio. While the Japanese were unable to understand the messages, or find any way to decode them, the Navajo speakers themselves had no trouble at all translating complex messages to and from English. Baker explains this apparent paradox using the principles-and-parameters theory. This theory, introduced by Noam Chomsky [1], proposes that the grammatical differences between human languages can be explained on the basis of a small number of hierarchically organized discrete principles and parameters. The principles determine the different possible ways in which human grammars can be organized, whereas the parameters are set by infants learning the language and determine how the grammar will turn out exactly. In the course of the book, Baker identifies a number of potential parameters, using data from about fifty different languages, from Abkhaz to Zapotec. In organizing the material in the book, Baker effectively uses chemistry as a metaphor, and presents the principles-and-parameters theory as the “periodic table” of language. In his view, the principles are the “atoms of language”; hence the title of the book.	artificial life;book;code talker;confidentiality;human-based computation;modeling language;organizing (structure);population;principles and parameters	Bart de Boer	2003	Artificial Life	10.1162/106454603321489545	generative grammar;computer science;artificial intelligence;linguistic competence;cognitive science;head-driven phrase structure grammar	NLP	-28.1729845588769	-14.744070366190815	133248

Special care was brought to make the simulations playable by humans and to favor the apparition of coalitions. Being controlled by humans, the agents of the initial model became completely pro-active and were able to exchange coffee and money and to form coalitions to fulfill the buyer's offers. Coalitions appeared as expected.Besides, during these experiments, we observed the emergence of specialized roles which were not included in the initial model. We implemented a regular multi-agent system based on the initial model to test the distributed system solving improvements brought by the roles that emerged.	distributed computing;domain model;emergence;experiment;humans;multi-agent system;simulation	Paul Guyot;Alexis Drogoul;Christian Lemaître	2005		10.1145/1082473.1082503	distributed algorithm;simulation;design process;computer science;artificial intelligence;domain model;multi-agent system;management science	AI	-20.40126021883502	-13.743605254792906	133741

These methods are based on the model for context-specific route directions as presented in Richter & Klippel (2005); cardinal  directions, global landmarks, and environmental structure, like different districts, are used as elements in our approach  to generate coarse directions that indicate major reorientation points along the way. The generation process results in an  abstract relational specification of these directions that reflect conceptual elements of route information; the abstract  specification may then be externalized in different modalities, for example verbally or graphically, to be presented to the  user, which will be outlined.  	blue (queue management algorithm);cognition;german research centre for artificial intelligence;graphical user interface;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization	Kai-Florian Richter	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-36728-4_16	management science;spatial cognition;modalities;turn-by-turn navigation;cardinal direction;computer science	NLP	-19.86206150688118	-21.986518858425043	134063
2e22c2ddf3299a160261c1efc27d8c7316c8fd05	engineering self-organising systems	engineering self-organising systems	A self-organising system functions without central control, and through contextual local interactions. Components achieve a simple task individually, but a complex collective behaviour emerges from their mutual interactions. Such a system modifies its structure and functionality to adapt to changes to requirements and to the environment based on previous experience. Nature provides examples of self-organisation, such as ants food foraging, molecules formation, or antibodies detection. Similarly, current software applications are driven by social interactions (negotiations, transactions), based on autonomous entities or agents, and run in highly dynamic environments. The issue of engineering applications, based on the principles of selforganisation to achieve robustness and adaptability, is gaining increasing interest in the software research community. The aim of this paper is to survey natural and artificial complex systems exhibiting emergent behaviour, and to outline the mechanisms enabling such behaviours.	autonomous robot;complex systems;emergence;entity;intelligent agent;interaction;requirement;self-organization	Sven A.

d233ab5a613e70eba952b12a73897460ff6b7db9	toward computational motivation for multi-agent systems and swarms		Motivation is a crucial part of animal and human mental development, fostering competence, autonomy, and open-ended development. Motivational constructs have proved to be an integral part of explaining human and animal behavior. Computer scientists have proposed various computational models of motivation for artificial agents, with the aim of building artificial agents capable of autonomous goal generation. Multi-agent systems and swarm intelligence are natural extensions to the individual agent setting. However, there are only a few works that focus on motivation theories in multi-agent or swarm settings. In this study, we review current computational models of motivation settings, mechanisms, functions and evaluation methods and discuss howwe can produce systems with new kinds of functions not possible using individual agents. We describe in detail this open area of research and the major research challenges it holds.		Md Mohiuddin Khan;Kathryn Kasmarik;Michael Barlow	2018	Front.

Having the ability of handling emotions is considered to make autonomic unit more intelligent, more communicative and more social. In this article we try to build an emotion model for agents that act as autonomic units in autonomic systems and can self-manage its behavior to achieve the best performance. From four levels we define four models progressively and the top-level model is defined on the foundation of the three below, combining them as a unity. By given arousing axioms theoretically of several typical emotions, the model is proved to be effective for reasoning emotions of autonomic unit, and can be easily extended for dealing with other type of emotions. On this base an architecture of emotional autonomic unit is described. An example shows that emotion plays an important role in intelligent decision making, which proves the validity of the model and the special function in practice.	autonomic computing;autonomic networking;cognition;cognitive model;peano axioms;simulation	Donglei Zhang;Yu Pan;Zhongzhi Shi	2009	2009 8th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Informatics	10.1109/COGINF.2009.5250801	psychology;artificial intelligence;communication;social psychology	Robotics	-24.314739639871114	-14.841622643972057	134502

All interactions among various agents can be viewed as the transaction activity or behavior in the crowd intelligence network. In this study, we analyze the transaction modes and rules from the perspective of crowd science. We review the transaction modes and rules and further develop four modes for the intelligent transactions based on the modularization level of the transaction objects and the quantity of transaction subjects, including the demand side and the supply side. We also show representative examples to further illustrate rules and features of these transaction modes.	citizen science;intelligent agent;interaction;online transaction processing;physical object;rule (guideline)	L.

b64d66d7396a7a8f1f1f3bf5c0fa2cb94c031a7d	comparison of agentsl performance in learning to cross a highway for two decisions formulas		We compare the performance of simple cognitive agents, learning to cross a Cellular Automaton (CA) based highway, for two decision formulas used by the agents’ in their decision-making process. We describe the main features of the simulation model: CA based highway traffic environment, agents and their decision and learning mechanisms. The agents use a type of “observational social learning” strategy, i.e. they observe the performance of other agents and they try to mimic what worked for other agents and they try to avoid what did not work for the other agents. In the decision-making process of deciding whether to cross the highway or to wait, depending on the simulation setup, the agents use one of the two decisions formulas: the first one based only on the assessment of the agents crossing decisions (cDF), or the second one based on the assessment of the agents crossing and waiting decisions (cwDF). Our simulations show that the performance of agents using cwDF is much better than the performance of the agents using cDF in their decision making process. We measure the agents’ performance by the numbers of agents: who crossed successfully, who were killed and those who are still queuing to cross at simulation end.	autonomous robot;cellular automaton;cognitive science;correctness (computer science);feedback;knowledge base;leslie speaker;modeling language;pc bruno;simulation;tree accumulation	Anna T.

By means of speech acts, a group of people who have different areas of expertise can cooperate and dynamically reconfigure their social interactions to perform tasks and solve problems that would be difficult or impossible for any single individual. This paper proposes a framework for intelligent systems that consist of a variety of specialized components together with logic-based languages that can express propositions and speech acts about those propositions. The result is a system with a dynamically changing architecture that can be reconfigured in various ways: by a human knowledge engineer who specifies a script of speech acts that determine how the components interact; by a planning component that generates the speech acts to redirect the other components; or by a committee of components, which might include human assistants, whose speech acts serve to redirect one another. The components communicate by sending messages to a Linda-like blackboard, in which components accept messages that are either directed to them or that they consider themselves competent to handle.	artificial intelligence	John F.

This paper reports and discusses the main results of the MACP4Log (Mobile Autonomous and Cooperating robotic Platforms for supervision and monitoring of large LOGistic surfaces) research project, aimed at the study and development of a set of algorithms and services, enabling autonomous navigation of a team of mobile robots in large logistic spaces, and exploiting cooperation, through communication with a supervisor and among the robotic platforms. Although the main services required for the robots coincide with the most common issues of mobile robotics (i.e., localization, mapping, SLAM and exploration), the particular characteristics of the logistic spaces introduce specific problems (e.g., related to a high symmetry of the environment and/or to its variability), which must be properly taken into account. The paper discusses in detail such problems, summarizing the main results achieved both from the methodological and the experimental standpoint, and is completed by the description of the general functional architecture of the whole system, including navigation, logistic, and monitoring services.

3e119fd50e407b33cff75dda907134ccfb8492d5	detection of unethical intelligent agents in ethical distributed constraint satisfaction problems		Ethics has become the most interesting research field in artificial intelligence, it has been considered in several areas such as intelligent military applications, private data systems and autonomous systems (e.g. autonomous vehicle). Another artificial intelligence discipline needs to consider ethics in autonomous multi-agent systems. Designers of these autonomous systems create agents that decide, act and interact in dynamic environments under different constraints, where they may share or execute tasks with other agents and human beings. As a consequence, these intelligent agents gain increased autonomy and human supervision by users decreases. In Distributed Constraint Reasoning framework, the scope of the agents activities magnifies while solving mathematical problems and ensuring that such systems will not make irrelevant or even dangerous decisions is necessary. This paper shows an ethical control system which can be implemented into Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problem (DisCSP) algorithms by several ways, and which is able to detect the abnormal activities and then the responsable unethical agents in order to regulate the resolution ethically. Experimental results show the feasibility of our contribution.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;autonomous car;autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);autonomy;centralized computing;constraint satisfaction problem;control system;data system;distributed constraint optimization;information privacy;intelligent agent;multi-agent system;relevance	Ghizlane El Khattabi;Oussama Haij;Imade Benelallam;El-Houssine Bouyakhf	2018		10.1145/3177148.3180083	mathematical problem;management science;intelligent agent;data system;constraint satisfaction problem;autonomy;control system;autonomous system (internet);multi-agent system;computer science	AI	-19.940369763879705	-11.166883244369615	135524

The control system has to consider various demands: first, it has to manage unstructured and dynamic environments. Second, as humans are around, aspects of safety are of particular importance. This implies that the system has to be highly reactive. Third, the robot also has to be capable of carrying out dialogs to be taught or instructed. Altogether, this requires a highly integrated control framework. In this paper we present an agent-based architecture for our mobile robot BIRON in order to realize sophisticated human-robot interaction. The architecture is built in a modular fashion and controlled by a central execution supervisor using an event queue to handle asynchronous events. This execution supervisor contains an augmented finite state machine which is specified in XML and thus is highly generic. Similarly, the communication between all modules is based on XML. The overall system, therefore, is easily maintainable and extensible, as the architecture's design allows us to add new modules to the system without requiring major modifications on existing components.	agent-based model;control system;finite-state machine;human–robot interaction;message queue;mobile robot;service robot;xml	Marcus Kleinehagenbrock;Jannik Fritsch;Gerhard Sagerer	2004	2004 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) (IEEE Cat.

A research study was conducted to determine the use of cost-estimating in commercial digital printing companies. This study answers the questions: 1) What methods are currently being used to estimate digital printing? 2) What is the relationship between estimating and pricing digital printing? 3) To what extent, if at all, do digital printers use fullabsorption, all-inclusive hourly rates for estimating? Three different digital printing models were identified: 1) Traditional print providers, who supplement their offset presswork with digital printing for short-run color and versioned commercial print; 2) “Low-touch” print providers, who leverage the power of the Internet to streamline business transactions with digital storefronts; 3) Marketing solutions providers, who see printing less as a discrete manufacturing process and more as a component of a complete marketing campaign. Each model approaches estimating differently. Understanding and predicting costs can be extremely beneficial. Establishing a reliable system to estimate those costs can be somewhat challenging though. Unquestionably, cost-estimating digital printing will increase in relevance in the years ahead, as margins tighten and cost knowledge becomes increasingly more critical.	adobe streamline;discrete manufacturing;printing;relevance	Malcolm G.

Humans, however, seem not to reason and make decisions naturally in this way. As authors such as Herbert A. Simon [21] have proposed, humans seem to develop a concept of bounded rationality, according to which human reasoning process and decision-making is bounded to a part of reality at a time as a focusing effect. According to some psychologists, focus of thought is one of the main purposes of emotions in humans. Using an abstract framework, in this work we propose an approach to consider emotions as an argument-selection heuristic towards the ability for an agent to reason and act in a believable manner. Influenced by emotions, the agent will produce a line of reasoning according to the evolution of its own emotional state.	argumentation framework;autonomous agent;entity framework;heuristic;humans;intelligent agent;interaction;rationality;semantics (computer science);simon;synergy	Santiago Emanuel Fulladoza Dalibón;Diego C.

In particular, in recent years, it received great attention within knowledge representation, because of its relevance for knowledge engineering and for ontology-based technologies. However, the notion of concept itself turns out to be highly disputed and problematic. In our opinion, one of the causes of this state of affairs is that the notion of concept is in some sense heterogeneous, and encompasses different cognitive phenomena. This results in a strain between conflicting requirements, such as, for example, compositionality on the one side and the need of representing prototypical information on the other. AI research in some way shows traces of this situation. In this paper we propose an analysis of this state of affairs and sketch some proposal for concept representation in formal ontologies, which takes into account suggestions coming from psychological research. Our basic assumption is that knowledge representation technologies designed considering evidences coming from experimental psychology (and, therefore, more similar to the humans way of reasoning and organizing information) can have better results in real life applications (e.g. in the field of Semantic Web).	artificial intelligence;cognition;knowledge engineering;knowledge representation and reasoning;ontology (information science);organizing (structure);real life;relevance;requirement;semantic web;tracing (software)	Marcello Frixione;Antonio Lieto	2011		10.1145/2063518.2063534	knowledge representation and reasoning;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;data mining;commonsense knowledge	AI	-27.946816132813634	-10.918360828368531	136246

Yet, biological organisms and collective insect constructions are exceptional examples of complex systems (CS) that are both architectured and self-organized. Can we understand their precise self-formation capabilities and integrate them with technological planning? Can physical systems be endowed with information, or informational systems be embedded in physics, to create autonomous morphologies and functions? To answer these questions, we have launched in 2009, and developed through a series of workshops and a collective book, a new field of research called morphogenetic engineering. It is the first initiative of its kind to rally and promote models and implementations of complex self-architecturing systems. Particular emphasis is set on the programmability and computational abilities of self-organization, properties that are often underappreciated in CS science—while, conversely, the benefits of self-organization are often underappreciated in engineering methodologies.

Like other metaphors in autonomic computing, this is inspired by biological systems, and is the analog of biological apoptosis.

2007d7b0da769977386995b764732e6c6caf5c76	rational dialog in interactive games	game theory;time complexity;non player character;computer game	"""""""I am fairly sure of this that none ever willingly errs"""". Socrates The motivation for this research is an increased call for highly interactive games in virtual realities with intelligent Non-Player Characters (NPCs). The NPCs currently implemented in computer games are rarely autonomous, although some have an emotional drive and a set of goals to chase. Their actual interactions are usually pre-set or very limited. Additionally the games themselves have pre-set narratives that result in games that the average player does not care to play numerous times, simply because the game is always the same. The question addressed in this thesis is whether an NPC will interact with a player and other NPCs in a rational and goal driven way when given a past life and a decision mechanism based on a causal network like a Bayesian network. Will the NPC adopt a strategy that will maximize its pay-offs? To answer this question I built an engine that creates NPCs that have past lives, a knowledge base and tools to find a sentence to speak in a rational dialog. The knowledge base and past lives of the NPCs are created from plots that a Dynamic Plot Generating Engine (DPGE) creates. The DPGE creates continuously new plots for murder mystery games that are logically consistent. The decision mechanisms of the NPCs are modelled using MultiAgent Influence Diagrams (MAIDs), a mathematical method for multi-agent decision-making in competitive situations. The engine created clearly indicates a basis to create NPCs that can participate in a rational dialog by calculating optimal sentences on the fly. The time complexity is linear in respect to number of sentences and more than half of the sentences are calculated in less than 1 minute. With some standard optimizations these results can be greatly improved.

The wreath product cognitive model, first described by Leyton is an abstract, although powerful, model which closely couples perception and actuation for representing shape. However, no implementation of the wreath product model exists. Our work is an attempt to combine the wreath product knowledge representation mechanism with a BDI architecture that works in a real-world setting. A prototype implementation of this combination is demonstrated on an iRobot Create differential-drive robot, with a Kinect One structural sensor, in an indoor environment. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated by its accuracy for mapping the environment and localization of the robot for navigation purposes.	algorithm;belief revision;cognitive architecture;cognitive model;context-free grammar;context-free language;deterministic pushdown automaton;irobot create;internationalization and localization;kinect;knowledge representation and reasoning;mobile robot;personal digital assistant;prototype;robotic mapping;stack (abstract data type)	Anshul Joshi;Thomas C.

This prototype performs this task by integrating several artificial intelligence technologies in an innovative way. These technologies include rich semantic representations, a natural language understanding module, and a flexible semantic matcher.

1473ebcb82a872ea76f6109819d35e01114608e9	models of complexity for dynamic decision making derived from cognitive informatics, complexity theory, and psychophysics		Dynamic Decision-Making (DDM) is interested in the study of complex decision-making involving dynamic systems and problem spaces. Through the use of human in the loop experimentation in an interactive learning environment, we endeavour to observe the impact of complexity on human performance. Our research presents some preliminary efforts in determining objective models and metrics of complexity to measure the impact of system complexity on comprehension and performance, drawing on research in applied cognitive psychology, cognitive informatics, and complexity theory. By using serious games scenarios of varying degrees of complexity, psychophysical measures have been collected and benchmarked, such as prediction and decision performances, subjective measures of confidence and assessment of problem complexity, etc., according to a number of objective measures of complexity. Additional critical factors of DDM are modeled, such as the goal distance to reach objectives, in order to establish criteria for an objective measure of difficulty, beyond problem complexity.	cognitive science;cognitive tutor;computational complexity theory;dynamical system;endeavour (supercomputer);goal programming;human reliability;informatics;performance	Sylvain Pronovost;Jean-François Gagnon;Daniel Lafond;Sébastien Tremblay	2014			psychophysics;management science;social psychology;comprehension;informatics;interactive learning;cognition;dynamic decision-making;operations research;computer science;human-in-the-loop	AI	-23.014896069352833	-16.49841615697588	137221

All the present advanced control systems have certain advantages and disadvantages compared with each other. Due to the lack of an optimal control system with desired capabilities, such a control system has been the focus of recent robotics research programs. The new approach proposed in this paper is a hybrid control system that takes the advantages of various control structure types thereby integrating them in a way that results in an overall increase in synergy. The proposed control architecture presents a new approach to the design of supervisory control system that utilizes reactive, deliberative, distributed and centralised control approaches, and uses fuzzy logic as well as modular hierarchical structure. The architecture carries out supervision, modification and execution of commands generated by the centralised command arbitration module by conducting fuzzy logic integration of activated behaviours from distributed, independent asynchronous decision making processes that takes information from the user, sensory system and task description, thus providing goal-oriented, real-time responsive and tele-operable control system architecture. The resulting control system was experimented on and it was observed that not only was the response time sufficiently short, but also it exhibited robustness, flexibility, adaptability, portability and expandability.	advanced process control;autonomous robot;centralisation;complex systems;continuous operation;control flow;control system;debugging;experiment;fuzzy logic;lookup table;modular design;operability;operational definition;optimal control;performance;real-time transcription;requirement;response time (technology);robotics;software portability;synergy;systems architecture;systems design;television	H.

Like an infant, Jean repeatedly executes schemas, gradually transferring them to new situations and extending them as necessary to accommodate new experiences. We model this process of accommodation with the Experimental State Splitting (ESS) algorithm. ESS learns elementary action schemas, which comprise controllers and maps of the expected dynamics of executing controllers in different conditions. ESS also learns compositions of action schemas called gists. We present tests of the ESS algorithm in three transfer learning experiments, in which Jean transfers learned gists to new situations in a real time strategy military simulator.	algorithm;experiment;jean;map;piaget's theory of cognitive development;simulation	Paul R.

62e7df5095f627b463bbd55e30c210acd8d57ad3	the design of the scent automated advisor	automated debugging;intelligent tutoring;diagnosing logical and conceptual errors;strategy judging;student modelling;blackboard control	ion are fundamental to the design of a SCENT-style programming advisor for any domain. At the lowest level is a student’s attempted solution to a particular task, the raw data. At the next level are traces, cross-reference listings, etc., which are derived from straightforward operations applied to the raw data. Patterns observed at this program behaviour level can indicate important features of the student’s solution to the task at hand. The next level of abstraction, therefore, consists of a number of observers, each of which is responsible for recognizing a particular pattern. Without further interpretation, these observations would be of limited value. It is the responsibility of strategy judges and diagnosticians at the next level to bring knowledge of various solution strategies, and possible ways they can go wrong, to the interpretation of these observations. There may be many possible interpretations, and tusk experts at the next level of abstraction must arbitrate among the various possibilities and choose the interpretation most appropriate to the particular task at hand. At the level of the task expert an interpretation of the student’s solution exists, but this interpretation must be related to the student’s current goals and level of understanding before appropriate advice can be dispensed. This is the responsibility of entities at the highest level of abstraction, student knowledge. Moving up through these levels, interpretations become more task-specific and student-specific. These restrictions are achieved by adding knowledge of the task and student at each level, which, while narrowing the scope at each level, also deepens the interpretation. While the conceptual levels have been described in a bottom-up fashion, no inferences should be made about information or control flows through the levels. An aggregation of events at a lower level can trigger the activation of a higher-level entity to interpret the events. Likewise, a higher-level entity may require lower-level information to cany out its goals. This suggests that control flow between entities at various levels should be flexible: both top-down and bottom-up invocation strategies should be available; information should be available to entities at any level; it should be possible for many entities to actively consider various requests simultaneously. A control structure is needed which accommodates any of these possibilities, as well as a communication structure that permits entities at various levels to exchange information. This suggests the need for a central information exchange which allows control and data to flow freely. The blackboard control scheme, first proposed for the Hearsay speech-understanding systems (Erman et al. 1980), provides just such a capability. How the blackboard methodology is adapted for use in SCENT is outlined in subsequent sections (see Sect. 3.2.4 in particular). Initial work on the prototype system has concentrated on providing task experts for several examples in the kinship 78 COMPUT. WTELL. VOL. 2, 1986 domain. These task experts have been implemented in LISP and illustrate the range of intelligent debugging capabilities possible in the tasks they address. While they are by no means complete debugging assistants, they have helped to clarify the architecture and to suggest ways that new and (or) more sophisticated experts could be constructed. Strategy judges, diagnosticians, observers, and various traces, cross-reference lists, etc. for these task experts have also been devised and have provided useful confirmation of the viability of the SCENT approach. The student knowledge and blackboard components are currently quite primitive, although their role in the system has become much clearer through the initial experiments. SCENT is currently only a test-bed for these ideas. Further experiments will be needed to fully elaborate and understand the architecture, especially to prove that it can be easily generalized to other domains besides the kinship domain. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether general knowledge about program debugging can be distilled out of the problem-specific examples worked out so far. If not, then building a SCENT-style tutor will require an immense coding effort as the debugging knowledge for every problem will have to be built from scratch. Even in the current examples, however, certain regularities can be discemed which could form the basis for shared knowledge to be used across a variety of problems, thus avoiding this potential difficulty. An accounting of the current topics being investigated in the context of the SCENT project will conclude this paper (Sect. 5) . First, however, other systems of particular relevance to SCENT will bediscussed (Sect. 2). Then, SCENT will be detailed (Sect. 3) and an integrated example of SCENT “in action” will be presented (Sect. 4). 2. Background to SCENT There has been some work recently in artificial intelligence trying to build knowledge-based automated programming advisors. Hartley and Sleeman (1973) delineate the essential components of such a knowledge-based approach: an expert to analyze a student’s solution; a student model to represent the system’s knowledge of the student; a tutor, containing knowledge of how, when, and what to teach; a communicator to interface with the student (most desirably in natural language); and a driver to control the other components. A number of systems incorporate some or all of these components, as they experiment with the many complexities of knowledge-based program tutoring. For example BIP (Westcourt et al. 19771, a system to teach fundamental programming skills using BASIC, emphasizes student modelling and tutoring. The SPADE system of Miller (1978) tries to tutor a student on how to plan solutions to LOGO programming problems. LAURA (Adam and Laurent 1980) is able to spot bugs in FORTRAN programs by comparing an ideal solution to the user’s solution. The Programmer’s Apprentice (Rich and Shrobe 1978) is designed to help expert LISP programmers debug both their solution strategies and their code. PHENARETE (Wertz 1982) helps debug code at three levels: surface (lexical and syntactic), deep (semantic and teleological), and conceptual. The LISP tutor (Anderson and Reiser 1985) teaches a student LISP by having himher solve problems of ever-increasing complexity, all the while looking over hidher shoulder, interrupting as erroneous LISP code is entered. The MENO-iI system (Soloway ef al. 1981~) experiments with how to teach concepts and also how to recognize student misconceptions in the framework of a PASCAL tutor. Following up on the particular problem of how to recognize the solution methods (both valid and invalid) the student is employing in writing his/her program, the PROUST system (Soloway and Johnson 1985aJ) builds on the MEN0 work. Systems of most relevance to SCENT are LAURA, PHENARETE, the LISP tutor, and PROUST. LAURA (Adam and Laurent 1980) debugs simple FORTRAN programs implementing several basic computer science algorithms. An ideal FORTRAN version of each such algorithm is kept and LAURA compares this with a student’s version. It does this by concocting a graph from both the student’s code and the ideal version which abstracts out some of the purely notational aspects of the program. The graphs are then compared-certain differences are significant, others are not. To tell one from the other, heuristic program transformations are used which can map one graph onto the other to derive deep similarities between ostensibly different surface structures, Unlike SCENT, LAURA is completely domain-independent and thus cannot recognize domain-dependent variations in a student’s solution. Neither does it attempt to recognize different strategies and subtleties of student solutions. Finally, if LAURA were to be expanded into a general-purpose debugging assistant there would seem to be combinatorial problems in applying transformations without more knowledge of the domain and the problem being solved. PHENARETE (Wertz 1982) is a system which attempts to debug and correct novice LISP programs. Wertz identifies three levels of errors: surface errors (lexical and syntactic errors), deep errors (errors in logic), and conceptual errors (difficulties in the method of solution). Only surface errors and deep errors can be dealt with by PHENARETE. Of most interest are the deep errors, detected by “meta-evaluating” the user’s program after the surface errors have been corrected. The metaevaluation uses a number of frame-based semantic specialists and pragmatic programming rules to locate the errors and a repair module to correct them. PHENARETE does not handle conceptual errors since it does not know the intended goal of the function being debugged. Its methodologies would also appear to work best for simple functions and would be difficult to extend to more complicated multifunction problem solutions. The LISP tutor (Anderson and Reiser 1985) is a system which not only detects and corrects LISP bugs, but also teaches LISP to novice programmers through a set of 18 lesson plans. The LISP tutor is based on empirical studies of how novices learn LISP (Anderson et (11. 1984) and is currently being marketed as a commercial product. The system has three components: a domain expert, a bug catalogue, and a tutor. The domain expert has 325 valid production rules which allows the LISP tutor to solve various problems. The 475 production rules in the bug catalogue can be used to recognize deviations from correct usages of LISP. The tutor component of the system presents the student with a variety of programming exercises to illustrate any given lesson and then “watches” as the student enters a solution to a given exercise. The solution is compared with the ideal solution generated by the domain expert, and deviations are recognized by rules in the bug catalogue.

This thesis describes a small sub element of the CAMAL architecture that has been implemented on a mobile robot. The first area of investigation within this research relates to the anchoring problem. Can the robotic agent generate symbols based on responses within its perceptual systems and can it reason about its environment based on those symbols? Given that the agent can identify changes within its environment, can it then adapt its behaviour and alter its goals to mirror the change in its environment? The second area of interest involves agent learning. The agent has a domain model that details its goals, the actions it can perform and some of the possible environmental states it may encounter. The agent is not provided with the belief-goal-action combinations in order to achieve its goals. The agent is also unaware of the effect its actions have upon its environment. Can the agent experiment with its behaviour to generate its own belief-goal-action combinations that allow it to achieve its goals? A second related problem involves the case where the beliefgoal-action combination is pre-programmed. This is when the agent is provided with several different methods with which to achieve a specific goal. Can the agent learn which combination is the best? This thesis will describe the sub-element of the CAMAL architecture that was developed for a robot (robo-CAMAL). It will also demonstrate how robo-CAMAL solves the anchoring problem, and learns how to act and adapt in its environment.

899dd2e942f98274838e1177766413a800b35113	towards a jason infrastructure for soccer playing agents.		AgentSpeak and its practical interpreter Jason represent an excellent framework for implementing complex, reasoning agents. This paper discusses an ongoing research dedicated to extending Jason with the support for soccer playing agents. The end goal is to design an efficient infrastructure, capable of deploying and running BDI agents in the RoboCup soccer simulation league. 1 Intelligent agents playing soccer RoboCup is an annual, internationally-recognized competition of football/soccer playing robots [5]. By providing a formidable challenge in a fun environment, its main goal is to support and further motivate the development of various artificial intelligence techniques. Many concepts of the multi-agent technology, including autonomy, pro-active behaviour, coordination and cooperation, fit naturally into requirements of the RoboCup competition. These concepts are directly supported by the complex, Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI ) agent architecture [6]. The BDI architecture has a strong mathematical basis and is widely supported by a number of agent development frameworks [2]. Our previous work on deploying BDI agents in RoboCup simulations [4] was based on the agent-oriented programming language AgentSpeak and its accompanying interpreter Jason [1]. The main reasons Jason was selected as for this task include its direct support for BDI , and a high level of customizability. By analyzing the inner workings of Jason and the simulator, it was concluded that both systems support agents that operate in sense-think-act cycles. This fact simplifies the integration process significantly. To deploy Jason agents, it ? This work was partially supported by Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia, through project no. OI174023: ”Intelligent techniques and their integration into wide-spectrum decision support” Towards a Jason Infrastructure for Soccer Playing Agents 295 is sufficient to extend and modify the following set of the interpreter’s subcomponents: – Simulated environment : a model of the game that enables the agents to sense their surroundings, and act accordingly. The environment was extended with custom parser and generator components which, respectively, extract agent’s belief literals from the simulator’s set of percepts, and transform agent actions into concrete effectors; – Execution control : handles Jason reasoning cycles. Development of a custom execution control was necessary for several reasons, including the support for key-framed motions. Key-framed motions often span across multiple Jason reasoning cycles. The execution control assures that the appropriate sets of commands are sent to the simulator as the motion progresses; – Agent architecture: a link between the simulated environment and the remaining components. Our custom implementation of these components was evaluated using a concrete implementation of a soccer playing agent [4]. The results have shown that Jason is perfectly capable of satisfying strict time constraints imposed by the official RoboCup simulator. However, further improvements and extensions are needed in order to implement and deploy agents that exhibit more complex behaviour. Our ongoing work is dedicated to designing and re-implementing the remaining parts of the Jason infrastructure [1]. This step is necessary in order to fully integrate Jason into the RoboCup simulator, allowing Jason agents to actually compete against other teams, and to do so by relying on extensively researched and well-understood concepts and methodologies of the multi-agent technology. In the long run, the plan is to further extend the infrastructure with MOISE+, an advanced Jason-compatible framework for organizational modelling that has already been tested in virtual soccer simulations [3].	adjustment handle;agent architecture;agent-oriented programming;agentspeak;artificial intelligence;autonomy;belief–desire–intention software model;bespoke;decision support system;distributed multi-agent reasoning system;high-level programming language;jason;multi-agent system;requirement;robot;simulation;virtual reality	Dejan Mitrovic;Mirjana Ivanovic;Hans-Dieter Burkhard	2013			embedded system	AI	-26.30212583834691	-21.696407280143486	138230

Little work, however, has been done on swarms of networked humans. This paper introduces UNU, an online platform that enables networked users to assemble in real-time swarms and tackle problems as an Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI). Modeled after biological swarms, UNU enables large groups of networked users to work together in real-time synchrony, forging a unified dynamic system that can quickly answer questions and make decisions. Early testing suggests that human swarming has significant potential for harnessing the Collective Intelligence (CI) of online groups, often exceeding the natural abilities of individual participants.	autonomous robot;collective intelligence;dynamical system;real-time clock;real-time locating system;swarm intelligence;swarm robotics	Louis Rosenberg	2016			artificial intelligence;artificial intelligence, situated approach;machine learning;swarm intelligence;collective intelligence;artificial intelligence system;computer science;swarm robotics;marketing and artificial intelligence;human-in-the-loop;artificial psychology	AI	-24.921706107672062	-19.758078718900922	138282
6d5884782ed492891015d0eb7dc729729abb472c	toward explainable multi-objective probabilistic planning		Use of multi-objective probabilistic planning to synthesize behavior of CPSs can play an important role in engineering systems that must self-optimize for multiple quality objectives and operate under uncertainty. However, the reasoning behind automated planning is opaque to end-users. They may not understand why a particular behavior is generated, and therefore not be able to calibrate their confidence in the systems working properly. To address this problem, we propose a method to automatically generate verbal explanation of multi-objective probabilistic planning, that explains why a particular behavior is generated on the basis of the optimization objectives. Our explanation method involves describing objective values of a generated behavior and explaining any tradeoff made to reconcile competing objectives. We contribute: (i) an explainable planning representation that facilitates explanation generation, and (ii) an algorithm for generating contrastive justification as explanation for why a generated behavior is best with respect to the planning objectives. We demonstrate our approach on a mobile robot case study.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;design rationale;list of system quality attributes;mit engineering systems division;mathematical optimization;mobile robot	Roykrong Sukkerd;Reid G.

6cd9eeb07d2fef3a81b6db6d724388d9d5018a48	supporting interaction in the robocare intelligent assistive environment	computer science	The ROBOCARE project is aimed at creating an instance of integrated environment with software and robotic agents to actively assist an elderly person at home. In particular the project has synthesized a proactive environment for continuous daily activity monitoring in which an autonomous robot acts as a main interactor with the person. This paper accounts for the combination of features that create interactive capabilities for personalized and mixed-initiative interaction with the assisted person. A project with an intelligent assistant The use of intelligent technology for supporting elderly people at home has been addressed in various research projects in the last years (Pollack et al. 2003; Pineau et al. 2003; Haigh et al. 2003; Pollack 2005). Increasing attention is also given to the synthesis of Cognitive Systems to produce aids that enhance human cognition capabilities. As an example, the project CALO (Myers 2006; Myers & Yorke-Smith 2005) has as its primary goal the development of cognitive systems able to reason, learn from experience, be told what to do, explain what they are doing, reflect on their experience, and respond robustly to contingencies. Other projects somehow connected to different aspects of this research topic are CMRADAR (Modi et al. 2004), whose aim is to develop an intelligent scheduler assistant, and CAMEO (Rybski et al. 2004) whose main objective is to build a physical awareness system to be used by an agent-based electronic assistant. All these projects have required the orchestration of different intelligent software technologies and have highlighted a number of important issues that need to be addressed: the problem of coordinating the distributed components as well as the problem of providing intelligent interaction with the user, are undoubtedly among the most critical. The ROBOCARE project shares several of the challenges with the above mentioned projects. Indeed ROBOCARE’s main motivations can be summarized as follows: “The objective of this project is to build a distributed multi-agent system which provides assistance services Copyright c © 2007, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

The agents are a highly heterogeneous collection of fixed and mobile robotic, sensory and problem solving components. The project is centered on obtaining a virtual community of human and artificial agents who cooperate in the continuous management of an enclosed environment.” The project has involved research groups with different background with the goal of investigating how state of the art AI techniques could be combined to create new homeservice integration for elderly people (Cesta et al. 2003; Cesta & Pecora 2006; Bahadori et al. 2004). As a target domain we have chosen a prototypical home environment where the presence of an intelligent assistant would be of concrete help in the daily life of a cognitively impaired user through the integrated performance of advanced distributed components. The most important capability of an intelligent assistant is the continuous maintenance of a high level of situation awareness. This objective is obtained through the interaction of a number of intelligent physical and/or software agents: among others, vision-based sensors, which ensure the acquisition of continuously updated data from the environment; a schedule management software agent, which analyzes the status of every activity being performed within the monitored space; a mobile robotic platform able to behave robustly and continuously in the environment. The ultimate goal of the overall system is to provide cognitive support both on-demand, by guaranteeing a real-time question&answer service situated to the contextual knowledge of an assisted person, and proactively, by providing an event-driven support again grounded on what is going on in a daily living environment. Our efforts to integrate an autonomous robot in the intelligent environment have immediately made clear that the latter might naturally play the role of attention focalizer and main interactor with the user. Therefore we have concentrated most of the interaction capabilities in the robot, and, additionally, have chosen verbal communication as the main interaction modality. This paper specifically concerns the aspects related to the system’s context-awareness as well as interaction capabilities. In particular we describe how the constraintbased scheduling technology is used to maintain a knowledge repository aimed at supporting on-demand specific in(a) The “silent observer” (b) The current robotic assistant (c) The “proactive interactor” Figure 1: Evolving ROBOCARE demonstrators. teractions as well as enabling autonomous system initiative. The chosen domain and the addressed problem After having studied features of different physical environments for elderly people, the home environment has been selected to develop the fielded integrated demonstrator. This choice is supported not only by the aim of improving home technology personalization, but also by recent studies, e.g., (Giuliani, Scopelliti, & Fornara 2005), that underscore the relevance of the attachment of elderly people to their home and the beneficial effects of increasing their independence at home. Figure 1(a) shows our first step toward the creation of an effective combined support service. We integrated sensors that monitor users’ activities with a schedule management environment called T-REX, (Tool for schedule Representation and EXecution (Pecora et al. 2006)), through which it is possible to represent of a set of activities and their quantitative temporal connections (i.e., a schedule of activities that the user is expected to carry out). The broad idea is to allow the specification and then the execution monitoring of a set of activities that the person usually performs or needs to perform due to prescription (on suggestion from his personal doctor for example). T-REX integrates a constraint-based scheduler (Cesta et al. 2001) with additional features for knowledge engineering, in particular for problem modeling. Particular attention has been given to the definition of “user-oriented terminologies” in order to easily synthesize both the basic elements of a target domain as well as different problem inSee (Cesta & Pecora 2006) for a broad presentation of the diversified project initiatives. In particular we used stereo cameras, endowed with specific software for people locatization and tracking (Bahadori et al. 2005). stances in the particular domain (i.e., in the form of activities and constraints among activities). For example, in the ROBOCARE context, T-REX allows the definition of “home domain activities” like breakfast, lunch, go-for-walk, and also temporal/causal links among activities like meal-boundmedication to express rules like “aspirin cannot be taken before eating”. Through this high level language an external user (a doctor, a relative of the assisted person, etc.) may define a network of activities, a schedule, that the observed person is supposed to carry out in the home environment during the day. Such a schedule is dispatched for execution and monitored using the underlying schedule execution technology. Information coming from the sensors is used for maintaining an updated representation of what is really happening in the environment. Even if human activity recognition is outside the scope of the project, it is worth highlighting how the sequence of observations from the artificial vision sensors allows to follow the evolution of the activities of the observed person (e.g., if and when she took a pill, when she had lunch, etc.). Based on the synthesis of these observations, the system is able to generate a report for the external users that underscores when the person’s activities have been performed within “reasonable” temporal boundaries or when important anomalies or even violations on their execution have been detected (Cesta et al. 2005; Bahadori et al. 2004). In this light the demonstrator in Figure 1(a), is a basic example of home Activity Monitor grounded on scheduling technology. Notice that, on its own, the domestic activity monitor acts as a “silent observer” and does not take initiative with respect to the elder person in any way. In this paper, we show how its indications can be There is plenty of recent research on activity recognition with sensors, e.g., (Pentney et al. 2006), that could potentially impact this class of applications.

The adaptation of an ambient system to the specific needs of its users is a challenging task. Because human-system interaction has to be as natural as possible, we propose an approach based on Learning from Demonstration (LfD). LfD is an interesting approach to generalize what has been observed during the demonstration to similar situations. However, using LfD in ambient systems needs adaptivity of the learning technique. We present ALEX, a multi-agent system able to dynamically learn and reuse contexts from demonstrations performed by a tutor. The results of the experiments performed on both a real and a virtual robot show interesting properties of our technology for ambient applications.

The proposed BDI agent framework allows modeling of human behavior with a high degree of fidelity. The realistic attributes that govern the BDI characteristics of the agent are reverse-engineered by conducting human-in-the-loop experiments in the VR-based Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE). To enhance generality and interoperability of the proposed crowd simulation modeling scheme, input data models have been developed to define environment attributes (e.g., maps, demographics, evacuation management parameters). The validity of the proposed data models are tested with two different evacuation scenarios. Finally, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effect of various crowd evacuation management parameters on the key performance indicators in the evacuation scenario such as crowd evacuation rate and densities. The results reveal that constructed simulation can be used as an effective emergency management tool. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

First, we explore different types of ANN simulated in MATLAB to understand their operation in order to choose the one that fits to our virtual environment. The environment was created with the UDK game engine and it consists of a character that moves across a working environment to identify warning signals. Later we implemented the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) ANN in this environment. MLP was selected according to data obtained in several tests. This implementation was done by integrating the ANN in the state machines in the source code of the game engine to perform several operations within a controlled work environment.

In particular, we formalize an agent who attributes mental attitudes such as goals and desires to the normative system which creates and enforces its obligations. The wishes (goals) of the normative system are the commands (obligations) of the agent. Since the agent is able to reason about the normative system’s behavior, our model accounts for many ways in which an agent can violate a norm believing that it will not be sanctioned. We thus propose a cognitive theory of normative reasoning which can be applied in theories requiring dynamic trust to understand when it is necessary to revise it.	cognitive science;game theory;recursion;trust (emotion)	Jaime G.

In developing Teambotica, we found that many of the simplifying assumptions that are often taken in both multiagent systems and behavior-based robotics had to be discarded. Central to our approach is a multilevel agent architecture which is adaptive along a number of dimensions and which is based on a vertically integrated design that spans a wide range of operations, from team-level reasoning to low-level control. The design addresses a number of pertinent issues: the proper mix of deliberation and action, flexible networking support including planning for communications, adaptive task level control, team-based monitoring, and an open systems modularity that takes form-factor considerations seriously. We also describe simulation tools for development and discuss several robotic teams that we have demonstrated.	agent architecture;agent-based model;behavior-based robotics;form factor (design);high- and low-level;multi-agent system;relevance;robot;simulation	Régis Vincent;Pauline M.

3f4fd6cf2002dd90edd320561c9acbc22fc8e986	off-line synthesis of evolutionarily stable normative systems	norms;normative systems;norm synthesis;evolutionary algorithm	Within the area of multi-agent systems, normative systems are a widely used framework for the coordination of interdependent activities. A crucial problem associated with normative systems is that of synthesising norms that will effectively accomplish a coordination task and that the agents will comply with. Many works in the literature focus on the on-line synthesis of a single, evolutionarily stable norm (convention) whose compliance forms a rational choice for the agents and that effectively coordinates them in one particular coordination situation that needs to be identified and modelled as a game in advance. In this work, we introduce a framework for the automatic off-line synthesis of evolutionarily stable normative systems that coordinate the agents in multiple interdependent coordination situations that cannot be easily identified in advance nor resolved separately. Our framework roots in evolutionary game theory. It considers multi-agent systems in which the potential conflict situations can be automatically enumerated by employing MAS simulations along with basic domain information. Our framework simulates an evolutionary process whereby successful norms prosper and spread within the agent population, while unsuccessful norms are discarded. The outputs of such a natural selection process are sets of codependent norms that, together, effectively coordinate the agents in multiple interdependent situations and are evolutionarily stable. We empirically show the effectiveness of our approach through empirical evaluation in a simulated traffic domain.	game theory;interdependence;multi-agent system;natural selection;numerous;online and offline;plant roots;simulation;t-norm	Javier Morales;Michael Wooldridge;Juan A.

92b0bfbeef6c2344499d24f81ffc26e3b6264b83	analyse temporelle de la dynamique de communautés végétales à l'aide de modèles individus-centrés. (temporal analysis of plant community dynamics using individual-based models)		iv ___________________________________________________________________________ Abstract Plant communities are complex systems in which multiple species differing by their functional attributes interact with their environment and with each other. Because of the number and the diversity of these interactions the mechanisms that drive the dynamics of theses communities are still poorly understood. Modelling approaches enable to link in a mechanistic fashion the process driving individual plant or population dynamics to the resulting community dynamics. This PhD thesis aims at developing such approaches and to use them to investigate the mechanisms underlying community dynamics. We therefore developed two modelling approaches. The first one is based on a stochastic modelling framework allowing to link the population dynamics to the community dynamics whilst taking account of intraand interspecific interactions as well as environmental and demographic variations. This approach is easily applicable to real systems and enables to describe the properties of plant population through a small number of demographic parameters. However our work suggests that there is no simple relationship between these parameters and plant functional traits, while they are known to drive their response to extrinsic factors. The second approach has been developed to overcome this limitation and rely on the individual-based model Nemossos that explicitly describes the link between plant functioning and community dynamics. In order to ensure that Nemossos has a large application potential, a strong emphasis has been placed on the tradeoff between realism and parametrization cost. Nemossos has then been successfully parameterized from trait values found in the literature, its realism has been demonstrated and it has been used to investigate the importance of temporal environmental variability for the coexistence of functionally differing species. The complementarity of the two approaches allows us to explore various fundamental questions of community ecology including the impact of competitive interactions on community dynamics, the effect of environmental filtering on their functional composition, or the mechanisms favoring the coexistence of plant species. In this work, the two approaches have been used separately but their coupling might offer interesting perspectives such as the investigation of the relationships between plant functioning and population dynamics. Moreover each of the approaches might be used to run various simulation experiments likely to improve our understanding of mechanisms underlying community dynamics.	agent-based model;coexist (image);complementarity theory;complex systems;ecology;experiment;heart rate variability;interaction;linear algebra;population dynamics;simulation;stochastic modelling (insurance);while	Théophile Lohier	2016				AI	-19.430975426352674	-16.71898958927114	140010

We lay out a general computational framework of appraisal and coping as a central organizing principle for such systems. We then discuss a detailed domain-independent model based on this framework, illustrating how it has been applied to the problem of generating behavior for a significant social training application. The model is useful not only for deriving emotional state, but also for informing a number of the behaviors that must be modeled by virtual humans such as facial expressions, dialogue management, planning, reacting, and social understanding. Thus, the work is of potential interest to models of strategic decision-making, action selection, facial animation, and social intelligence.	action selection;artificial intelligence;automated planning and scheduling;autonomous robot;cognition;computation;dialog system;organizing (structure);theory	Jonathan Gratch;Stacy Marsella	2004	Cognitive Systems Research	10.1016/j.cogsys.2004.02.002	psychology;action selection;computer science;artificial intelligence;autonomous agent;social intelligence;communication;human behavior;social psychology;facial expression	AI	-23.504008159815925	-15.193256083338724	140050
90d0c8d3349f122b7cf69bdd58edaa6a7720ea5c	an introduction to aspect-oriented music representation	area of interest;aspect oriented programming;aspect oriented	The composition of music in many idioms involves the exploitation of recurrent, recombinant musical fragments. Any given fragment may, as a consequence, appear in arbitrarily many structures, in its original or transformed state. Such a fragment is said to crosscut the musical structure, in the sense that the modification of such a fragment implies that revisions should be made to related structures. Aspect-Oriented Music Representation (AOMR), is an approach to music representation that draws inspiration from Aspect-Oriented Programming techniques in computer software. In overview, AOMR enables fragments of music to be encapsulated and associated with user-defined areas of compositional interest. New fragments may be generated by specifying transformational and combinatorial relationships with other fragments, by reference to their area of interest. In this way, AOMR separates structure from content, and enables crosscutting fragments to be stated once, with any subsequent revisions to a fragment being automatically propagated to all related fragments. In order to remain recombinant, each fragment must be independent of its ultimate temporal location. AOMR provides an approach to the arrangement of fragments within a temporal framework, and enables the content of fragments to be conditionally modified, based on factors such as location, context and provenance.	aspect-oriented software development	Patrick Hill;Simon D Holland;Robin C.

Abstract This paper reports on a study designed to investigate how people understand superhuman concepts that are of interest to cognitive scientists of religion. Similar to findings of previous studies of surprising social conceptual combinations, we found that people generated numerous emergent properties for such concepts. These results support the knowledge-based models of conceptual combination. Supernatural Agents u0026 Religion Religion: the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods. (Oxford-Dictionaries, 2010) Keywords: Semantic memory, folk psychology, conceptual development. Introduction Since the early days of cognitive science, study of concepts has formed the core of the discipline because concepts are thought to be “the building blocks of thought” (Franks, 2003) and “the basis of word meaning” (Murphy, 1988). Understanding creation of complex concepts by combining simpler concepts is crucial to the success of this enterprise (Kunda, Miller, u0026 Claire, 1990; Murphy, 1988; Osherson u0026 Smith, 1981). Understanding how concepts with contradictory properties are combined has also been of recent interest to cognitive scientists of religion investigating the spread of counterintuitive religious concepts (Boyer, 1994, 2001; Franks, 2003). Boyer (1994; 2001) argued that most widespread religious concepts around the world are minimally counterintuitive (or MCI for short) and that this is because minimally counterintuitive concepts are more memorable than intuitive and maximally counterintuitive concepts. MCI concepts such as “a listening tree” are minimally counterintuitive because they violate a small number of intuitive expectations associated with the basic category (e.g., tree in this case) that along with a counterintuitive property (e.g., listening in this example) constitutes such concepts. Franks (2001) argued that MCI concepts are best considered as combinations of concepts with contradictory properties. He further argued that at least “some religious representations may involve relation mapping combinations” (Page 50). Unlike property mapping combinations where a property of the constituent concepts is simply transferred to the combined concept, in relational mapping a meaning relation that is not represented in either of the constituent concepts indicates how they are related to make the combined concept (Page 46). The relationship establishment processes, especially in the context of conflicting properties (Heit, 1998), are thought to use relevant background knowledge to create a coherent conceptual combination. However, as an extensive review of the literature by (Ran u0026 Duimering, 2009) recently noted, the precise nature of how relevant Boyer was not the first scholar of religion to observe the crucial role played by supernatural concepts in general, and superhuman concepts in particular, in religious cognition of people around the world. Scholars of religion from a variety of traditions have argued that belief in superhuman entities is a hallmark of religion (Giddens, 1989; Horton, 1960; Lawson u0026 McCauley, 1990; Spiro, 1966; Tylor, 1871; Wallace, 1966). One of the oldest definitions of religion comes from Tyler (1871) who defined it as “the belief in spiritual beings.” Preferring the term “supernatural beings” over “spiritual beings”, Wallace (1966) defined religion as “behavior that can be classified as belief and ritual concerned with supernatural beings, powers and forces” (Page 5). Lawson and McCauley (1990) define a religious system as a “symbolic-cultural system of ritual acts accompanied by an extensive and largely shared conceptual scheme that includes culturally postulated superhuman agents” (Page 5). Lawson and McCauley have joined a growing group of scholars of religion advocating a new cognitive science of religion to understand how human minds represent and acquire superhuman agent conceptual schemas (Guthrie, 1993; Whitehouse, 2004). These cognitive scientists of religion argue that an understanding of psychology of language comprehension and learning is needed to understand why some ideas spread widely to become cultural successes while others quickly perish. Memorability advantages have been a particular focus of this work. A number of studies have found that minimally counterintuitive (MCI) concepts are remembered better than intuitive and maximally counterintuitive concepts (Atran, 2004; J. Barrett u0026 Nyhof, 2001; Boyer u0026 Ramble, 2001; Upal, 2005). Attempts to account for these findings have differed on whether contextual factors play a crucial role in making MCI ideas memorable, and whether memory for MCI concepts is a distinct phenomenon or whether it is related to memory for schema-violating/distinctive concepts (J. L. Barrett, 2008; Russell, 2013; Upal, 2009).

0477891b7427f3de46f8d01f31543befb32f9d98	simulation of electromagnetic waves propagation in free space using netlogo multi-agent approach		In this paper, we propose a Netlogo multi-agent formulation for modeling electromagnetic waves propagation in free space using Maxwell's equations. This modeling approach contrasts with traditional ones, which are typically built up from sets of interrelated differential equations. The multi-agent systems paradigm choice is due to its effectiveness for modeling and simulating the complex systems which are characterized by a wide variety of interactions between entities which compose it. The based agent simulation provides a means to apprehend dynamic characteristics and to represent their functionings, which facilitates their study. The obtained results describing the spatial variation of electric field are in good agreement with the theoretical ones.	complex systems;entity;interaction;maxwell (microarchitecture);multi-agent system;netlogo;programming paradigm;simulation;software propagation	Hamid Bezzout;Sara Hsaini;Salma Azzouzi;Hanan El Faylali	2017		10.1145/3090354.3090471	theoretical computer science;complex system;electromagnetic radiation;netlogo;computer science;maxwell's equations;differential equation;spatial variability;electric field	AI	-19.609525049378863	-15.863987058275457	140655
76c241743fadb07a201f6669eaabc8cbc086d285	general problem solving with category theory		This paper proposes a formal cognitive framework for problem solving based on category theory. We introduce cognitive categories, which are categories with exactly one morphism between any two objects. Objects in these categories are interpreted as states and morphisms as transformations between states. Moreover, cognitive problems are reduced to the specification of two objects in a cognitive category: an outset (i.e. the current state of the system) and a goal (i.e. the desired state). Cognitive systems transform the target system by means of generators and evaluators. Generators realize cognitive operations over a system by grouping morphisms, whilst evaluators group objects as a way to generalize outsets and goals to partially defined states. Meta-cognition emerges when the whole cognitive system is self-referenced as sub-states in the cognitive category, whilst learning must always be considered as a meta-cognitive process to maintain consistency. Several examples grounded in basic AI methods are provided as well.	artificial intelligence;category theory;cognition;cognitive architecture;mental operations;problem solving;state (computer science);while	Francisco J.

To do this we will first describe the motivation for doing so and then the strategy for achieving it. Along the way, it will become clear that the machines we design and build are not robots in any traditional sense. They are not machines designed to perform a set of goal-oriented tasks, or work, but rather to express modes of survivalist behavior: the survival of a mobile autonomous machine in an a priori unknown and possibly hostile environment. We use no notion of conventional """"intelligence"""" in our designs, although we suspect some strange form of that may come later. Our topic is survival-oriented machines, and it turns out that intelligence in any sophisticated form is unnecessary for this concept. For such machines, if life is provisionally defined as that which moves for its own purposes, then we are dealing with living machines and how to evolve them.

The agent serves as an additional team member and enables rapid planning and re-planning of multiple vehicles. For this purpose, the agent adapts its extent of assistance based on the necessity of the given situation. The concept was implemented for the use case of manned-unmanned teaming in future military helicopter missions. Thereby, the mixed-initiative agent was implemented with three different levels of automation. The article focuses on the experimental evaluation with German military helicopter pilots. Results show the advantages of the scalable mixed-initiative concept especially in time critical and high workload situations.

They have changed the way we understand the world, which means we can have a different perspective when computing situation awareness. In this paper, we give a detailed explanation on how social media data affect situation awareness and our focus is set on the military environment. We discuss why subject matter expert based human computation is necessary and essential for this procedure and how to involve it in the situation awareness architecture. The goal of our paper is to give readers some suggestions on how to use social media and human processing power within the military situational awareness domain.	aggregate data;experience;experiment;fuzzy logic;human-based computation;need to know;requirement;social media;subject matter expert turing test;subject-matter expert	Sheng Miao;Ziying Tang	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2017.8015709	subject-matter expert;fuzzy logic;architecture;human computation;computer science;knowledge management;situation awareness;social media	DB	-33.124995853583215	-11.58335434577508	141151
1e0de309074a4662e0373fedbfc538467d1ee6da	collective trust and normative agents		In this paper we analyze the notion of collective trust within a multi-modal setting. We argue that collective trust is a scalable concept and therefore definable in qualitatively distinct levels or strengths. We show possible connections between different forms of group trust and the emergence of obligations within groups of agents. In particular, the notion of collective trust appears to be strong enough to entail forms of delegation that may have a deontic connotation: the trust a group puts in an agent’s performance of an action yields to the result that it becomes obligatory in the interest of the group that the agent performs this action.	emergence;modal logic;scalability	Clara Smith;Antonino Rotolo	2008	Logic Journal of the IGPL	10.1093/jigpal/jzp076	public relations;political science;communication;social psychology	ECom	-21.459722522130374	-11.999550645536475	141222

The received answer is that computation is a computer at work, and a computer at work is that which can be modelled as a Turing machine at work. Unfortunately, as John Searle has recently argued, and as others have agreed, the received answer appears to imply that AI and Cog Sci are a royal waste of time. The argument here is alarmingly simple: AI and Cog Sci (of the “Strong” sort, anyway) are committed to the view that cognition is computation (or brains are computers); butall processes are computations (orall physical things are computers); so AI and Cog Sci are positively silly. I refute this argument herein, in part by defining the locutions ‘x is a computer’ and ‘c is a computation’ in a way that blocks Searle's argument but exploits the hard-to-deny link between What's Computation? and the theory of computation. However, I also provide, at the end of this essay, an argument which, it seems to me, implies not that AI and Cog Sci are silly, but that they're based on a form of computation that is well “beneath” human persons.	cog (project);cognition;cognitive science;computer;theory of computation;turing machine	Selmer Bringsjord	1994	Minds and Machines	10.1007/BF00974171	psychology;epistemology;computer science;turing machine;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;algorithm;cognitive science	AI	-28.537210854088038	-14.57396002155465	141292

Within such a slant, the machine (robot) shrewdness is constructed on the basis of a multilevel cognitive concept attempting to handle complex artificial behaviors. The intended complex behavior is the autonomous discovering of objects by robot exploring an unknown environment: in other words, proffering the robot autonomy and awareness in and about unknown backdrop.	a* search algorithm;angela mclean (biologist);artificial consciousness;conference on information and knowledge management;emoticon;humanoid robot;like button;machine learning;netbios over tcp/ip;openembedded;query expansion;search engine optimization;sed;shebang (unix);tun (product standard);teller assist unit	Kurosh Madani;Dominik Maximilián Ramík;Christophe Sabourin	2000	Applied Comp.

It is conceived as a collective activity of a group of interacting agents, in which each component contributes with its own local beliefs. The integration of the different opinions is performed not by an external supervisor, but by the entire group through an election mechanism. Each agent exchanges information with the other components and uses a local belief revision mechanism to maintain its cognitive state consistent. We propose a model for local belief revision/integration based on what we called: “Principle of Recoverability.” Computationally, our way to belief revision consists of three steps acting on the symbolic part of the information, so as to deal with consistency and derivation, and two other steps working with the numerical weight of the information, so as to deal with uncertainty. In order to evaluate and compare the characteristics and performance of the centralized and of the distributed approaches, we made five different experiments simulating a simple society in which each agent is characterized by a degree of competence, communicates with some others, and revise its cognitive state. The results of these experiments are presented in the paper.	belief revision;centralized computing;experiment;interaction;numerical analysis;serializability;simulation	Aldo Franco Dragoni;Paolo Giorgini	2003	Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems	10.1023/A:1021833301185	computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;belief revision	AI	-20.21607447965237	-11.482323105476885	141421

Commonly, such components attempt to synthesize the operations and architecture of brain functions, such as perception and emotions. To carry out this, they embody computational models whose development is based on theories explaining cognitive and affective functions as well as on principles and standards established for the development of software systems. Unfortunately, such theories and software principles are not always available or entirely adequate. In this paper, we analyze and discuss fundamental issues associated to the development of these type of architectural components. We focus on the problems that arise throughout their development cycle and identify some improvements for the tools used in their construction.		Luis-Felipe Rodríguez;Félix F.

db64534cd00be9271f766ea882c68632148700a0	legible normativity for ai alignment: the value of silly rules		It has become commonplace to assert that autonomous agents will have to be built to follow human rules of behavior–social norms and laws. But human laws and norms are complex and culturally varied systems; in many cases agents will have to learn the rules. This requires autonomous agents to have models of how human rule systems work so that they can make reliable predictions about rules. In this paper we contribute to the building of such models by analyzing an overlooked distinction between important rules and what we call silly rules —rules with no discernible direct impact on welfare. We show that silly rules render a normative system both more robust and more adaptable in response to shocks to perceived stability. They make normativity more legible for humans, and can increase legibility for AI systems as well. For AI systems to integrate into human normative systems, we suggest, it may be important for them to have models that include representations of silly rules.	autonomous robot;complexity;norm (social);three laws of robotics	Dylan Hadfield-Menell;M.

One key reason is the lack of an appropriate spatial representation. Spatial knowledge plays a crucial role in navigation, (selfand object-)localization, planning and reasoning for physical grounded robots. However, it is a major difficulty of most existing approaches that each of these tasks imposes heterogeneous requirements on the representation. In this paper, we propose an egocentric representation, which relies on 1-D ordering information that still provides sufficient allocentric information to solve navigation and (selfand object) localization tasks. Furthermore, we claim that our approach supports an efficient, incremental process based on a simple 1D-representation. We conclude with a more abstract qualitative spatial representation.	as-interface;knowledge representation and reasoning;requirement;robot;sensor	Thomas Wagner;Ubbo Visser;Otthein Herzog	2004	Robotics and Autonomous Systems	10.1016/j.robot.2004.07.022	knowledge representation and reasoning;computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence	AI	-26.98002559199452	-19.793307249296628	141860
31258ca847702e033ac2c5f08c083b57dc20c573	integrating model-based prediction and facial expressions in the perception of emotion		Understanding a person’s mental state is a key challenge to the design of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that can interact with people. A range of technologies have been developed to infer a user’s emotional state from facial expressions. Such bottom-up approaches confront several problems, including that there are significant individual and cultural differences in how people display emotions. More fundamentally, in many applications we may want to know other mental states such as goals and beliefs that can be critical for effective interaction with a person. Instead of bottom-up processing of facial expressions, in this work, we take a predictive, Bayesian approach. An observer agent uses mental models of an observed agent’s goals to predict how the observed will react emotionally to an event. These predictions are then integrated with the observer’s perceptions of the observed agent’s expressions, as provided by a perceptual model of how the observed tends to display emotions. This integration provides the interpretation of the emotion displayed while also updating the observer’s mental and emotional display models of the observed. Thus perception, mental model and display model are integrated into a single process. We provide a simulation study to initially test the effectiveness of the approach and discuss future work in testing the approach in interactions with people.	artificial general intelligence;bottom-up proteomics;interaction;mental model;mental state;simulation	Nutchanon Yongsatianchot;Stacy Marsella	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-41649-6_23	machine learning;artificial intelligence;observer (quantum physics);computer science;perception;emotion perception;artificial general intelligence;facial expression;expression (mathematics);bayesian inference;bayesian probability	HCI	-23.22331819047436	-19.363703196842394	141937

612c1fd9512102c0c5e2744f71dc8e17af523dad	demo abstract: integrating a driving simulator with city-scale vanet simulation for the development of next generation adas systems		The future of driving will be heavily influenced by Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) using data from Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs). While driver assistance systems and VANETs have been separate domains of research and development, the gap between them is going to close. This poses challenges to developing next generation cooperative ADAS systems, as traditional testing methods cannot cover their complex interactive and interconnected nature. In this demo, we present a solution for this: a driving simulator integrated with a city-scale VANET simulation. The fundamental basis is the coupling of a driving environment operating in real-time and an event-driven simulator using our novel Ego Vehicle Interface (EVI). Visitors can take control of a vehicle within the simulation using a steering wheel and pedals. This allows them to experience future ADAS interactively in the simulation. Also, it enables researchers to analyze the influence of a human driver on such systems both on a microscopic as well as on a macroscopic level.	architecture design and assessment system;driving simulator;event-driven programming;game controller;interactivity;logic simulation;next-generation network;real-time clock;steering wheel	Dominik S.

This supervisory controller has been used for automating the manual operations in GaAs crystal growth in a liquid encapsulated Czochralski (LEC) process-based puller from Cambridge Instruments (CI-358). Although commercial crystal-growth controllers provide some degree of automation to help in relieving the burden on an operator, it is essentially the skill and experience of an operator that determines the quality of the crystals grown. Thus, reproducibility of the process is limited, thereby limiting the quality of crystals grown. This controller, referred to as the Meta-Controller (MC), executes 'plans' to sequence the operations of crystal growth. Plans are structured English-like representations of scripts that operators follow to grow crystals. Plans are then executed by the Meta-Controller, which responds to asynchronous sensor data interrupts in real time, and issues actuator commands to a real-time controller module. The notion of time is explicitly incorporated into the syntax of the language. Software structures referred to as logical sensors and logical actuators perform the translation from numeric to symbolic values and vice versa. The MetaController has been successfully demonstrated on an LEC puller and has automated three phases of crystal growth, including the 'seed-on' phase which is currently the most manual-intensive operation in GaAs crystal growth. The other two phases are 'synthesis' and 'meltback'. More plans are currently being written to automate the entire process of crystal growth.	interrupt;light-emitting electrochemical cell;liquid-crystal display;procedural programming;real-time clock;real-time transcription;rule-based system;sensor;structured english	Vivek V.

The model integrates neural, reinforcement, and symbolic learning methods to perform on-line, bottom-up learning (i.e., learning that goes from neural to symbolic representations). The model utilizes both procedural and declarative knowledge (in neural and symbolic representations, respectively), tapping into the synergy of the two types of processes. It was applied to deal with sequential decision tasks. Experiments and analyzes in various ways are reported that shed light on the advantages of the model.	autonomous robot;clarion;declarative programming;experiment;online and offline;procedural programming;reinforcement learning;synergy	Ron Sun;Todd Peterson	1998	IEEE transactions on neural networks	10.1109/72.728364	markov decision process;navigation;extraction;index term;decision theory;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;top-down and bottom-up design;markov process;learning classifier system;reinforcement learning;artificial neural network;statistics	ML	-24.119806346873474	-17.620132463029876	143777

His particular theory, however, is not transferable to literary studies. If we need a new model, I would suggest that cognitive science can provide a few interesting ones. I have begun to do some work based on David Marr's VISION, in which he hypothesizes two levels of processing within the visual module. My speculation has been on the parallel existence of distinguishable levels of conceptual or language organization which would correspond to the viewer and object centered perspectives Marr describes for vision. I propose to explore the possibility that we may find here the model for the existence of stylistic individualism within overarching historical stylistic generalizations, and even more, that this may be what feminists are searching for when they try to resist being coopted by the masculine language of objectivity.

Unfortunately none of the existing approaches is able to interweave multiple manipulation tasks and execute them reliably at the same time, enabeling e.g. an intuitive human-robot cooperation. To bridge this gap, we suggest a novel reactive behavior-based architecture. For this, we transfer the multitasking concept from modern computer operating systems to the robot and use a resource based approach to coordination and synchronization. With this, we are able to safely run multiple competing behaviors on a robot. Due to the design of the behaviors, new behaviors can easily be added to the system. The behaviors can be interrupted by other behaviors in order to react properly to a dynamic environment. Later, the interrupted behaviors are resumed in such a way that the system keeps a consistent state.	action selection;computer multitasking;context switch;experiment;finite-state machine;high- and low-level;interrupt;operating system;process (computing);recurrent neural network;robot;scheduling (computing);synchronization (computer science)	Christian Groth;Dominik Henrich	2013	2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2013.6696789	human–robot interaction;control engineering;simulation;articulated robot;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;social robot;control theory;robot control	Robotics	-27.74161780120928	-21.315637550807686	144352
92af316dccf83a5bd4bbdf24cd5cd22a99eebcb5	dancing robots - form, environment and context in human-robot interaction		Most dancing robots to date have used patterns of preprogrammed motions or hard-coded interaction rules to produce this behaviour. In a departure from this approach, recently we used a form of embodied chaotic itinerancy (Ikegami, 2007, J. Consc. Studies, 14, p.111; Kaneko et al., 2003, Chaos, 13(3), p. 926) to generate motor movements for a robot in real time. We used the robot’s sensors to analyse audio input, processing it at regular time intervals to find the appropriate tempo, and used this information to send input pulses to a FitzHugh-Nagumo neural network model (Aucouturier et al., 2007, Proc. of the 14th ICONIP, SpringerVerlag). The dynamic properties of these neurons allow for interesting chaotic behaviour, as some inputs will produce entrained periodic states, while others produce chaotic or aperiodic responses. The output neurons of this network drove the motors of our chosen robotics platform Miuro, a simple two-wheeled vehicle robot manufactured by ZMP (Tokyo, Japan). Despite the deterministic nature of the mechanisms driving Miuro, the resultant motions are heavily dependent on the music being played, and thus the robot displays complex transitions between quasiperiodic states of motion. The robot is able to demonstrate both synchronization and autonomy in its reactions to the music. Currently we are organizing a workshop together with art students to invent a new type of environment for robots. In particular, we are aiming to generate “natural” sound environments in which mobile robots can generate complex and interesting dancing patterns. The workshop will also investigate the role of physical form in driving interaction between autonomous robots and human observers. The robot will interact with human observers in the same method as above, through sound, but our investigation of radical and novel physical forms for the robot will allow us to investigate new varieties of agent-environment couplings. Ikegami and colleague Keiichiro Shibuya have started a series of sound installations, each of which uses ideas of Artificial Life and complex systems science to make unique soundscapes (http://sacral.c.utokyo.ac.jp/index.php?Third%20Term%20Music). Using robots, we can further develop this enlightening cooperation between science and art, which we think is a promising future avenue of artificial life study. Our collaboration with people from Art University will also encompass this issue, examining the concept of open-endedness in artificial life studies and developing new methods for generating sound arts. In both cases, our future work hinges on developing a new understanding of the robot-environmenthuman relationship. Through analysis of our work thus far, and discussion of the multitude of conceptual issues we have investigated with the artistic community, we will demonstrate new ways in which to examine these relationships. The interplay between form and function, between observer and performer, and between context and action will all influence the development of both the robot’s morphology and its control structure.	aperiodic graph;artificial life;artificial neural network;autonomous robot;chaos theory;complex systems;control flow;embodied cognition;hard coding;human–robot interaction;mathematical morphology;mobile robot;network model;organizing (structure);quasiperiodicity;resultant;robotics;sensor;synchronization (computer science);systems science;word lists by frequency;zero moment point	Eric Silverman;Takashi Ikegami;Yuta Ogai;Jean-Julien Aucouturier	2008			artificial intelligence;robot;chaotic;computer science;mobile robot;artificial life;complex system;embodied cognition;human–robot interaction;robotics	AI	-21.37491545445937	-17.540830721096764	144440

Process Refinement (level 4) of the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) is a meta-process used to assess and improve the data fusion task during a real-time operation. The User Refinement (level 5) of the JDL is intended to address knowledge representation for the decision-making resources. In this regard, we have proposed a performance metric to direct the analysts' attention about any ranking capability issues that may occur during a real-time operation. This paper discusses the interaction between machine projection and user perception. In particular, it is conducting a reliability-based evaluation to examine the proposed scoring scheme against the operators comprehension. The Ranking Capability Score (RCS) has successfully quantified different ranking instances appropriately. However, it provides incomprehensible scores for the analysis team, specifically, under a situational assessment where the number of prioritized events is dynamically shifted in a multi-projection environment.	cyberspace;knowledge representation and reasoning;norm (social);real-time clock;real-time transcription;refinement (computing);soap with attachments	Orabi Shurrab	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)	10.1109/MFI.2016.7849562	reliability engineering;computer science;knowledge management;data mining	Robotics	-33.426233069415254	-12.481599645716615	144924

These exercises require the support of human controllers who monitor and control simulated entities to maintain realism of the exercise. The high cost in time, money, and personnel for supporting large exercises makes it important to reduce the number of role players required. In addition, the large volume of information flowing from the synthetic battlespace and the narrow window for response dictate a need for mechanisms to assist the human role players who control the simulated entities. The Role Player Intelligent Controller Node (RPICN) uses intelligent agents to monitor and interact with the simulation environment. The agents can recognize significant events, make recommendations, and perform routine actions for the role player. By increasing situational awareness and automating routine tasks, the RPICN improves the efficiency of the human controllers.	academy;artificial intelligence;computer simulation;email;entity;information filtering system;intelligent agent;money;reduction (complexity);relevance;software engineer;synthetic intelligence	Gary Buker;Brian C.

Three different aspects of mental representations of space are briefly discussed. First, the physical size of a space restricts the set of behaviors that can be performed within the space. Mental representations of space therefore should differ in important respects depending on the perceived physical size of the referent space. Second, different reference systems can be used to code spatial information. Third, the demands on accuracy of representing spatial information differ between tasks. We posit that specialized mental representations are best suited to accomodate the different demands posed by actions within a given space. The benefit of different formats of mental representations, especially of analog representation, is addressed from a theoretical perspective. We argue that although different representational systems can be constructed that possess similar behavioral characteristics, analog representations in some cases lend themselves to more directly testable predicitions than other representations.	mental representation	Steffen Werner;Christina Saade;Gerd Lüer	1998		10.1007/3-540-69342-4_6	computer science;artificial intelligence;mental representation;mathematics;spatial analysis;spatial intelligence;scale-space axioms	HCI	-25.707821807392104	-15.74914858544914	145614

The two legal traditions are the civil (Romano-Germanic) system of continental Europe and the common law tradition of the Anglo-American countries. The two approaches to artificial intelligence are the expert-systems approach on the one hand and the more recently developed emergent approaches, in particular, connectionist approaches, on the other.

However, current HBR lacks realistic and human-like characteristics, and many domain experts think that integrating personality and individual differences into existing simulation tools in CGFs is able to improve HBR. This article describes an approach to represent reasoning with personality effects in variable cognitive processes in CGFs. By combining the Integrated Performance Modelling Environment (IPME), the proposed representation provides a high level reasoning tool for human behaviour modelling. This approach deals with deterministic and uncertainty reasoning with influence of personality and supports user-defined personality models in simulated military operators. This research shows the possibility to integrate the reasoning with personality effects into performance simulation engines in CGFs for improving current HBR.	computer-generated holography;high-level programming language;performance prediction;simulation	Ruibiao J.

In the field of psychology, a considerable amount of knowledge is still expressed using only natural language. This lack of a formalization complicates accurate studies, comparisons, and verification of theories. We believe that ASP, a knowledge representation formalism allowing for concise and simple representation of defaults, uncertainty, and evolving domains, can be used successfully for the formalization of psychological knowledge. To demonstrate the viability of ASP for this task, in this paper we develop an ASP-based formalization of the mechanics of Short-Term Memory. We also show that our approach can have rather immediate practical uses by demonstrating an application of our formalization to the task of predicting a user’s interaction with a graphical interface.	answer set programming;graphical user interface;knowledge representation and reasoning;long short-term memory;natural language;semantics (computer science);stable model semantics;theory	Marcello Balduccini;Sara Girotto	2010	TPLP	10.1017/S1471068410000384	knowledge representation and reasoning;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;answer set programming;graphical user interface;short-term memory;natural language;programming language;algorithm	AI	-24.027189713175602	-14.029379801043351	145740

First, a brief historical summary and a definition of hierarchies in Bayesian modeling are given. Subsequently, some model structures are described based on four examples in the literature. These are models for the development of the shape bias, for learning ontological kinds and causal schemata as well as for the categorization of objects. The Bayesian modeling approach is then compared with the connectionist and nativist modeling paradigms and considered in view of Marr’s (1982) three description levels of information-processing mechanisms. In this context, psychologically plausible algorithms and ideas of their neural implementation are presented.

Artificial immune systems (AISs) are a biologically-inspired approach which take inspiration from the biological immune system. Interestingly, recent research has shown how AISs which use multi-level information sources as input data can be used to build effective algorithms for realtime computer intrusion detection. This research is based on biological information fusion mechanisms used by the human immune system and as such might be of interest to the information fusion community. The aim of this paper is to present a summary of some of the biological information fusion mechanisms seen in the human immune system, and of how these mechanisms have been implemented as AISs.	anomaly detection;artificial immune system;artificial neural network;autonomous agent;autonomous robot;cylinder-head-sector;evolutionary algorithm;homeostasis;igen;intrusion detection system;multi-compartment model;nsa product types;parallel computing;population;pseudocode;second generation multiplex plus;security hacker;sensor;stochastic probe;subroutine;virtual reality	Jamie Twycross;Uwe Aickelin	2010	Information Fusion	10.1016/j.inffus.2009.04.008	immune system;computer science;artificial intelligence;innate immune system;artificial immune system	Robotics	-25.34345305010367	-20.335327302948887	146561

This paper describes the implementation of an argumentation system used for participatory management of environmental protected areas, more precisely to model the decision of a park manager artificial agent. This implementation is based on a BDI agent architecture, namely the Jason/AgentSpeak framework/language. After introducing the principles of BDI architecture and of argumentation systems, we will detail how we model arguments within the BDI (BeliefDesire-Intention) architecture. Then, we present the argumentation-based model of deliberation and decision by the park manager agent as a case study. We show how our argument-based approach allows to model various cognitive profiles of park managers (more conservationist or more sensitive to social issues), through different knowledge bases. We show examples of decisions produced by the park manager agent and examples of traces of arguments used during deliberation, which could be a base for explaining decisions. Before concluding, we point out future directions, such as using argumentation as a basis for negotiation between various agents.	agent architecture;agentspeak;intelligent agent;jason;knowledge base;tracing (software)	Pedro Elkind Velmovitsky;Jean-Pierre Briot;Marx L.

The task of designing and implementing autonomous agents with negotiation competence is usually understood as involving the consideration of insights from multiple relevant research areas to integrate different perspectives on negotiation. Hence, this paper uses both game-theoretic techniques and methods from the social sciences as a basis to develop autonomous negotiating agents. It employs game-theoretic techniques to define equilibrium strategies for the bargaining game of alternating offers, and formalizes a set of negotiation strategies and tactics studied in the social sciences and frequently used by human negotiators. This paper also lays the foundation for performing an experiment to investigate the behaviour of autonomous agents equipped with the strategies, paying particular attention to the quality and the cost of bargaining.

This chapter elaborates on the emergent requirements of decision support in light of recent advancements in decision science  and presents a conceptual framework that serves as an agent-based architecture for decision-support. We argue that in most  decision-making problems, the nature of the problem changes as the situation unfolds. Initial parameters, as well as scenarios  can be irrelevant under emergent conditions. Relevant contingency decision-making models need to be identified and instantiated  to continue exploration. In this paper, we suggest a multi-model framework that subsumes multiple submodels that together  constitute the behavior of a complex multi-phased decisionmaking process. It has been argued that situation awareness is a  critical component of experience-based decision-making style.

This Quantum Interaction Approach is briefly reviewed in this paper focusing, in particular, on the quantum models that have been elaborated to describe how concepts combine in cognitive science, and on the ensuing identification of a quantum structure in human thought. We point out that these results provide interesting insights toward the development of a unified theory for meaning and knowledge formalization and representation. Then, we analyze the technological aspects and implications of our approach, and a particular attention is devoted to the connections with symbolic artificial intelligence, quantum computation and robotics.	cognition;cognitive science;computation;quantum computing;quantum entanglement;quantum mechanics;robotics;semantics (computer science);symbolic artificial intelligence	Diederik Aerts;Marek Czachor;Sandro Sozzo	2011	CoRR		quantum hall effect;quantum cognition;quantum information science;computer science;artificial intelligence;open quantum system;machine learning;mathematics;quantum computer	AI	-26.957288193069825	-13.47656920705259	147067

We claim that nichesourcing combine the strengths of the crowd with those of professionals, optimizing the result of human-based computation for certain tasks. We illustrate our claim using scenarios in two domains: cultural heritage and regreening in Africa. The contribution of this paper is to provide a definition of the main characteristics of nichesourcing as a natural extension of crowdsourcing and to outline research challenges for realizing nichesourcing applications.	crowdsourcing;human-based computation;niche blogging	Viktor de Boer;Michiel Hildebrand;Lora Aroyo;Pieter De Leenheer;Chris Dijkshoorn;Binyam Tesfa;Guus Schreiber	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33876-2_3	simulation;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;data mining	Web+IR	-31.76826339530881	-18.034798621443354	147100

At some given moment, the underlying action model is only imperfectly known by agents and may have to be revised according to the unexpected effect of the current action. In a Multi Agent context, this revision process can and should benefit of interactions between the agents. For that purpose, we consider the general multi agent learning protocol SMILE [2] together with the relational action model learner IRALE [5] in order to model the interactions between agents.	action model learning;autonomous robot;interaction	Christophe Rodrigues;Henry Soldano;Gauvain Bourgne;Céline Rouveirol	2014			error-driven learning;statistical relational learning;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;machine learning;collective intelligence;action learning	AI	-20.71259244513854	-10.989953750871475	147594

Based on activity theory, our goal is to mediate rather than drive human activity and to integrate components from the physical, numerical and social environments. We propose an original architecture coupling a physical space (tools supporting human activity), a processing space (agent performing activity, be it human or artificial), an informational space (traces reflecting activity), and a normative space (filters regulating activity). We further consider collaboration as a conversational process grounded in the objects of the working space. To this end, tangible objects of various kinds are designed to support multi-threaded activity. Heterogeneous trace properties may then be fused to situate activity and ground the filtering process. Interface agents are designed to provide appropriate visual feedback and support mutual awareness. Beyond the mere sharing of individual or group activity, we approach awareness as involving mutual knowledge of the activity constraints. We show through simple examples from the RISK game the potential richness of the proposed approach.	agent-based model;ambiguous name resolution;context awareness;linear algebra;multi-agent system;numerical analysis;seamless3d;situated cognition;social reality;systems design;systems theory;thread (computing);tracing (software);workspace	Catherine Garbay;Fabien Badeig;Jean Caelen	2012		10.1007/978-1-4471-4093-1_15	human–computer interaction;engineering;knowledge management;communication	HCI	-21.781188946649547	-13.070803161216098	147598

The approach combines concepts from semiotics and schema theory to develop a holistic approach to linguistic meaning. Schemas serve as structured beliefs that are grounded in an agent’s physical environment through a causal-predictive cycle of action and perception. Words and basic speech acts are interpreted in terms of grounded schemas. The framework reflects lessons learned from implementations of several language processing robots. It provides a basis for the analysis and design of situated, multimodal communication systems that straddle symbolic and non-symbolic realms.  2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.	causality;holism;multimodal interaction;realms;robot;semiotics;situated	Deb Roy	2005	Artif.

The method enables us to provide intelligent services which are environmentaware with highly dynamic movement of nodes such as intellectual navigation that tells the user the best route to detour congested regions. In the proposed method, each node is supposed to know its location roughly (i.e. within some error range) and to maintain a density map covering its surroundings. This map is updated when a node receives a density map from a neighboring node. Also by estimating the change of the density, taking into account the movement characteristics of nodes, the density map is updated in a timely fashion. The simulation experiments have been conducted and the results have shown the accuracy of the estimated density maps.	application domain;automotive navigation system;autonomy;experiment;hoc (programming language);map;real-time clock;simulation;vehicle information and communication system;zero-configuration networking	Junji Hamada;Akira Uchiyama;Hirozumi Yamaguchi;Shinji Kusumoto;Teruo Higashino	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02830-4_15	simulation;computer experiment;telecommunications;computer science	Robotics	-19.300498005694624	-22.49309166139196	148075

It is a commonly held belief in the model differencing community that the best way of presenting a model difference is by using graph or tree-based visualizations. We disagree and present an alternative approach where sets of low-level model differences are abstracted into high-level model differences that lend themselves to being presented textually. This format is informed by an explorative survey to elicit the change descriptions modelers use themselves. Our approach is validated by a controlled experiment that tests three alternatives to presenting model differences.

Through this simulation, we have been able to explore conceptual difficulties amongst students concerning the notions of probability theory in the university. On the one hand, these difficulties revolve around the basic concepts of probability theory, so that modeling through the random variable becomes very difficult. Such as, difficulties to adopt the frequentist approach to estimate the fortune of the gambling player, difficulties to identify a random experiment, difficulties to build the proper random variable to a probabilistic situation, etc. On the other side, this innovation of simulation allowed the students to explore a cognitive model for two probabilities of opposing """"heads"""" and """"tails"""" events of a coin. Moreover, many students were excited to exploit the frequentist approach of probability thanks to the possibilities of rehearsals whose simulation allowed them."""	cognitive model;computer simulation;experiment;tails	Hamid El Amrani;Moncef Zaki;Youssef Nafidi	2018		10.1145/3230905.3230949	theoretical computer science;cognitive model;probability theory;probabilistic logic;random variable;exploit;frequentist inference;computer science	AI	-32.141549383466185	-16.31970109631929	148517

As an attempt to concretely bridge this divide, a formalism is proposed that describes a constructive artificial chemistry on a space of directed graph structures. The idea for the formalism originates in computer science theory, with the traditional abstraction of a physical machine, the finite-state machine (FSM). In the FSM, the machine (state-transition graph) and input string (series of binary digits) are fundamentally distinct objects, separated by nature of the underlying formalism. This distinction is dissolved in the proposed system, resulting in a construction process that is reflexive: graphs interact with their own topological structure to generate a product. It is argued that this property of reflexivity is a key element missing from earlier model chemistries. Examples demonstrate the continuous emergence complex self-similar topologies, novel reaction pathways, and seemingly open-ended diversity. Implications of these findings are discussed.

If robots lose their network connection, they cannot receive commands or share sensor data with teammates. Most research in the multi-robot systems and human-robot interaction communities assumes 100% network connectivity, 100% of the time; but this is unrealistic for real-world domains. Indeed, this assumption could be associated with significant risk, depending on the robots’ task domain. This paper presents preliminary results for measuring the impact of communication loss on multi-robot team performance. A series of controlled experiments were conducted, with physical and simulated robots, where the probability of packet loss is gradually increased from 0% to 75%. The experiments show that the multi-robot team exhibits a non-linear decrease in performance with respect to an increase in percentage of packets dropped.	robot	Tsvetan Zhivkov;Eric Vc Schneider;Elizabeth Sklar	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-64107-2_32	robot;real-time computing;simulation;packet loss;network packet;computer science	Robotics	-25.740781655633572	-23.296811078699438	149697
d06dd8fd5b90a88d56692d7afdcd64de2cc01c6b	automatic acquisition and use of some of the knowledge in physics texts	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	"""This report describes an investigation of the workings of expository technical texts with the goal of being able to automatically acquire and use some of the knowledge that they contain. The motivating question is: How does the presentation of material in college-level physics textbooks make it possible to solve problems based on that material? My hypothesis is that a lot of what is needed to solve problems is encoded fairly straightforwardly in the linguistic structure of the presentation text. Presentation passages often begin by describing a scene or telling a simple story. The physics is then introduced as a commentary on the described scene or story, perhaps by deriving an equation relating quantities in the story, or by introducing a physical phenomenon that occurs in the situations described. Problems are also presented as simple stories, and solving a problem requires locating in the presentation text a description of a situation that subsumes the one in the problem so that the associated equations can be applied. A program, called """"Sagredo,"""" was written to illustrate these ideas. Sagredo can read a passage of text describing elementary kinematics and can solve problems based on that material. As the program processes the source text, it interprets a set of definitions and rules in a unification-grammar based logic programming formalism, and constructs a representation of the occurrences described by the text. When it encounters passages that present new material, the program records definitions and rules that it can later instantiate when it reads and solves problems. One result of my reading lots of physics books was the realization that textbooks do much more than just list the laws of physics or show how to solve problems. Especially in the earlier chapters, where the fundamental principles and methods are treated, physics textbooks often resort more to rhetorical persuasion than to the sort of logical presentation that a program can easily follow. A complete account of the workings of expository technical texts must attend to wider roles that such texts play in the creation and maintenance of their communities of practice.

This is particularly true in the case of online support systems and adaptive displays which cannot rely on SA measurement techniques based on freeze probe techniques. This work investigates the state of the art in computational models of situation awareness and proposes a method to calibrate and evaluate such models using virtual reality human-in-the-loop experiments. This work introduces a new methodology to evaluate and calibrate online SA assessment systems taking advantage of the flexibility and reconfigurable power of virtual reality environments. This technology provides the experimenter with full control on the scenarios, cockpit types and interfaces. It also allows testing of off-nominal situations such as the loss of an instrument and more severe failures. Moreover, eye tracking capabilities provide an accurate way of registering monitoring events and feed SA assessment models with realistic data.	virtual reality	Sebastien Mamessier;Daniel Dreyer;Matthias Oberhauser	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07725-3_12	simulation;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-26.21701091309988	-23.753482181189263	150163

In this article we introduce the fundamentals, formalisation and application of a brand-new method based on first-order moments called the ''centre of area method''. We also comment on its validity, at an individual level and in combination with other methods, in order to build a situated representation of the environment.		José R.

The pursuer is charged with capturing the evader while the evader tries to avoid getting caught. Many robotics applications such as search, tracking, and surveillance can be modeled as pursuit-evasion games. Equally important, these games can be modeled as fun mathematics problems to inspire newcomers to the field of robotics. We have witnessed this firsthand during summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates programs at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications, located at the University of Minnesota. The subject is accessible, with many open problems that require creativity, insight, and strong algorithmic thinking. Our summer students digested the basics of the field and developed results that evolved into research publications [1], [2].	evasion (network security);make;pursuit-evasion;robotics	Narges Noori;Andrew Beveridge;Volkan Isler	2016	IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine	10.1109/MRA.2016.2540138	games;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;automation;mathematical model;multimedia;educational robotics	Robotics	-32.74358345441056	-21.35758707732183	150926
c904a2f6731520445bbdb07c6bd9c26538ab15d6	un système-multi agent normatif pour le soutien évaluatif à la collaboration humain-machine : application à la gestion de crise. (a normative multi-agent system for evaluative support in human-machine collaboration : application to crisis management)		We address the possibility of regulating collaborative work by o ering evaluative support both about the collaborative activity and about the processes that guide this activity (rules, plans, standards, norms). In designing a groupware tool, the rst di culty of monitoring the activity is that neither the activity can be assumed to be correct as a reference for evaluating the processes, nor can the processes be assumed to be correct as a reference for evaluating the activity. Moreover, deploying a groupware tool requires managing and sustaining the interaction activity. We use crisis management and in particular training in crisis management as the application case study, and tangible interaction as the technological support. From this we establish a socio-technical system for evaluative support in order to deploy multi-organizational awareness in a distributed context. In this document, we treat three main issues : the management of (1) the di erent threads of contexts (sustained activity and interaction), and of (2) the di erent process threads (sustained activity, and interaction), and of (3) the articulation of sustained activity and interaction (including contexts and processes). Our approach brings us to design the OrA model, which articulates process and context, and articulates sustained activity and interaction activity. Three properties are respected in OrA : 1. intelligibility through the modularity and the description of the process and context elements, together with the sustained activity and the interaction ; 2. exibility through decoupling and the preservation of autonomy between process and context elements, and the sustained activity and the interaction : 3. evaluative monitoring through the propagation and the appreciation of the process and context elements, and the sustained activity and the interaction. To this aim, we take inspiration from groupware models, in particular CLOVER spaces. We also take inspiration from the context management with the Traces in particular. We take inspiration from the process management with in particular the normative Organizations, and from process and context articulation with in particular the MAS. We propose to articulate in a homogeneous model the conceptual and the functional groupware approaches, considering that each step in Human-Machine-Human interaction follows its own functional rules. We show how we can o er evaluative support on both the activity of human users and the processes associated with this activity, according to di erent process levels. We evaluate our approach by modelling the processes of a practical crisis management exercise and then using the tool in a real crisis management training exercise. Finally, in four simulated situations, we discuss in more detail the establishment of tangible interaction, activity analysis and informed feedback.	biconnected component;case preservation;collaborative software;coupling (computer programming);intelligibility (philosophy);linear algebra;multi-agent system;sociotechnical system;software propagation;tangible user interface;tracing (software)	Lauren Thévin	2016				HCI	-21.890287410697663	-12.82812152508609	151198
f6bf33bc62be1141571ba674fe21796ecc5ea22b	a robot model in limited scenarios to create a suitable decision-making criterion by interacting with people in a group		In this study, we propose a model to enable robots to create a suitable criterion for decision-making by interacting with people in a group. Using this model, a system learns a suitable criterion for the group as a group member itself through Q-learning. When people, who have different individual decision-making criteria form a group, they adjust their criteria to a common criterion for the group. This common criterion is suitable for the group. People and the system cooperatively answer easy quizzes that have vague questions. The present study investigates whether the system can make a suitable decision-making criterion in a group by learning from interactions, that is, whether its answer converges to a certain criterion. Our experiments reveal that a group consisting of the participants and the system forms a common criterion in a limited scenario. Moreover, it is likely that robots using the model will be able to adjust their decision-making criteria for human groups based on interaction with them. However, further study is required to reveal whether robot's answers affect people and whether participants create a suitable criterion taking the robot's answer into account even if the participants recognize that they are interacting in a group that includes a real robot.	eisenstein's criterion;experiment;interaction;q-learning;robot;sql;vagueness	Yotaro Fuse;Hiroshi Takenouchi;Masataka Tokumaru	2017	2017 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)	10.1109/SSCI.2017.8280976	robot;machine learning;computer science;artificial intelligence;convergence (routing)	HCI	-21.44634261610724	-19.277973806503613	151540

This goal is still far despite significant advances in human-robot interaction. While considerable progress is made in various areas ranging from improving the hardware over safety measures to better sensor systems, the research on basic mechanisms of interaction and its technical implementation is still in its infancy. In the following, we give an overview of our own work aiming at improving human-robot interaction and joint action. When humans jointly collaborate to achieve a common goal, the actions of each partner need to be properly coordinated to assure a smooth and efficient workflow. This includes timing of the actions, but also, in the case of physical interaction, the spatial coordination. We thus first investigated how a simple physical interaction, a hand-over task between two humans without verbal communication, is achieved. Our results with a human as receiver and both humans and robots as delivering agent show that both the position and the kinematics of the partner's movement are used to increase the confidence in predicting hand-over in time and space. These results underline that for successful joint action the robot must act predictably for the human partner. However, in a more realistic scenario, robot and human constitute a dynamic system with each agent predicting and reacting to the actions and intentions of the other. We therefore investigated and implemented an assembly task where the robot acts as assistant for the human. Using a Bayesian estimation framework, the robot predicts assembly duration in order to deliver the next part just in time.	assembly language;benchmark (computing);dynamical system;fundamental interaction;humans;human–robot interaction;just-in-time compilation;robot	Stefan Glasauer;Markus Huber;Patrizia Basili;Alois Knoll;Thomas Brandt	2010	19th International Symposium in Robot and Human Interactive Communication	10.1109/ROMAN.2010.5598638	human–robot interaction;computer vision;simulation;bayes estimator;computer science;artificial intelligence;dynamical system;assembly;robot kinematics	Robotics	-24.64397176805722	-19.75648964572686	151831

We take as a model the only existing systems which are universally accepted as intelligent: humans. We emphasize building intelligent systems which are not masters of a single domain, but, like humans, are adept at performing a variety of complex tasks in the real world. Using evidence from cognitive science and neuroscience, we suggest four alternative essences of intelligence to those held by classical AI. These are the parallel themes of development, social interaction, embodiment, and integration. Following a methodology based on these themes, we have built a physical humanoid robot.

The authors model the system behavior in the presence of three possible approaches to the organization of information interaction. The first approach is based on the principle that everyone can communicate with everyone. The second approach is the choice of “leader” for a particular rule, who is carrying out the exchange of information with other elements. The third approach involves the dynamic selection of the leader, based on current requirements.

Higher orders of simplexity explain greater degrees of complexity relatively simply, and give rise to the development of new paradigms that are better able to explain perceived complex phenomena.

Using arguments of anticipation as an imperative for inquiry, the purpose of this paper is to introduce generic modelling for living systems theory, and assigns the number of generic constructs to orders of simplex modelling.

It addresses the many facets involved in the control of directed information flow in a dynamic system, culminating in the notion of information gap, defined as the difference between relevant information (useful part of what is extracted from the incoming measurements) and sufficient information representing the information needed for achieving minimal risk. The notion of information gap leads naturally to how cognitive control can itself be defined. Then, another important idea is described, namely the two-state model, in which one is the system's state and the other is the entropic state that provides an essential metric for quantifying the information gap. The entropic state is computed in the perceptual part (i.e., perceptor) of the dynamic system and sent to the controller directly as feedback information. This feedback information provides the cognitive controller the information needed about the environment and the system to bring reinforcement leaning into play; reinforcement learning (RL), incorporating planning as an integral part, is at the very heart of cognitive control. The stage is now set for a computational experiment, involving cognitive radar wherein the cognitive controller is enabled to control the receiver via the environment. The experiment demonstrates how RL provides the mechanism for improved utilization of computational resources, and yet is able to deliver good performance through the use of planning. The paper finishes with concluding remarks.	computation;computational resource;dynamical system;floor and ceiling functions;radar;reinforcement learning	Simon Haykin;Mehdi Fatemi;Peyman Setoodeh;Yanbo Xue	2012	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2012.2215773	cognitive model;cognition;cognitive architecture;cognitive models of information retrieval;cybernetics;computer science;artificial intelligence;cognitive load;rational analysis;cognitive science;cognitive ergonomics;cognitive robotics;lida	Robotics	-25.47748156083796	-15.654028451382084	151991

The notion of a generation process is defined and illustrated by examples. Our specific interest here is the proposal of a particular generation process, and much of the discussion focusses in this. The decision process is suggested as a second independent phase to select a ‘most plausible’ interpretation based on some auxilliary criterion from among those provided by the generation process as consistent with the visual data S.

A version of Cultural Algorithms with the ability to shift its representational bias was used to solve the Royal Road problem suggested by Holland. The results of the experiments indicate that representational self-adaptations such as this can produce significant performance improvements over systems without such capabilities for problems whose performance function is inherently hierarchical, as is the case in the Royal Road function.	cultural algorithm;experiment;formal language;speedup	Robert G.

The spatial abilities of the visually impaired are discussed. Former approaches of outdoor navigation systems for the blind are analyzed and deemed inappropriate for the purpose of modeling indoor navigation. The proposed routing algorithm for the blind calculates routes based on physical characteristics of traveling with a long cane. The algorithm distinguishes between clues, landmarks, obstacles, and hazards along the feasible paths and selects the optimal route by trading off distance and the number of landmarks and clues along a route. Subsequently, the routes for the blind are compared to routes calculated by a the routing algorithm for the sighted. The paper asserts that the proposed indoor routing algorithm leads to more suitable routes for the blind.	algorithm;routing	Martin Swobodzinski;Martin Raubal	2009	International Journal of Geographical Information Science		computer vision;routing;simulation;geography;multipath routing;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing	Mobile	-19.296776367841023	-22.96436942826141	152518

The evaluation round held in Leipzig confirmed the strength of RoboCup-2015 champion (WrightEagle, i.e. WE2015) in the League, with only eventual finalists of 2016 competition capable of defeating WE2015. An extended, post-Leipzig, round-robin tournament which included the top 8 teams of 2016, as well as WE2015, with over 1000 games played for each pair, placed WE2015 third behind the champion team (Gliders2016) and the runner-up (HELIOS2016). This establishes WE2015 as a stable benchmark for the 2D Simulation League. We then contrast two ranking methods and suggest two options for future evaluation challenges. The first one, “The Champions Simulation League”, is proposed to include 6 previous champions, directly competing against each other in a roundrobin tournament, with the view to systematically trace the advancements in the League. The second proposal, “The Global Challenge”, is aimed to increase the realism of the environmental conditions during the simulated games, by simulating specific features of different participating countries.	benchmark (computing);global illumination;round-robin scheduling;simulation	Mikhail Prokopenko;Peter Wang;Sebastian Marian;Aijun Bai;Xiao Li;Xiaoping Chen	2017		10.1007/978-3-030-00308-1_27	tournament;engineering management;league;management science;realism;computer science;champion;ranking	ML	-30.915744216583878	-20.19717355523572	152658

In this paper, we present a framework for modeling the decisions and behaviors of ball carriers in American Football using the Axis Football Simulator. While offensive strategies in football employ the use of prescribed plays with specific spatio-temporal goals, players must also be able to intelligently respond to the conditions created by their opponent. We utilize a two-part substate framework for ball carriers to advance downfield while avoiding defenders. Unlike existing football simulations that employ variations on professional football rules and regulations, our method is demonstrated in a realistic football simulation and produces results that are consistent with actual competitions.	apache axis;intelligent agent;multi-agent system;simulation;threat (computer)	Danny Jugan;Dewan T.

At the origin of Holland’s work, LCSs were seen as a model of the emergence of cognitive abilities thanks to adaptive mechanisms, particularly evolutionary processes. After a renewal of the field more focused on learning, LCSs are now considered as sequential decision problem-solving systems endowed with a generalization property. Indeed, from a Reinforcement Learning point of view, LCSs can be seen as learning systems building a compact representation of their problem thanks to generalization. More recently, LCSs have proved efficient at solving automatic classification tasks. The aim of the present contribution is to describe the state-of-the-art of LCSs, emphasizing recent developments, and focusing more on the sequential decision domain than on automatic classification.	cognition;decision problem;dynamic energy budget;emergence;genetic and evolutionary computation conference;learning classifier system;problem solving;reinforcement learning;rule-based system;semantics (computer science);word lists by frequency	Olivier Sigaud;Stewart W.

The concept of layering was introduced early, first assemblers and then compilers providing higher levels of abstraction with which programmers could work. The recent development of User Interface Management Systems has extended to interactive systems the separation of problem and technique by layering. Psychologists have long recognized the likelihood that humans behave as if they used layers of abstraction in both perception and performance. In communication between two partners, both must use the same forms and signals, or communication fails. Together, the forms of messages and the signals that indicate alternations of message direction can be considered to be a protocol. Protocols at several layers of abstraction form the basis of current models for communication between computers. This paper proposes that communication between humans and computers should likewise be regarded as a series of layered protocols, and that interfaces should be designed to take advantage of the natural tendency of humans to process communication in a layered manner, using protocols learned in other interactions.

56c0ec779f6f57660796d2365870aaf45be846e0	modelling wayfinding in public transport: network space and scene space	space network;public transport;partial order	Wayfinding in the public transportation infrastructure takes place on traffic networks. These consist of lines that are interconnected at nodes. The network is the basis for routing decisions; it is usually presented in maps and through digital interfaces. But to the traveller, the stops and stations that make up the nodes are at least as important as the network, for it is there that the complexity of the system is experienced. These observations suggest that there are two cognitively different environments involved, which we will refer to as network space and scene space. Network space consists of the public transport network. Scene space consists of the environment at the nodes of the public transport system, through which travellers enter and leave the system and in which they change means of transport. We explore properties of the two types of spaces and how they interact to assist wayfinding. We also show how they can be modelled: for network space, graphs can be used; for scene space we propose a novel model based on cognitive schemata and	complexity;map;routing	Urs-Jakob Rüetschi;Sabine Timpf	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-32255-9_2	simulation;geography;transport engineering;communication	Networks	-19.62888394026857	-22.23573940386744	155071

The model is based on the view of language as goal-directed behavior. We propose that the content of a referring expression can be accounted for by the planning paradigm. Not only does this approach allow the processes of building referring expressions and identifying their referents to be captured by plan construction and plan inference, it also allows us to account for how participants clarify a referring expression by using meta-actions that reason about and manipulate the plan derivation that corresponds to the referring expression. To account for how clarification goals arise and how inferred clarification plans affect the agent, we propose that the agents are in a certain state of mind, and that this state includes an intention to achieve the goal of referring and a plan that the agents are currently considering. It is this mental state that sanctions the adoption of goals and the acceptance of inferred plans, and so acts as a link between understanding and generation.

9a7e1647c74561c765fe16abaa3b88507784b1ad	a model of generating and predicting intention toward human-robot cooperation		We normally tend to think that we, as human beings, act as if we have intention to achieve a goal. However, in the situation of cooperating with other people, it is difficult to come up with a mechanism for predicting and adjusting each other's intention when we think that the goal is given top-down. Thinking that intention comes from context may help to solve that problem. In this study, we attempt to model an action learning mechanism that generates/predicts self-intention using deep Q-network and recurrent neural network. And then we show such a mechanism makes it possible for the agent to predict intention of others and goals.	artificial neural network;human–robot interaction;recurrent neural network;top-down and bottom-up design	Anh-Tuan Nguyen;Chie Hieida;Takayuki Nagai	2018	2018 27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)	10.1109/ROMAN.2018.8525543	simulation;task analysis;robot;feature extraction;action learning;machine learning;recurrent neural network;human–robot interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;context model	Robotics	-23.190129505786192	-18.46315598375321	155175
dd346897751ab548f56da5b1dd236e524554a269	quantitative semantic analysis and comprehension by cognitive machine learning		Knowledge learning is the sixth and the most fundamental category of machine learning mimicking the brain. It is recognized that the semantic space of machine knowledge is a hierarchical concept network (HCN), which can be rigorously represented by formal concepts in concept algebra and semantic algebra. This paper presents theories and algorithms of hierarchical concept classification by quantitative semantic analysis based on machine learning. Semantic equivalence between formal concepts is rigorously measured by an Algorithm of Concept Equivalence Analysis (ACEA). The semantic hierarchy among formal concepts is quantitatively determined by an Algorithm of Relational Semantic Classification (ARSC). Experiments applying Algorithms ACEA and ARSC on a set of formal concepts have been successfully conducted, which demonstrate a deep machine understanding of formal concepts and quantitative relations in the hierarchical semantic space by machine learning beyond human empirical perspectives.	list comprehension;machine learning	Yingxu Wang;Mehrdad Valipour;Omar A.

For instance, when assessing trust, e.g. through a trust network, it is important to understand the role that personal taste plays in order to correctly interpret potential value dependent trust recommendations and conclusions, in order to provide a sound basis for decision-making.

When life scientists speak of the intelligence of animals, they are asking us to call to mind a set of human behaviors that they are asserting the animals are (or are not) capable of. When computer scientists speak of artificial intelligence, machine intelligence, intelligent agents, or (as I chose to do in the title of this essay) computational intelligence, we are also referring to that set of human behaviors. Although intelligence meanspeople thinking, we might be able to replicate the same set of behaviors using computation. Indeed, one branch of modern cognitive psychology is based on the model that the human mind and brain are complex computational “engines,” that is, we ourselves are examples of computational intelligence.	artificial intelligence;computation;computational intelligence;computer scientist;grand challenges;intelligent agent;mind;self-replicating machine	Edward A.

Design/methodology/approach – Using a functional approach it is shown how an increasing complexity of controller structures follows an increasing ability to make more complex decisions. Two applications are used to analyze that in detail: first, the controller structures necessary for Miller’s living systems and for Beer’s viable systems are presented in one comparable scheme. Second, a complex controller structure illustrates the basic requirements for a brain. Findings – Analyzing necessary decisions in Beer’s viable systems it is shown how the elementary decisions found in feedback systems can be used as a first approximation for decision making. Hence, it is shown how principles of decision making determine the development of complex controller structures. Practical implications – The paper provides basic analytic tools to understand the interrelation between controller structures and the content of the decision these structures can make. It shows four different evolutionary paths from feedback systems towards brain structures. Also it emphasizes the role of goal values in decision making and their importance especially for social systems. Originality/value – The paper seeks to present cybernetics as a science of structures that enable certain decisions. It is suggested that making explicit the goal orientation of decision making gives cybernetics an additional relevance for the social sciences.	cybernetics;functional approach;living systems;order of approximation;relevance;requirement;social system;viable system model	Helmut Nechansky	2011	Kybernetes	10.1108/03684921111117933	cybernetics;computer science;artificial intelligence;feedback;management science;operations research;business decision mapping	AI	-23.87927316913115	-15.044479048254292	157392

More specifically, the point of view is that of Paul Humphreys' philosophical account of the organization of scientific knowledge [Humphreys, Paul. Extending Ourselves -Computational Science, Empiricism and the Scientific Method. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004.] Humphreys considers the units of analysis constituting scientific knowledge (in computational science) to be computational models, and computational templates. Computational templates are abstract syntactic schemata underlying domain specific models. Humphreys' own examples are mainly from computational research in physics, biology and statistics. Neural networks research in cognitive science can also be fruitfully considered from this computational models/templates perspective, illustrated here by two examples from recent neural networks research.	artificial intelligence;cognitive science;computation;computational model;computational science;neural networks;paul humphreys (philosopher)	Otto Lappi	2007	2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks	10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371133	philosophy of science;scientific method;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;sociology of scientific knowledge;artificial neural network;unit of analysis	ML	-27.5921753657181	-13.575186690155467	157578

Some of them (e.g. SOAR [Laird (2012)]) adopt a classical symbolic approach, some (e.g. LEABRA [O’Reilly and Munakata (2000)]) are based on a purely connectionist model, while others (e.g. CLARION [Sun (2006)]) adopt a hybrid approach combining connectionist and symbolic representational levels. Additionally, some attempts (e.g. biSOAR) trying to extend the representational capacities of CAs by integrating diagrammatical representations and reasoning are also available [Kurup and Chandrasekaran (2007)]. In this paper we propose a reflection on the role that Conceptual Spaces, a framework developed by Peter Gärdenfors [Gärdenfors (2000)] more than fifteen years ago, can play in the current development of the Knowledge Level in Cognitive Systems and Architectures. In particular, we claim that Conceptual Spaces offer a lingua franca that allows to unify and generalize many aspects of the symbolic, sub-symbolic and diagrammatic approaches (by overcoming some of their typical problems) and to integrate them on a common ground. In doing so we extend and detail some of the arguments explored by Gärdenfors [Gärdenfors (1997)] for defending the need of a conceptual, intermediate, representation level between the symbolic and the sub-symbolic one. In particular we Preprint submitted to Elsevier January 3, 2017 ar X iv :1 70 1. 00 46 4v 1 [ cs .A I] 2 J an 2 01 7 focus on the advantages offered by Conceptual Spaces (with respect to symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches) in dealing with the problem of compositionality of representations based on typicality traits. Additionally, we argue that Conceptual Spaces could offer a unifying framework for interpreting many kinds of diagrammatic and analogical representations. As a consequence, their adoption could also favor the integration of diagrammatical representation and reasoning in CAs.	artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;blueprint;clarion;cognitive architecture;cognitive science;connectionism;diagram;experiment;knowledge level;leabra;mental representation;salvatore j. stolfo;semantics (computer science);soar (cognitive architecture);spaces	Antonio Lieto;Antonio Chella;Marcello Frixione	2017	CoRR	10.1016/j.bica.2016.10.005	knowledge representation and reasoning;cognitive model;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;algorithm	AI	-26.88542507402322	-11.676319140684846	157594

As credit card becomes the most popular mode of payment for both online as well as regular purchase, cases of fraud associated with it are also rising. In this paper, we model the sequence of operations in credit card transaction processing using a hidden Markov model (HMM) and show how it can be used for the detection of frauds. An HMM is initially trained with the normal behavior of a cardholder. If an incoming credit card transaction is not accepted by the trained HMM with sufficiently high probability, it is considered to be fraudulent. At the same time, we try to ensure that genuine transactions are not rejected. We present detailed experimental results to show the effectiveness of our approach and compare it with other techniques available in the literature.	credit card fraud;e-commerce;hidden markov model;markov chain;scalability;stochastic process;transaction processing	Abhinav Srivastava;Amlan Kundu;Shamik Sural;Arun K.

Crowd behaviour models are divided into agent-based, flow-based and particle-based in terms of whether the behaviour emerges from simulating all people (agents) individually (Koh and Zhou, 2011; Braun et al., 2005; Luo et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2007; Shendarkar et al., 2006; Narain et al., 2009), is programmatically defined a priori using fluid dynamics models (Hughes, 2002, 2003; He et al., 2011), or employ a particle system governed by physical laws (Helbing et al., 2000; Bouvier et al., 1997; Treuille et al., 2006; Cucker and Smale, 2007). In agent-based models, computationally intense problems, such as global navigation, hinder the efficient real-time modelling of thousands of agents. In this paper we present a novel approach to crowd behaviour modelling which couples the agent-based paradigm of allowing high level of individual parametrization (group behaviour between friends, leader/follower individuals) with an efficient approach to computationally intensive problems encountered in very large number of agents thus enabling the simulation of thousands of agents in real time using a simple desktop PC.	agent-based model;simulation	Vassilios Kountouriotis;Stelios C.

Pattern recognition is typically described as the discipline investigating how to recognize patterns and regularities in data, with the description leaving tacit that these patterns and regularities are somehow exploited, applied, acted upon, or simply announced once recognized. The aforementioned omission is more than a linguistic one, and is reflected on the emphasis that technical, theoretical, and empirical work on pattern recognition places on the predictors it develops, analyzes, and deploys. Most research on pattern recognition adopts, effectively, a stance amounting to treating the predictors as being disembodied, taken to mean that they operate without affecting the environment about which they make predictions. This essay argues for the dismissal of this stance, and demonstrates that the adoption of an embodied predictor stance is philosophically and technically not only possible, but also desirable.	kerrison predictor	Loizos Michael	2015	Pattern Recognition Letters	10.1016/j.patrec.2015.05.009	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;embodied cognition;interconnectedness;mathematics;unity of science	Vision	-26.94413500609133	-15.18877027628119	158368

1fc4a6f0370a86a4aea23809c82e4a33423cd348	bots are users, too! rethinking the roles of software agents in hci		Increasingly sophisticated autonomous software agents called ’bots’ roam throughout the Internet, performing a wide variety of tasks, some for good and some for evil. Yet while autonomous, these bots are not artificial intelligences, instead programmed to perform mundane, routine tasks that would otherwise be impossible by humans. Useful bots crawl the web for search engines, enforce order in IRC channels, patrol for spam in Wikipedia, while malicious bots target systems, impersonate humans in chat rooms, and spam blogs and comment threads. Much research has focused on inhibiting these malicious bots, with CAPTCHAs used to verify that a user is human. [1] While bots are built by HCI researchers and practitioners, there has not been as much attention on enabling these more useful bots, many of which constitute a core part of the communities they inhabit. In Wikipedia, for example, hundreds of bots perform a variety of tasks that have made and continue to make the encyclopedia what it is today. [2] Most notably, Wikipedia’s counter-vandalism bots work alongside human volunteers in a fast-paced mode of collaboration that distributes complex, cognitive tasks across ad-hoc groups of human and bot users. [3] Yet this is only possible because powerful APIs have been developed and made accessible to bot developers. Given the powerful contributions that bots can make as participants to communities like Wikipedia, this paper argues that we must consider the non-human agents who populate our systems as users, striving for familiar concepts like usability, but for bots as well as humans. BODY Bots are users of systems just as humans are. HCI practitioners must not forget to design for both bot-computer and human-bot interaction.	application programming interface;artificial intelligence;autonomous robot;blog;captcha;chat room;hoc (programming language);human–computer interaction;internet relay chat;population;software agent;spamming;usability;web search engine;wikipedia	R.

90aee0df20e842c26121b957e7641064a8b4aeca	hive collective intelligence for cloud robotics: a hybrid distributed robotic controller design for learning and adaptation		The recent advent of Cloud Computing, inevitably gave rise to Cloud Robotics. Whilst the field is arguably still in its infancy, great promise is shown regarding the problem of limited computational power in Robotics. This is the most evident advantage of Cloud Robotics, but, other much more significant yet subtle advantages can now be identified. Moving away from traditional Robotics, and approaching Cloud Robotics through the prism of distributed systems or Swarm Intelligence offers quite an interesting composure; physical robots deployed across different areas, may delegate tasks to higher intelligence agents residing in the cloud. This design has certain distinct attributes, similar with the organisation of a Hive or bee colony. Such a parallelism is crucial for the foundations set hereinafter, as they express through the hive design, a new scheme of distributed robotic architectures. Delegation of agent intelligence, from the physical robot swarms to the cloud controllers, creates a unique type of Hive Intelligence, where the controllers residing in the cloud, may act as the brain of a ubiquitous group of robots, whilst the robots themselves act as proxies for the Hive Intelligence. The sensors of the hive system providing the input and output are the robots, yet the information processing may take place collectively, individually or on a central hub, thus offering the advantages of a hybrid swarm and cloud controller. The realisation that radical robotic architectures can be created and implemented with current Artificial Intelligence models, raises interesting questions, such as if robots belonging to a hive, can perform tasks and procedures better or faster, and if can they learn through their interactions, and hence become more adaptive and intelligent. * Parts of this work have been supported by the FP7 Collaborative Project RAPP (Grant Agreement No 610947), funded by the European Commission.

f8225d04a282ead161ea4e9e9cbd04daae3a8b6a	visual analytics tool for urban traffic simulation	urban simulation;urban scenarios;interface;geovisualization	Nowadays is extremely important to monitor and analyze the urban environment and in particular the urban viability. The increasing availability of computational power, together with more efficient simulation algorithm allows real time modeling of even complex systems such as urban traffic. Information and simulation are at the basis of the decisional process for policy makers at global and local level. In this context, visualization tools are useful aids where the understanding of a simulated phenomenon is quite difficult. In recent years, microscopic traffic simulations have become an increasingly active field of research in transport engineering. However the main challenge of these systems is related to the high ’learning curve’ and to the complex interface of the analysis tools. Often these models are used by final users that have specific competences to evaluate the phenomena and take appropriate decision. However, often these tools lack in usability and visualization makes it difficult to extract useful information. To face this problem it is important to develop a visual-analytic tool with easily readable results for users with different backgrounds, in order to catch the important information in short time. In this paper we present a highly interactive visual analytics system that helps urban planners, decision makers and traffic analysts simulate and analyze the urban scenario related to the urban viability. The design of the interface has not been based on traditional pull-down menus, panels or buttons that can take the user outside of the frame of the task. The interaction is ensured through direct actions with the 3d context in order to make the operations intuitive and easy to perform. In this way the user is cognitively focused during the problem solving. The user can interact with the 3d environment through graphical metaphors that reduce considerably the time needed to set the parameters for the simulation as well as the time needed to analyze the results. In this paper we focus on the design of the interface and on the visual analysis of the simulation model.	algorithm;complex systems;computation;graphical user interface;problem solving;simulation;usability;visual analytics	Alberto Debiasi;Federico Prandi;Giuseppe Conti;Raffaele de Amicis;Radovan Stojanovic	2013		10.4108/icst.simutools.2013.251740	geovisualization;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;interface;multimedia	HCI	-21.713212272628695	-23.043492688596906	158813

A similar baseline does not exist for electronic trading systems, but one way in which it may be possible to create t hat initial trust is through the abstract notion of an institution, defined in t erms of norms [19] and the scenes within which (software) agents may play roles in different trading activities, governed by those norms.

Accessing such information in real-time and in a methodological manner would allow disaster responders to allocate resources more efficiently. This paper presents an initial research framework related to aggregating, assessing, and diffusing information relevant to a disaster. A hybrid approach, utilizing automated data mining tools and crowdsourcing to optimize the information evaluation process, is suggested. Furthermore, a research framework for future disaster informatics research is presented. This paper informs information systems researchers, disaster planning organizations, government entities and organizations interested in utilizing real-time information to make sound decisions. Specifically, recent research of social networks presents a unique opportunity to evaluate information systems that must make sense of large quantities of data in a short period of time.		Michael A.

We employ several mental states attributes to characterize the mechanism of decision and we add a set of motivation-derived desires to the top of a BDI-like architecture. We show that an agent can change her behavior if motives behind the decisions change. Finally we explore reasons behind reasons, arguing that we can expect to identify different agent types. Endowed with such operational extensions, the Mental State Framework can provide a tool with which to program flexible agents in a principled way.	embedded system;mental state	José Cascalho;Luis Antunes;Milton Corrêa;Helder Coelho	2005		10.1007/11881216_48	simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;social psychology	AI	-21.780632042524854	-11.71911521963333	159826

More generally, we put forward an ethical view of A.I. that focuses more on internal states of the artificial agent rather than on external actions of the agent.

But what affordances do the new capabilities represent and how will problem holders and practitioners exploit these capabilities as they struggle to meet performance demands and resource pressures? Discussions of the impact of new robotic technology typically mistake new capabilities for affordances in use. The dominate note is that robots as autonomous agents will revolutionize human activity. This is a fundamental oversimplification (see Feltovich et al., 2001) as past research has shown that advances in autonomy (an intrinsic capability) have turned out to demand advances in support for coordinated activity (extrinsic affordances). The Law of Stretched Systems captures the co-adaptive dynamic that human leaders under pressure for higher and more efficient levels of performance will exploit new capabilities to demand more complex forms of work (Woods and Dekker, 2000; Woods and Hollnagel, 2006). This law provides a guide to use past findings on the reverberations of technology change to project how effective leaders and operators will exploit the capabilities of future robotic systems. When one applies the Law of Stretched Systems to new robotic capabilities for demanding work settings, one begins to see new stories about how problem holders work with and through robotic systems to accomplish goals. These are not stories about machine autonomy and the substitution myth. Rather, the new capabilities trigger the exploration of new story lines about future operations that concern:   how to coordinate activities over wider ranges,  how to expand our perception and action over larger spans through remote devices, and  how to project our intent into distant situations to achieve our goals..	autonomous agent;autonomous robot;autonomy;excite;word lists by frequency	David D.

Recent work includes the conceptual design and prototype development of the Virtual Planning Rooms (ViPR), an innovative visualisation environment that displays multi-media information on the walls of immersive virtual rooms. The operator is able to view and interact with relevant information within the octagonal rooms, and to explore different levels of abstraction or alternative data sets by navigating through doorways to adjoining rooms. Random accessibility throughout the environment is also possible via interaction with a 3D map representing a high level view of the data. Potential uses for ViPR include course-of-action visualisation, planning or display of other hierarchical data sets.

However, although solutions of public goods game have been widely discussed with empirical studies or theoretical approaches, no computational and automatic simulation approaches has been adopted. For this reason, we have implemented a computer simulator with reinforcement learning agents module for public goods game, and we have utilized this simulator to further study the characteristics of public goods game.

We will describe and critically assess the different ways AI systems are evaluated. We first focus on the traditional task-oriented evaluation approach. We see that black-box (behavioural evaluation) is becoming more and more common, as AI systems are becoming more complex and unpredictable. We identify three kinds of evaluation: human discrimination, problem benchmarks and peer confrontation. We describe the limitations of the many evaluation settings and competitions in these three categories and propose several ideas for a more systematic and robust evaluation. We then focus on a less customary (and challenging) ability-oriented evaluation approach, where a system is characterised by its (cognitive) abilities, rather than by the tasks it is designed to solve. We discuss several possibilities: the adaptation of cognitive tests used for humans and animals, the development of tests derived from algorithmic information theory or more general approaches under the perspective of universal psychometrics.	advanced intelligent tape;algorithmic information theory;artificial intelligence;automata theory;black box;captcha;cognition;control system;enumerated type;imperative programming;intelligent agent;openml;peer-to-peer;relevance;robot;sampling (signal processing);social network;technological singularity;theory of computation	José Hernández-Orallo	2014	CoRR		computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;management science	AI	-21.494056992615594	-16.761810505506972	160047

Based on Artificial Life concepts, the model has been designed for long-term simulations spanning a large number of generations while emphasizing the most important morphological and physiological aspects of a single plant. The virtual plants combine a physiological transport-resistance model with a morphological model using the L-system formalism and grow in a simplified 3D artificial ecosystem. Experiments at three different scales are carried out and compared to observations on real plant species. At the individual level, single virtual plants are grown in order to examine their responses to environmental constraints. A number of emerging characteristics concerning individual plant growth can be observed. Unifying field observation, mathematical theory and computer simulation, population level experiments on intraspecific and interspecific competition for resources are related to corresponding aggregate models of population dynamics. The latter provide a more general understanding of the experiments with respect to long-term trends and equilibrium conditions. Studies at the evolutionary level aim at morphogenesis and the influence of competition on plant morphology. Among other results, it is shown how the struggle for resources induces an arms race that leads to the evolution of elongated growth in contrast to rather ample forms at ground-level when the plants evolve in isolation.	aggregate data;artificial life;capability maturity model;coat of arms;computer simulation;ecosystem;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;file spanning;formal system;galaxy morphological classification;l-system;mathematical morphology;multi-agent system;multi-compartment model;natural language processing;physical plant;population dynamics;semantics (computer science);stepping level;virtual world	Stefan Bornhofen;Claude Lattaud	2008	Natural Computing	10.1007/s11047-008-9089-5	interspecific competition;computer science;plant community;population dynamics;artificial life	Web+IR	-19.370429459711293	-16.86762711838478	160384

Whereas in artificial languages it is normally impossible to distinguish between the meaning of an expression on the one hand, and the intended meaning the user wishes to convey with that expression on the other (the two are identical), in natural languages a parallel distinction between sentence meaning and speaker meaning (see, for example, Searle, 1975, in press) underlies all nonliteral uses. One of the central concepts in the analysis of nonliteral uses of language is that of indirectness. It is a notion that has begun to attract the attention of linguists, philosophers, psychologists, and computer scientists in their various efforts to come to a better understanding of natural languages and of human linguistic performance. One of my purposes in this paper is to show how central a concept indirectness is with respect to the production and comprehension of definite descriptions.	computer scientist;list comprehension;natural language	Andrew Ortony	1978		10.3115/980262.980274	natural language processing;computer science;linguistics;communication	NLP	-28.6485922816956	-14.650580347640553	160399

These include: • cortical homogeneity – a computing fabric of similar functional units • functional plasticity – areas dynamically grow, shrink, adopt new functionality and connectivity • the predominance of feedback in cortical structure – this indicates considerably more self-monitoring than typical AI and robotics programs • the stratified accretion of capabilities seen in phylogenetic and ontogenetic development • real-time and dynamical – the brain evolved as a controller for the body, with reflective symbolic thought a late addition involving minor tweaks • associative memory – since this is at present simulated in software, a SERVO STACKS architecture uses considerably more processing power than conventional AI systems for the same tasks. This appears to be a price evolution has paid as well, for robustness and adaptability At any given stage in its development, a SERVO STACKS architecture consists of a more-or-less hierarchical network of state machines (called sigmas) which operate in a manner not unlike a conventional subsumption architecture. Sigmas, however, are continuous rather than finite state machines and are implemented as interpolating associative memories. They store trajectories through state spaces composed of both their input and output signals. Each sigma acts as a case-based reasoner in the space of its local inputs and outputs; given a current and a goal state, it selects or interpolates a trajectory which has connected them in its experience. It is capable of analogy (by interpolation) and learning (by remembering novel cases) within the scope of its local ontology. A static SERVO STACKS network, properly connected and provided with appropriate local representations and bootstrap memories, would be a reasonably robust and adaptive robot controller. Our torso-robot testbed, which plays with wooden blocks on a table, can learn enough hand-eye coordination to reach out and touch a block. “Play,” in the form of random activity, is crucial for static-network learning: it fills the sigma Copyright c © 2008, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. memories with trajectories which are later used to predict the results of similar actions. Knowledge is represented in a SERVO STACKS architecture by subnetworks that form a dynamical systems model of the phenomenon to be understood. Such a subnetwork can be used to recognize, to predict, or to plan about and manipulate the phenomenon. The (hoped-for) primary learning modality in SERVO STACKS is not trial and error but imitation. This is by far the dominant learning modality in humans. In the context of SERVO STACKS, learning a new action involves creating a new sigma (or subnetwork) as a recognizer and controller of it; determining which internal as well as sensory and motor signals need to be connected to it; and adding it to the roster of higher-level sigmas which might want to call on it as a primitive. This in turn involves heuristics about when to recognize some activity as indicative of a memorable action or new object, what to connect, and so forth. These heuristics are themselves embodied as bootstrap memories in sigmas whose motor signals are capable of creating and connecting other sigmas as well as simply sending values along established pathways. This makes the system autogenous, capable not only of improving its abilities and learning but of improving its ability to learn, and in theory at least, of learning new ways to learn. Our plan of research consists of the following phases: • create enough mechanism and ontology for the robot to have a few physical and verbal skills, on the order of SHRDLU, and being able to improve them by practice • create enough meta-skill mechanism for the robot to learn new concepts by observation and skills by imitation • improve its learning skills by practice and trial and error • in the very long term, have the robot learn new ways to learn by watching someone learn	artificial intelligence;cognitive architecture;content-addressable memory;cortical implant;developmental robotics;dynamical system;fabric computing;feedback;finite-state machine;heuristic (computer science);input/output;interpolation;modality (human–computer interaction);phylogenetics;real-time clock;real-time locating system;robot;shrdlu;semantic reasoner;servo;stratified sampling;subnetwork;subsumption architecture;testbed;tree network	J.

Therefore, it comes as no surprise that several research works have examined the utilization of dynamical systems for symbolic music composition. The main motivation of the paper at hand is the analysis of the tonal composition potentialities of several discrete dynamical systems, in comparison to genuine human compositions. Therefore, a set of human musical compositions is utilized to provide “compositional guidelines” to several dynamical systems, the parameters of which are properly adjusted through evolutionary computation. This procedure exposes the extent to which a system is capable of composing tonal sequences that resemble human composition. In parallel, a time series analysis on the genuine compositions is performed, which firstly provides an overview of their dynamical characteristics and secondly, allows a comparative analysis with the dynamics of the artificial compositions. The results expose the tonal composition capabilities of the examined iterative maps, providing specific references to the tonal characteristics that they can capture.	chaos theory;dynamical system;evolutionary computation;iterative method;map;qualitative comparative analysis;time series	Maximos A.

The goal of our work is to enhance the mitigation capabilities of first responders in the event of a crisis by dramatically transforming their ability to collect, store, analyze, interpret, share and disseminate data. CAMAS specifically is a system designed to allow a variety of users, including the average citizen to report incidents and potentially hazardous situations, analyze and evaluate these reports and notify appropriate personnel for further action. The multidisciplinary approach incorporates a variety of information technologies: networks; distributed systems; databases; image and video processing; GIS; and machine learning, together with subjective information obtained through social science. Besides providing an overview of the CAMAS architecture, we describe the demonstration platform and specific experiments that will illustrate issues of event extraction, ranking, access control and visualization.	access control;database;distributed computing;experiment;geographic information system;machine learning;video processing	Sharad Mehrotra;Carter T.

Gentner’s Structure-Mappzng theory predicts that soundness is highest for relational matches, while accessibility is highest for surface matches. These predictions have been borne out in psychological studies, and here we demonstrate that SME replicates these results. In particular, we ran SME on the same stories used in the psychological studies with two different kinds of match rules. In analogy mode, SME closely captures the human soundness ordering. In mereappearance mode, SME captures the accessibility ordering. We briefly review the psychological studies, describe our computational experiments, and discuss the utility of SME as a cognitive modeling tool.	accessibility;artificial intelligence;cognitive model;computation;experiment;human reliability;simulation	Janice Skorstad;Brian Falkenhainer;Dedre Gentner	1987			cognitive model;simulation;computer experiment;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;structure mapping engine	AI	-24.372047579244963	-15.915078229494274	161712

However, while theory building does account for a process of knowledge creation and the evolution of a theory, which is characterised by falsification and rebuttals, a conceptual model remains a vessel of expressing a current state of knowledge. A theory held in a person's mind might develop during gaining experiences and through discussions with others, usually held in natural language. A conceptual model, however, disregards these aspects of theory building. Therefore in this paper, we will introduce an approach of purposefully constructing and validating conceptual models by means of arguments. This approach will not just enable a validation of a conceptual model against the theory of the creator, but against all theories the respective stakeholders might have.

So far embodied accounts have not paid sufficient attention to the various aspects of the normativity of emotions. In this paper it shall be pointed out that embodied accounts are constrained in the way they can account for the normativity of emotions due to their commitments to naturalism, externalism, and anti-vehicle-internalism. One way to account for the normativity of emotions within a naturalist framework is to describe the intentional objects of emotions as affordances that are of value for the organism. These affordances are part of a biological and social environment we are situated in, and they stand in complex relations to each other and to skillful organisms. I suggest that describing these relations can replace vehicle-internalist approaches but still account for the normativity of emotions within a naturalist framework.	externalism;intension;metaphysical naturalism;norm (social);rule 90;situated;user (computing)	Rebekka Hufendiek	2016	Synthese	10.1007/s11229-016-1144-7	naturalism;epistemology;social environment;cognitive science;mathematics;situated;affordance;externalism;enactivism;embodied cognition;phenomenon	NLP	-25.209603671714106	-13.245530268501119	162223

We experiment with a microscopically detailed agent model in which over 20,000 soldiers are represented individually (one agent per soldier) in a simulation of the Battle of Isandlwana in 1879.  We describe how a rule based model can be specified for soldiers on both sides and how it can be specialized for different skill sets and fighting capabilities of soldier agents belonging to particular units. We address some of the challenges of programming a model consisting of large numbers of agents. We demonstrate that our model provides a simulation of the battle with considerable historical accuracy and then go on to show how the same model can be used to demonstrate a plausible alternative to history.	agent-based model;simulation	Chris Scogings;Kenneth A.

5b92aa56456cbe6f76ad1549a3fc94442f13931a	seeking true intelligence from the ground up: evolutionary origins of cognition		Higher cognitive function was built from a foundation laid by the lowest goal-directed systems in the human brain. Thus, to understand higher cognitive function we must first understand the lowest level. This paper presents our initial results of a computational investigation into the origins of our cognition. We present results from four experiments that investigated the conditions under which initial cognitive abilities arose in our lineage, by comparing a representative chordate, amphioxus, to its close cousins the tunicates and Pikaia. Experiment 1 found that the chordates that would eventually lead to amphioxus and Pikaia evolved a switching mechanism for actions partially from a need to deal with sparse food environments. Experiments 2 & 3 found that predator sensing was the most beneficial adaptation for an organism to receive, followed by increased speed and switching speeds, but also surprisingly, that sensing food was in some cases detrimental. In Experiment 4 we examined the addition of a higher radius of vision and found an amplified performance from predator detection. Our findings show that cognitive adaptations are more advantageous because they enable organisms to avoid predation, eventually enabling them to become predators themselves. Future research will then examine how these basic principles led to more sophisticated cognitive-control mechanisms and learning as evolution progressed to vertebrates, mammals, primates, and ultimately to the complete human mind and brain.	cognition;computation;control system;experiment;lineage (evolution);mind;quorum sensing;sparse matrix	Tyler H.

The need for performing such modelling and simulation is evident since in-vivo organizational experiments are costly, not easily generalizable, and may not be feasible in critical situations. The proposed model enables one to point to strategies for organizational transformation/evolution by i) developing a unique approach to culture modelling from a holistic and systems-theoretic perspective according to seven dimensions, and ii) simulating cultural interactions as a multi-agent system that achieves an equilibrium of beliefs. Incipient results with a simple model reveal the dynamics of emergent culture of an agent organization having distinct roles and influences that develop as new individuals are added to the system.	bottom-up proteomics;complex systems;emergence;environment variable;experiment;futures studies;holism;interaction;multi-agent system;simulation;system integration;theory;top-down and bottom-up design;video-in video-out	Alexis Morris;William Ross;Mihaela Ulieru	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27216-5_6	complex systems;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;management science	AI	-19.473846483752176	-16.280706430211282	163136

86553974fabf38bbe022dc44794f345339b45c0b	understand, compose and respond - answering visual questions by a composition of abstract procedures		An image related question defines a specific visual task that is required in order to produce an appropriate answer. The answer may depend on a minor detail in the image and require complex reasoning and use of prior knowledge. When humans perform this task, they are able to do it in a flexible and robust manner, integrating modularly any novel visual capability with diverse options for various elaborations of the task. In contrast, current approaches to solve this problem by a machine are based on casting the problem as an end-to-end learning problem, which lacks such abilities. We present a different approach, inspired by the aforementioned human capabilities. The approach is based on the compositional structure of the question. The underlying idea is that a question has an abstract representation based on its structure, which is compositional in nature. The question can consequently be answered by a composition of procedures corresponding to its substructures. The basic elements of the representation are logical patterns, which are put together to represent the question. These patterns include a parametric representation for object classes, properties and relations. Each basic pattern is mapped into a basic procedure that includes meaningful visual tasks, and the patterns are composed to produce the overall answering procedure. The UnCoRd (Understand Compose and Respond) system, based on this approach, integrates existing detection and classification schemes for a set of object classes, properties and relations. These schemes are incorporated in a modular manner, typical also to human vision. The logical composition of real visual tasks allows using meaningful intermediate results to elaborate the answer (e.g. reasoning) and provide corrections and alternatives when answers are negative. In addition, an external knowledge base is also integrated into the process, to supply common-knowledge information that may be required to understand the question and produce an answer. We performed a qualitative analysis of the system, which demonstrates its representation capabilities and provide suggestions for future developments.	end-to-end principle;knowledge base;modular programming;subroutine	Ben Zion Vatashsky;Shimon Ullman	2018	CoRR		artificial intelligence;machine learning;classification scheme;knowledge base;modular design;parametric statistics;computer science;composition (visual arts)	AI	-31.827519779024364	-13.468569932682053	163203

In contrast to many former approaches in the theories of information and also in biosemiotics, we will show that the forms of meaning emerge simultaneously (alongside) with information and energy. Hence, information can be visualized as being always meaningful (in a sense to be explicated) rather than visualizing meaning as a later specification of information within social systems only. This perspective taken has two immediate consequences: (1) We follow the GDI as defined by Floridi, though we modify it somehow as to the aspect of truthfulness. (2) We can conceptually solve Capurro’s trilemma. Hence, what we actually do is to follow the strict (i.e., optimistic) line of UTI in the sense of Hofkirchner’s. While doing this, we treat energy and information as two different categorial aspects of one and the same underlying primordial structure. We thus demonstrate the presently developing convergence of physics, biology, and computer science (as well as the various theories of information) in some detail and draft out a line of argument eventually leading up to the further unification of UTI and biosemiotics.	bottom-up parsing;computer science;emergence;graphics device interface;social system;theory;top-down and bottom-up design;unification (computer science)	Rainer E.

René Descartes postulated that the mind is an immaterial thinking thing essentially distinct from the nonthinking material body, only then to face the ‘‘problem of interactionism,’’ i.e., explaining how an immaterial mind can cause anything in a material body, and vice versa. Today’s symbol grounding problem addresses the same concern, asking how symbols understood as arbitrary shapes or tokens defined in nonmetric space can interact densely with sensory-motor reality defined in an effectively physical and material metric space. In his paper, ‘‘Self-organization and compositionality in cognitive brains: A neurorobotic study,’’ Tani attempts to constructively resolve this long-standing problem of mind and body. The paper details experimental trials, inspired by Merleau–Ponty’s philosophy of embodiment, in which Tani has engineered self-organizing nonlinear dynamic systems into robotic platforms in order to test the conjecture that neurodynamic structures self-organize via accumulated learning of the continuous flow of sensory-motor experience. This learning grounds higher level cognition in perceptual reality without suffering the disjunction between lower and higher level operations found in hybrid models employing symbolic compositional operations. Instead, iterative interactions between top–down subjective intentional processes (acting on the objective world) and the bottom–up recognition of perceptual reality result in the modification of top–down intention by circular causality. As such, Tani’s models demonstrate what Merleau–Ponty metaphorically described as the reciprocal insertion and intertwining of one (the subject) and the other (the object) through which those two become inseparable entities [1]. This sketch might not be easily appreciated by proponents of cognitivism such as that laid out by Chomsky in response to Skinner’s behaviorism, i.e., that symbolic language cannot be acquired merely through conditioning, as the cognitivist may assume the following two aspects of human cognition. The first assumption may be that an essential aspect of human cognition can be adequately described in terms of logical symbol systems, the great strength of which being that they can support an infinite range of recursive expressions. And, the second assumption may be that a less or nonessential sensory-motor or semantic system is not necessary for the composition or recursion taking place in terms of such symbol systems, either at all or at least not in any noteworthy depth [2]. The crucial question for Tani, here, is whether it is necessary for the daily behaviors and thoughts of human beings to be supported by such an infinite range of recursive compositions. In normal situations, he argues, human beings speak only with a limited depth of embedded sentences, and make action plans composed of only a limited length of primitive sequences at each level. In neither case is an infinite depth of recursive compositions required. And, the series of experimental studies that he describes in his contribution to this issue confirm this characterization. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can learn to mimic stochastic sequences through self-organizing deterministic chaos with the complexity of finite state machines, but not with that of infinite ones. Although mathematical study [3] has established the possibility that analog computational models, including RNNs, can exhibit a computational capability beyond the Turing limit, the construction of such Turing machines through learning is practically impossible because the corresponding connectivity weights can be found only in nonmeasurable points in the weight space. And, to make matters worse, even if an equivalence of such a Turing machine could be reconstructed in an RNN by chance, such a parameter-sensitive system may not function reliably, situated in the noisy sensory-motor reality that its practical embodiment may require. This situation should be the same for ordinary human cognitive processes, which rely on working memory of relatively limited size and accuracy.

This attractive vision gave birth to Evolutionary Robotics (ER), an interdisciplinary field that incorporates ideas from Biology, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. Within the last 20 years, Evolutionary Robotics yielded to a large variety of scientific questions, from understanding Natural Evolution thanks to ER models, to addressing the autonomous design of robots' bodies and brains.  This tutorial will first give an overview of ER and its motivations. It will then present the main features of ER to introduce the main topics of the tutorials, which are: (1) how to make it work? Fitness function design and the influence of selection pressure; (2) ER for real robots: the reality gap and how to cross it; (3) ER and collective robotic systems: how to build such systems? How to use these tools to understand collective behaviors in nature?  The questions related to the representation and the principles of neuro-evolution will be only briefly mentioned, as they are described in another tutorial.	artificial intelligence;autonomous robot;collective intelligence;erdős–rényi model;evolution;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary robotics;fitness function	Nicolas Bredèche;Stéphane Doncieux;Jean-Baptiste Mouret	2015		10.1145/2739482.2756583	simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;evolutionary robotics;developmental robotics	Robotics	-21.075969122560995	-17.172091229675857	163671

All artificial agents are built on a computational foundation. Some are purely computational, e.g., Internet bots, search engines, and others are physically embodied entities with computational decision-making components, e.g., robots, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and autonomous cars. The noteworthy feature of artificial agents – the feature that leads to the artificial agent label – is their capacity to operate autonomously. At some level or to some degree, artificial agents operate independently from the humans who design and deploy them. They are agents in the sense that we deploy them to perform tasks on our behalf and often these tasks involve learning and decision-making. Since humans previously performed many of these tasks, we mark the difference, that is, the machine performance of these tasks, by referring to them as “artificial.” Responsibility issues are prominent in the discourse on artificial agents. Much attention has been given to the possibility that artificial agents might develop in ways that will make it impossible to hold humans responsible for their behavior. We believe that this concern misconstrues the situation and distracts attention from more important and more urgent issues. Rather than lamenting the possibility of artificial agents for which no one can be responsible, attention should be focused on how to develop artificial agents so as to ensure that humans can be responsible for their behavior. This involves attending to the optimal distribution of tasks among human and non-human (machine) components of artificial agent systems; appropriate designations of responsibilities to the humans operating in the system; and development and implementation of responsibility practices to support the assignments of tasks and responsibilities. As part of a National Science Foundation funded project (“Ethics for Developing Technologies: An Analysis of Artificial Agent Technology”), we developed a set of recommendations for the future development of artificial agents. An early version of the recommendations was presented to a small group of experts in the fields of robotics, computer science, philosophy, ethics, law, and policy. Based on the feedback received from these experts, the recommendations were revised. We present the final Recommendations for Future Development of Artificial Agents MEREL NOORMAN DEBORAH G.

Without it, humans can neither act nor interact. So unsurprisingly, this concept received in the last years a growing interest from researchers in security and distributed artificial intelligence that gave rise to numerous models. The principal aim of these models was to assist users in making safe decisions at the individual level. However, studies have shown that the behavior of an individual within collective structures (e.g., a group, a community, a coalition or an organization) is affected (directly or indirectly) by the behavior of other members, creating a social influence dynamics within these structures. In this article, we study the impact of social influence phenomena when they are applied to trust management within open distributed communities of self-organized and self-governed agents.	collective intelligence;distributed artificial intelligence;experiment;malware;open innovation;performance;population;programming paradigm;self-organization;simulation;trust management (information system);verification and validation;virtual community	Reda Yaich;Olivier Boissier;Gauthier Picard;Philippe Jaillon	2017	Web Intelligence	10.3233/WEB-170361	open innovation;computer science;computational trust;social influence;multi-agent system;knowledge management	AI	-19.57037890044598	-13.1207695377103	164153

Paralleli~im is developed in a large variety of approaches. The panel will make an attempt to clarify the underlying concepts, the differences <~f approach, the perspectives and general tt!ndencies, and the difficulties to be expected. Some differences of approach will be iAlustrated with examples from the work of the panelists. The ~ommon context of our approaches is the following:Standard computational linguistics tries to solve its problems by programmiltg a yon Neumann computer. The execution of the programs is inherently sequenti~l. This is implied by the fact that there is only one central processing unit (CPU) executing the program. In contrast to this, pal~allel processing defines the solution of p~oblems in terms of sets of computational units which operate concurrently and interactively, unless sequentialized for simulation ~urposes. Various approaches to parallelism differ in the computational power they assume for the concurrently active units. The differences may be outlined as follows: Massively parallel systems are usually systems whose units are, intuitively speaking, purely reactive units, i.e. mathematically defined by a specific function relating the state and output of a unit to its inputs. They could also be called connectionist systems in the wide sense; connectionist systems in the narrow sense are those whose function~ are based on weighted sums of input activities. In contrast to these systems, the units may be themselves complicated systems which compute their states and outputs depending on the messages and control signals which they receive. The units cooperate in solving the problem. In typical cases, each unit may be a central processor unit or even a complete computer. Systems with cooperative processors (computing """"agents"""") are usually considered to be non-massively parallel. These distinctions suggest different metaphors used in informal talk about the systems: the neural net metaphor on the one hand and the society of minds (demons) meta~ phor on the other."""	artificial neural network;central processing unit;computation;computational linguistics;connectionism;interactivity;parallel computing;parallel processing (dsp implementation);simulation;state (computer science)	Garrison W.

It provides multiple benefits such as robustness where the performance of the system is not affected significantly with the failure of individuals, simplicity of computational and perceptual capabilities of individuals but still allowing global complex behaviors and scalability of the control mechanism that does not depend on the number of agents (Mitton and Simplot-Ryl 2014). The application of swarm intelligence to collective robotics is identified as Swarm Robotics in El Zoghby et al. (2014). Many artificial systems such as distributed computing systems and artificial intelligence systems are characterized by complex behaviors that emerge as a result of the nonlinear spatio-temporal interactions among a large number of system components at different levels of organization. These systems are known as Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) as stated by Lansing (2003). Holland (2006) also considers CAS as dynamic systems able to adapt in and evolve with a changing environment. MAF problem is a benchmark problem for swarm robotics. It can be seen as a CAS and defined like in Niazi and Hussain Abstract Background: The foraging task is one of the canonical testbeds for cooperative robotics, in which a collection of robots has to search and transport objects to specific storage point(s). In this paper, we investigate the Multi-Agent Foraging (MAF) problem from several perspectives that we analyze in depth. Results: First, we define the Foraging Problem according to literature definitions. Then we analyze previously proposed taxonomies, and propose a new foraging taxonomy characterized by four principal axes: Environment, Collective, Strategy and Simulation, summarize related foraging works and classify them through our new foraging taxonomy. Then, we discuss the real implementation of MAF and present a comparison between some related foraging works considering important features that show extensibility, reliability and scalability of MAF systems Conclusions: Finally we present and discuss recent trends in this field, emphasizing the various challenges that could enhance the existing MAF solutions and make them realistic.	artificial intelligence;benchmark (computing);complex adaptive system;computation;distributed computing;dynamical system;extensibility;integrative level;interaction;nonlinear system;robot;scalability;simulation;swarm intelligence;swarm robotics	Ouarda Zedadra;Nicolas Jouandeau;Hamid Seridi;Giancarlo Fortino	2017	CASM	10.1186/s40294-016-0041-8	simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;management science	AI	-20.464467923723475	-17.0355390716154	164240

We discuss the ethical challenges involved in such a scenario, ranging from the construction of ethics into such machines to the standard of ethics we could actually demand from such machines. We argue that we might have to accept those machines committing human-like ethical failures if they should ever reach human-level autonomy and intentionality. We base our discussion on recent ideas that novel goals could be originated from agents’ value system that express a subjective goodness of world or internal states. Novel goals could then be generated by extrapolating what future states would be good to achieve. Ethics could be built into such systems not just by simple utilitarian measures but also by constructing a value for the expected social acceptance of a the agent’s conduct.	autonomy;conditional (computer programming);extrapolation;intentionality;robot;value (ethics)	Matthias Rolf;Nigel Crook	2016			management science;robot;knowledge management;political science	HCI	-23.309162810786262	-12.248248224974635	164470

fd9b8625c0454d339d6c793a08411024f005b5ef	the triple hybrid cognitive architecture: connectionist aspects	cognitive architecture	This paper introduces a recently proposed hybrid cognitive model, called TRIPLE focusing on its connectionist aspects. They are demonstrated on a series of schematic and realistic examples of analogy based retrieval from memory. The model integrates three modules which run in parallel: serial reasoning, connectionist and emotion engines. The serial reasoning engine deals with the current task, processes perceptual input, plans and performs actions, and synchronizes the activity the other two engines. Its special feature is formal reasoning. This paper focuses on the connectionist engine and the formalism behind it and how it compares to existing approaches. The connectionist engine can be considered as standalone model of retrieval from memory and mapping to the current task. It is based on a series of distributed re-representations of semantic net like symbolic localist representations of knowledge. The distributed representation building mechanisms proposed can reflect taxonomic, relational, semantic or other structure of the long term memory. The representations obtained are made dynamic by a complementary activation spreading process. The mapping-to-task mechanisms of the connectionist module are based on a dynamic similarity evaluation between task and memory content and simultaneous selection of the best mappings by a constraint satisfaction network.	cognitive architecture;connectionism	Maurice Grinberg;Vladimir Haltakov	2009		10.3233/978-1-60750-072-8-293	dual;cognitive architecture;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning	Robotics	-24.56364402724226	-17.071034306232885	164744

The library also provides simple mechanisms to create new environments with different agent morphologies and the option to modify the distribution of generated terrain.

Over the past decades a considerable amount of work has been devoted to the notion of autonomy and the intelligence of robots and of AI systems: depending on the application, several standards on the “levels of automation” have been proposed. Although current AI systems may have the intelligence of a fridge, or of a toaster, some of such autonomous systems have already challenged basic pillars of society and the law, e.g. whether lethal force should ever be permitted to be “fully automated.” The aim of this paper is to show that the normative challenges of AI entail different types of accountability that go hand-in-hand with choices of technological dependence, delegation of cognitive tasks, and trust. The stronger the social cohesion is, the higher the risks that can be socially accepted through the normative assessment of the not fully predictable consequences of tasks and decisions entrusted to AI systems and artificial agents.	automation;autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);autonomy;critical section;group cohesiveness;intelligent agent;robotics;software agent	Ugo Pagallo	2017		10.24963/ijcai.2017/3	automation;accountability;phenomenology (philosophy);management science;computer science;autonomous system (internet)	AI	-22.71880881610881	-12.42967372546238	165737

We conduct a detailed functional comparison by looking at a wide range of cognitive components, including perception, memory, goal representation, planning, problem solving, reasoning, learning, and relevance to neurobiology. In addition, we study the range of benchmarks and applications that these architectures have been applied to. Although no single cognitive architecture has provided a full solution with the level of human intelligence, important design principles have emerged, pointing to promising directions towards generic and scalable architectures with close analogy to human brains.	act-r;automated planning and scheduling;benchmark (computing);clarion;cognitive architecture;machine perception;problem solving;relevance;scalability;soar (cognitive architecture);subsumption architecture	Hui-Qing Chong;Ah-Hwee Tan;Gee Wah Ng	2007	Artificial Intelligence Review	10.1007/s10462-009-9094-9	agent architecture;cognitive model;simulation;database-centric architecture;cognitive architecture;subsumption architecture;icarus;soar;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;clarion;lida	AI	-24.933458560514755	-16.342746868410593	166152
266163fd21fdc5bccf38aea7cac3cd83e999656e	the influence of task contexts on the decision-making of humans and computers	agent interaction;computer model;satisfiability	Many environments in which people and computer agents interact involve deploying resources to accomplish tasks and satisfy goals. This paper investigates the way that the context in which decisions are made affects the behavior of people and the performance of computer agents that interact with people in such environments. It presents experiments that measured negotiation behavior in two different types of settings. One setting was a task context that made explicit the relationships among goals, (sub)tasks and resources. The other setting was a completely abstract context in which only the payoffs for the decision choices were listed. Results show that people are more helpful, less selfish, and less competitive when making decisions in task contexts than when making them in completely abstract contexts. Further, their overall performance was better in task contexts. A predictive computational model that was trained on data obtained in the task context outperformed a model that was trained under the abstract context. These results indicate that taking context into account is essential for the design of computer agents that will interact well with people.	computation;computational complexity theory;computational model;computer;experiment;humans;interaction;norm (social);predictive modelling	Ya'akov Gal;Barbara J.

593d3f7db76fe995e991ab589eafcb27f85d1747	pororobot: a deep learning robot that plays video q&a games		Recent progress in machine learning has lead to great advancements in robot intelligence and human-robot interaction (HRI). It is reported that robots can deeply understand visual scene information and describe the scenes in natural language using object recognition and natural language processing methods. Imagebased question and answering (Q&A) systems can be used for enhancing HRI. However, despite these successful results, several key issues still remain to be discussed and improved. In particular, it is essential for an agent to act in a dynamic, uncertain, and asynchronous environment for achieving human-level robot intelligence. In this paper, we propose a prototype system for a video Q&A robot “Pororobot”. The system uses the state-of-the-art machine learning methods such as a deep concept hierarchy model. In our scenario, a robot and a child plays a video Q&A game together under real world environments. Here we demonstrate preliminary results of the proposed system and discuss some directions as future works.	cognitive robotics;deep learning;human–robot interaction;machine learning;natural language processing;outline of object recognition;prototype;robot	Kyung-Min Kim;Chang-Jun Nan;Jung-Woo Ha;Yu-Jung Heo;Byoung-Tak Zhang	2015				AI	-30.22746808139957	-21.48684042080765	166550

The proposed model supports taskdependent node selection and aggregation through an announcement/bidding/selection strategy. It resolves node assignment conflicts by solving an equivalent constraint satisfaction problem. Our technique is scalable, as it lacks any central controller, and it is robust to node failures and imperfect communication. Another unique aspect of our work is that we advocate visually and behaviorally realistic virtual environments as a simulation tool in support of research on large-scale camera sensor networks. Specifically, our visual sensor network comprises uncalibrated static and active simulated video surveillance cameras deployed in a virtual train station populated by autonomously self-animating pedestrians. The readily reconfigurable virtual cameras generate synthetic video feeds that emulate those generated by real surveillance cameras monitoring public spaces. Our simulation approach, which runs on high-end commodity PCs, has proven to be beneficial because this type of research would be difficult to carry out in the real world in view of the impediments to deploying and experimenting with an appropriately complex camera network in extensive public spaces.	closed-circuit television;cognitive model;constraint satisfaction problem;experiment;high- and low-level;image sensor;match moving;norm (social);personal computer;population;prototype;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;situated;stationary process;synthetic data;virtual reality;visual sensor network	Faisal Qureshi;Demetri Terzopoulos	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-73090-3_1	embedded system;computer vision;simulation;wireless sensor network;computer science;virtual machine;operating system;constraint satisfaction problem;computer security;computer network;visual sensor network	Vision	-19.973830180026606	-20.43176751857146	166794

The central idea is that stability and regulation of activity within a multi-agent system can be accounted for by means of a complex web of roles, commitments, obligations and rights. In particular, commitments are considered to be the attitudes that hold a group of agents together. In pursuit of their own objectives as well as in order to support their collective commitments, agents adopt roles and undertake social commitments. Being semi-autonomous they may decide to drop their commitments and roles, but they may have to bear the consequences of the other agents' prerogative to exercise their rights.	autonomous robot;multi-agent system;semiconductor industry	Maria Fasli	2003		10.1145/860575.860759	modal logic;social relation;social behavior;computer science;multi-agent system	AI	-21.31449109652798	-11.999467651717742	167004

We assume high-level agent behavior can be described as a sequential composition of lower-level behavioral primitives. Aggregation or division of the collective into distinct clusters is achieved by developing a macroscopic description of the ensemble dynamics. The advantages of this approach are twofold: 1) the derivation of a low dimensional but highly predictive description of the collective dynamics and 2) a framework where interaction uncertainties between the low-level components can be explicitly modeled and control. Additionally, classical dynamical systems theory and control theoretic techniques can be used to analyze and shape the collective dynamics of the system. We consider the aggregation problem for homogeneous agents into clusters located at distinct regions in the workspace and discuss the extension to heterogeneous teams of autonomous agents. We show how a macroscopic model of the aggregation dynamics can be derived from agent-level behaviors and discuss the synthesis of distributed coordination strategies in the presence	autonomous robot;dynamical systems theory;high- and low-level;process calculus;workspace	M.

This can be accomplished by explicitly coordinating the agent's planning, perception, and action. The Task Control Architecture (TCA) provides a vocabulary of coordination constructs that combines both deliberative and reactive aspects. The paper briefly describes the control constructs of TCA, and characterizes their applicability along several important dimensions.	advanced telecommunications computing architecture;automated planning and scheduling;computation;computational resource;control flow;mobile robot;vocabulary	Reid G.

6e978baa0beaeaa22e8de818bd48aa984d8e459c	bipocl: a discourse-driven story planner for procedural narrative generation (extended abstract)		Narrative intelligence is fundamental for organizing experiences, understanding our surroundings, and forming predictions about the future [Schank, 1995]. Computational systems that leverage narrative intelligence benefit applications that involve stories including entertainment, education, skill training, and legal decision-making. AI planning research is a popular source of data structures and algorithms for understanding, generating, and reasoning about stories [Young et al., 2014]. Narratologists frequently distinguish the story (i.e. fabula) of narrative from the discourse [Chatman, 1980], and plans have proven useful for modeling both story and discourse [Young, 2007]; they are effective for modeling discourse because a coherent sequence of communicative actions is plan-like [Cohen and Perrault, 1979], and plans are effective for modeling stories because stories are composed of events with cause-effect relations with characters themselves forming plans to achieve goals. Psychological studies have demonstrated that plans capture many of the key aspects of narratives that spectators use to understand narrative discourse [Radvansky et al., 2014; Cardona-Rivera et al., 2016].	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;coherence (physics);computation;data structure;emergent gameplay;organizing (structure);word lists by frequency	David R.

31d7be1fd7a59f69c863afcf21d6dfbd2c90418c	teaching & learning guide for speech variation, utility, and game theory		This article proposes a new way for viewing, analyzing, interpreting, and understanding speech variation, divergence of dialects, and linguistic change. We do so by examining a spectrum of linguistic descriptions of speech behavior and articulation patterns in a manner similar to economists’ analytic depiction of the interplay in economic interactions. That is, we posit that the full gamut of Game Theory fundamentals, as developed in the last 70 years by mathematical economists, bears on attributes of speech as used in real life. ‘A game is being played whenever people interact with each other’ – Ken Binmore, p.3, Fun and games – a serious text on Game Theory. Speech certainly qualifies. The mathematical presentation of game theory, with its language for communicating concepts, ideas, and findings, might at first appear as a forbidding barrier to the sociolinguistic community. In an attempt to facilitate breaching this barrier, we present (and illustrate) in Section 2 game theory basic concepts by means of familiar linguistic situations. To make a transparent connection between game theory and sociolinguistics, we conclude Section 2 with a hypothetical example of a linguistic Prisoners’ Dilemma. In Section 3, we attempt to tighten the understanding of the conceptual parallels with illustrations and examples derived mostly from linguistic literature. In Section 4, we propose a new way of examining and interpreting the experimental findings of social psychologists of language use as presented by Genesee and Bourhis (1982, 1988). That is, we offer a new perspective on two classic studies by Genesee and Bourhis demonstrating that their observed behavioral account exemplifies a version of a linguistic Prisoners’ Dilemma. In the next four sections, we follow up with a number of additional detailed demonstrations of game theory relevance to sociolinguistics by discussing the evidence in studies of articulation and linguistic shift patterns that are more clearly interpreted using game theoretical models and tools.	biconnected component;game theory;interaction;parallels desktop for mac;prisoner's dilemma;real life;relevance;vergence	Moshe Dror;Daniel Granot;Malcah Yaeger-Dror	2014	Language and Linguistics Compass	10.1111/lnc3.12064	cognitive psychology;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence	NLP	-29.111488565615485	-13.700987928430486	167775

96e89a503ec9282f822334d1a810ae14c6477796	toward a semantic general theory of everything		The notion of a universal semantic cognitive map is introduced as a general indexing space for semantics, useful to reduce semantic relations to geometric and topological relations. As a first step in designing the concept, the notion of semantics is operationalized in terms of human subjective experience and is related to the concept of spatial position. Then synonymy and antonymy are introduced in geometrical terms. Further analysis building on previous studies of the authors indicates that the universal semantic cognitive map should be locally low-dimensional. This essay ends with a proposal to develop a metric system for subjective experiences based on the outlined approach. We conclude that a computationally defined universal semantic cognitive map is a necessary tool for the emerging new science of the mind: a scientific paradigm that includes subjective experience as an object of study. ! 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

8c51ac6306d3dd44e93dd8269930d8bbb8f9ad75	an algorithm defining the choice of 'active~passive' formal paradigms in georgian		Two different formal paradigms traditionally referred to as 'Active' and 'Passive' are clearly distinguished in Georgian; however, there are many cases in which a simple semantic-functional interpretation of the paradigms cannot be given inasmuch as the constructions pointed out as 'Active' or 'Passive' can actually represent a variety of verb semantics: non-conversive passives both dynamic and static, active intransitive processes, reflexives, reciprocals, potentials, deponents, etc. Thus, the problem with these paradigms is that it is difficult to predict the meaning from the form and, to such an extent, traditional terms 'Active' and 'Passive' actually have a conventional character. This paper suggests a cognitive model based on certain semantic features that define the choice of either the passive or the active formal paradigms for grammatical representations of so-called 'medial' verbs. The process of choice is organized as an algorithm with four stages of implicational rules and mirrors the hierarchically organized optimal dynamic process of linguistic structuring of an active~passive continuum.	algorithm	Rusudan Asatiani	2015		10.1007/978-3-662-54332-0_1	computer science;artificial intelligence;algorithm	NLP	-26.192340982715244	-14.244338367809629	168376

The highest layer of the GLAIR Architecture, the Knowledge Layer (KL), contains the beliefs of the agent, and is the layer in which conscious reasoning, planning, and act selection is performed. The lowest layer of the GLAIR Architecture, the Sensori-Actuator Layer (SAL), contains the controllers of the sensors and effectors of the hardware or software robot. Between the KL and the SAL is the Perceptuo-Motor Layer (PML), which grounds the KL symbols in perceptual structures and subconscious actions, contains various registers for providing the agent’s sense of situatedness in the environment, and handles translation and communication between the KL and the SAL. The motivation for the development of GLAIR has been “Computational Philosophy”, the computational understanding and implementation of human-level intelligent behavior without necessarily being bound by the actual implementation of the human mind. Nevertheless, the approach has been inspired by human psychology and biology.	cognitive architecture;computation;embodied agent;mind;robot;sensor;simulation	Stuart C. Shapiro;Jonathan P.

In this paper we present a new classification for CSCW systems based on logical principles of this philosophy so as to classify them in a flexible and appropriate way.	computer-supported cooperative work;embedded system	Shenjun Xue;Yi Liu	2008	2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering	10.1109/CSSE.2008.1229	human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;computer-supported cooperative work;taxonomy	Robotics	-32.4019244468832	-17.664658318651995	168693

The system has the characteristics of flexible agent, variable topology, isomorphic function structure, distributed knowledge storage, and integrated control method. The architecture is proposed with four kinds of agent models, that is Control_Agent, Union_Agent, Ship_Agent and VTS_Agent. We developed these agent models for modeling the behaviors for human, ship and VTS using a BDI (Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions) agent framework. The agent communication mechanism based on AIS (Automatic Identification System) message is also established and discussed. The proposed multiagent-based simulation system provides a useful platform for studying multi-target encountering problems and different decision-making methods for collision avoidance.	agent-based model;automatic identification and data capture;ion implantation;simulation;vehicle tracking system	Yuhong Liu;Chunsheng Yang;Xuanmin Du	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74171-8_31	simulation;automatic identification system;computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;computer security	Robotics	-19.160691042029836	-11.411924869286869	169348

EOM is unique in that autonomous agent behavior is not restricted in advance, but only if it turns out to be necessary at runtime, and does so exploiting a seamless combination of evolving probabilistic and normative behavioral expectations as the key modeling abstraction and as the primary level of analysis and in uence. Expectations are attitudes which allow for the relation of observed and predicted actions and other events to the modeler's intentions and desires on the one hand and her beliefs on the other in an integrated, adaptive manner. In this regard, this work introduces a formal framework for the representation and the semantics of expectations embedded in social contexts. We see the applicability of EOM especially in open domains with a priori unknown and possibly unreliable and insincere actors, where the modeler can not rely on cooperation or pursue her goals through the exertion of strictly normative power, e.g. the development and assertion of exible interaction policies for trading platforms in the Internet, as illustrated in a case study. To our knowledge, EOM is the rst approach to the speci cation, prediction, analysis and in uencing of social interaction that aims at tackling the level of expectations explicitly and systematically, and allow for representing the beliefs and the intentions of agents in terms of empirical and desired predictions.	assertion (software development);autonomous agent;autonomous robot;embedded system;enterprise output management;run time (program lifecycle phase);seamless3d	Matthias Nickles;Michael Rovatsos;Gerhard Weiß	2005	Eng.

Theoretical concepts concerning social behavior are presented from a systemic per spective and their usefulness is evaluated in interpreting the results obtained. Two agents moving in an unstructured arena must locate each other, and remain within a short distance of one anoth er for as long as possible using noisy continuous acoustic interaction. Evolved dynamical recurrent neural networks are used as the control architecture. Acoustic coupling poses nontrivial problems like discriminating 'self' from 'non-self' and structuring production of signals in time so as to minimize interference. Detailed observation of the most frequently evolved behavioral strategy shows that interacting agents perform rhythmic signals leading to the coordination of movement. During coordination, signals become entrained in an anti-phase mode that resembles turn-taking. Perturbation techniques show that signalling behavior not only performs an external function, but it is also integrated into the movement of the producing agent, thus showing the difficulty of separating behavior into social and non-social classes. Structural congruence between agents is shown by exploring internal dynamics as well as the response of single agents in the presence of signalling beacons that reproduce the signal patterns of the interacting agents. Lack of entrainment with the signals produced by the beacons shows the importance of transient periods of mutual dynamic perturbation wherein agents achieve congruence.	acoustic coupler;brainwave entrainment;simulation;zeller's congruence	Ezequiel A.

Such human-like behavior can be essential in for instance serious games in which humans have to learn a certain task, and are either faced with automated teammates or opponents. To tailor these cognitive models towards a certain scenario can however be a time-consuming task requiring a lot of domain expertise. In this paper, a cognitive model is taken as a basis, and the addition of scenario specific information is for a large part automated. The performance of the approach of automatically adding scenario specific information is rigorously evaluated using a case study in the domain of fighter pilots.	cognitive model	Richard Koopmanschap;Mark Hoogendoorn;Jan Joris Roessingh	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-38577-3_3	simulation;cognitive models of information retrieval;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;machine learning	HCI	-23.652072162903956	-20.28172704161946	169830

Most of the efforts in designing co-ordination mechanisms set out from an agent-centred point of view: they see the individual actor with its local beliefs and reasoning capabilities as the foundation of all system properties. Our thesis is that co-ordination is best modelled from an environment-centred, social perspective, that considers the whole, situated system as the starting point of any analysis. We argue that this stance is reflected in Clancey’s modification of the Knowledgelevel hypothesis. On the basis of this modified hypothesis we introduce a distinction between co-ordination at the Knowledgeand at the Symbollevel. Finally, we present a Knowledge-level model of co-ordination and illustrate it by specifying the co-ordination processes of an intelligent traffic management system.	distributed artificial intelligence;knowledge level;situated	Sascha Ossowski;Ana M.

44a81a98cb3d25aafc1fa96372f0a68486d648a2	is multiagent deep reinforcement learning the answer or the question? a brief survey		Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved outstanding results in recent years. This has led to a dramatic increase in the number of applications and methods. Recent works have explored learning beyond single-agent scenarios and have considered multiagent scenarios. Initial results report successes in complex multiagent domains, although there are several challenges to be addressed. In this context, first, this article provides a clear overview of current multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MDRL) literature. Second, it provides guidelines to complement this emerging area by (i) showcasing examples on how methods and algorithms from DRL and multiagent learning (MAL) have helped solve problems in MDRL and (ii) providing general lessons learned from these works. We expect this article will help unify and motivate future research to take advantage of the abundant literature that exists in both areas (DRL and MAL) in a joint effort to promote fruitful research in the multiagent community.	agent-based model;algorithm;categorization;driven right leg circuit;emergence;game theory;reinforcement learning;stationary process	Pablo Hernandez-Leal;Bilal Kartal;Matthew E.

910335069574082a6a135e9fe14eb04853e3a1c7	on the emergence of syntactic structures: quantifying and modeling duality of patterning	quantitative linguistics;combinatoriality;language dynamics;compositionality	The complex organization of syntax in hierarchical structures is one of the core design features of human language. Duality of patterning refers, for instance, to the organization of the meaningful elements in a language at two distinct levels: a combinatorial level, where meaningless forms are combined into meaningful forms; and a compositional level, where meaningful forms are composed into larger lexical units. The question remains wide open regarding how such structures could have emerged. The aim of this paper is to address these two aspects in a self-consistent way. First, we introduce suitable measures to quantify the level of combinatoriality and compositionality in a language, and we present a framework to estimate these observables in human natural languages. Second, we show that a recently introduced multi-agent modeling scheme, namely the Blending Game, provides a mathematical framework to address the problem of how a population of individuals can bootstrap combinatoriality and compositionality. Theoretical predictions based on this model turn out to be in good agreement with empirical data. It is remarkable that the two sides of duality of patterning emerge simultaneously as a consequence of a pure cultural dynamics in a simulated environment that contains meaningful relations, provided a simple constraint on message transmission fidelity is also considered.	alpha compositing;constraint algorithm;emergence;large;mathematics;multi-agent system;natural language;numerous;observable;programming languages;virtual reality	Vittorio Loreto;Pietro Gravino;Vito Domenico Pietro Servedio;Francesca Tria	2016	Topics in cognitive science	10.1111/tops.12193	psychology;natural language processing;quantitative linguistics;computer science;artificial intelligence;linguistics;principle of compositionality;cognitive science	AI	-22.61034576603304	-14.810575557979524	170763

All major teams use a fixed algorithm to control its players. An unexpected opponent strategy, not previously considered by the developers, might result in winning all matches. To improve this we use ILP to learn action descriptions of opponent players; for learning on dynamic domains, we have to deal with the frame problem. The induced descriptions can be used to plan for desired field states. To show this we start with a simplified scenario where we learn the behaviour of a goalkeeper based on the actions of a shooter player. This description is used to plan for states where a goal can be scored. This result can directly be extended to a multiplayer environment.	simulation	Alberto Illobre;Jorge Gonzalez;Ramón P.

This collaboration is structured using collaborative scripts. Hence, the design of these Scripts is not trivial; it requires information on learners and on their interaction. We believe that when learners are the target of any design, this one needs to be evaluated on the basis of the learners themselves. However, most of the design approaches do not use experimental feedback on the learners’ collaboration to improve the initial design. We propose in this article a method for the design of scripts basing on the experimental feedback. We suggest the use of multi-agent systems to provide help and information to the scripts designers.	agent-based model;autonomous agents and multi-agent systems;continuous design;interaction;interpretation (logic);java;katia sycara;multi-agent system;springer (tank)	Sara Boutamina;Hassina Seridi-Bouchelaghem;Abdelkader Gouaich	2009			computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining	HCI	-25.643984752367935	-20.31112707705871	171083

Scientists sometimes make use of mathematical models at one level of abstraction, but multiple levels of abstraction, with each increasingly abstract, is not a common idea in science or the history and philosophy of science. In AI it is easy to consider dropping detail as one proceeds upward in an abstraction hierarchy. Forming the higher-level, abstract concepts while building a knowledge base can be a creative process for the knowledge engineer. The AI researcher might have to add new abstract concepts in order to put the knowledge into a knowledge representation system with multiple levels of abstraction. For example, the concept of a “molecular switch” was developed at a high level of abstraction in the MOLGEN knowledge base, and it has proved of interest	artificial intelligence;attribute-value system;high-level programming language;knowledge base;knowledge engineer;knowledge representation and reasoning;mathematical model;principle of abstraction	Lindley Darden	1986	AI Magazine		computer science;artificial intelligence;algorithm	AI	-30.15117682890905	-13.19465853364388	171110

Human behaviours are motivated by goals, which are known to the actor but typically inferred on the part of the observer. Goals can be hierarchical in nature, such that a collection of sub-goals (e.g., getting a mug, boiling water) can be nested under a higher-level goal (e.g., making tea), which can be further nested under an even higher-level goal (e.g., making breakfast). The diverse set of talks in this symposia all highlight the foundational role that goals play in action processing and representation. Eisenberg et al. detail how online prediction of others’ goals shapes observers’ sampling of information during action observation. Howard and Woodward provide evidence that children’s memory for non-human events can be facilitated by priming children with their own goaldirected actions. Loucks and Meltzoff highlight the importance of goal structure in children’s memory for complex action sequences. Finally, Cooper presents a computational model to explain the emergence of goaldirected action hierarchies.	actor model;computation;computational model;emergence;sampling (signal processing)	Michelle L.

We argue that truthmaking functions are constrained by a stable phenomenal world and a stable cognitive architecture. This account takes truth as normatively distinct from epistemic justification while relativizing the truth conditions of our statements to what we call “Frameworks.” The pluralistic aspect allows that these stable elements, while constraining representational and linguistic schemes, do not define a single framework for truthmaking relations. We strengthen this position by considering themes on situated rational agency from cognitive science and artificial intelligence, arguing that whatever enables or supports rational action within a particular environment must figure into some account of truth and truthmaking, and vice versa.	alethic modality;artificial intelligence;cognitive architecture;cognitive science;situated	Murat Baç;Renée Elio	2004	Minds and Machines	10.1023/B:MIND.0000021705.36572.0f	psychology;cognitive architecture;philosophy;rationality;epistemology;computer science;artificial intelligence;software framework;agency;ontology;situated cognition;realism;social psychology;algorithm;cognitive science;pluralism	AI	-24.654746155135996	-12.543988121580119	171567
f0227eb3dadfc938cfbb89b7626747e16851463c	preference models for creative artifacts and systems.		Although there is vigorous debate around definitions of creativity, there is general consensus that creativity i) has multiple facets, and ii) inherently involves a subjective value judgment by an evaluator. In this paper, we present evaluation of creative artifacts and computational creativity systems through a multiattribute preference modeling lens. Specifically, we introduce the use of multiattribute value functions for creativity evaluation and argue that there are significant benefits to explicitly representing creativity judgments as subjective preferences using formal mathematical models. Various implications are illustrated with the help of examples from and inspired by the creativity literature.	computational creativity;interpreter (computing);mathematical model	Debarun Bhattacharjya	2016			computer science	HCI	-24.539658238231702	-12.156922687028885	172102

Causal modeling and causal discovery are central to medical science. In order to algorithmically consider causal relations, the relations must be placed into a representation that supports manipulation. Knowledge of at least some causal effects is imprecise. The most widespread causal representation is directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, DAGs are severely limited in what portion of the common sense world they can represent. This paper considers the needs of commonsense causality and suggests Fuzzy Cognitive Maps as an alternative to DAGs.	algorithm;causality;commonsense reasoning;directed acyclic graph;precondition	Lawrence J.

Usually, poor performance of an agent leads to a decrease of trust in that agent. This is not always reasonable. If the environment interferes with the performance, the agent is possibly not to blame for the failure. We examine which failures can be called excusable and hence must not be seen as bad performances. Knowledge about these failures makes assessments of trustworthiness more accurate. In order to approach a formal definition of excusableness, we introduce a generic formalism for describing environments of Multi-Agent Systems. This formalism provides a basis for the definition of environmental interference. We identify the remaining criteria for excusableness and give a formal definition for it. Our analysis reveals that environmental interference and a strong commitment of the performing agent do not suffice to make a failure excusable.	failure;formal system;interference (communication);multi-agent system;performance;precondition;reputation system;testbed;trust (emotion)	Eugen Staab;Thomas Engel	2007		10.1007/978-3-642-01639-4_11	mobile ad hoc network;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;distributed computing;computer security	AI	-20.27102900666749	-10.595980941782075	172142

The complexity and uncertainty of the nature of modern systems, and the heterogeneity of related information, require a complex approach for their study, based on systems theory and systems analysis and consisting of information and expert knowledge management, initial pre-processing, modeling, simulation, and decision making support. As the complexity of systems increases, system theoretic methods become more crucial. Often they may provide the only effective tools to obtain the information about the elements in a system, connections between those elements, and a means for getting the adequate representation of system in a whole. The variety of complex systems can be described by deterministic or stochastic differential equations, statistical mechanics equations, neural network models, cellular automata, finite state machines, multi-agent systems, etc. Most of the complex real world objects are modeled as dynamic systems enriched by artificial intelligence resources. Equipped with artificial intelligence techniques, these models offer a wide variety of advantages such that coping with incomplete information and uncertainty, predicting system’s behavior, reasoning on qualitative level, knowledge representation and modeling, where computer simulations and information systems play an important and active role and facilitate the process of decision making. This chapter aims to discuss the problems of modeling, control, and decision support in complex dynamic systems from a general system theoretic point of view, with special emphasis on methodological aspects. We consider the main characteristics of complex systems and of system approach to complex system study. Then the chapter continues with the general dynamic modeling and simulation technique for complex hierarchical systems functioning in control loop. The proposed technique is based on the information-mathematical models and described in terms of the hierarchical state transition diagrams. The methodology is sufficiently abstract to allow both qualitative and quantitative analysis of system state dynamics and control through hierarchical scenario calculus. The evaluation of different scenarios is defined by the multiple criteria vector-functions related to the efficiency of control strategies and time required for system goals achievement. We also offer general architectural and structural models of computer information system intended for simulation and decision support in complex systems.

We present an algorithm that generates such imaginary objects, which we call gadgets, in order to extend the ontological expressivity of existing, planning-based story generation systems. The behavior of a gadget is represented as a plan including typical events that happen when the gadget is used. Our algorithm creates gadgets by extrapolating and merging one or more commonly known objects in order to achieve a narrative goal provided by an existing story generator. We extend partial-order planning to establish open conditions based on analogies between concepts related respectively to common objects and the gadget. We show the algorithm is capable of generating gadgets created by human.	algorithm;extrapolation;gadget (computer science);imaginary time;partial-order planning	Boyang Li;Mark O.

These models manage and aggregate the information needed by agents to efficiently perform partner selection in uncertain situations. For simple applications, a game theoretical approach similar to that used in most models can suffice. However, if we want to undertake problems found in socially complex virtual societies, we need more sophisticated trust and reputation systems. In this context, reputation-based decisions that agents make take on special relevance and can be as important as the reputation model itself. In this paper, we propose a possible integration of a cognitive reputation model, Repage, into a cognitive BDI agent. First, we specify a belief logic capable to capture the semantics of Repage information, which encodes probabilities. This logic is defined by means of a two first-order languages hierarchy, allowing the specification of axioms as first-order theories. The belief logic integrates the information coming from Repage in terms if image and reputation, and combines them, defining a typology of agents depending of such combination. We use this logic to build a complete graded BDI model specified as a multi-context system where beliefs, desires, intentions and plans interact among each other to perform a BDI reasoning. We conclude the paper with an example and a related work section that compares our approach with current state-of-the-art models.	agent architecture;agent-based model;aggregate data;argumentation framework;biological anthropology;cognition;cognitive model;computational linguistics;computational trust;conceptualization (information science);cristiano castelfranchi;deductive language;emergence;first-order logic;first-order predicate;jason;mathematical model;mental state;relevance;reputation system;simulation;virtual community	Isaac Pinyol;Jordi Sabater-Mir;Pilar Dellunde;Mario Paolucci	2010	Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems	10.1007/s10458-010-9149-y	reputation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;image;trustworthy computing	AI	-21.814565025736197	-11.02600012641839	173725

Artificial intelligence is a computational technique which is inspired by natural intelligence such as the swarming of birds, the working of the brain and the pathfinding of the ants. These techniques have impact on economic theories. This book studies the impact of artificial intelligence on economic theories, a subject that has not been extensively studied. The theories that are considered are: demand and supply, asymmetrical information, pricing, rational choice, rational expectation, game theory, efficient market hypotheses, mechanism design, prospect, bounded rationality, portfolio theory, rational counterfactual and causality. The benefit of this book is that it evaluates existing theories of economics and update them based on the developments in artificial intelligence field.	artificial intelligence;causality;counterfactual conditional;game theory;intelligent agent;modern portfolio theory;pathfinding;rationality	Tshilidzi Marwala;Evan Hurwitz	2017	CoRR		artificial intelligence;sociological intelligence;artificial psychology;cognitive science	AI	-25.372881768865774	-12.325189079175763	173827

This paper raises the analogous issue for olfaction: how to test the validity of a system claimed to reproduce arbitrary odours artificially, in a way recognizable to humans. Although odour reproduction systems are still far from being viable, the question of how to test candidates thereof is claimed to be interesting and non-trivial, and a novel method is proposed. Despite the similarity between the two questions and their surfacing long before the tested systems exist, the present question cannot be answered adequately by a Turing-like method. Instead, our test is very different: it is conditional, requiring from the artificial no more than is required from the original, and it employs a novel method of immersion that takes advantage of the availability of easily recognizable reproduction methods for sight and sound, a la Nicéphore Niépce and Alexander Graham Bell.	artificial intelligence system;bell palsy;gilles de la tourette syndrome;graham scan;greater than;immersion (virtual reality);linear algebra;nomenclature;odors;smell perception;turing test	David Harel	2016		10.1098/rsif.2016.0587	biology;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;ecology;algorithm	AI	-28.305088665934473	-15.158274277230232	174010

The desire for intelligent machines remained just an elusive dream until the first computer was developed. When the first computer appeared in the early fifties, we admired it as an artificial brain, and we thought that we are successful in creating a low level decision making cognitive machine. Researchers coined the term Artificial Intelligence (AI) and waited for many potential applications to evolve. Research in AI is directed toward building """" thinking """" machines and improving our understanding of intelligence. As evident, the ultimate achievement in this field would be to mimic or exceed human cognitive capabilities including reasoning, recognition, creativity, emotions, understanding, learning and so on. Even though we are a long way from achieving this, some success has been achieved in mimicking specific areas of human mental activity. Recent research into AI together with other branches of computer science has resulted in the development of several useful intelligent paradigms, which forms the basis of this volume. This volume is focused on some of the recent theoretical developments and its practical applications in engineering, science, business and commerce. The intelligent paradigms can be roughly divided among knowledge-based systems, computational intelligence and hybrid combinations. Knowledge-based systems include expert and rule-based systems, intelligent agents and techniques for handling uncertainty (e.g., fuzzy logic). Computational intelligence includes neural networks, fuzzy inference systems, evolutionary computation and other optimization algorithms, rough sets, probabilistic reasoning and so on. The integration of different learning and adaptation techniques, to overcome individual limitations and achieve synergetic effects through hybridization or fusion of these techniques, has in recent years contributed to a large number of new hybrid system designs. This volume is a rare collection of 18 chapters compiling the latest developments in the state-of-the-art research in intelligent paradigms and some of its practical interesting applications. The chapters are authored by world leading well-established experts in the field. Each chapter focuses on different aspects of intelligent paradigms and is complete by itself. The volume is divided into two parts: """" Theory """" (Chapters 1-9) and """" Applications """" (Chapters 10-18). However, this does not intend to strictly divide the chapters. The theoretic chapters are not limited to theory only; they also illustrate the theory with examples or real-world applications.

And the mappings between these scientific theories and computational systems in their scope are analyzed in terms of suitable specializations of the notions of model of experiment and model of data. Furthermore, the extensively mechanized character of model-based reasoning in model checking is highlighted by a comparison with proof procedures adopted by other formal methods in computer science. Finally, potential epistemic benefits flowing from the application of model checking in other areas of scientific inquiry are emphasized in the context of computer simulation studies of biological information processing.	computation;computer science;computer simulation;formal methods;information processing;model checking;model-based reasoning;theory	Nicola Angius;Guglielmo Tamburrini	2011	Minds and Machines	10.1007/s11023-011-9231-5	computer simulation;philosophy of science;model checking;scientific modelling;information processing;epistemology;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;model-based reasoning;philosophy of computer science;algorithm	AI	-26.952036174901828	-12.586287641167578	174546

However, there is still no agreement on the aspects that should be evaluated to knowwhether a UMV satisfies the degree or level of autonomy expected. This paper reviews current approaches to assess autonomous behavior in UMVs. It also recaps the different development and operation aspects taken into account by researchers and practitioners to evaluate autonomy in unmanned systems from diverse domains. This provides a baseline to study methodologies to assess maritime autonomy so that metrics and assessment criteria can be defined for UMVs. This paper also presents statistical results from a comparison of existing assessment frameworks for autonomy in different domains. Outcomes from this study are critical to devise guidelines for metric autonomy assessment in UMVs. In addition, a discussion on relevant aspects of a autonomy assessment process for UMVs, and future research directions are presented. & 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Instantiating each domain entity with an agent captures many aspects of system dynamics and interactions that other modeling techniques do not. However, an entity's agent can execute only one trajectory per run, and so does not capture the alternative trajectories accessible in the evolution of any realistic system. Averaging over multiple runs does not capture the range of individual interactions. We address these problems with a new modeling construct, the polyagent, which represents each entity with a single persistent avatar supported by a swarm of transient ghosts. Each ghost interacts with the ghosts of other avatars through digital pheromone fields, capturing a wide range of alternative trajectories in a single run of the system that can proceed faster than real time.	instance (computer science);interaction;swarm;system dynamics;systems modeling	H.

A clear account of the ontology of functions and functioning is thus an important desideratum for any top-level ontology intended for application to domains such as engineering or medicine. The benefit of using top-level ontologies in applied ontology can only be realized when each of the categories identified and defined by a top-level ontology is integrated with the others in a coherent fashion. Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) has from the beginning included function as one of its categories, exploiting a version of the etiological account of function that is framed at a level of generality sufficient to accommodate both biological and artifactual functions. This account has been subjected to a series of criticisms and refinements. We here articulate BFO’s account of function, provide some reasons for favoring it over competing views, and defend it against objections.

We present a user study which conceptualises knowledge to be implemented in a rule-based application aiming at supporting situation awareness. Participatory observations were used as a method for extracting operatorspsila knowledge. The result of the user study is in the form of a number of identified rules emerging from organisational factors, group thinking and individual experience. A description of the rule-based prototype is presented a long with the result from the user study. This is also discussed together with the applicability of rule based systems and how to support situation awareness.	experience;logic programming;participatory monitoring;prototype;usability testing;utility	Maria Nilsson;Joeri van Laere;Tom Ziemke;Johan Edlund	2008	2008 11th International Conference on Information Fusion		simulation;engineering;knowledge management;data mining	HCI	-31.282016180616697	-11.451154064351753	175398

01cecdae4ace09bb525aee45fdbd50d6f930695a	a cognitive model of coherence-driven story comprehension	cognitive model	Current models of story comprehension have three major deficiencies: (1) lack of experimental support for the inference processes they involve (e.g. reliance on prediction); (2) indifference to 'kinds' of coherence (e.g. local and global); and (3) inability to find interpretations at variable depths. I propose that comprehension is driven by the need to find a representation that reaches a 'coherence threshold'. Variable inference processes are a reflection of different thresholds, and the skepticism of an individual inference process determines how thresholds are reached. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Recent research in psychology maintains that comprehension is 'explanation-driven' (Graesser et al., 1994) and guided by the 'need for coherence' (van den Broek et al., 1995). The comprehender's goal is construction of a more-orless coherent representation which includes explanations for and relations between the story's eventualities. This representation is generated via inferences, which enrich the representation until it reaches the threshold specified by the comprehender's coherence need (van den Broek et al., 1995). By contrast, early models of comprehension emphasised its expectation-driven nature: prediction of future eventualities, followed by substantiation of these predictions (DeJong, 1979). The inference processes described in these early models are still implemented in many contemporary systems. One problem with these models is their failure to account for experimental evidence about inferences: predictive inferences are not generated at point x in the story, unless strongly supported by the story up to point x (Trabasso and Magliano, 1996); in addition, predictive inferences not immediately confirmed by the story after point x are not incorporated into the representation (Murray et al., 1993). While it is difficult to define 'strong support' or 'confirmation', it is clear that an overly-assumptive model does not reflect mundane comprehension. A second problem is the failure of these models to account for differential establishment of local and global coherence. Local coherence holds between 'short sequences of clauses', while global coherence is measured in terms of 'overarching themes' (Graesser et al., 1994). McKoon and Ratcliff (1992) maintain that only local coherence is normally established during comprehension (the minimalist hypothesis). Others state that readers 'at tempt to construct a meaning representation that is coherent at both local and global levels' (the constructionist hypothesis) (Graesser et al., 1994). Script-based models allow globally-coherent structures to be constructed automatically, contradicting the minimalist hypothesis; the inclusion of promiscuous predictive inferences also contradicts the constructionist hypothesis. A third problem is that previous models deny comprehension's flexibility. This issue is sometimes side-stepped by assuming that comprehension concludes with the instantiation of one or more 'primitive' or 'top-level' patterns. Another approach is to apply lower-level patterns which account for smaller subsets of the input, but the aim is still to connect a story's first eventuality to its last (van den Broek et al., 1995). This paper describes a model which treats inferences as coherence generators, where an inference's occurrence depends on its coherence contribution. Unusual inference-making, establishment of local and global coherence, and variable-precision comprehension can be	cache coherence;cognitive model;coherence (physics);list comprehension;universal instantiation;user story;word lists by frequency	Elliot Smith	1998		10.3115/980691.980819	cognitive model;computer science;artificial intelligence;statistics	NLP	-24.99815451044472	-11.33079775134239	175715

It also plays a critical role in engineering and architectural design. Ferguson (1992), for example, views good engineering largely as an outcome of visual reasoning (and not verbal or mathematical reasoning). Yet, there is much that we do not yet understand about visual reasoning. In fact, at present there is not even a universal agreement in cognitive science on a definition of visual representation or reasoning. The purpose of this symposium is to bring together recent cognitive science research on visual reasoning in modeling and design. Our proposal focuses on visual representations such as sketches, drawings and diagrams. The speakers in the proposed symposium represent multiple disciplines within cognitive science, including artificial intelligence (Cheng, Goel), science education (Clement), cognitive psychology (Hegarty), architecture (Dogan), and philosophy and history of science (Nersessian). Goel will be the moderator for the symposium.

The pervasiveness of technology allows to precisely track human behavior; however, when dealing with the development of an intelligent assistant exploiting data acquired through such technologies, a critical issue has to be taken into account; namely, that of supporting the user in the event of any transgression with respect to the optimal behavior. In this paper we present a reasoning framework based on Simple Temporal Problems that can be applied to a general class of problems, which we called cake&carrot problems, to support reasoning in presence of human transgression. The reasoning framework offers a number of facilities to ensure a smart management of possible """"wrong behaviors"""" by a user to reach the goals defined by the problem. This paper describes the framework by means of the prototypical use case of diet domain. Indeed, following a healthy diet can be a difficult task for both practical and psychological reasons and dietary transgressions are hard to avoid. Therefore, the framework is tolerant to dietary transgressions and adapts the following meals to facilitate users in recovering from such transgressions. Finally, through a simulation involving a real hospital menu, we show that the framework can effectively achieve good results in a realistic scenario."""

To this end we use a spatial, developmental, neuroevolution system presented here for the first time. We use our system to evolve ANNs to perform simple abstractions of cognitive tasks such as size perception, counting color identification and reading. We define these tasks to explore hypotheses about the evolution of counting and the the nature of the Stroop effect. Our results show the versatility of our evolutionary system. We show that we can evolve it to perform a variety of cognitive tasks, and also that evolved networks exhibit interference behavior when dealing with multiple tasks and incongruent data.	cognition;evolutionary computation;interference (communication);neuroevolution	Amit Benbassat;Avishai Henik	2015		10.1145/2739482.2764888	psychology;artificial intelligence;machine learning;communication	HCI	-22.217683088821243	-17.787780014183912	176123

One of the problems in decision making is that the decisions are predictable. In order to address some of these deficiencies, we have developed a computer implementation of Recognition Primed Decision (RPD) making model using Soar cognitive architecture and it is referred to as RPD-Soar agent in this paper. The proposed implementation is evaluated using prototypical scenarios arising in command decision making in tactical situations. Due to the ability of the RPD-Soar agent to mentally simulate applicable courses of action it is possible for the agent to handle new situations very effectively using its prior knowledge. The variability in behavior within an agent is a desirable characteristic. Variability in agents may be produced through randomness but randomness also introduces undesirable behavior. The observed variability in the RPD-Soar agent is due to reasonable but some times sub-optimal choices given to the agent. RPD-Soar agent developed in this paper exhibits the ability to change decision making strategy with experience. And the preliminary results clearly demonstrate the ability of the model to represent human behavior variability within and across individuals.	cognitive architecture;heart rate variability;randomness;simulation;soar (cognitive architecture);spatial variability;synthetic intelligence	Masood Raza;Venkat V.

A course of action (CoA) should be verified and we propose a special tool for recommendation of CoA. Therefore, the pattern recognition method for identification of the decision situation is presented in the paper. The decision situation being identified is a basis for choosing CoA because with each decision situation a few typical CoA frames are connected. There is also a short description of the deterministic simulator, which is described on the basis of combat model, taking into account complimentary processes of firing and movement.

Multiagent systems represent a powerful paradigm of analyzing, projecting, and developing complex systems. One of the main difficulties in modeling a multi-agent system is defining the coordination model, due to the autonomous behavior of the agents. Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOP) have emerged as one of most important formalisms for coordination and distributed problem solving in multi-agent systems and are capable of modeling a large class of real world problems naturally. This work aims to provide an overview and critical review of DCOP, addressing the most popular methods and techniques, the evolution and comparison of algorithms, and future perspectives on this promising research area. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstractions implify behavioral analysis and help focus on dominant system behaviors by defining sets of equivalent behavior types called modes. System behavior evolves in continuous modes with discrete transitions between modes. Subtle interactions between the continuous behaviors and discrete transitions need to be captured by well-defined hybrid modeling and analysis semantics. This paper presents a taxonomy of transition modes, and develops a formal semantics for transition conditions that lead to efficient and physically consistent simulation algorithms for physical systems.	algorithm;dynamical system;interaction;nonlinear system;semantics (computer science);simulation;spatial scale;taxonomy (general)	Pieter J.

In humans and some primates, ToM is fundamental to effective cooperation and competition, and is a key component of high-level cognition. In this paper, we explore the use of evolutionary robotics methods to create a robotic ToM. We use a co-evolutionary setup to evolve controllers that retrospectively explain an observed actor's behavior, and new actions that elicit new and more revealing behaviors. Evolved controllers can then be used to predict, manipulate and exploit the observed actor's behavior for cooperation or competition.

The challenges arise in the areas of system architecture and design, knowledge-base design, decision-making mechanisms, and the distributed virtual environment (DVE) network interface. These challenges are especially significant if the DVE is to be used for training, because accurate training is essential to the ready application of training experience to real-world situations. The project described in this paper was undertaken to improve the quality of threat CGAs in DVEs utilized for aircrew training. In this paper, we describe the system and the reasons for its genesis.

We decompose people movement into global and local, and make a model of each of them. Global movement corresponds to following a route from a current position to a destination. In local movement, a person moves toward the next subgoal while avoiding surrounding persons and obstacles. We also model behavior specific to a cafeteria, such as queuing and searching for unoccupied seats. We implement these simulation algorithms in a simulator RT component, that can be used easily for development of robot motion planners, which are also realized as RT components. Various simulation experiments show the effectiveness of the simulation algorithms and the simulator RT component.	algorithm;experiment;simulation	Atsushi Shigemura;Yuki Ishikawa;Jun Miura;Junji Satake	2012	JRM	10.20965/jrm.2012.p0165	computer vision;real-time computing;simulation;computer science	Robotics	-19.5184993325547	-22.18830904251934	176930

The first contribution relates to quantitative cognitics, an approach which helps in analyzing complex situations and in designing advanced systems involving cognition, such as cooperating robots. Cognitive systems usually feature a hierarchy of subsystems. For humans, as for autonomous, cooperating robots, the functions of perception, decision, or in a more refined fashion yet, vision or trajectory planning, are good examples of (sub-) processes and tasks, which can be addressed per se, in specific subsystems. In particular, vocal communication is discussed below, as instance of a very stochastic process. For such cases, the probability of error is to be taken into account for the relevant assessment of knowledge quantities. The second contribution relates to a critical feature: relative agility of control elements. For complex cases, where many resources are necessary (e.g. groups of robots), a multi-agent structure may be useful, but then interactions occur and this involves loops, where information flows, and consequently stability becomes increasingly of concern. Several elements of solutions are proposed.	requirement;robot	Jean-Daniel Dessimoz;Pierre-François Gauthey	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-03558-6_15	simulation	Robotics	-21.357467409271212	-13.100980023307876	177180

Therefore, CBR can be seen as a method for problem solving, and also as a method to capture new experience and make it immediately available for problem solving. The CBR paradigm has been originally introduced by the cognitive science community. The CBR community aims to develop computer models that follow this cognitive process. Up to now many successful computer systems have been established on the CBR paradigm for a wide range of real-world problems. We will review in this paper the CBR process and the main topics within the CBR work. Hereby we try bridging between the concepts developed within the CBR community and the statistics community. The CBR topics we describe are: similarity, memory organization, CBR learning, and case-base maintenance. The incremental aspect arising with the CBR paradigm will be considered as well as the life-time aspect of a CBR system. We will point out open problems within CBR that need to be solved. Finally we show on application how the CBR paradigm can be applied. The applications we are focusing on are meta-learning for parameter selection in technical systems, image interpretation, incremental prototype-based classification and novelty detection and handling. Finally, we summarize our concept on CBR.	artificial intelligence;bridging (networking);case-based reasoning;cognition;cognitive science;computer simulation;database;document retrieval;e-commerce;extrapolation;geographic information system;graph coloring;machine learning;memory organisation;novelty detection;pattern recognition;problem solving;programming paradigm;prototype;software quality;usability	Petra Perner	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-02309-0_2	case-based reasoning;machine learning;artificial intelligence;computer science	AI	-27.505505053580677	-9.9966943540041	177326

Trends in the oil and gas industry to improve safety and efficiency and reduce environmental impact suggest the use of industrial robotics. New developments in regions difficult or dangerous for humans to work in could be enabled with maintenance, inspection and repairs carried out by remotely-controlled industrial robots. This new application area highlights some difficulties with today's robots, as they do not adapt well to dynamic environments, do not offer rich human-robot interaction and are not simple for end-users to program. In addition, the oil and gas context presents a challenging work environment for robots as they are exposed to variable and often extreme weather and need to be safe for use alongside explosive hydrocarbons. As robots are introduced, issues of trust and accountability come to the fore as well as how they fit into organisational structures. If robots have too little autonomy, human operators will waste time attending to robots instead of attending to their work tasks. If robots are highly autonomous, situational awareness of plant activity is diminished. A balance needs to be struck to find a level of autonomy suitable for the task, the realistic capabilities of the automation, and the need to actively engage human operators in a constructive fashion. These issues also relate to what form the interface takes for remote or co-located robot control, as well as how information and activity is represented for remote operators. The contribution of this paper is a discussion of issues relating to human-robot interaction for future industrial robotics, in particular for the oil and gas industry	autonomous robot;autonomy;human–robot interaction;industrial robot;robot control;robotics	Clint Heyer	2010	2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2010.5651294	human–robot interaction;simulation;computer science;petroleum industry;engineering;artificial intelligence;aisoy1;manufacturing engineering;mechanical engineering	Robotics	-25.897804212763475	-23.154228796850617	177794

This definition is intended to have relevance beyond the realm of digital computers, particularly vis-à-vis natural systems. This will be done by using an extension of a phase transition coefficient previously defined in an attempt to characterise the dynamical behaviour of cellular automata and other systems. The transition coefficient measures the sensitivity of a system to external stimuli, and will be used to define the susceptibility of a system to being (efficiently) programmed.	automata theory;cellular automaton;coefficient;computation;computer;dynamical system;relevance;visual instruction set	Hector Zenil	2012	CoRR		phase transition;cellular automaton;computation;theoretical computer science;natural computing;computer science	NLP	-25.981982778099493	-13.594349129876523	178569

In ubiquitous computing environments like smart home, agents have to learn user's preferences in order to assist them. These preferences are represented by user profiles. Our proposed UT-AGENT uses case-based reasoning (CBR) to acquire knowledge about user actions that are worth recording to determine their preferences and Bayesian network (BN) as an inference tool to model relationships between them. UT-AGENT maintains the status of every device present in the home and activates them as per user preference.

However, in dynamic systems, the existence of such an ontology is unrealistic and its maintenance is cumbersome. Burden of maintaining a common ontology can be alleviated by enabling agents to evolve their ontologies personally. However, with different ontologies, agents are likely to run into communication problems since their vocabularies are different from each other. Therefore, to achieve personalized ontologies, agents must have a means to understand the concepts used by others. Consequently, this paper proposes an approach that enables agents to teach each other concepts from their ontologies using examples. Unlike other concept learning approaches, our approach enables the learner to elicit most informative examples interactively from the teacher. Hence, the learner participates to the learning process actively. We empirically compare the proposed approach with the previous concept learning approaches. Our experiments show that using the proposed approach, agents can learn new concepts successfully and with fewer examples.	concept learning;ontology (information science)	Murat Sensoy;Pinar Yolum	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03603-3_13	concept learning;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;dynamical system;machine learning;data mining;active learning	NLP	-20.490402221468223	-10.213010237330232	178580

c1802c8157d18e7461ffac576428f05f0b4d746e	on effective causal learning		We have developed a framework for identifying causal relationships between events which are effective in the sense that they can be put to practical use, without regard to what the “true” causes really are. A rapid causal learning process is devised for temporally correlated events that can be observed proximally which is sufficient for the learning of many causalities involving basic physical and social phenomena. The system relies on a diachronic aspect of causes which is a characterization of consistent temporally correlated events and a synchronic aspect of causes which is a characterization of the contextual factors that enable the diachronic causal relations. The causal learning method is applied to some problem solving situations that allows some basic knowledge to be learned rapidly and that results in drastic reductions of the search space and amount of computation involved. This method is necessary to jump start the chain of causal learning processes that allow more complex and intricate causal relationships to be learned based on earlier knowledge.	causal filter;causal system;causality;computation;problem solving;synchronicity	Seng-Beng Ho	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-09274-4_5	causal model	AI	-22.999295556030436	-13.617392525559145	179591

People cannot stop or start instantaneously and their movements reflect an attention to balance as well as other environment-driven goals. This work seeks to fill the void between full-scale, computationally expensive models of articulated human motion and simplified particle/cell models used in many multiagent simulations. Comparison of our pedestrian model results with those published elsewhere reveals that this work preserves phenomena like self-organization, lane formation, and semi-circular crowding at exits [Helbing et al. 2002]. Furthermore, our pedestrian model enables novel behaviors such as tripping, stumbling, and falling which permit animating more extreme scenarios; for example, earthquakes, where translational forces significantly affect pedestrian and crowd dynamics.	agent-based model;analysis of algorithms;crowd simulation;crowding;dirk helbing;full scale;kinesiology;self-organization;semiconductor industry;stumbleupon;the void (virtual reality);virtual reality	Ori P.

4b935dc4d3dc87169c5459f4803707b6656f9166	intelligent robotics systems - sirs '94		From July 11 to 15 1994, the Second International Symposium on Intelligent Robotics Systems, (SIRS '94) was held in Grenoble France. In addition to a spectacular fireworks display on the 14th of July, this symposium featured 30 presentations on techniques for perception and navigation for autonomous mobile robots. On the last day of the symposium, participants were asked to nominate nine papers for a special issue of Robotics and Autonomous Systems. The results are the ten papers presented in this special issue. As with SIRS '93, a major issue which appeared throughout the symposium was the problem of defining the transformations from perception to action. Two opposing viewpoints were evident in the presentations. One approach seeks to treat control a,; an engineering science, by developing the modeling tools which permit an engineer to hand-craft the appropriate control laws. I will refer to this as an engineering approach. The alternative view is that the required models for real sensors and real mobile robots are too complex. In this case, robust control requires training. Most authors who favour this approach investigate various forms of neural (or connectionists) techniques for learning the transformations from perception to action.

Web publishers today use this technology to share information about the websites a user has visited, making it possible to target advertisements to users based on their prior history. This begs the question: do publishers (who are competitors for advertising money) always have the incentive to share online information? Intuitive arguments as well as anecdotal evidence suggest that sometimes a premium publisher might suffer information sharing through an effect called information leakage: by sharing user information with the advertiser, the advertiser will be able to target the same user elsewhere on cheaper publishers, leading to a dilution of the value of the supply on the premium publishers.  The goal of this article is to explore this aspect of online information sharing. We show that, when advertisers are homogeneous in the sense that their relative valuations of users are consistent, publishers always agree about the benefits of cookie matching in equilibrium: either all publishers’ revenues benefit, or all suffer, from cookie matching. We also show using a simple model that, when advertisers are not homogeneous, the information leakage indeed can occur, with cookie matching helping one publisher’s revenues while harming the other.	http cookie;information leakage;online advertising;spectral leakage	Arpita Ghosh;Mohammad Mahdian;R.

c20fa477d0e9dc7314955fcc94bbbf64fc36e50f	computational machines in a coexistence with concrete universals and data streams		We discuss that how the majority of traditional modeling approaches are following the idealism point of view in scientific modeling, which follow the set theoretical notions of models based on abstract universals. We show that while successful in many classical modeling domains, there are fundamental limits to the application of set theoretical models in dealing with complex systems with many potential aspects or properties depending on the perspectives. As an alternative to abstract universals, we propose a conceptual modeling framework based on concrete universals that can be interpreted as a category theoretical approach to modeling. We call this modeling framework pre-specific modeling. We further, discuss how a certain group of mathematical and computational methods, along with ever-growing data streams are able to operationalize the concept of prespecific modeling. 1. How to Approach the Notion of Scientific Modeling? Modeling paradigms, as a necessary element of any scientific investigation, act like pairs of glasses, which impact the way in which we encode (conceive of) the real world. Therefore, any kind of intervention in real world phenomena is affected by the chosen modeling paradigm and the real phenomena under investigation. In the domain of urbanism and urban design, cities as complex and open environments with dynamic and multidimensional aspects are challenging cases for modeling scholars, as there are many distinct urban phenomena. Figure 1 shows a list of different functional aspects of urban phenomena in an indexical manner. Figure 1. Different functional aspects of urban phenomena In addition to the diversity of urban problems, there is a huge variety of competing paradigms for analyzing cities: the city as an ecological phenomena that is optimally adjusted to an environment (economic, political, cultural) assumed to be “natural” for it; the city as a thermodynamic system that needs to be balanced and which can be controlled; the city as a grammatical text with its own “syntactical laws”; the city as a biological organism following fractal growth patterns. Further, historical perspective provide additional city models such as the City of Faith, the City as Machine, or the Organic City, and especially, since the advent of computers from the second half of the twentieth century, city as information. Although comparing to classical science and its engineering disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry and Mechanics, urban design, planning and modeling is a rather young discipline, when one does a quick search of the keywords central to this field, one is quickly confused by the number of approaches and the variety of practical problems within the reaches of the discipline. For example, A. G. Wilson’s five volume text on urban modeling is over 2,600 pages long. A broad range of casebased canonization has thus emerged, and applied techniques are developed for specific urban functions such as urban land use, urban transportation, urban economy, urban social patterns, and so on. As a result, the lack of a more abstract categorization of applied techniques makes comparison between them very hard. Beginning in mid-twentieth century, General Systems Theory emerged as one of the main theories for working toward unification of different disciplinary modeling practices. In principle, the underlying idea of systems theory is the promotion of a unified view to modernist-reductionist science, which was diversified around a variety of application and functional domains. Although, interdisciplinary collaborations such as making analogies within disciplines, (e.g., hydraulic theories to describe biological systems) was not new, systems theory’s formalization, as an orthogonal view to classically diversified scientific and practical problems, reached to a point in which, according to George Klir, systemic tasks such as modeling, optimization, and simulation have emerged as distinct scientific disciplines. However, taking systems theory as a body of knowledge (rather than a specific and singular theory), one could expect a gradual divergence of its methods, starting from its unified principles. The advent of computational methods by Alan Turing in 1940s and later the democratization of computational methods in 1980s created a new diversified landscape of system modeling approaches. As a result, after fifty years we encounter a competitive ecosystem of different modeling species with different capacities and trade-offs. Figure 2 shows a list of different modeling methodologies in an indexical manner. Figure 2. Competitive ecosystem of different modeling methodologies. Therefore, the first motivation of this present essay is to find a unifying (abstract) perspective for assessment of different (inter-disciplinary) modeling approaches, while keeping the diversities. We think toward this aim we need to investigate the mathematical and philosophical grounds of scientific modeling. 2. Formal Definitions and Categories of Scientific Modeling Because there is such a wide variety of modeling approaches in different scientific domains, formalizing and theorizing the practice of scientific modeling is an active research area in philosophy of science. For example, according to Roman Frigg and Stephen Hartmann, there exist the following types of models: Probing models, phenomenological models, computational models, developmental models, explanatory models, impoverished models, testing models, idealized models, theoretical models, scale models, heuristic models, caricature models, didactic models, fantasy models, toy models, imaginary models, mathematical models, substitute models, iconic models, formal models, analogue models and instrumental models are but some of the notions that are used to categorize models. Nevertheless, these categories are not still abstract enough, but rather labels for different (not necessarily exclusive) modeling approaches. To better understand of models, one can look at the interpretation of their roles and functions, and to distinguish the presets on which the different points of view are based. One of the main issues by which models have been extensively discussed is the relation between models and the way of representation of real phenomena under study (the target system). According to Frigg and Hartmann, from a representational point of view there are “models of phenomena” and “models of data” and within these categories there are subcategories such as “scale models,” “idealized models,” “analogical models,” like the hydraulic model of an economic system, which are further divided to material analogy, where there is a direct similarity between the properties (or relations between properties) of two phenomena, and formal analogy, where two systems are based similarly on a formalization such as having the same mathematical equations that describe both systems. (Hesse 1963). Further, one can refer to phenomenological models, which are focused on the behavior of the particular phenomena under investigation rather than on underlying causes and mechanisms. Further, there are models of theories, like the dynamic model of the pendulum, which is based on Newtonian laws of motion. Models can also be divided into ontological classes like physical objects, fictional objects, set-theoretic structures, descriptions, and equations. However, these categories of models and modeling approaches overlap and they are rather descriptive and neutral classifications than critical. They do not give us a measure or a gauge to compare different modeling approaches in terms of their capacities and their limits in dealing with different levels of complexity in real world problems. In this essay I am looking for a way to condition modeling approaches in different levels of complexity to examine their theoretical capacities. Among the above-mentioned categories, the crucial, but somewhat commonly accepted shared property of the majority of traditional scientific modeling approaches is that they are all based on some sorts of idealization. In what follows, I explain different aspects of idealization in scientific modeling and, following the issues of idealizations, directs us to the problem of universals, which is an old philosophical issue. 3. Idealization in Scientific Modeling In the context of philosophy of science, idealization in modeling has been discussed extensively. In principle, idealization is considered to be equal to an intended (over) simplification in the representation of the target system. Although there are different ways of explaining or defining the notion of idealization, Michael Wiseberg discusses three kinds of idealization that we refer to in this work: minimalist idealization, Galilean idealization, and multiple-model idealization. Minimalist idealization is the practice of building models of real world phenomena by focusing only on main causal factors. Therefore, as is inferred from its name, minimalist models usually end to very simple elements that are informative enough for further decision-making. For example, the aim in domain of networks analytics is to explain complex behaviors that happen in the real phenomena by means of network properties such as centrality measures, integration, closeness, between-ness, etc. As an example, in urban theory, in the city science approach or urban scaling laws the final goal is to find a few main informative factors in cities such as city size or population in order to explain other aspects of cities such as energy consumption in a linear equation. Even though it seems obvious that cities are complex phenomena with many observable aspects and many exceptions, minimalist models attract attention exactly because they identify and state very general rules.

Agents are supposed to be aware of the environmental structure, but they should also be aware of the level of congestion, at least for the gateways that are immediately in sight. This paper presents the tactical level component of a hybrid agent architecture in which these decisions are enacted at the operational level by mean of a floor-field based model, in a discrete simulation approach. The described model allows the agent taking decisions based on a static a-priori knowledge of the environment and dynamic perceivable information on the current level of crowdedness of visible path alternatives.	simulation	Luca Crociani;Andrea Piazzoni;Giuseppe Vizzari;Stefania Bandini	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-24309-2_5	simulation;computer science;operations research	AI	-19.63838322169056	-22.231392154457836	180810

In terms of mechanistic explanations, it critiques various existing views, especially those embodied by existing computational cognitive models. In this regard, the paper argues in favor of the explanation based on the distinction between localist (symbolic) representation and distributed representation (as formulated in the connectionist literature), which reduces the phenomenological difference to a mechanistic difference. Furthermore, to establish a teleological explanation of consciousness, the paper discusses the issue of the functional role of consciousness on the basis of the aforementioned mechanistic explanation. A proposal based on synergistic interaction between the conscious and the unconscious is advanced that encompasses various existing views concerning the functional role of consciousness. This two-step deepening explanation has some empirical support, in the form of a cognitive model and various cognitive data that it captures.	computation;consciousness	Ron Sun	2001	Cognitive Systems Research	10.1016/S1389-0417(00)00013-9	psychology;cognitive psychology;cognitive model;cognition;qualia;reduction;teleology;epistemology;computer science;artificial intelligence;consciousness;computation;social psychology;cognitive science	AI	-25.251840955014337	-14.29472930652741	180891

In support of this need, the military requires a responsive family of Models, Methods, and Tools (MMT) able to credibly represent US and Coalition ground forces conducting operations in a Joint and Combined IW environment, from the tactical to strategic levels. As a first step in this direction, Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center (TRAC) Monterey (TRAC-MTRY) is developing a prototype capability that credibly represents ground forces conducting IW operations and focusing on the relevant relationships and interactions within the population. A primary objective of this work-in-progress is a repeatable approach for validating cultural behavior models, including risk measures and criteria for assessing risk using the Cultural Geography (CG) model as a vehicle for the method's implementation.

Second, we show that the application of logical reasoning can be both necessary and relatively simple. Finally, we argue that the evidence for a logical reasoning system that co-exists with simpler heuristic forms of thinking is overwhelming. Not only is it implausible a priori that we would have evolved such a system that is of no use to us, but extensive evidence from the literature on dual processing in reasoning and judgement shows that many problems can only be solved when this form of reasoning is used to inhibit and override heuristic thinking.	brevundimonas sp. shira 15-11-1;cognition disorders;dual;emoticon;fuzzy logic;judgment;literature;proprietary name;published comment;reasoning - publishing subsection;reasoning system;sampling (signal processing);shiira;trees (plant);interest	Jonathan St. B.

The design is unique in treating teams as composable objects, in being scale-free, in relying on configuration and inference (not hard-coding), and in treating participant behaviors as sensory input.	crowdsourcing	Brent D.

Each visit is evoked by one’s motivation to engage in some kind of activity at a certain location. By means of modeling the pedestrians’ interests in locations with the aid of computer simulations, it is possible to forecast the occupancy at locations by utilizing sophisticated pedestrian destination choice models. In the field of pedestrian dynamics research, location preference modeling is not common, but it is all the more rare to include a psychological grounding into such choice models. Here we show that our psychologically inspired and mathematically defined model to describe pedestrians’ interests in locations is able to improve the exactness of pedestrian destination choice models. The interest function model is based on the psychological concept of goal-related memory accessibility and on fundamental coherences found in pedestrian-related data that is measurable at locations. We validated the interest function model and our results provide evidence that our approach improves the simulation fidelity regarding occupancy forecasting. Because the interest concept is designed as a framework that can be coupled to existing microscopic pedestrian simulators, it can be used in most pedestrian destination choice models to describe pedestrian visiting preferences. Consequently, the reliability of the occupancy predictions of pedestrian simulations can be enhanced by integrating the interest function model into choices models.	accessibility;computer simulation;function model	Peter M.

Many recent studies have highlighted the factors and the small sets of parameters that play a role when a large crowd interacts with an organization. However, no comprehensive simulation has yet been developed to incorporate all these parameters, investigate Artificial Life phenomena such as emergence and self-organization and potentially generate predictive power. Based on a presentation at ALIFE XII, this paper describes the development of a simulator for human crowds performing collective problem solving in a Crowdsourcing scenario. It details the mechanics of a multi-agent system (MAS) by building on insights from empirical science in several disciplines. The simulator allows running sensitivity analyses of multiple parameters as well as simulation of intractable interactions of complex networks of irrational agents. In addition, the paper provides a review of Crowdsourcing and human collective intelligence literature structured from an Alife point-of-view.	artificial life;biological system;collective intelligence;complex network;crowdsourcing;emergence;interaction;internet;multi-agent system;organizing (structure);problem solving;real life;self-organization;simulation;wikipedia	Thierry Bücheler;Rocky Lonigro;Rudolf M.

We present a computational model for creating an emotional memory and an algorithm for decision making based on the collected information in the memory. We concentrate on simulating human behaviour as there is not always one perfect way to reach a goal but alternatives that are more advantageous. For evaluation purposes a gambling task, performed by real subjects, was created for the modelled agent.

fea861d6560483ee4460a86c9276f2f7f95de2d9	predicate learning in neural systems: discovering latent generative structures		Humans learn complex latent structures from their environments (e.g., natural language, mathematics, music, social hierarchies). In cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience, models that infer higher-order structures from sensory or first-order representations have been proposed to account for the complexity and flexibility of human behavior. But how do the structures that these models invoke arise in neural systems in the first place? To answer this question, we explain how a system can learn latent representational structures (i.e., predicates) from experience with wholly unstructured data. During the process of predicate learning, an artificial neural network exploits the naturally occurring dynamic properties of distributed computing across neuronal assemblies in order to learn predicates, but also to combine them compositionally, two computational aspects which appear to be necessary for human behavior as per formal theories in multiple domains. We describe how predicates can be combined generatively using neural oscillations to achieve human-like extrapolation and compositionality in an artificial neural network. The ability to learn predicates from experience, to represent structures compositionally, and to extrapolate to unseen data offers an inroads to understanding and modeling the most complex human behaviors.	artificial neural network;cognitive science;computation;computational neuroscience;distributed computing;experience;extrapolation;first-order predicate;generative model;humans;natural language;neural oscillation;theory	Andrea E.

f92f12af008420a2177555ba2c65d5b228e801a8	customer experience management architecture for enhancing corporate customer centric capabilities		The paper reports results of theoretical research aimed at devising methods for representation of experience in computer systems for the purpose of implementing Customer Experience Management (CEM) systems. The paper introduces a novel architecture for modelling customer experience with respect to company, brand, product and its relation to consumer decisions. A process for customer experience approximation is proposed and links to customer decision making are mapped. Experience gaining by a customer has been modelled as a learning process which opens up the way for applying various machine learning algorithms to customer experience emulation. Each customer is represented as an intelligent agent, which reflects the distributed nature of the problem and allows for autonomy of its elements. It is shown how the architecture can be utilised with existing resources e.g. Customer Relationship Management systems as a source of data for CEM. 1 Background and research problem The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework for representing the experience of a consumer that could be applied in computer systems supporting the management method and marketing concept known as Customer Experience Management (CEM). CEM is currently an intensively discussed topic in management science [18], [19], [17] and has recently attracted significant attention form the B/OSS (Business/Operations Support Systems) manufacturers. Capturing, measuring and representation of customer experience in artificial systems remains one of the key challenges faced by CEM system architects. Schmitt introduced the concept of Customer Experience Management by which he popularised the approach to customer relations and loyalty management, but also strategic marketing at large, to which customer experiences are of central significance [10]. The important contribution of Schmitt was the observation and emphasis on that customer experience should not only be measured by customer satisfaction linked to functional aspects of product or services but also to customer emotions, and social fulfilment derived from the consumption. Still, he provides little insight in qualitative and quantitative character of the experience, which is critical if his approach is to be of any use for commercial IT systems. In [4] we have defined the experience as remembered states of mind resulting from appreciation of stimulus events that determine generically any human behaviour, consumer decisions in particular. In case of a consumer decision, customer experience can be modelled as a set of learned concepts about an object of consumption (brand, product, service, provider, etc.), emotionally marked, and internalised by a given customer. It has been proposed to look at experience gaining as a learning process, and treat transactions and consumption related events as training examples. Here we will further develop this idea and propose how it could be addressed in more formal terms. We see potential in applying Schmitt approach in AI enabled CEM support systems, in particular the use of machine learning theory for modelling customer experience to support planning and executing marketing strategies that would aim at optimising customer experience either via adapting the offer to it, or teaching the customers the relevant concepts. 2 Customer knowledge, experience and intentionality The study of human experience, either in the context of consumer behaviour or any other, is intrinsically related to the study of human consciousness and in particular intentionality of human mind. Though a comprehensive discussion on the implications of philosophy of mind on customer experience management does not fit in the scope of this paper, it is important to outline the philosophical stance that constitutes epistemic underpinnings for formalisms introduced in the paper. This philosophical stance has been developed by Searle [11] [12] [13]. As mentioned earlier in the widest sense we define experience as remembered states of mind. This entails certain qualities of experience which relate to the qualities of human consciousness, of which the most important are dependability on memory and its volatility (temporal dimension of experience), emotional value (emotional dimension of experience), integrity and intentionality. The last two qualities may require further explanations. Integrity of human consciousness embraces two important characteristics of human experience. Firstly the fact that at a given moment our cautious appreciation of the surrounding world is unitary in the sense that different stimuli we receive at the same time are converted into single experiential states. Secondly, these unitary states follow and relate to one another creating thus a coherent flow of experience in the sense that one experiential state comes for the previous one and turns into the following one. Integrity of human consciousness allows to model experience as a learning process where events (stimulus events) serve as training examples, because it justifies the casual relationship between past events and current experience. Intentionality of human mind in turn, as defined by Searle [11], embraces the phenomenon that the mind always relates to external world, always is directed at or about something. This aboutness allows to represent experience by means of formal logics. Intentional states typically have a structure such that they are composed of two main elements: psychological mode (S) and propositional content (p): S(p), for instance: Hate (I wake up in the morning). The main consequence of this is that human experience, therefore customer experience as well, can be comprehensively represented in artificial systems by means of first order logic. Importantly, representation of intentional states with logical propositions leaves out the emotional content of conscious experience. We propose that this can be compensated by attaching a variable to the intentional state which would represent the emotional value (in terms of intensity and valence) of the given state as experienced and remembered by an experiencing agent. 3 Customer experience and consumer decisions The reason why we concentrate on experience is because of its significance to the human decision making, in particular we are interested in what is customer experience, how to model and measure it and how does it influence customer decisions. A CEM system would bring real value to its users only if it succeeds in mapping the relations between customer experience and purchase decisions. Importantly, the overview of CEM and CRM solutions currently available on the market reveals that ’customer experience’ has become a widely misused buzzword, often confused with GUI usability or service quality. We understand customer experience more widely, as the part of customer’s knowledge and remembered emotional states, that relate, directly or indirectly, to consumption of a given product or service, and we are interested in how this phenomena can be represented in artificial systems and used for supporting customer relationship management and marketing activities. Let us consider then the nature of consumer decisions in the context of a CEM system. Consumer decision is a special case of a decision, which in general terms is defined on the grounds of decision theory (e.g. [3]) as choice between available alternative ways of conduct and acting upon it. This therefore requires an intentional state of the agent that is followed by the action, so internally accepting that an agent wants to do something and eventually does it. A consumer decision therefore would always be about whether an agent wants to consider to buy anything in first place, then which of the available offers it will decide to accept and eventually purchase. The moment when the decision can be considered made is when an agent makes a legally binding commitment to purchase the offer. Consequently this decision is a two step process. Firstly an offer must match an intentional state of an agent that is a desire or commitment that fits the offer, we would say in such a case that an agent has a need corresponding to the offer. Secondly, an agent will consider alternative options available to him that fit the set of desire or commitment type of intentional states constituting the need as to assess which of these options would fit it best. At each of these steps an agent engages in what is called rational deliberation. Searle [13] points out that rational deliberation consists in appraising the motivators (desires or commitments) for their validity and for conflicts between motivators, and appraising the effectors and constitutors (the available optional offers) in such a way as to bring about the maximum satisfaction of the motivators with the least expenditure of other motivators in satisfying the effectors and constitutors. From perspective of CEM or any other system supporting the customer relationship management the following questions are of primary importance: 1. How a customer would respond to an offer 2. What is the best moment to present an offer to a customer 3. How to shape the offer to make it fit with desires or commitments (the need) of a customer 4. How to influence customer’s experience to provoke desires or commitments corresponding to the presented offer 5. How to influence a customer’s experience to make him choose the presented offer from all others satisfying the need. To be able to answer these questions a CEM system requires a reasoner emulating the decision process per each customer.

d4f67238c0916553af52f5bad750bee094c1acaf	concept hierarchy memory model: a neural architecture for conceptual knowledge representation, learning, and commonsense reasoning		This article introduces a neural network based cognitive architecture termed Concept Hierarchy Memory Model (CHMM) for conceptual knowledge representation and commonsense reasoning. CHMM is composed of two subnetworks: a Concept Formation Network (CFN), that acquires concepts based on their sensory representations; and a Concept Hierarchy Network (CHN), that encodes hierarchical relationships between concepts. Based on Adaptive Resonance Associative Map (ARAM), a supervised Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) model, CHMM provides a systematic treatment for concept formation and organization of a concept hierarchy. Specifically, a concept can be learned by sampling activities across multiple sensory fields. By chunking relations between concepts as cognitive codes, a concept hierarchy can be learned/modified through experience. Also, fuzzy relations between concepts can now be represented in terms of the weights on the links connecting them. Using a unified inferencing mechanism based on code firing, CHMM performs an important class of commonsense reasoning, including concept recognition and property inheritance.	adaptive resonance theory;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;canadian football network;code;cognitive architecture;commonsense reasoning;concept formation;immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif;knowledge representation and reasoning;memory model (programming);multiple inheritance;reasoning - publishing subsection;sampling (signal processing);shallow parsing;weight	Ah-Hwee Tan;Hui-Shin Vivien Soon	1996	International journal of neural systems	10.1142/S0129065796000270	natural language processing;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics	AI	-26.57456583595554	-16.57586847488584	183956

A subset of commonsense describing causality, such as the sentence “a consequence of drinking alcohol is intoxication,” is selected from the ontology of the Open Mind Commonsense Knowledge Base (Singh, 2002). Binary causal relations are extracted from these sentences and stored as crude trans-frames (Minsky, 1988). By performing fuzzy, creativity-driven inference over these frames, creative “causal chains” are produced for use in story generation. The current system has mostly local pair-wise constraints between steps in the story, though global constraints such as narrative structure are being added. Our motivation for this project stems from two questions: Can a large-scale knowledge base of commonsense benefit the artificial intelligence community by supplying new knowledge and methods to tackle difficult AI problems? And given that full commonsense reasoning has yet to mature, can we demonstrate any success with a more “fail-soft” approach? We picked story generation because we feel it is a classic AI problem that can be approached with a creative use of commonsense knowledge. Compared to problem solving or question answering, story generation is a “softer” problem where there is no wrong solution per se, and that solution is evaluated subjectively. This paper is organized as follows. In the first section we frame our approach in the context of previous work in story generation. In the second section, we present the system’s representation of commonsense and techniques for fuzzy, creativity-driven inference. The third section presents an overview of the story generation architecture of MAKEBELIEVE. We conclude with an evaluation of the system followed by some discussion.	artificial intelligence;causality;commonsense knowledge (artificial intelligence);commonsense reasoning;interactive storytelling;knowledge base;open mind common sense;problem solving;question answering;source-to-source compiler	Hugo Liu;Push Singh	2002			natural language processing;legal expert system;knowledge base;commonsense reasoning;question answering;html;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;model-based reasoning;data mining;commonsense knowledge;ai-complete;narrative structure	AI	-32.28612518977056	-12.07690882827346	184597

While we believe such connections are an important piece in the puzzle of meaning, we argue that perceptual grounding alone does not suffice to explain the specific, stable meanings human speakers attribute to each other. Instead, human attributions of meaning depend on a process of societal grounding by which individual language speakers coordinate their perceptual experience and linguistic usage with other members of their linguistic communities. For system builders, this suggests that implementing a strategy of societal grounding would justify the attribution of bona fide linguistic meaning to a system even if it had little perceptual experience and only modest perceptual accuracy. We illustrate the importance and role of societal grounding using an implemented dialogue system that collaboratively identifies visual objects with human users.	agent-based model;arbiter (electronics);correctness (computer science);dialog system;interaction;judgment (mathematical logic);perceptual computing;simulation;systems design;visual objects	David DeVault;Iris Oved;Matthew Stone	2006			artificial intelligence	AI	-27.830103859228522	-17.9733264962003	184684

Anokhin's theory of functional systems. We propose the animat control system that consists of a set of functional systems (FSs) and enables predictive and purposeful behavior. Each FS consists of two neural networks: the Actor and the Model. The Actors are intended to form chains of actions and the Models are intended to predict futures events. There are primary and secondary repertoires of behaviors: the primary repertoire is formed by evolution; the secondary repertoire is formed by means of learning. The paper describes both principles of the Animat Brain operation and the particular model of predictive behavior in cellular landmark environment.	action potential;action selection;animat;artificial neural network;control system;futures and promises;risk management;simulation;systems theory	Vladimir G.

In domains where time and resources are limited, the ability to balance resource consumption according to the problem characteristics and to the required solution quality is a crucial aspect of intelligent behavior. Growing evidence indicates that emotional phenomena may play an important role in that balance. To support this view we propose an agent model where emotion and reasoning are conceived as two symbiotically integrated aspects of cognitive processing. In this paper we concretize this view by extending emotionbased regulation of cognitive activity to enable an active control of the abstraction level at which cognitive processes operate through emotion-based attention mechanisms, thus allowing a dynamical adjustment of the resources used. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the proposed approach and to evaluate its effectiveness in a scenario where reasoning under time-limited conditions in a dynamic environment is required.

Context has many definitions such as additional information that further describes a given situation. However, the definition of context is very contentious – what is considered context in one system may be considered unimportant in another. In this paper, we focus on the ability of context-aware systems to respond to external events, in particular incoming hurricanes, in an appropriate, authorised and regular manner. Hurricanes are often problematic in that they may be difficult to predict, in terms of direction and intensity, and require immediate and appropriate responses. We look at how this system will respond to an authorised set of stimuli using a pre-defined sequence and set of behavioural rules. The response produced by the system will be appropriate depending on the context of the stimuli received. © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

b15abf17e9fb676f42af589a9e7ac73ecb105e76	a gpu-assisted hybrid model for real-time crowd simulations	real time crowd simulation	In this paper, we propose two new techniques for real-time crowd simulations; the first one is the clustering of agents on the GPU and the second one is incorporating the global cluster information into the existing microscopic navigation technique. The proposed model combines the agent-based models with macroscopic information (agent clusters) into a single framework. The global cluster information is determined on the GPU, and based on the agents' positions and velocities. Then, this information is used as input for the existing agent-based models (velocity obstacles, rule-based steering and social forces). The proposed hybrid model not only considers the nearby agents but also the distant agent configurations. Our test scenarios indicate that, in very dense circumstances, agents that use the proposed hybrid model navigate the environment with actual speeds closer to their intended speeds (less stuck) than the agents that are using only the agent-based models. & 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Autonomy in such settings implies rational actions in unforeseen surroundings where one system may have to interact with a varying number and various types of systems at different times. In order to adapt adequately and effectively to new situations, a system should dynamically become knowledgeable of a selected number of systems in its surroundings. For this purpose, it has to find those systems that are relevant to it, that is, those that may support or hinder it in achieving its goals, and those that may require its support. The factors influencing the search for and discovery of relevant systems are specified, and the reasoning and decision processes involved are described. >	autonomous agent;autonomous robot	Afsaneh Haddadi;Kurt Sundermeyer	1993		10.1109/ISADS.1993.262709	simulation;intelligent decision support system;system of systems;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;autonomous agent	AI	-19.968058036420402	-10.980239696136895	185706

In all cases, be it navigational or non-navigational tasks, the robot control mechanisms share fundamental properties:           •       they exploit an internal mapping between “world space” and “map space” (the cognitive map),          •       they acquire maps through learning, rather than using pre-installed maps, and          •       they use these maps for a broad range of tasks, rather than narrowly defined ones.                    In other words, this chapter presents evidence for a convergence towards one common underlying mechanism over a broad spectrum  of mobile robot control architectures.      	cognitive tutor;emergent	Ulrich Nehmzow	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-75388-9_6	mobile robot;computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;social robot;robot control;communication;mobile robot navigation	Robotics	-25.845297304528284	-16.795150436646328	185791

To make advertising campaigns more effective, advertisers look to target more relevant users. Ad-networks and other data collectors, such as, Cellular Service Providers (CSPs), hold a treasure trove of user information that is extremely valuable to advertisers. Moreover, these players may have complimentary sets of data. Combining and using data from different collectors can be very useful for advertising. However, in the trade of data among the various players, it is currently unclear how a price can be attached to a certain piece of information. This work contributes (i) a MOdel of the Value of INformation Granularity (MoVInG) that captures the impact of additional information on the revenue from targeted ads in case of uniform bidding and (ii) an expression that is applicable in more general scenarios. We apply MoVInG to a user data-set from a large CSP to evaluate the financial benefit of precise user data.	trove	Swati Rallapalli;Qiang Ma;Han Hee Song;Mario Baldi;S.

With the help of multiagent modeling guideline ASPECS, an example of ecodistrict model is discussed, as well.

4dad22f73f92cf916312dc389e1299b418302a4d	a signature based method for fraud detection on e-commerce scenarios		Electronic transactions have revolutionized the way that consumers shop, making the small and local retailers, which were being affected by the worldwide crisis, accessible to the entire world. As e-commerce market expands, the number of commercial transactions supported by credit cards—Card or Customer Not Present also increases. This growing relationship, quite natural and expected, has clear advantages, facilitating e-commerce transactions and attracting new possibilities for trading. However, at the same time a big and serious problem emerges: the occurrence of fraudulent situations in payments. In this work, we used a signature based method to establish the characteristics of user behavior and detect potential fraud cases. A signature is defined by a set of attributes that receive a diverse range of variables—e.g., the average number of orders, time spent per order, number of payment attempts, number of days since last visit, and many others—related to the behavior of a user, referring to an e-commerce application scenario. Based on the analysis of user behavior deviation, detected by comparing the user’s recent activity with the user behavior data, which is expressed through the user signature, it is possible to detect potential fraud situations (deviant behavior) in useful time, giving a more robust and accurate decision support system to the fraud analysts on their daily job.	e-commerce	Orlando Belo;Gabriel Mota;Joana Fernandes	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-25226-1_45	computer security	Vision	-33.401715217099635	-17.532232555024812	186017

The formalism was motivated by a need for transparent representations of assessment processes in the INFACT online learning environment. An editor and interpreter for SIGMA diagrams have been implemented and embedded in INFACT. The interpreter works with either stored event data, real-time event processing, or a combination of both. Examples diagrams are given, and the expressive power of the formalism is discussed.	complex event processing;diagram;embedded system;expressive power (computer science);graphical model;real-time clock;real-time computing;semantics (computer science)	Steven L.

An important question is whether all the mentioned faculties will have to be implemented at once in order to enable a natural interaction experience for the human user, or whether it is possible to realize a simple yet realistic type of ‘basic’ interaction competence in the nearer future, then gradually enrich it in order to implement human-like skills at a later point in time.	computation;computational linguistics;humans;human–robot interaction;levinson recursion;social robot	Wendelin Reich	2010			artificial intelligence;evolution;affordance	AI	-27.3620373001795	-17.60536301996355	186513

Situations in which human performance is subject to degradation over time, such as vigilance tasks, are not represented. This article describes a computational model for vigilance performance embedded in a new cognitive framework that utilizes recent advances in system neuroscience, evolutionary psychology and complexity theory. The Reduced Human Performance Model (RHPM) captures human errors in monitoring tasks to a greater degree than previous attempts. RHPM is implemented as a discrete event simulation using Listener Event Graph Objects (LEGOs). The model captures leading vigilance theories and can be used as a tool to improve existing vigilance theories and to improve current monitoring procedures minimizing errors that could lead to catastrophic outcomes.	complex adaptive system;computational complexity theory;computational model;elegant degradation;embedded system;human reliability;simulation	Joerg C.

The behavior of th is third agent, quite common in human interaction, is called overhearing. We present an agent architecture modeling this behavior. In particular, we focus on o verhearing based on ontological reasoning; that is, the overhearer semantical ly se ects pieces of communication according to his own knowledge (ontologically o rganized) and goals. In our architecture, overhearing is performed by a team of ag ents playing two different roles: the first role (overhearer) classifies the o v rheard communication according to a formal ontology; the second role (suggester) makes appropriate suggestions at the appropriate time point. We present a form al language for the interaction between agents in the overhearing team. A prototy pe of the architecture, implemented using JACK Intelligent Agents, is briefly descr ibed and preliminary experimental results are discussed.	abstraction layer;agent architecture;description logic;formal ontology;intelligent agent;jack intelligent agents;multi-agent system;parsing;software agent;value (ethics)	Marco Aiello;Paolo Busetta;Antonia Donà;Luciano Serafini	2001		10.1007/3-540-45448-9_13	artificial intelligence	AI	-21.905150837784497	-10.324610772321282	186751
e53829db72c63c72b3f7ed5c63e685fef3785e48	probabilistic strategy selection for flexible cognition		While current artificial systems must be custom tailored to operate within a single domain of expertise, the human mind readily adapts to multiple domains. In moving toward artificial systems that display similar flexibility, we become interested in how efforts to learn about the mind can support the development of flexible artificial systems, and how the development of these systems can contribute to our understanding of how the mind works. When contrasting natural and artificial systems, we find that people learn and maintain multiple competing strategies for performing the same task, while current software lacks this ability. When adding numbers, asking questions, referring to objects in the environment, or discerning spatial relationships, people develop and flexibly use a variety of approaches. This paper describes a proposed research program that focuses on computationally modeling the ability to maintain and use multiple strategies for performing the same task. We first point to developmental evidence as motivation for this research program. We then describe a few computational efforts that seem to fall within this vein. Finally, we describe preliminary work within the field of lexical semantics based on a new proposed model of “word strategies”.	cognition;computation;computer simulation;mind	Jennifer Margaret Roberts;Gregory Marton	2008			computer science;research program;machine learning;probabilistic logic;software;artificial intelligence;cognition;lexical semantics	HCI	-26.413425096143747	-17.64008013669034	186906

A conceptual framework is provided to describe the structure of a class of engineered complex systems and predict their future adaptive patterns. The proposed modeling approach allows examining complexity in the structure and the behavior of components as a result of their connections and in relation to their environment. Electrical power demand is used to illustrate the applicability of the modeling approach. We describe and use the major differences of natural complex adaptive systems (CASs) with artificial/engineered CASs to build our framework. The framework allows focus on the critical factors of an engineered system, but also enables one to synthetically employ engineering and mathematical models to analyze and measure complexity in such systems without complex modeling. This paper adopts concepts of complex systems science to management science and system-of-systems engineering.	complex adaptive system;complex system;complex systems;dynamical system;emergence;information theory;interoperability;mit engineering systems division;management science;mathematical model;self-organization;simulation;system of systems engineering;systems science	Moeed Haghnevis;Ronald G.

The methodology is explained using a robotic assembly task involving position and force controls. The action sequence is defined based on a control hierarchy which consists of four levels (Control primitive level, Control skill level, Skill level, and Task level). A complicated assembly task can be represented by the product and concatenation of control primitives in the lower levels, and various tasks can be defined by adding new control primitives. The parts to be assembled are represented by the built-up structure that we propose. In this paper, the concept of a CRS (Constraint Reduction System) is introduced for creating a robot task program. The CRS is realized through the use of an extended """"prolog"""" programming language.

a5be4b732c6923dbf7fc190a8397e267123b832c	eigenforms and quantum physics	quantum algebra;quantum physics	Our essay begins with explication of the notion of eigenform as pioneered by Heinz von Foerster in his papers (Foerster, 1981, pp. 258–271, pp. 274–285, pp. 288–309) and explored in papers of the author (Kauffman, 2003, pp. 73–90, 2005, pp. 129–150; 2009, pp. 121–137, 2010, pp. 48–89). In Foerster (1981, pp. 274–285) the familiar objects of our existence can be seen as tokens for the behaviors of the organism, creating apparently stable forms. Such an attitude toward objects makes it impossible to discriminate between the object as an element of a world and the object as a token or symbol that is simultaneously a process. The notion of an eigenform is inextricably linked with second-order cybernetics. One starts on the road to such a concept as soon as one begins to consider a pattern of patterns, the form of form or the cybernetics of cybernetics. Such concepts appear to loop around upon themselves, and at the same time they lead outward to new points of view. Such circularities suggest a possibility of transcending the boundaries of a system from within. When a circular concept is called into being, the boundaries turn inside out. An object, in itself, is a symbolic entity, participating in a network of interactions, taking on its apparent solidity and stability from these interactions. We ourselves are such objects, we as human beings are signs for ourselves, a concept originally due to the American philosopher C. S. Peirce (Kauffman, 2001, pp. 79–110). Eigenforms are mathematical companions to Peirce’s work. In an observing system, what is observed is not distinct from the system itself, nor can one make a separation between the observer and the observed.

The presented quantitative information-theoretic methods measure behavioural and epistemic entropy, and detect phase transitions — the edge of chaos — in team performance. The techniques clearly identify under-performing states, where a change in tactics may be warranted. This approach is a step towards a unified quantitative framework on behavioural and belief dynamics in complex multi-agent systems.	edge of chaos;information theory;multi-agent system	Mikhail Prokopenko;Peter Wang	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-25940-4_8	phase transition;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;management science	AI	-20.52452632875427	-12.434179968403853	187440
351a19164745e6bb104074bde854de5ca2040c66	towards an atlas of computational learning theory	004;computational learning language learning partially set driven learning strongly monotone learning	A major part of our knowledge about Computational Learning stems from comparisons of the learning power of different learning criteria. These comparisons inform about trade-offs between learning restrictions and, more generally, learning settings; furthermore, they inform about what restrictions can be observed without losing learning power. With this paper we propose that one main focus of future research in Computational Learning should be on a structured approach to determine the relations of different learning criteria. In particular, we propose that, for small sets of learning criteria, all pairwise relations should be determined; these relations can then be easily depicted as amap, a diagram detailing the relations. Once we have maps for many relevant sets of learning criteria, the collection of these maps is an Atlas of Computational Learning Theory, informing at a glance about the landscape of computational learning just as a geographical atlas informs about the earth. In this paper we work toward this goal by providing three example maps, one pertaining to partially set-driven learning, and two pertaining to strongly monotone learning. These maps can serve as blueprints for future maps of similar base structure. 1998 ACM Subject Classification I.2.6 Learning	amap;blueprint;computation;computational learning theory;diagram;institute for operations research and the management sciences;map;monotone	Timo Kötzing;Martin Schirneck	2016		10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2016.47	multi-task learning;instance-based learning;combinatorics;algorithmic learning theory;sample exclusion dimension;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;mathematics;stability;action learning;computational learning theory;active learning;algorithm	AI	-28.63779692149632	-11.742827230289048	187698

For example, his concern with perception is mainly with whether a representational theory of mind is relevant to explaining it. There are no diagrams of the eye or statements of any detail about how human vision might work. Similarly, although Pylyshyn is interested in drawing from folk psychology, there is a very large gap between grandma's prediction of what cousin Fred might do and a predictive model for any aspect of Fred's mind. Pylyshyn eschews details. My main praise of Pylyshyn's book is that he provides compelling, short, and clear examples for the points he chooses to make. For students of AI the book shows how phenomena that might seem quite ordinary can be quite remarkable when seen through a psychological perspective informed by computing. In reviews [1] of an earlier version fo Pylyshyn's work, reviewers of both theoretical and experimental persuasions picked at various aspects of Pylyshyn's approach. They discussed ambiguities in the application of the cognitive-penetrability criterion.

Yet we are lacking a fundamental understanding of what fun is and how fun works in games and other media. For example, why do thousands of people spend millions of dollars playing slot machines, especially when most know they will lose money in the long run? To answer this question, The author presents an aesthetic analysis of slot play using a Bayesian-information approach. The finding is that fun in slots can be seen as arising from a difference in information gained from good versus bad outcomes. This difference is modeled by marginal entropies and the result is a measure of fun in slot play, showing for what range of payoff probabilities slots are fun and at what probability they are most fun. The approach is extended to games of skill and the same Bayesian-information theory is used to derive computational measures of fun in these games	color gradient;entropy (information theory);image scaling;information theory;marginal model;money;shannon (unit);wheels	Kevin Burns	2006	2006 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Games	10.1109/CIG.2006.311709	game design;game theory;entropy;simulation;cognition;competitive intelligence;information theory;bayesian probability;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computational intelligence;probability;kullback–leibler divergence;human behavior;statistics	Logic	-32.16493881434884	-16.401455567667178	188206

Secondly, the methodology of Agent-based modeling (ABM) is used to establish the simulation model of command and control (C2) node of network-centric information system. At last, a method based on the information associated network is proposed to solving the problem of the System of System (SOS) simulation on network-centric information system. Through analyzing the information interactive relationship between information system nodes, the interactive contents are real-time computed and stored in a two-dimension table. So according to the information interactive relationship and interactive contents, the SOS running effect of network-centric information system can be high fidelity simulated.	information system;simulation	Fang Zhou;Shaojie Mao	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-34390-2_12	architecture;engineering;control engineering;command and control;real-time computing;information system	AI	-22.132100782377357	-22.13244347236825	188267
7ae55b480ed4c74ae17e96ad9b53c394ef3542e7	towards a comprehensive teamwork model for highly dynamic domains		Cooperative behaviour of agents within highly dynamic and nondeterministic domains is an active field of research. In particular establishing responsive teamwork, where agents are able to react to dynamic changes in the environment while facing unreliable communication and sensory noise, is an open problem. Unexpectedly changing situations force agents to react and adapt under tight time-constraints. Hence they often cannot communicate or agree upon their decisions before acting upon them. We present a novel model for cooperative behaviour geared towards such domains. In our approach, the agents estimate each other’s decision and correct these estimations once they receive contradictory information. We aim at a comprehensive approach for agent teamwork featuring intuitive modelling capabilities for multi-agent activities, abstractions over activities and agents, and clear operational semantics for the new model. We show experimentally that the resulting behaviour stabilises towards teamwork and can achieve a cooperative goal.	3apl;experiment;multi-agent system;network packet;observable;operational semantics;robot;steam	Hendrik Skubch;Michael Wagner;Roland Reichle;Stefan Triller;Kurt Geihs	2010			computer science;artificial intelligence;open problem;management science;machine learning;nondeterministic algorithm;operational semantics;abstraction;teamwork	AI	-21.57268600155045	-15.065369242254883	188335

Device-based reasoning can only be as good as the model used; if the needed knowledge, correct detail, or proper theoretical background is not accessible, performance deteriorates. Much of the work on model-based reasoning references the ‘no-function-in-structure’ principle, which was introduced by de Kleer and Brown. Although they were well motivated in establishing the guideline, this paper explores the applicability and workability of the concept as a universal principle for model representation. This paper first describes the principle, its intent and the concerns it addresses. It then questions the feasibility and the practicality of the principle as a universal guideline for model representation.		Anne M. Keuneke;Dean Allemang	1989	J. Exp. Theor. Artif.

Open complex giant systems (OCGSs) are a family of specially complex systems with system complexities such as openness, human involvement, societal characteristic, and intelligence emergence. They greatly challenge multiple disciplines such as system sciences, system engineering, cognitive sciences, information systems, artificial intelligence, and computer sciences. As a result, traditional problem-solving methodologies can help deal with them but are far from a mature solution methodology. The theory of qualitative-to-quantitative metasynthesis has been proposed as a breakthrough and effective methodology for the understanding and problem solving of OCGSs. In this paper, we propose the concepts of M-Interaction, M-Space, and M-Computing which are three key components for studying OCGS and building problem-solving systems. M-Interaction forms the main problem-solving mechanism of qualitative-to-quantitative metasynthesis; M-Space is the OCGS problem-solving system embedded with M-Interactions, while M-Computing consists of engineering approaches to the analysis, design, and implementation of M-Space and M-Interaction. We discuss the theoretical framework, problem-solving process, social cognitive evolution, intelligence emergence, and pitfalls of certain types of cognitions in developing M-Space and M-Interaction from the perspectives of cognitive sciences and social cognitive interaction. These can help one understand complex systems and develop effective problem-solving methodologies.	artificial intelligence;cognition;cognitive model;cognitive science;complex systems;computer science;embedded system;emergence;information system;interaction;openness;problem solving;simulation;spaces;systems engineering	Longbing Cao;Ruwei Dai;Mengchu Zhou	2009	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans	10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2022414	complex systems;socio-cognitive;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;management science;information system	AI	-26.962561033791278	-14.110234466909038	188814

In doing this, both explicit and implicit forms of human reasoning are incorporated in a unified framework, which is embodied in a cognitive architecture, CLARION. First, similarity in human everyday reasoning is explored. A computational framework encompassing both rule-based and similarity-based reasoning provides explanations for human data. The simulation using CLARION demonstrates the role played by similarity-based reasoning in human everyday reasoning, and how such a reasoning process follows from the structure of CLARION. Furthermore, the modelling of discovery tasks, i.e. tasks where sudden insights result from cumulative information, is explored. This is useful for improving the understanding of reasoning involving intuition and insight. The situation is interpreted as...	cognitive architecture	Ron Sun;Xi Zhang	2006	J. Exp. Theor. Artif.

Embodied natural communication belongs to this class of systems, encompassing many cognitive mechanisms that interact in highly complex ways, both within and between communicating individuals, constituting a heterogeneous, large, densely-coupled system (HeLD). HeLDs call for finer model granularity than other types of systems, lest we risk them to be not only incomplete but likely incorrect. Consequently, models of communication must encompass a large subset of the functions and couplings that make up the real system, calling for a powerful methodology for integrating information from multiple fields and for producing runnable models. In this paper I propose such an approach, abstract module hierarchies, that leverages the benefits of modular construction without forcing modularity on the phenomena being modeled.	automata theory;causal filter;causality;cellular automaton;cognition;cognitive model;cognitive science;complex system;complex systems;computer simulation;correctness (computer science);emergence;emoticon;high-level programming language;humanoid robot;level of detail;modular design;multimodal interaction;numerical weather prediction;principle of abstraction;robotics	Kristinn R.

This technology is extremely attractive to the military to provide training simulations. By the use of mock-up vehicles and high-fidelity visual systems, trainees get a window onto a virtual world populated by simulated vehicles interacting over a realistic terrain surface. Some of these vehicles are controlled by human trainees, others by computers. It is essential that trainees find the behavior of the computer-controlled vehicles realistic. Currently most computer forces are semiautomated using finite state machines or rule bases to govern their behavior, but requiring constant supervision by a human controller [1]. However, the vehicles can become increasingly autonomous as AI and agent techniques develop, thus reducing the number of human controllers as well as the hefty manpower bill associated with running big training simulations [2, 3]. We are concentrating on developing agents to control tanks within ground battle simulations. Here, tactical behavior is governed by two main factors—the terrain over which the tanks are moving and their beliefs about the enemy. In trying to produce battlefield behavior that mimics a human tactician, it is advantageous to model the command structure used by the army. This helps with the gathering of knowledge from subject matter experts and enables a hierarchical decomposition of the problems. The figure appearing in this sidebar shows the hierarchy of agents—highlevel commanders are given objectives that are used to produce lower-level objectives for their subordinates. Information flows both up and down the command chain and agents need to cooperate with their peers to achieve the overall goal set by their commander. This natural decomposition of the problem allows higherlevel agents to work on long-term plans while the individual tank agents carry out orders designed to achieve more immediate objectives.	autonomous robot;computer simulation;digital video effect;finite-state machine;interaction;mock object;population;subject matter expert turing test;subject-matter expert;virtual reality;virtual world	Jeremy W.

9806f72440c30e8a6b124dc86ee37bda166ceb7e	towards norm realization in institutions mediating human-robot societies		Social norms are the understandings that govern the behavior of members of a society. As such, they regulate communication, cooperation and other social interactions. Robots capable of reasoning about social norms are more likely to be recognized as an extension of our human society. However, norms stated in a form of the human language are inherently vague and abstract. This allows for applying norms in a variety of situations, but if the robots are to adhere to social norms, they must be capable of translating abstract norms to the robotic language. In this paper we use a notion of institution to realize social norms in real robotic systems. We illustrate our approach in a case study, where we translate abstract norms into concrete constraints on cooperative behaviors of humans and robots. We investigate the feasibility of our approach and quantitatively evaluate the performance of our framework in 30 real experiments with user-based evaluation with 40 participants.

They are further divided into three and four subcategories, respectively. The cybernetic conception of information, which comprises both the mathematical-statistic and the logical-semantic approaches, misses some aspects of information and knowing, that are important in economics and technology studies, among others. The semiotic-pragmatic approach presumes the existence of several modes of being of information, as well as connects certainty and ambiguity to information in a different way from how the cybernetic approach does. These two general approaches to information and knowing are strikingly different, especially in their analysis of ignorance or incomplete knowledge. None of the cybernetic conceptions, and only some conceptions within the semiotic-pragmatic approach, can vindicate the elusive intuition of the potential positive role of ignorance. This comparative, philosophical discussion of the modes of ignorance may be taken as a challenge for cybernetics and computational philosophy to make better sense of incomplete knowledge.	abductive reasoning;computation;cybernetics;information;information science;offset binary;pluralism (philosophy);semiotics;theory	Erkki Patokorpi	2011	Information	10.3390/info2010041	ecological rationality;information;cybernetics;epistemology;computer science;artificial intelligence;heuristics;mathematics;bounded rationality;rational ignorance	NLP	-25.469609088875636	-12.446691010010914	190413

Norms regulate the actions of human actors based on the dynamics of the environment in which they are situated. This dynamics results from both environment evolution and actors’ actions. Our objective is to situate norms in the environment in order to provide a context-aware crisis regulation. However, this coupling must be a loose one to keep both levels independent and easyto-change in order to face the complex and changing crisis situations. To that aim, we introduce a constitutive level between environmental and normative states providing a loose coupling of normative regulation with environment evolution. Norms are thus no more referring to environmental facts but to status functions, i.e., the institutional interpretation of environmental facts through constitutive rules. We present how this declarative and distinct SAI modelling succeeds in managing the crisis with a context-aware crisis regulation.	loose coupling;multi-agent system;situated cognition	Maiquel de Brito;Lauren Thévin;Catherine Garbay;Olivier Boissier;Jomi Fred Hübner	2016	Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering	10.1631/FITEE.1500369	computer science;artificial intelligence	AI	-21.918806814768494	-12.460583253964426	191048

Visual interactive simulation (VIS) has been proposed as a means for eliciting experts' decision-making by getting them to interact with a visual simulation of the real system in which they work. In order to explore the effectiveness and efficiency of VIS based knowledge elicitation, an experiment has been carried out with decision-makers in a Ford Motor Company engine assembly plant. The model properties under investigation were the level of visual representation (2-dimensional, 2½-dimensional and 3-dimensional) and the model parameter settings (unadjusted and adjusted to represent more uncommon and extreme situations). The conclusion from the experiment is that using a 2-dimensional representation with adjusted parameter settings provides the better simulation-based means for eliciting knowledge, at least for the case modeled.	augmented reality;computer animation;experiment;interaction;knowledge-based systems;puma (microarchitecture);sync;simulation;state space;virtual reality	Stewart Robinson;Ernie P.

In view of the problems of the traditional but still prevailing associationist theory, Ernst Cassirer demanded a more sophisticated theory that could explain the human ability to concentrate one’s thoughts on a topic, such as a problem or a task. He presented a representational theory of mind to explain this ability. This paper explicates the scope of this theory and Cassirer’s idea of interdisciplinary cooperation between philosophers and psychologists.	autonomous robot;cognition;mental representation	Martina Plümacher	2009	Synthese	10.1007/s11229-009-9625-6	knowledge representation and reasoning;representation theory;philosophy;epistemology;mathematics;knowledge;representation	AI	-26.21841337580315	-13.731136761347415	191188

Hence, we develop a set of multiUAV supervisory control interfaces and a multiagent coordination algorithm to support human decision making in this setting. To elucidate the resulting interactional issues, we compare manual and mixed-initiative task allocation in both static and dynamic environments in lab studies with 40 participants and observe that our mixed-initiative system results in lower workloads and better performance in re-planning tasks than one which only involves manual task allocation. Our analysis points to new insights into the way humans appropriate flexible autonomy.	agent-based model;algorithm;autonomy;unmanned aerial vehicle	Sarvapali D. Ramchurn;Joel E.

The interfaces of the services which the robot arm subsystem should provide to fully exploit its capability are identified. Specifically, the services of moving, object recognition, object fetching, and safety of human-robot interaction are considered as the fundamental functionalities that the robot arm should provide. The way to evaluate the quality of services (QoS) for the robot arm subsystem is also explained. To build such a robot arm subsystem, the system architecture is proposed. Also, implementation for the subsystem which includes: 3-D model-based object recognition, grasp database for object fetching, and online noncontact obstacle avoidance for the safety of human-robot interaction is provided. The experimental results demonstrate that the capability of 3-D model-based object recognition, object fetching, and dynamic collision avoidance are successfully implemented.	3d modeling;agent-based model;automation;cyber-physical system;human–robot interaction;multi-agent system;obstacle avoidance;outline of object recognition;robot;robotic arm;service-oriented device architecture;systems architecture;theory;workspace	Ren C.

8c6db488bebf3fb2c50d951c4a9f002a531f9b61	modeling multimodal dynamic spatiotemporal graphs		Spatiotemporal graphs (STGs) are a powerful tool for modeling multi-agent interaction scenarios, used commonly in human trajectory prediction and proactive planning and decision making for safe human-robot interaction. However, many current STG-backed methods rely on a static graph assumption, i.e., that the underlying graphical structure maintains the same nodes and edges throughout the scenario. This assumption is frequently broken in real-world applications, especially in highly-dynamic problems such as human trajectory prediction in crowds. To remove the reliance on this assumption, we present a methodology for modeling and predicting agent behavior in both highly dynamic and multimodal scenarios (i.e., where the scene’s graphical structure is time-varying and there are many possible highly-distinct futures for each agent). Our approach to model dynamic STGs augments prior multimodal, multi-agent modeling methods with a gating function on edge models that smoothly adds and removes edge influence from a node. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the ETH multi-human trajectory dataset and on NBA basketball player trajectories. Both are highly-dynamic, multimodal, and multi-agent interaction scenarios which serve as proxies for many robotic applications.	futures and promises;graphical user interface;human–robot interaction;multi-agent system;multimodal interaction;robot;smoothing;star trek generations	Boris Ivanovic;Marco Pavone	2018	CoRR		engineering;simulation;crowds;machine learning;trajectory;artificial intelligence;graph	AI	-21.568963999041618	-21.231331134234196	191883

Using precise mental models developed in artificial intelligence, the author analyzes motivation, attention, reasoning, learning, and communication in mechanical terms. These analyses provide psychology and economics with new characterizations of bounded rationality, provide mechanics with new types of materials exhibiting the constitutive kinematic and dynamic properties characteristic of different kinds of minds, and provide philosophy with a rigorous theory of hybrid systems combining discrete and continuous mechanical quantities. The resulting mechanical reintegration of the physical sciences that characterize human bodies and the mental sciences that characterize human minds opens traditional philosophical and modern computational questions to new paths of technical analysis.	artificial intelligence;computation;hybrid system;mental model;rationality	Jon Doyle	2006				AI	-26.534255609568756	-14.16201851752534	192386

Offering decision support by providing reputation information helps reducing uncertainties in virtual environments.

The supposed genericity of cortical processing has elicited a series of modeling works in computational neuroscience that underline the information flows driven by the cortical circuitry. In the minimalist framework underlying the current theories for the embodiment of cognition, such a generic cortical processing is exploited for the coordination of poles of representation, as is reported in this paper for the case of visual attention. Interestingly, this case emphasizes how abstract internal referents are built to conform to memory requirements. This paper proposes that these referents are the basis for communication in humans, which is firstly a coordination and an attentional procedure with regard to their congeners.	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;cognition;computation (action);computational neuroscience;electronic circuit;flow;generic drugs;generic programming;requirement;theory;congener	Frédéric Alexandre	2009	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/j.neunet.2009.01.006	vision;systems modeling;information flow;cognition;artificial intelligence;computer animation;memory;implementation;perception;computational neuroscience;theory;cognitive science	ML	-24.15263141473263	-16.474006879537477	192650
ab74bf3eff16b15e378804ec4b0bf3aa40e14e89	an ontology diagram for coordination of the hylomorphically treated entities		An Ontology diagram based on the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is described. The diagram is meant both for philosophy and Artificial Intelligence (e.g., knowledge representation) applications. Generally, the diagram provides the fundamental articulation of reality. It visualizes relations among the form and matter and their compounds—entities, such as a thing, something and nothing. Aristotle’s hylomorphism, the Square of Opposition, and the Cartesian coordinate system motivates idea of the diagram. The Cartesian coordinate system is treated in terms of structure. Matter and form are viewed as its axes; their intersection then is considered an Ontology coordinate system. Positive values of the coordinates imply presence, and negative imply privation of form or matter, correspondingly. Intersection of the axes creates four quadrants; presence of form and matter (i.e., their compound) makes substance, or thing. The meaning of quadrants is analyzed in terms of ontology, logic, and semiotics. The Ontology diagram might reveal new possibilities to use the Cartesian idea of coordination for humanities and social science applications. Optimistically, it might become as useful, as the Cartesian coordinate system proved to be for mathematics, physics and other domains of science.	artificial intelligence;biconnected component;cartesian closed category;diagram;entity;knowledge representation and reasoning;ontology (information science);semiotics;web ontology language	Algirdas Budrevicius	2018			diagram;database;ontology;computer science	AI	-26.588538987372946	-11.542560539340974	192667

The transition from a limit betting structure to a no limit betting structure offers challenging problems that are not faced in the limit domain. In particular, we address the problems of determining a suitable action abstraction and the resulting state translation that is required to map real-value bet amounts into a discrete set of abstract actions. We also detail the similarity metrics used in order to identify similar scenarios, without which no generalisation of playing decisions would be possible. We show that we were able to successfully generalise no limit betting decisions from recorded data via our agent, SartreNL, which achieved a 2nd place finish at the 2010 Annual Computer Poker Competition.	state space	Jonathan Rubin;Ian D.

The interaction behind relies on a message sending mechanism, and it is limited by each agent's architecture. Therefore, the set of features that describe the agent's mental model constrains the interaction variety in any multi-agent world. These ideas have been studied along ten years having the building services industry in background, and several pathways were drawn between science and practice.

This paper proposes such an organization, which is termed a discrete neural assembly. Each discrete neural assembly is in turn made up of discrete neurons (nodes), that is, a node that processes inputs based on a discrete mapping instead of a continuous function. A group of discrete neurons (nodes) closely interconnected form an assembly and carry out a basic functionality. Some substructures and superstructures of such assemblies are developed to enable complex symbolic schemas to be represented and processed in connectionist networks. The paper shows that logical inference can be performed precisely, when necessary, in these networks and with certain genaralization, more flexible inference (fuzzy inference) can also be performed. The development of various connectionist constructs demonstrates the possibility of implementing symbolic schemas, in their full complexity, in connectionist networks.	assembly language;connectionism;fuzzy logic	Ron Sun	1995	Applied Intelligence	10.1007/BF00877227	computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;artificial neural network	ML	-26.680262466998876	-16.036412037430665	193114

This enables agents to cope with their internal and external world while pursuing their own agenda. We show that a technical model based on the psychoanalytical drive concept and Damasio’s neuro-biological findings is appropriate for human-inspired cognitive agents. In particular, after overcoming the hurdles of interdisciplinary work between hermeneutic and axiomatic approaches, a transformation of psychoanalytical and neuro-biological concepts into an consistent and deterministic model solves the problem of motivations and valuations in artificial cognitive agents. This multi-level model is presented, in which multiple principles and influences of valuation are used to incrementally generate and decide an agenda for the agent’s behavior.	agent-based model;autonomy;cognition;cognitive tutor;cycle (graph theory);deterministic algorithm;function model;mind;multilevel model;relevance;simulation;value (ethics)	Samer Schaat;Klaus Doblhammer;Dietmar Dietrich	2014		10.5220/0004916502550260	motivation;artificial general intelligence;emotion;valuation;computer science;artificial intelligence;management science	AI	-22.7439293391282	-12.964516363557518	193189
fcf86db7ff95217371f22236abb980ecaa7217f0	reasoning in the absence of goals		In creative industries such as design and research it is common to reason about ‘problem-finding’ before tasks or goals can be established. Problem-finding may also continue throughout the problem-solving process, so achieving goals may be an ongoing process of discovery as well as iterative improvement and refinement. This paper considers the design of cognitive systems with complementary processes for both problem-finding and problem-solving. We review a range of approaches that may complement goal-directed reasoning when an artificial system does not or cannot know precisely what it is looking for. We argue that there is a spectrum of approaches that can be used for reasoning in the absence of goals, which make progressively weaker assumptions about the definition and presence goals, and that goal-oriented behavior can be an intermediate result of problem-finding, rather than as a starting point for problemsolving. We demonstrate one such approach based on implicit motives and incentives.	action selection;algorithm;artificial intelligence;domain-specific language;emergence;experience;goal modeling;iteration;knowledge base;problem solving;refinement (computing)	Mary Lou Maher;Kathryn E.

Implementing the Network Enabled Capability (NEC) concept is the main transformation process in the Czech Army. The one of the main NEC outputs is a common operational picture. This article deals with a design and an implementation of services for common operational picture data visualization supported by Service Oriented Architecture. The article is built on a current status of a NEC implementation process. The main output of this project is a prototype of visualization system that can be used by a commander and its staff at the brigade level. The operator can easily see the real situation at the theatre supported by LINK 16 standard and a connection with Czech ground C2 system and virtual reality devices. This system is designed to support decision making process of a commander.	data (computing);data visualization;decision support system;head-mounted display;network-enabled capability;prototype;real-time computing;service-oriented architecture;virtual reality	Jan Hodicky;Petr Frantis	2009			operations research;decision support system;computer science	Visualization	-23.650117270046827	-23.501144210039364	193240
59a8f3ec8aef1a1776d70ffbd293dcdeef810ce5	data-driven multi-agent system for maritime traffic safety management		In this study, we propose a data-driven multi-agent system (D-MAS), in which dynamic interactions among different maritime agents, representing shore station-vessel, vessel-vessel, and virtual agent-physical agent, are modeled, to enhance maritime traffic safety management. The multi-agent framework is proposed through integrating learning, forecasting and planning technologies. Our prototype multi-agent system provides solutions to accommodate maritime data analysis and simulation for maritime traffic dynamics and safety evaluation and management. The prototype system developed on top of a set of universal APIs enables adaption to different algorithms for simulation and modeling. Based on multi-agent characterization, we have presented agent-based situational awareness, traffic forecasting, intelligent route planning that are of high importance for maritime traffic safety. The framework proposed can be further developed and applied for applications in maritime safety management.	agent-based model;algorithm;interaction;multi-agent system;prototype;simulation	Zhe Xiao;Xiuju Fu;Liye Zhang;Loganathan Ponnambalam;Rick Siow Mong Goh	2017	2017 IEEE 20th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317707	simulation;knowledge extraction;engineering;data-driven;situation awareness;intelligent transportation system;multi-agent system	Robotics	-22.00521672065021	-22.846745248900866	193351

In this article, we show how teleology is used as a modern scientific discipline that provides a channel to achieve different goals. In more detail, it focuses on using teleology in knowledge mapping where it serves as a framework for capturing strategic knowledge. An important part of this in a knowledge map is setting individual objectives. However, without some meaningful context, the different knowledge types are hardly distinguished. Therefore, we introduce ontology for mapping these knowledge types separately, in an academic environment, through assigning folksonomy tags to knowledge nodes. Further, it is discussed that similar approach can be extended to other domains too, only by using appropriate ontology.

Kim’s view assumes a model of ‘functional reduction’ which he claims to be substantially different from the traditional Nagelian model. I dispute this claim and argue that the two models are only superficially different, and that on either model, properly understood, it is possible to draw a distinction between a property’s being reductively identifiable with its base property and a property’s being reductively explainable in terms of it. I propose that we should take as the distinguishing feature of emergent properties that they be truly novel properties, i.e., ontologically distinct from the ‘base’ properties which they supervene on. This only requires that emergent properties cannot be reductively identified with their base properties, not that they cannot be reductively explained in terms of them. On this conception the set of emergent properties may well include mental properties as conceived by nonreductive physicalists.	emergence;irreducibility;mental property;philosophy of mind;reduction (complexity)	Ausonio Marras	2006	Synthese	10.1007/s11229-006-9026-z	philosophy;epistemology;supervenience;mathematics;emergence	Web+IR	-25.39029008870504	-12.777496165988074	193716

In this paper we examine the relationship between social laws and rational behaviour, by which we mean behaviour that can be justified by a defensible argument. We describe how social laws have previously been defined and used within the context of Action-Based Alternating Transition Systems (AATS). We then show how an account of argumentation for practical reasoning in agent systems, also based on AATS, can be used to determine what is rational for the agents to do in the absence and presence of such laws. The reasoning involved is both of a practical and epistemic nature: agents need to make decisions about what to do based upon the assumptions that they make about the states they find themselves in, and crucially, they also need to reason about what the other agents in the scenario will do. What is rational for the agents to do has implications for the need for social laws, the ways in which social laws can help the situation, the form the social laws should take, and the likelihood of compliance with the social laws. This paper demonstrates how we can think about social laws and rational behaviour in a single framework, so as to identify these implications in particular scenarios, and so frame social laws accordingly.	multi-agent system;programming paradigm	Katie Atkinson;Trevor J.

Moreover, none of the current cognitive theories predictions fit reliably the empirical data. In this paper, we show how human syllogistic reasoning can be modeled under a new cognitive theory, the Weak Completion Semantics. Our analysis based on computational logics identifies seven principles necessary to draw the inferences. Hence, this work contributes to a computational foundation of cognitive reasoning processes.	cognitive computing;cognitive science;computational logic;experiment;theory;web coverage service	Ana Oliveira da Costa;Emmanuelle-Anna Dietz Saldanha;Steffen Hölldobler;Marco Ragni	2017			syllogism;psychology;cognitive psychology;computational logic	AI	-24.796244616400898	-14.574613607632354	194501

Insights into human transfer learning help us to design computer-based agents that can better adapt to new environments without the need for substantial reprogramming. In this paper, we study the transfer of knowledge by humans playing various scenarios in a graphically realistic urban setting that are specifically designed to test various levels of transfer. We determine the amount and type of transfer that is being performed based on the performance of trained and untrained human players. In addition, we use a graph-based relational learning algorithm to extract patterns from player graphs. These analyses reveal that indeed humans are transferring knowledge from on 3 set of games to another and the amount and type of transfer varies according to player experience and scenario complexity. The results of this analysis help us understand the nature of human transfer in such environments and shed light on how we might endow computer-based agents with similar capabilities. The game simulator and human data collection also represent a significant testbed in which other Al capabilities can be tested and compared to human performance.	algorithm;data mining;experiment;human reliability;intelligent agent;randomness;simulation;testbed	Diane J.

No innate grammatical knowledge is needed; only interaction with an environment and a native speaker of the language is required.

It is important to accurately model situation awareness to generate realistic tactical behaviors for the non-player characters (also known as bots) in MOUT simulations. This is a very challenging problem due to the time constraints and the heterogeneous cue types in MOUT. Although there are some theoretical models on situation awareness, they generally do not provide computational mechanisms suitable for MOUT simulations. In this paper, we propose a computational model of situation awareness for the bots in MOUT simulations. The model forms up situation awareness quickly with key cues. It is also designed to work with some novel features. They include case-based reasoning, qualitative spatial representation and expectations. The effectiveness of the computational model is assessed with Twilight City, a virtual environment that we have built for MOUT simulations.	algorithmic efficiency;case-based reasoning;computation;computational model;experience;simulation;virtual reality;window of opportunity;word sense	Shang-Ping Ting;Suiping Zhou;Nan Hu	2011	Trans.

The search for the initial stimulus state, that over time leads to a target state of interest, is optimized using GA.

The goal for the human is to obtain the maximal reward. This type of experiment is carried out by cognitive scientists and psychologists in order to study human behaviors in decision making.

Daily activities in the physical world combine two types of reasoning: discrete and continuous. For example, to set the table in Figure 1, the robot must make discrete decisions about which and in what order to pick objects, and it must execute these decisions by computing continuous motions to reach objects or desired locations. Robotics has traditionally treated these issues in isolation. Reasoning about discrete events is referred to as task planning, while reasoning about and computing continuous motions is in the realm of motion planning.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;benchmark (computing);compiler;end system;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;feedback;general-purpose markup language;general-purpose modeling;modular design;motion planning;open-source software;planning domain definition language;reasoning system;robot;robotics;scene graph;software framework;star trek:	Neil T.

8cb065bc548734d3b2b68ee9abd482fa09b18bbe	goal recognition using temporal emphasis	humanoid robots robustness stationary state algorithm design and analysis robot sensing systems trajectory	The question of what to imitate is pivotal for imitation learning in robotics. When the robot's tutor is a naive user, it is very difficult for the embodied agent to account for the unpredictability of the tutor's behaviour. Preliminary results from a previous study suggested that the phenomenon of temporal emphasis, i.e., that tutors tend to keep the goal state of the demonstrated task stationary longer than the sub-states, can be used to recognise that task. In the present paper, the previous study is expanded and the existence of the phenomenon is investigated further. An improved experimental setup, using the iCub humanoid robot and naive users, was implemented. Analysis of the data showed that the phenomenon was detected in the majority of the cases, with a strongly significant result. In the few cases that the end state was not the one with the longest time span, it was a borderline second. Then, a very simple algorithm using a single binary criterion was used to show that the phenomenon exists and can be detected easily. That leads to the argument that humans may also be able to detect this phenomenon and use it for recognizing, as learners or emphasizing and teaching as tutors, the end goal, at least for tasks with clear and separate sub-goal sequences. A robot that implements this behavior could be able to perform better both as a tutor and as a learner when interacting with naive users.	algorithm;bottom-up parsing;directed acyclic graph;eisenstein's criterion;embodied agent;humanoid robot;icub;interaction;robotics;stationary process	Konstantinos Theofilis;Chrystopher L.

The proposed multi-layered architecture allows a rationally bounded, goal-directed agent to reason predictively about potential conflicts by constructing causal theories which explain other agents' observed behaviors and hypothesize their intentions; at the same time it enables the agent to operate autonomously and to react promptly to changes in its real-time environment. A principal aim of this research is to understand the role different functional capabilities play in constraining an agent's behavior under varying environmental conditions. To this end, an experimental testbed has been constructed comprising a simulated multi-agent world in which a variety of agent configurations and behaviors have been investigated. A number of experimental findings are reported.	autonomous robot;causal filter;multi-agent system;real-time clock;simulation;testbed;theory	Innes A.

We describe a general protocol for interaction between theory formation, theory revision, and experimentation. This protocol enables theory formation to make specific queries about the state of the world to fulfill its hypothesis generation goals. It also enables experimentation-based revision to post tasks for theory formation to supply relevant hypotheses. The utility and generality of this protocol is demonstrated by an implementation of our unified framework, which consists of the integration of two, previously autonomous systems. Its performance is described for discovering and revising models of evaporation and osmosis.	belief revision;interdependence	Brian Falkenhainer;Shankar A.

Its relation to the larger subject of evolution, however, remains problematic. It is suggested here that a scaling-down of the meaning of natural selection to “the elimination of the unfit,” as originally intended by Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913), might ultimately prove a more effective means of relating it to larger-scale, longer-term, evolutionary processes.	causality;darwin;digital history;error-tolerant design;image scaling;interdependence;lineage (evolution);population;smoothing;wallace tree	Charles H.

ABS is a paradigm used in many levels of abstraction, including those levels covered by SD S. We believe that the establishment of frameworks for the choice between these two simulation approaches would contribute to the simulation research. Hence, our work aims for the establishment of directions for the choice between SDS and ABS approaches for immune system-related problems. Previously, we compared the use of ABS and SDS for modelling agents’ behaviour in an environment with no movement or interactions between these agents. We concluded that for these types of agents it is preferable to use SDS, as it takes u p less computational resources and produces the same results as those obtained by the ABS model. In order to move this research forward, our next research question is: if we intro duce interactions between these agents will SDS still be the most appropriate paradigm to be used? To answer this question for immune system simulation problems, we will use, as case studies, models involving interactions between tumou r cells and immune effector cells. Experiments show that ther e are cases where SDS and ABS can not be used interchangeably, and therefore, their comparison is not straightforwa rd.	computation;computational resource;interaction;principle of abstraction;programming paradigm;simulation;system dynamics	Grazziela Patrocinio Figueredo;Uwe Aickelin	2010	CoRR		simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;system dynamics;operations research	AI	-20.403054436651676	-16.496338788598845	196775

Models of crowd behavior facilitate analysis and prediction of human group behavior, where people are close geographically or logically, and are affected by each other’s presence and actions. Existing models of crowd behavior, in a variety of fields, leave many open challenges. In particular, psychology models often offer only qualitative description, and do not easily permit algorithmic replication, while computer science models are often not tied to cognitive theory and often focus only on a specific phenomenon (e.g., flocking, bi-directional pedestrian movement), and thus must be switched depending on the goals of the simulation. We propose a novel model of crowd behavior, based on Festinger’s Social Comparison Theory (SCT), a social psychology theory known and expanded since the early 1950’s. We propose a concrete algorithmic framework for SCT, and evaluate its implementations in several pedestrian movement phenomena such as creation of lanes in bidirectional movement and movement in groups with and without obstacle. Compared to popular models from the literature, the SCT model was shown to provide improved results. We also evaluate the SCT model on general pedestrian movement, and validate the model against human pedestrian behavior. The results show that SCT generates behavior more intune with human crowd behavior then existing non-cognitive models.	algorithm;bi-directional text;cognitive model;computer science;cross-validation (statistics);flocking (behavior);machine vision;microsoft intune;simulation;streaming media	Natalie Fridman;Gal A.

Design and evaluation of this method are motivated by a particular application, the representation of the experimental strategies of the 19thC physicist Michael Faraday as recorded in his laboratory diaries. However, the methods have wider application. We argue that a functional database language has the same morphology as a role taxonomy for knowledge and that this similarity of form provides a clear descriptive language. It is further argued that a graphical representation exploits one of the fundamental capacities for creative human insight. The combination of the two approaches, as realised through the CLARITY functional programming environment, provides a powerful knowledge acquisition tool.	faraday cage;functional programming;galaxy morphological classification;graphical user interface;integrated development environment;knowledge acquisition;query language	Thomas R.

Intelligent agents, be it on their own or as part of a multi-agent system, operate in a dynamic and complex environment and hence they need to be able to cope with uncertainty and reason with often incomplete information. Agents must interact and also cooperate with one another to be able to meet their intended goals. Formal approaches may assist the developers of agent-based systems in modelling and verifying that the actions of intelligents agents and multi-agent interactions will lead to a desirable outcome. In order to develop theories to specify and reason about various aspects of intelligent agents and multi-agent systems, many researchers have therefore proposed the use of modal logics such as logics of beliefs, knowledge, norms, obligations and time, as these are among the concepts that are critical to an understanding of intelligent agent behaviour. This special issue arose from the inaugural international Workshop on Logics for Intelligent Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (WLIAMAS 2008) which was organized by Mehmet A. Orgun, Guido Governatori, Chuchang Liu, Mark Reynolds and Abdul Sattar. It was held in conjunction with the IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology (IAT 2008) in Sydney, Australia in December 2008. This workshop series aims at bringing together researchers from the fields of modal logics, theoretical computer science and multiagent systems as well as researchers and practitioners who are interested in building agentbased systems by drawing inspiration from various forms of modal logics. Therefore the affiliation of WLIAMAS with IAT was both timely and mutually beneficial for the communities involved in those events. WLIAMAS 2008 received 21 full paper submissions and each paper was reviewed by three program committee members of international standing. The selection process was very competitive and, as a result, six full papers were accepted for presentation and included in the proceedings of the conference published by the IEEE Computer Society. The workshop created a discussion forum and exchange medium for experts from the two fronts: developers and practitioners of agent-based systems and researchers who are interested in formal models of agency. Attendance at the workshop was well over 20 participants and after each presentation there was a lively discussion. It was felt that the first workshop fulfilled its objectives with	agent-based model;intelligent agent;interaction;lively kernel;modal logic;multi-agent system;theoretical computer science;verification and validation	Mehmet A.

In this paper we explore one meaning of the concept developed for explaining cognitive reasoning with spatial concepts. Several experiments have been interpreted as showing that an abstract propositional representation is not sufficient for understanding reasoning in this domain. Another form of representation is the mental model which has been proposed to explain the obtained results. In contrast to this, we discuss some steps towards a computational theory founded on the notions of a conceptua! m o d e l and levels of reasoning which is able to reproduce the experimental results within a single abstract form of representation. Some empirical consequences are outlined and tested. A tentative conclusion is that the experimental results do not reflect fundamental differences in representational form but strategy differences in how to solve the tasks. 1 . I n t r o d u c t i o n An interesting explanatory concept in current Cognitive Science research is the notion of mesial models. The concept has been used in such diverse research areas as rentoning (e.g., |8|), problem tolling (e.g., [2]), and human-computer interaction (e.g., [9]). There must, of course, be several similarities between the different uses. However, no precise definition has been put forward as to what it means for something to be a mental model. That is, there is no definition which is supposed to hold among the different areas of research and it is even hard to find a definition that is not ambiguous within a particular area. So, one can really ask what it is that makes something a mental model or to put it differently, """"what's in a mental model""""? A common theme within the three research areas is the emphasis on knowledge repretcntation, or perhaps we should say mental repretentation. Of particular interest in this respect is the ongoing debate about the status of images and their relation to mental models. Some researchers claim that images correspond to a basic and concrete form of mental representation that is essential for the brain's way of representing the environment (e.g., [10]). Others hold the view that images can be analyzed into a more fundamental and abstract representation. In this view, images are seen as products of processes operating on an abstract representation (e.g., [14]). Thus, mental models as images could be regarded as either a fundamental format of representation or as a result of a strategy-driven process. The concept of mental models as developed by Johnson-Laird [8] is very interesting in this perspective. In discussing how meaning is mentally represented, Johnson-Laird emphasized the distinction between a statement's eztension (or denotation) in contrast to its istention (or sense) and concluded that current theories of knowledge representation in Cognitive Science (e.g., semantic networks, lexical decomposition etc.) cannot give a satisfactory account of the relation between intension and extension. Instead, what is needed is a concept of a mental moid in order to explain how meaning comes into mind. For example, when a reasoner heart a sentence like, The knife it to the right of the fork, it is encoded in an abstract propositional (or conceptual) representation, e.g., Right(Knife,Fork), but its meaning is not reached unti l the reasoner builds a model of i t , e.g., [Fork Kn i fe ] It is clear that for many domains a mental model corresponds to an image. This is particularly relevant when the domain consists of spatial descriptions as the above example. Thus, a mental model in this conception is basically realized through an introduction of a new representational format. Moreover, it seems as if the notion is based on the assumption that a model, by definition, should be concrete, i.e., the model should have structural similarities to the real world object. In this paper we intend to discuss the concept of a mental model as developed by Johnson-Laird and discussed in |3), [4], and [5]. Naturally, we are also interested in generalizing the theoretical work to mental models in general. The fundamental concept we explore is the notion of a conceptual model showing many resemblances with conceptual ttructuret [15] and structural detcriptiont [7|. The computational theory we try to build is essentially an attempt to realize the """" mental model phenomenon"""" in a conceptual form of representation. The emphasis is on processes operating on an abstract representation and thus creating an """" image-like"""" structure. Let us start by a brief review of some experiments which gives the discussion a concrete content. 2. Experiments w i t h spatial descriptions The task domain we use as a means for the discussion has been studied by, for example, [12] and [8]. Descr ip t ion 1. The spoon it on the left of the knife. The plate it on the right of the knife. The fork it in front of the tpoon. The cup it in front of the knife. Descr ip t ion 2. The tpoon it on the left of the knife.

Figure 1 shows two spatial descriptions used in the experiments in [12]. The task is to read a description and then (i) to draw a scene, (ii) to recognize a scene, or (iii) to recognize the sentences among a set. In [3] we reviewed five experiments and presented steps towards a computational theory able to reproduce the empirical findings. In the following we concentrate on the notion of spatial determinacy, which is the difference between the descriptions in Figure 1. 2.1 Spat ia l de te rm lnacy and men ta l models The experimental situation for descriptions 1 and 2 is as follows [12). You are instructed to read a set of sentences and afterwards you might be presented with • a diagram and asked to decide whether or not the diagram corresponds to the description jnst read (e.g., Diagram 1) or • four descriptions each containing three sentences and asked to rank order the sets in terms of their resemblance to the original set."""	cognitive science;diagram;experiment;field electron emission;fork (software development);human–computer interaction;indeterminacy in concurrent computation;intension;knowledge representation and reasoning;mental model;mental representation;semantic network;semantic reasoner;theory of computation	Göran Hagert	1985			conceptual model;computability theory;computer science;artificial intelligence;conceptual model;mathematics;psychology of reasoning	AI	-28.070140446211866	-13.954050657400751	197627

Consumers claim they will switch to alternative providers or cancel transactions if data collection is deemed excessive. Therefore, privacy appears to be a competitive factor in electronic commerce. This paper describes a study which quantifies the degree to which privacy is a competitive advantage for online retailers. In an experiment, we offered 225 participants the option to purchase one DVD from one of two online stores. Throughout the study, one online shop asked for more invasive personal data—as confirmed by an exit-questionnaire. In the test treatment, the privacy-invasive store sold DVDs for one Euro less than the other, and in the control treatment, both stores sold DVDs for the same price. Across both treatments, 74 participants made a purchase and had the DVD they bought delivered. In our study we found that, when the price of DVDs was the same between both stores, the shop asking for less personal data did not amass 2 Preibusch, Kübler, Beresford the entire market. When consumers were offered a trade-off between price and privacy, the vast majority of customers chose to buy from the cheaper, more privacy-invasive, firm; this firm got both a larger market share and higher revenue. The cheaper shop generated strong dissatisfaction with their privacy practises; in contrast, consumers of the more expensive store displayed only weak dissatisfaction with price. We established the validity of our analysis by checking users made informed choices, and did not select one firm over the other due to hasty decision-making or ordering effects. We found no support for either a materialistic lifestyle nor the quest for immediate gratification as to why customers chose the cheaper but privacyunfriendly store. 1 Privacy as a competitive advantage Online retailing is a competitive electronic marketplace. Homogeneous goods and services can be purchased from multiple sellers; price steers demand. Unless retailers differentiate, they face the prospect of profit-diminishing price competition. Non-functional product or service attributes can be the source of differentiation: seller ratings from the community, shipping duration, and the returns policy are examples of characteristics not directly linked to the good for sale. The quantity and conditions under which customers’ personal information are collected can also be non-functional sources of differentiation [12]. For data collection, the privacy design determines which data items are collected and whether a data item is optional or mandatory. The privacy design also encompasses the purpose and retention time for each data item. Sometimes, collected information is shared with other entities. A firm does not need to apply a uniform privacy design across all its customers. Personalised privacy designs can be beneficial for consumers, because learning and pre-empting privacy preferences of Web users may alleviate the burden in manually configuring privacy settings [14]. For example, as part of a Web request, the browser submits information that providers can use as clues to tailor the privacy experience. This includes the ‘do no track’ (DNT) header as one of the most prominent and recently discussed sources. The development of personalised privacy designs also opens up the possibility for negotiation between the customer and the firm; the privacy design offered to the individual and the price of the goods or services, or even benefit or otherwise of other non-functional attributes may be traded in real-time. Privacy becomes a competitive factor as the policies governing data collection and processing start to vary noticeably across the market, or even between consumers shopping at the same store. It seems plausible that firms can turn their privacy design into a competitive advantage by responding to their customers’ needs by deploying a better design than their competitors, and in doing so may get a larger market share or higher revenues per customer. Experiment into privacy as a competitive advantage 3 Producing an optimal privacy design that serves the company and its customers alike, is not a trivial task [11]. One fundamental premise for turning privacy into a competitive advantage, however, is whether the consumer understands it, accepts it, and believes the potential benefits are important [1]. Previous market analysis has confirmed privacy experience as a ‘satisfier’: high performance will be positively noticed by customers, but a poor performance may not be penalised [13]. We know from previous studies that what people say when asked about their privacy preferences, and what they actually do, often differ enormously [17]. Hence, consumer reaction is the ultimate litmus test. 2 Hypotheses and experimental design This paper explores to what extent the privacy design of an online service can become the source of competitive advantages. The overarching research hypothesis, formed before the trials, was as follows: When firms differ with respect to their privacy practices, this will affect the market outcome. In particular, privacy-friendly firms will perform better than privacy-unfriendly firms, all other things being constant. In our study, privacy-friendliness is expressed in the data collection scheme a firm implements: that is, the amount, kind, and obligatoriness of data items it collects. We understand privacy as a vertical property: although consumers have heterogeneous privacy preferences, for instance, in ranking data items by sensitivity, there is a consensus that certain privacy practices are more invasive than others. The relationship of ‘more’ data collection, or ‘more’ permissive usage permissions are intrinsically vertical orderings. 2.1 Market supply and demand in the experiment Participants were offered the option of buying a DVD from one of two online stores. Unlike previous research, [5] we observe actual behaviour rather than behavioural intentions. DVD purchase was a unit demand and purchase quantities were zero or one for each participant. DVDs were selected because they are comparatively cheap, and a homogeneous good, identical regardless of where it is purchased. As a pragmatic consideration, DVDs are also easy to obtain and legal to resell. Further, in designing the experiment against a subject pool dominated by students, it is noteworthy that whilst students are less likely to shop online than the self-employed, for instance, they are the social group most actively buying music and films online (41% compared to 32% for the entire online shopping population; current in the year of the 1 A short paper using a subset of the data presented in this paper has been published in Economics Letters [2]. However, this earlier note only considered the privacy paradox and anomalies in human choice. 4 Preibusch, Kübler, Beresford study) [18, Tab. 5.4]. Given DVDs are a homogeneous good, a duopoly under Bertrand competition suffices for competition. The two stores were labelled “SilverDisc Cologne” and “SilverDisc Frankfurt” to represent two different branches of the same company. SilverDisc is an existing local DVD retailer whose logo and name were used with permission. The branch-qualifying suffixes “Cologne” and “Frankfurt” were chosen to minimise any differences between the two firms. Cologne and Frankfurt are the 4th and 5th largest German cities respectively, of comparable historical age, distance from Berlin where the sessions were held, and other infrastructural characteristics that could impact order fulfilment.	adobe flash player;bertrand (programming language);best practice;caller id;causality;data item;design of experiments;do not track;e-commerce;epr paradox;email;entity;experiment;ground truth;information privacy;internet privacy;litmus;logo;nonlinear gameplay;observable;online and offline;online service provider;online shopping;personally identifiable information;privacy policy;purchasing;real-time clock;realms;requirement;semiconductor industry;trust (emotion);web application;web search engine;while	Sören Preibusch;Dorothea Kübler;Alastair R.

The hardware architecture of the system is an embedded microcontrollers network designed to fit the concurrency requirements of the cognitive model of the aforementioned agent. The architecture of the agent comprises three levels, namely, the reactive level, instinctive level and the cognitive level, which runs concurrently. The reactive level is embedded in a PSoC 5LP, consisting of behaviours created over a embedded kinematic controller. The instinctive level runs in an ARM mbed, which receives perceptions from and sends the active behaviour to the reactive level through a CAN bus. This level uses a Knowledge Based System (KBS) with First Order Logic (FOL) as automatic reasoning mechanism. The cognitive level runs an implementation of the METATEM algorithm on a DNP/2486 which, in turn, receives symbolic information from the instinctive level to update its logical world model. It also sends new local goals to instinctive level through an Ethernet network. Finally, the architecture used in the experiments is presented, followed by the results.	arm architecture;advanced audio coding;algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;automated reasoning;autonomous agent;can bus;cognitive model;concurrency (computer science);concurrent metatem;dns certification authority authorization;embedded system;experiment;first-order logic;inference engine;knowledge representation and reasoning;knowledge-based systems;linear temporal logic;microcontroller;mobile robot;psoc;pass transistor logic;personal computer;printed circuit board;requirement;semantics (computer science);simulation;mbed	Diego Stéfano;Fabio Ferreira;Priscila S.

Similarly, specifying classes of interest is a central aspect of information systems analysis and design. We extend principles originally developed to guide classification in information systems to the general problem of organizing scientific knowledge. Two fundamental cognitive principles underlie the choice of classes. First, classes should encapsulate inferences about the properties of their instances. Second, collections of classes should provide economy of storage and processing. This leads to a view of classes as carriers of domain knowledge in the form of inferences about situations, rather than containers for information. In this paper, we show how this view, originally developed in the IT context, can be extended to other disciplines, notably the natural sciences. We explain how the principles of inference and economy can guide the choice of individual classes and collections of classes. Moreover, we present a generalized classification-based information processing system (CIPS) model. We propose that scientific theories can be represented by class structures as defined in our model and demonstrate how this can be done by applying CIPS to analyze an example from the philosophy of science literature dealing with nuclear physics. The example demonstrates two advantages of the CIPS approach: first, it can provide a simpler, more scalable, and more informative account of the phenomena than a competing approach (dynamic frames); second, the resolution of inconsistencies between theory and observation can be framed in terms of changes to classification structures, and the principles can even guide such changes.	cognition;information model;information processing;information processor;information system;organizing (structure);scalability;structured systems analysis and design method	Jeffrey Parsons;Yair Wand	2013	J.

3b12ddce41b574c27fce7fe0da51c653564f7d45	human-centred machine learning	data;user centered design;machine learning	Machine learning is one of the most important and successful techniques in contemporary computer science. It involves the statistical inference of models (such as classifiers) from data. It is often conceived in a very impersonal way, with algorithms working autonomously on passively collected data. However, this viewpoint hides considerable human work of tuning the algorithms, gathering the data, and even deciding what should be modeled in the first place. Examining machine learning from a human-centered perspective includes explicitly recognising this human work, as well as reframing machine learning workflows based on situated human working practices, and exploring the co-adaptation of humans and systems. A human-centered understanding of machine learning in human context can lead not only to more usable machine learning tools, but to new ways of framing learning computationally. This workshop will bring together researchers to discuss these issues and suggest future research questions aimed at creating a human-centered approach to machine learning.	algorithm;computer science;framing (world wide web);human-centered computing;machine learning;situated	Marco Gillies;Rebecca Fiebrink;Atau Tanaka;Jérémie Garcia;Frédéric Bevilacqua;Alexis Héloir;Fabrizio Nunnari;Wendy E.

Through identifying the resemblance points, we will discuss whether findings of ethology and neuroscience can be used in the process of design and development of non-classical AI systems. To this end, we focus on a specific example that has long been investigated in all the concerned disciplines: the action selection problem. The paper overviews action selection mechanisms in behaviour-based AI and neuroscience in order to identify the commonalities that underly the understanding of action selection in different disciplines, and that may constitute the pieces of a common language with which AI can communicate ideas and findings to and from ethology and neuroscience.	action selection;artificial intelligence;behavior-based robotics;control flow;selection algorithm	Pinar Öztürk	2005		10.1007/11499220_2	integrative neuroscience;action selection;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;cognitive science;systems neuroscience	AI	-25.884023995186933	-15.13200370687961	198133

We introduced a weighted sequential topology to the actions set to capture tactical preferences rather than individual action preferences. This produces a personality representation of much higher expressive power that improves the adaptation performance and subsequently enables a larger variety of action genres to be adaptable. A TAP-based learning framework is then constructed and it is shown to perform better than the one based on the previous agent personality. Consequently, we also implement an RPG scenario that demonstrates its ability to generate adaptive plausible behavior in a much larger variety of action genres.	algorithm;curse of dimensionality;dimensionality reduction;expressive power (computer science);np-completeness;os-tan;principal component analysis;rpg;transaction authentication number;while	Chek Tien Tan;Ho-Lun Cheng	2008			computer science;artificial intelligence;expressive power	AI	-22.870844893607256	-19.47716560373127	198223

Unless the agent is able to successfully partition these into functionally similar classes, its ability to interact with the world will be extremely limited. We present a method whereby an unsupervised robotic agent learns to discriminate discrete actions out of its continuous action parameters. These actions are discriminated because they lead to qualitatively distinct outcomes in the robot's sensor space. Once found, these actions can be used by the robot as primitives for further exploration of its world. We present results gathered using a Pioneer 1 mobile robot.	experience;language primitive;mobile robot	Gary W.

The structure of design descriptions is examined with particular reference to generative shape descriptions acting as the infrastructure for attributes. Structure is represented by relations among the parts of descriptions. In particular, a closure structure allows relations to be described by the parts themselves. Design processes use descriptions in combination. It is shown how to combine separate descriptions in parallel and sequentially. Rules change descriptions. It is shown how to aggregate local changes consistently across a design and to use rules with structure on their component shapes to highlight selected emergent features. Further, multiple attribute descriptions, including shape and associated properties, are constructed. Their structures are represented algebraically.		Chris F.

A key argument concerns the test’s use of, or even, reliance on deception for subjectively demonstrating intelligence, and counters with a test of his own based on Winograd Schemas that he suggests is more objective. We argue that the subjectivity of the test is a strength, and that evaluating the outcome of Levesque’s objective test introduces other problems.

It includes a simulation league where two teams of 11 players compete in a robotic soccer game very similar to real soccer. Teams exhibit very complex strategies in these games that are very difficult to analyze by conventional observation methods. This paper presents an approach to the visualization of simulated robotic soccer games using the RapidMiner software package.

The cognitive architecture Casimir is designed to provide a framework for computationally modeling human spatial knowledge processing relying on these kinds of representation formats. In this article, we present an overview of Casimir and its components. We briefly describe the long-term memory component and the interaction with external diagrammatic representations. Particular emphasis is placed on Casimir's working memory and control mechanisms. Regarding working memory, we describe the conceptual foundations and the processing mechanisms employed in mental spatial reasoning. With respect to control, we explain how it is realized as a distributed, emergent facility within Casimir.	cognition disorders;cognitive architecture;computer simulation;control system;diagram;emergence;foundations;memory disorders;memory, long-term;mental model;spatial–temporal reasoning;format	Holger Schultheis;Thomas Barkowsky	2011	Topics in cognitive science	10.1111/j.1756-8765.2011.01151.x	psychology;mental image;casimir effect;artificial intelligence;spatial intelligence;communication;computational model;social psychology;cognitive science	AI	-24.79382335192267	-15.883102055203894	199128

In this way shapes do not have to be categorized in an exhaustive hierarchy and there is no need to take immediate decisions on how to group the objects, it is rather possible to individualize some important characteristics of shapes and use them as the basis for their categorization and comparison. This approach also makes it possible to use the adequate similarity measure based on properties which helps find similar shapes in di↵erent contexts, depending on the relevance of the properties in the particular situation.	categorization;computation;feedback;mind;ontology (information science);relevance;similarity measure;software propagation	Silvia Likavec	2013			categorization;ontology;similarity measure;hierarchy;pattern recognition;mathematics;similarity (geometry);artificial intelligence	Web+IR	-27.854525326378873	-11.838880868315359	199484

This implies that the AI community will face the challenges of identifying, understanding, and dealing with the different types of social behaviours these intelligent machines could exhibit. Given these potential challenges, we aim to model in this paper three of the most studied strategic social behaviours that could be adopted by autonomous and malicious software agents. These are dishonest behaviours such as lying, bullshitting, and deceiving that autonomous agents might exhibit by taking advantage of their own reasoning and communicative capabilities. In contrast to other studies on dishonest behaviours of autonomous agents, we use an agentoriented programming language to model dishonest agents’ attitudes and to simulate social interactions between agents. Through simulation, we are able to study and propose mechanisms to identify and later to deal with such dishonest behaviours in software agents.	agent-oriented programming;autonomous agent;autonomous robot;high- and low-level;interaction;jason;malware;programming language;simulation;socialization;software agent;strand (programming language)	Alison R.

We contend that we cannot manage mathematical knowledge for human recipients if we do not take these factors into account. As a basis for a future extension of MKM systems, we analyze the social context of information in terms of Communities of Practice (CoP; a concept from learning theory) and present a concrete extensional model for CoPs in mathematics. People don’t learn to become [... mathematicians] by memorizing formulas; rather it’s the implicit practices that matter most. Indeed, knowing only the explicit, mouthing the formulas, is exactly what gives an outsider away. Insiders know more. By coming to inhabit the relevant community, they get to know not just the “standard” answers, but the real questions, sensibilities, and aesthetics, and why they matter.
