5f6216f9e89af74874c0d202b703496b9b480b53	asnst: an abstract syntax notation-one support tool	thesis;abstract syntax	Syntax Notat ion-One (ASN.1) is a standard notation which provides a number of built-in and defined data types for the specification of logical structures of PDUs (i.e. PDU definitions) 6. Each ASN.1 data type is accompanied by an encoding rule which determines the representation of a data item of the corresponding type for transmission through the underlying communication service 7. These encoding rules are applied to encode (i.e. convert) from External Form (EF)* to Internal Form (IF) ~ and decode (i.e. convert from IF to EF) PDU occurrences. Recently a set of ASN.1 support tools have been proposed 8-1°. Each of these tools is basically an encoder/ decoder with some editing facilities. These editing facilities are useful for the construction and manipulation of PDU definitions and PDU occurrences. A system that supports application layer protocol design, testing and validation is presented here. This system is based on a Prolog implementat ion of encoding rules associated with the ASN.1 notation, as well as Yacc and Lex ~ tools provided under Unix. Prolog clauses *The EF of a PDU occurrence refers to a PDU whose values are specified according to the ASN.1 notation. This is a stream-oriented form suitable for processing information by an application process. +The IF of a PDU occurrence refers to a PDU whose values are specified according to the encoding rules associated with the ASN.1 notation. This is a form suitable for the transfer of information through the communication medium. ~Yacc and Lex are Unix tools which assist in writing programs for the purpose of parsing and lexical analysis. 1989 Butterworth & Co (Publishers) Ltd	abstract syntax notation one;butterworth filter;canonical account;communications protocol;data item;encode;entity framework;free variables and bound variables;lex (software);lexical analysis;parsing;prolog;unix;yacc	Cheryl Cleghorn;Hasan Ural	1989	Computer Communications	10.1016/0140-3664(89)90018-2	abstract syntax;computer science;theoretical computer science;programming language;algorithm	SE	-27.53162767764255	88.29454275086097	70834

The interworking solution is based on P2P-IMS GateWay (PIGW), which acts as a normal peer in P2PSIP network and a 3rd party IMS Application Server (AS) in IMS network. The security is achieved by implementing Chord Secure Proxy (CSP) and enhanced with subjective logic based trust model. We also implement this system model and analyze it in several aspects: number of hops and delay, trust improvement and protection against malicious or compromised intermediate peers. We conclude that the proposed architecture is feasible and improves security. As far as we know our research is the first study that proposes secure internetworking P2PSIPS and IMS.	application server;border gateway protocol;information management system (ims);interconnection;internetworking;malware;mobile phone;peer-to-peer sip;prototype;public key infrastructure;server (computing);systems architecture	Xianghan Zheng;Vladimir A.

In this paper, we consider a general mobile traffic offloading system that adopts the widely used Gale-Shapley algorithm to optimize its mobile phone users (MUs) to offloading stations allocation plan. We notice that without careful protection, such a system could cause serious threat to MUs' location privacy, and thus design effective countermeasures based on the powerful state-of-the-art differential privacy concept. Specifically, we have proposed two joint differentially private Gale-Shapley mechanisms with strong privacy protections for mobile traffic offloading systems. The first mechanism is able to protect each user's location privacy even when all other users collude against this user assuming the system administrator can be trusted. The second mechanism is able to achieve the same privacy guarantee against colluding users, and moreover against an untrusted semi-honest system administrator. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate our mechanisms, and the results show that our mechanisms have good efficiency, accuracy, and privacy protection.	algorithm;differential privacy;experiment;mobile phone;semiconductor industry;stable marriage problem;system administrator	Yuan Zhang;Yunlong Mao;Sheng Zhong	2016	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2016.2605798	games;privacy software;mobile search;mobile telephony;computer science;resource management;operating system;interference;internet privacy;small cell;mobile computing;privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-22.757338533245036	75.58946947750812	72174

The real time synchronization of The Flexible Bus System makes it information rich and unique as compared to other DRTs. The Flexible Bus Systems is a system that can replace the Traditional Bus Systems with its flexibility and efficiency.

Competition between service providers may hinge on the speed at which one provider can respond to new market demands over another. The notion of open programmable networks is having broad impact on service providers and vendors across a range of telecommunication sectors calling for major advances in open network control architecture, network programmability and distributed systems technology. In this paper we discuss the origins of the Open Signalling Working Group (OPENSIG) and present a summary of the fifth Workshop on Open Signaling for ATM, Internet and Mobile Networks (OPENSIG'98), which was held at the University of Toronto, Ontario, October, 1998. We also discuss a number of new initiatives in the area of open programmable networks that have recently emerged.	atm turbo;distributed computing;internet;the open group	Andrew T.

This work proposes a filtering system for TCP/IP-based automation networks in which only certain kind of industrial traffic is permitted. All network traffic which does not conform with a proper industrial protocol pattern or with specific rules for its actions is supposed to be abnormal and must be blocked. As a case study, we developed a seventh layer firewall application with the ability of blocking spurious traffic, using an IP packet queueing engine and a regular expression library.	automation;internet protocol suite	Aguinaldo B.

This strong coupling between the session and the end-point attributes implies that any change to one or more of the elements in this 5-tuple invariably leads to session failure. We present an architecture (STEM) that decouples this strong association to enable seamless migration of active transport sessions across IP addresses and interfaces. We achieve this migration by directly communicating between the peers and dynamically updating the 5-tuple elements associated with the session. The migration is done in a transparent, simple and secure way.  Our architecture enables new and exciting applications such as fault-tolerant transport sessions (e.g. in BGP) and end-host mobility in the absence of mobile IP infrastructure. Although STEM can be used as an alternative to mobile IP, the two may co-exist as well, if desired. The novelty of this architecture is that it does not require any modifications to standard protocols or applications. In other words, no changes are needed to the finite state machine or protocol messages. We present an implementation of the STEM architecture and validate it by means of experimental results.	border gateway protocol;communication endpoint;fault tolerance;finite-state machine;internet protocol suite;mobile ip;seamless3d;viz: the computer game	Furquan Ansari;Ajay Sathyanath	2007	Mobile Computing and Communications Review	10.1145/1282221.1282222	fault tolerance;real-time computing;network architecture;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;optical ip switching;distributed computing;finite-state machine;ip tunnel;transport layer;mobile ip;active transport;computer network	HPC	-22.73076336694169	86.91479752737207	74934

In principle a single experimental setup in the remote laboratory can be monitored and logged simultaneously by any number of permitted clients through a simple, custom web browser interface. The system features an IEEE 802.3 compliant full-duplex Medium Access Controller (MAC) and Physical Layer Device connected to actuators and measurement transducers for control, data acquisition, distribution and logging over a local high-speed TCP/IP network. The designed system differs in its approach from most contemporary approaches in that it specifies circuit level components required to set up a low cost collaborative remote experimentation server. The system hardware comprises a server made up of a PIC18f2620 and ENC28j60 and client PC terminals interconnected through a network hub. The software comprises the firmware, written in C and Javascript, and a simple client web browser written in the Visual Basic.NET framework. This custom client browser approach circumvents the restrictions that standard client browsers place on direct file system access while optimizing data acquisition and transport while better handling several exception scenarios and implementing an authentication mechanism for secure client access. The system suggests a simplified external ROMbased client authentication solution to the problem of embedded system security that is of growing global concern. The figures of merit of the system, such as the round-trip times and the inter-sample times, are determined. Finally, typical data outputs of two networked PCs in a collaborative monitoring of temperatures in Newton’s law of cooling experiment are presented. & 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

They contained significant and seminal technological results, a paper by Claude Shannon in 1948 and a patent by Horst Feistel in 1971. Shannon’s paper announces the challenge at the start, writing ``the fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected *sent+ at another point.‛ Shannon’s Coding Theorem established the relationship between the probability of receiving the message in error and transmission rate measuring the process efficiency. Shannon proved the existence of codes achieving optimal performance, but it required forty-five years to exhibit an actual code achieving it. The optimal-efficient Shannon codes are responsible for a wide range of communication technology we enjoy today, from GPS, to the NASA rovers Spirit and Opportunity on Mars, and also to worldwide communication over the Internet. US Patent #3798539A filed by the IBM Corporation in1971 described Horst Feistel’s Block Cipher Cryptographic System, a new paradigm for encryption systems. It was a departure from the current cryptographic technology based on shift-register stream encryption for voice and the variety of the electro-mechanical cipher machines introduced nearly fifty years before. Horst’s vision was its application to secure the privacy of computer files. It was invented at a propitious moment in time and implemented by IBM in automated teller machines for the Lloyds Bank Cashpoint System. The emergence of E-Commerce in the next decades would far overshadow the value of encryption in banking business. Finally, it has drastically altered the SIGINT mission of the National Security Agency. While Horst Feistel did not directly participate to any of these commercial applications of cryptography, the traditional interpretation of the law of cause and effect certainly describes the effect of Feistel’s patent.	block cipher;causality;code;computer file;cryptography;cryptosystem;e-commerce payment system;emergence;encryption;feistel cipher;global positioning system;internet;programming paradigm;shannon (unit);shift register;signals intelligence	Alan G.

583b0afc097a7b62ade724117309af22da3b7aeb	design and performance analysis of sensor proxy-aaa authentication scheme based on fast handover and forwarding mode for ip-based internet of things		Recently, with the development of IoT technology, a wireless sensor network technology capable of real-time management by receiving information wirelessly through various kinds of sensors has been actively developed. Hence, reducing the signaling cost becomes an important issue because most of the sensors are powered by battery only. In addition, since the Internet of objects is open on the Internet in object environments, security issues related to authentication of users accessing wireless networks are very important. AAA technology is the best possible way these days of resolving delay issue when introducing authentication process of mobile switching. However, despite long development in AAA technology, the mobility management in wireless network environment has yet to be researched further. To solve these problems, we propose a Proxy-Authentication Authorization Accounting (Proxy-AAA) authentication scheme. This places the AAA server in the LMA so as to the cost of authentication by means of a short, simple mobile authentication. The proposed method reuses the LMA-based session key in the authentication process when moving within the domain, and reuses the AAA server based session key when moving between domains. The AAA server of the scheme will be deployed on Local Mobility Anchor (LMA), making up for the shortage of simple fast handover authentication and hierarchical authentication, and further reducing the cost of intra-domain authentication.	aaa (video game industry);authentication;internet of things;profiling (computer programming)	Chulhee Cho;Byunghun Song;Jongpil Jeong;Tai-Myung Chung	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-60717-7_3	wireless network;wireless sensor network;handover;the internet;session key;computer network;mobility management;internet of things;authentication;computer science	Mobile	-23.495451271051838	82.677655729515	76607
02df6a1575f266dc32642626d8bf7e493d634be6	reconciling d+1 masking in hardware and software		The continually growing number of security-related autonomous devices requires efficient mechanisms to counteract low-cost side-channel analysis (SCA) attacks. Masking provides high resistance against SCA at an adjustable level of security. A high level of SCA resistance, however, goes hand in hand with an increasing demand for fresh randomness which drastically increases the implementation costs. Since hardware based masking schemes have other security requirements than software masking schemes, the research in these two fields has been conducted quite independently over the last ten years. One important practical difference is that recently published software schemes achieve a lower randomness footprint than hardware masking schemes. In this work we combine existing software and hardware masking schemes into a unified masking algorithm. We demonstrate how to protect software and hardware implementations using the same masking algorithm, and for lower randomness costs than the separate schemes. Especially for hardware implementations the randomness costs can in some cases be halved over the state of the art. Theoretical considerations as well as practical implementation results are then used for a comparison with existing schemes from different perspectives and at different levels of security.	algorithm;autonomous robot;high-level programming language;randomness;requirement;side-channel attack	Hannes Groß;Stefan Mangard	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-66787-4_6	theoretical computer science;hardware security module;randomness;implementation;d-1;real-time computing;computer science;masking (art);software;computer hardware	Crypto	-32.900928589716045	74.64591928329267	76850

In this context, the main challenge consists in mining the traffic flows with high accuracy and limited memory consumption. In this respect, we introduce a novel algorithm, which mines the approxi- mate closed frequent patterns over a stream of packets within a sliding window model. The latter is based on a relaxation rate parameter as well as an approximate support concept. Our experiment results show the robustness and efficiency of our new algorithm against those in the literature.

a59cfdd708a565787cec089511db51d106474491	simple mail delivery protocol - recipient-based email delivery with anti-spam support		In this paper we propose a user based architecture for the email system, where the recipient of an email message manage its receipt in conjunction with both origin and destination email servers. Messages are kept to the origin email server until a confirmation from the recipient is issued though the destination email server. Therefore, spam email doesn’t travel the Internet and doesn’t overload the destination email server and recipient's mailbox. White and black lists for (sender, email_server) pairs are built automatically following user evaluation. With our proposal, full control is delegated to the recipient over the email activity. On the server side, Simple Mail Delivery Protocol (SMDP) manages email delivery and options. SMDP server acts as a gateway for sending emails, a repository for the users' mailboxes and a central point for managing user options related to email filtering and spam handling. The solution is suitable for group/business email handling.	anti-spam techniques;compiler;email filtering;function overloading;inbound marketing;internet;on the fly;outbound laptop;personalization;server (computing);server-side;spamming;user (computing)	Dimitris Zisiadis;Spyros Kopsidas;Leandros Tassiulas	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-37437-1_9	architecture;the internet;server-side;world wide web;email filtering;receipt;computer network;server;business;communication source;default gateway	Networks	-25.88080609080463	87.76724423585192	81647

However, the mobile gaming user experience may be limited by the communication constraint imposed by available wireless networks and computation constraint imposed by the cost and availability of cloud servers. In this paper, we propose a rendering adaptation technique which can adapt the game rendering parameters to satisfy CMG communication and computation constraints, such that the overall mobile gaming user experience is maximized. Experiments conducted on a commercial UMTS network demonstrate that the proposed rendering adaptation techniques can make the CMG approach feasible: ensuring protection against wireless network conditions, and ensuring server computation scalability, thereby ensuring acceptable mobile gaming user experience.	3d rendering;cloud computing;computation;experiment;graphics processing unit;mobile device;mobile game;scalability;selection algorithm;server (computing);user experience	Shaoxuan Wang;Sujit Dey	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684144	games;real-time computing;mobile search;universal mobile telecommunications system;simulation;mobile telephony;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;wireless network;mobile device;multimedia;mobile computing;server;computer network;satisfiability	Mobile	-20.161218039207807	75.40616661265561	81669

These architectures should be adaptable to the conditions at the event site and resilient enough to operate under adverse conditions in an emergency. Furthermore, they should enable rapid gathering of crucial event data and its delivery to the responder units at the site as well as the command and control center that is off-site. In this article, we first examine the state of the art in areas related to communication in PPDR systems, and discuss the open research issues for each topic. Then we propose a novel architecture that meets the aforementioned requirements and relies on a novel device called an ICG. An ICG enables flexible use of the spectrum and facilitates data gathering from all lower-tier devices and relays this data to relevant units through the higher-tier public or commercial backhaul networks. Finally, we provide some results that justify the need for these devices in emergency scenarios.	backhaul (telecommunications);inversive congruential generator;multitier architecture;next-generation network;off-site data protection;open research;relay;requirement	Özgür Ergül;Ghalib A.

Although a user with a multiple-interface mobile node may desire the ability to communicate locally, perhaps while disconnected from the Internet, MobileIP offers no such support.Contact Networking provides lightweight, localized network communication to a node with diverse network interfaces. The goal is to provide support for local connectivity equivalent to that provided by MobileIP for remote connectivity. The concept of link-layer awareness enables Contact Networking to tailor its operation to different links, using link-layer native services to implement abstract services when possible. Interface management and autoconfiguration insulate the user from concerns about the number and type of interfaces available.In this paper, we motivate the need for localized mobility, and present the design and architecture of Contact Networking. Details of our prototype implementation illustrate the complexities of providing a localized mobility facility.	aggregate data;authentication;auto-configuration;booting;cns;documentation;hoc (programming language);internet;mathematical optimization;mobile ip;network packet;peer-to-peer;personal digital assistant;prototype;regret (decision theory);requirement;routing;service discovery;superword level parallelism;tunneling protocol;usability;vulnerability (computing)	Casey Carter;Robin Kravets;Jean Tourrilhes	2003		10.1145/1066116.1066119	link layer;telecommunications;computer science;network interface;mobility model;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-22.196673470107648	83.8203417437664	83085
08838b22751c97c51880b05d3450114b03eee2ad	an buffering optimization algorithm for cooperative mobile service		With the development of wireless network technology and embedded technology, mobile devices have more powerful hardware and are used wildly than before. However, mobile services have different features compared with the traditional desktop services. Different types of wireless networks can provide different network widths for the mobile services. When images are transferred to mobile devices. The performance will be affected by network circumstances. This makes it necessary to adjust the buffering strategy for local data to improve the user experiences. In this paper, a novel buffering optimization algorithm is proposed for cooperative mobile service. The buffering optimization model is constructed as basis and the algorithm can adjust the buffering strategy according to the real-time network width. The traffic will be reduced to achieve better response to users and save the limited network width. The experimental results show that this algorithm can improve the performance without loss of the user experiences.	algorithm	Lei Hu;Huan Shen;Qingsong Shi;Jiajia Xu;Wei Hu;Peng Ke	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-52015-5_9	computer network	Robotics	-19.83591032738048	75.11967793374222	83794

One of the criticisms of SNMP is that it suffers from a common failing of such client-server based paradigms, namely the performance problems caused by all traffic being directed to and from a single location (the network management platform). The behaviour of such client-server applications has been explored through the use of the OPNET simulation system, populating the model using data collected from a study of the way a network management platform is used both to monitor a properly-functioning network and to collect information in response to fault situations. Initial results are presented for version 1 of SNMP showing the behaviour of the resultant system over a network configuration which includes both local and wide area network links.	agent-based model;client–server model;failure;mobile agent;performance tuning;population;resultant;server (computing);simple network management protocol;simulation	Colin Pattinson	2001			network management;out-of-band management;fcaps;element management system;network traffic control;intelligent computer network;network architecture;network management station;computer science;operating system;fault management;network simulation;distributed computing;network management application;simple network management protocol;structure of management information;computer security;computer network	Networks	-21.995248802715818	82.07861373168663	84439

It employs only off-the-shelf PC components and is capable of guaranteeing the real-time delivery of digital video streams from the server’s disk subsystem, through an Ethernet network, to an end user’s display. The SBVS integrates a software-based disk array with a Real-Tune Ethernet Protocol, RETHER, which gtrarantees the smooth delivery of multimedia data while allowing nonreal-time traffic to coexist on the same LAN. While outlining all of the design issues that must be addressed when building a LANbased video server, this papw focuses on three main design and implementation issues: 1) retrieval algorithms for reading multimedia files from a software-driven disk array for supporting normal playback, slow-motion playback, and rewind; 2) buffer management and organization; and, 3) client-side support for rewind of MPEG video streams. The papw also presents several unanticipated problems that arose when implementing the SBVS and our solutions. It is hoped that other designers can learn from our experiences for the developmmt of future video servers.	algorithm;auto-tune;brookgpu;central processing unit;certificate authority;client-side;coexist (image);data rate units;data striping;digital video;disk array;end-to-end principle;entity–relationship model;experience;file server;hardware description language;ibm research;jolla;linear algebra;mpeg transport stream;management system;media controls;megabit;moving picture experts group;operating system;optimizing compiler;oracle multimedia;playout;real-time clock;rico;scalability;scheduling (computing);server (computing);simulation;sitara arm processor;streaming media;vehicle identification number;video server;videocassette recorder	Michael Vernick;Chitra Venkatramani;Tzi-cker Chiueh	1996		10.1145/244130.244230	h.263;disk array;uncompressed video;computer science;operating system;video capture;multimedia;video processing;smacker video;world wide web;server;computer graphics (images);non-linear editing system	OS	-25.998422075418787	78.53735965314965	84964

In this paper, we study a network-assisted UPC service model, where a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) enables its subscribers to operate as mobile WiFi hotspots (hosts) and provide Internet connectivity for others. A unique aspect of this service model is that the MVNO offers some free data quota to hosts as reimbursements (incentives) for connectivity sharing. This reimbursing scheme, together with a usage-based pricing, constitute a revolutionary hybrid data pricing-reimbursing scheme, which has not been considered before. We analyze the different impacts of data price and reimbursement on the host's connectivity sharing decision systematically. Based on this analysis, we further derive the optimal hybrid pricing-reimbursing policy that maximizes the MVNO's revenue. Our numerical result indicates that by using the proposed hybrid pricing policy, the MVNO can increase its revenue by 20% to 135% under an elastic client demand, and by 20% to 550% under an inelastic client demand, comparing to those achieved under a pricing-only policy.	alok r. chaturvedi;hotspot (wi-fi);numerical analysis;programming paradigm	Lin Gao;George Iosifidis;Jianwei Huang;Leandros Tassiulas	2014	IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6847994	computer security;computer network	Metrics	-23.73611327126587	76.12528709718919	85125

A multi-utility company could exploit wired and wireless communications to make homogenous access to smart metering even in hard-to-reach locations. For this reason, several standard solutions have been proposed in the recent past, all having a common approach based on the use of narrowband and robust modulation schemes. This paper suggests the adoption of a reconfigurable and multi-core approach for implementing a smart meter capable to easily switch among different standards and various application scenarios. The basic idea is to exploit the """"software defined"""" paradigm for the realization of the three main units of a smart meter, i.e., the communication, the time synchronization and the measurement subsystems. A prototypal platform has been developed around low-cost GPP and DSP cores, using an FPGA for the implementation of reconfigurable peripherals, without losing in generality. Some experimental results have been carried out to verify the affordability and feasibility of the proposed approach, highlighting requirements in terms of computational and memory resource needs. A multi-standard and multi-utility reconfigurable smart meter is proposed.The software defined approach is pursued to be compliant with evolving standards.Heterogeneous reconfigurable approach is suggested as a viable solution.A proof-of-concept prototype is realized for testing complexity and feasibility."""

One consideration is to use GMPLS protocols to upgrade the control plane of optical transport networks. This document illustrates this process by describing those extensions to GMPLS protocols that are aimed at controlling Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) or Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) networks. SDH/SONET networks make good examples of this process for a variety of reasons. This document highlights extensions to GMPLS-related routing protocols to disseminate information needed in transport path computation and network operations, together with (G)MPLS protocol extensions required for the provisioning of transport circuits. New capabilities that an GMPLS control plane would bring to SDH/SONET networks, such as new restoration methods and multi-layer circuit establishment, are also discussed. Bernstein, et al.

c2e102833ca7a6c38d93be095a3eff25bdd77d3d	clusters in the expanse: understanding and unbiasing ipv6 hitlists		Network measurements are an important tool in understanding the Internet. Due to the expanse of the IPv6 address space, exhaustive scans as in IPv4 are not possible for IPv6. In recent years, several studies have proposed the use of target lists of IPv6 addresses, called IPv6 hitlists.  In this paper, we show that addresses in IPv6 hitlists are heavily clustered. We present novel techniques that allow IPv6 hitlists to be pushed from quantity to quality. We perform a longitudinal active measurement study over 6 months, targeting more than 50 M addresses. We develop a rigorous method to detect aliased prefixes, which identifies 1.5 % of our prefixes as aliased, pertaining to about half of our target addresses. Using entropy clustering, we group the entire hitlist into just 6 distinct addressing schemes. Furthermore, we perform client measurements by leveraging crowdsourcing.  To encourage reproducibility in network measurement research and to serve as a starting point for future IPv6 studies, we publish source code, analysis tools, and data.	address space;cluster analysis;crowdsourcing;internet	Oliver Gasser;Quirin Scheitle;Pawel Foremski;Qasim Lone;Maciej Korczynski;Stephen D.

The justification in IPv4 was avoiding address changes and pool preservation. With delegated prefixes, changing the client prefix causes routing changes and reconvergence, which is usually user-visible. And the number of available subnets in a prefix pool is in the same order of magnitude as IPv4 addresses, not the billions and billions of addresses available in an IPv6 pool. Hence, we're back to needing to solve the same problems, with the same resulting solution: failover. AlterNet and the modem network used by MSN, AOL, and Earthlink.

214dfa16ff60bfddab14fb495eb282f4ec6d63ba	tweeting 'when online is off'? opportunistically creating mobile ad-hoc networks in response to disrupted infrastructure		In this paper, we present a system that enables people to post and receive tweets despite disruptions of existing network infrastructure. Our system opportunistically deploys mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) based on Wi-Fi in which people can communicate with each other in a peer-to-peer fashion. A MANET per se constitutes an isolated island, but as people carry devices around that can join other MANETs, eventually people can transport previously collected data to the online world. Compared to other systems that aim to enable communication in crisis, our system differs in two ways: it does not rely on existing network infrastructure, and it exploits established protocols and standards allowing it to run on off-the-shelf, commercially available smartphones. We evaluated our prototype with a group of students and practitioners. Overall, we received positive feedback on the potential of our technology, but also were pointed to limitations requiring future work.	blackberry messenger (bbm);hoc (programming language);institute for operations research and the management sciences;mobile operating system;mobile phone;peer-to-peer;positive feedback;prototype;smartphone;social media;text-based (computing)	Amro Al-Akkad;Christian Raffelsberger;Alexander Boden;Leonardo Ramirez;Andreas Zimmermann	2014			telecommunications;engineering;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-27.917061553685453	77.88467130954167	87901

In this study, the Quality of Service (QoS) needed to support service continuity in heterogeneous networks is achieved by a Distributed Multi-Agent Scheme (DMAS) based on cooperation concepts and an awareness algorithm. A set of problem solving agents autonomously process local tasks and cooperatively interoperate via an in-cloud blackboard system to provide QoS and mobility information. A Q-Learning awareness algorithm calculates the exceptive rewards of a handoff to all access networks. These rewards are then used by problem solving agents to determine what actions must be performed. Agents located in the integrated IMS-4G-Cloud networks handle service continuity by using a handoff mechanism. Through operations and cooperation among active agents, these phases select a policy for predictive and anticipated IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) handoff management. Compared with conventional IMS handoff management, the proposed DMAS scheme achieves shorter handoff delay and better QoS for real-time service applications.	multi-agent system;scott continuity	Han-Chuan Hsieh;Jiann-Liang Chen	2015	Computers & Electrical Engineering	10.1016/j.compeleceng.2014.07.017	real-time computing;mobile qos;heterogeneous network;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	AI	-19.801238878240294	82.1413033540044	88462

6c16b28cf92134e7500942e49e3b81b19ed39bf1	test sequence reduction of wireless protocol conformance testing to internet of things		Wireless communication protocols are indispensable in Internet of Things (IoT), which refer to rules and conventions that must be followed by both entities to complete wireless communication or service. Wireless protocol conformance testing concerns an effective way to judge whether a wireless protocol is carried out as expected. Starting from existing test sequence generation methods in conformance testing, an improved method based on overlapping by invertibility and multiple unique input/output (UIO) sequences is proposed in this paper. The method is accomplished in two steps: first, maximum-length invertibility-dependent overlapping sequences (IDOSs) are constructed, then a minimum-length rural postman tour covering the just constructed set of maximum-length IDOSs is generated and a test sequence is extracted from the tour. The soundness and effectiveness of the method are analyzed. Theory and experiment show that desirable test sequences can be yielded by the proposed method to reveal violations of wireless communication protocols in IoT.	computer engineering;concatenation;conformance testing;information science;internet of things;robotics;software testing	Weiwei Lin;Hongwei Zeng;Honghao Gao;Huaikou Miao;Xiaolin Wang	2018	Security and Communication Networks	10.1155/2018/3723691	computer science;computer network;wireless;wireless application protocol;conformance testing;route inspection problem;soundness;internet of things	AI	-29.900447855562266	81.94011771471298	94813

983968729077808cf791c610c0df240e734f1ead	a cross layer protocol for traffic management in social internet of vehicles		Abstract One of the important members of Internet of Things (IoT); transportation vehicles are utilizing sudden advancements of communication technology. Now days, to make the Social IoT (SIoT) a reality there are many on-going world-wide research initiatives and standardization efforts. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an extension to the concept of SIoT that proposes Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV). SIoV is an example of SIoT, where Smart vehicles are the objects of SIoT that builds social relationship and interchanges information to enhance the driving knowledge and gives various services to the drivers. In this paper, the proposed Vehicular Social Networks based on the VIoT consist of a large number of sensors that transmit data wirelessly. However, the very high heterogeneity in hardware capabilities of things and QoS requirements for different applications limits the performance of classical layered protocol solutions and the existing cross-layer solutions for wireless sensor networks. The results show that the proposed VSNP (Vehicular Social Network Protocol) for VIoT based on WSN solution can achieve a global communication optimum and outperforms existing layered solutions. The novel cross-layer module is a primary step towards providing efficient traffic management and reliable vehicle to vehicle communication in the SIoT. We have proposed an algorithm to control traffic congestion and road safety for VIoT.		Bindiya Jain;Gursewak Brar;Jyoteesh Malhotra;Shalli Rani;Syed Hassan Ahmed	2018	Future Generation Comp.

This paper ties server locations to the dynamic discovery protocol of the High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryption such that information dissemination and computing resources can be optimized based on encryption tunnel formation regardless of the underlying topology. We show with analysis and simulation results that compared to leaving services centralized at the teleport, creating hierarchical servers and aligning server locations with encryption tunnel formation, results in better utilization of the network core resources, and improvements in client/server activities, both in terms of message download time and reliability (availability of information to the end user).	bittorrent protocol encryption;centralized computing;client–server model;download;global information grid;high assurance internet protocol encryptor;information system;köppen climate classification;quantum teleportation;reachability;server (computing);simulation	George F.

55422f2639b5509317d594bee3a81654202f9839	design and implementation of security gateway for synchrophasor based real-time control and monitoring in smart grid		Synchrophasor technology has numerous applications ranging from simple grid monitoring/visualization to real-time protection and control. Most legacy phasor measurement units (PMUs) and phasor data concentrators (PDCs) deployed in power grids support the IEEE C37.118.2 communication framework, which is highly vulnerable to cyber attacks due to lack of inherent security mechanisms. The IEC 61850-90-5 recently emerged as new communication framework with support for security features but its use in commercial devices is still very limited. The replacement of legacy PMUs/PDCs in power grids is a big challenge due to cost and deployment complexity. The concept of a gateway has recently been proposed in the literature to enable IEEE C37.118.2 compatible PMUs to send data in IEC 61850-90-5 format. However, the published gateway has limited features and also lacks security functionalities. This paper addresses security, interoperability, and integration issues between legacy and state-of-the-art phasor devices through the design of a security gateway. The security gateway is implemented with flexibility in mind and can be used for PMUs as well as PDCs under different configurations. It provides: 1) protocol conversion functionalities (from IEEE C37.118.2 to IEC 61850-90-5 and vice versa) and 2) security functionalities based on IEC recommended group domain of interpretation security mechanism. The security gateway is very compact in size, based on low-power ARM processor and inexpensive to be deployed in power systems. Through detailed experimental evaluation with real PMU data, this paper also validated the suitability of the security gateway for different types of synchrophasor applications with strict latency and data rate requirements.

900c7591c9694c7a2499a1cfff7d0d143f2553da	towards an emulated iot test environment for anomaly detection using nemu		The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a major change in the way we interact with increasingly ubiquitous connected devices such as smart objects and cyber-physical systems. It has also led to an exponential increase in the number of such Internet-connected devices over the last few years. Conducting extensive functional and performance testing is critical to assess the robustness and efficiency of IoT systems in order to validate them before their deployment in real life. However, creating an IoT test environment is a difficult and expensive task, usually requiring a significant amount of physical hardware and human effort to build it. This paper proposes a method to emulate an IoT environment using the Network Emulator for Mobile Universes (NEMU), itself built on the popular QEMU system emulator, in order to construct a testbed of inter-connected, emulated Raspberry Pi devices. Additionally, we experimentally demonstrate how our method can be successfully applied to IoT by showing how such an emulated environment can be used to detect anomalies in an IoT system.	anomaly detection;cyber-physical system;deployment environment;emulator;experiment;internet of things;raspberry pi 3 model b (latest version);real life;smart objects;software deployment;software performance testing;testbed;time complexity	Shane Brady;Adriana Hava;Philip Perry;John Murphy;Damien Magoni;A.

119cda7e76db20d6c3da31207faeaf9b1237e460	an architecture for internet data transfer	data gathering;lines of code;design and implementation;data transfer	This paper presents the design and implementation of DOT, a flexible architecture for data transfer. This architecture separates content negotiation from the data transfer itself. Applications determine what data they need to send and then use a new transfer service to send it. This transfer service acts as a common interface between applications and the lower-level network layers, facilitating innovation both above and below. The transfer service frees developers from re-inventing transfer mechanisms in each new application. New transfer mechanisms, in turn, can be easily deployed without modifying existing applications. We discuss the benefits that arise from separating data transfer into a service and the challenges this service must overcome. The paper then examines the implementation of DOT and its plugin framework for creating new data transfer mechanisms. A set of microbenchmarks shows that the DOT prototype performs well, and that the overhead it imposes is unnoticeable in the wide-area. End-to-end experiments using more complex configurations demonstrate DOT’s ability to implement effective, new data delivery mechanisms underneath existing services. Finally, we evaluate a production mail server modified to use DOT using trace data gathered from a live email server. Converting the mail server required only 184 lines-of-code changes to the server, and the resulting system reduces the bandwidth needed to send email by up to 20%.	content negotiation;email;experiment;overhead (computing);prototype;server (computing)	Niraj H Tolia;Michael Kaminsky;David G.

6af5291d5effdaab03df93dcb0860998ba4235ca	advances in green mobile networks	green mobile networks	Global warming and climate change have been a growing worldwide concern. Six sources, i.e., transportation, power, buildings, industry, agriculture and forestry, and land use, have been identified as major contributors to the rise of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from 40 giga-tonnes of CO2 equivalent (Gt CO2e) in 2002 to an estimate of 52 Gt CO2e in 2020. The mobile industry is seen as a potential enabler to reduce greenhouse gases contributed by these six sources provided that appropriate measures are implemented. On the other hand, the mobile industry itself will also contribute to CO2 emission through network operations, mobile equipments, etc. To meet the requirement of low-carbon economy development, it is necessary to reduce the operation expenditure or energy consumption of mobile networks, while maintaining acceptable quality of service. This special issue is intended to provide a forum for presenting, exchanging and discussing the recent advances on green mobile networks in terms of system architectures, networking & communication protocols, applications, testbed and prototype, traffic balance and energy-efficient cooperation transmission. In response to the call for contributions, we have received 52 paper submissions from both academia and industries that covered a variety of interesting topics. Two rounds of careful review by the guest editors and experts in the field led to 13 papers for inclusion in this issue. The first paper “A Survey of Green Mobile Networks: Opportunities and Challenges” by X. Wang et al. extensively surveyed various remarkable techniques toward green mobile networks (mainly targeting cellular networks). The survey discussed recent energy-efficient work from the perspective of the structure of mobile networks, ranging from the data center, core backhaul, macrocell, femtocell, end-hosts, application and services. Also it summarized the current research projects related to green mobile networks, along with the taxonomy of energy-efficiencymetrics (greenmetrics). Finally, potential future research opportunities and design challenges for green mobile networks were discussed and elaborated in this survey paper. The second paper entitled by “ARIVU: Making Networked Mobile Games Green” by B. Anand et al. proposed an adaptive middleware that uses set of novel techniques and algorithms to conserve energy consumed by wireless interface, display and processor of mobile devices without affecting the quality of game play. With the advent of feature rich Smartphone platforms, growth rate of global smart phone sales escalates in two-digit figures in recent years. The amount of resources required in a mobile device is application dependent. Multiplayer Mobile games, one of the most downloaded applications, demand resources at their peak levels due to their interactive nature. The middleware described in the paper optimises the use of wireless resources according to demand by predicting the game state and saves up to 60% of total energy consumed by the wireless interface which translates to saving 27% of overall system energy.

Exploiting movement data and context information of diurnal user movements (public transportation, vehicular users, etc.) allows for predicting cell transitions and lays the basis e.g. for designing efficient resource reservation schemes or smart resource mapping approaches. In real life scenarios, several mobile users co-travel in public transport forming data intensive moving user clusters or moving networks. Various load balancing solutions exist to manage congestion situations that could arise. However, the crucial trigger for these solutions is timely prediction of arrival of moving user clusters or moving networks into a cell. This paper presents prediction and detection schemes that exploit context information for predicting user cell transitions and resulting congestion. These schemes are utilized to anticipate the arrival of data intensive moving user groups/moving networks, which are also referred to as """"hotspots"""", into a cell.

It implements a centralized topology for network monitoring and control. The centralized piconet coordinator (PNC) needs to be dynamically selected depending on a number of categories that measure its abilities as the most capable device compared to the surrounding devices in the network. This article presents an extension to the PNC selection criteria in IEEE 802.15.3 by modifying the reserved fields readily available in the standard to support user-centricity as well as other higher layer service dependent criteria. This article also develops the implementation process for the message header exchange between devices to support this new selection process.

However, existing sensor network architectures have been developed in isolation and thus interoperability has not been a concern. Recently, IP has been proposed as a solution to the interoperability problem of low-power and lossy networks (LLNs), considering its open and standards-based architecture at the network, transport, and application layers. We present two complete and interoperable implementations of the IPv6 protocol stack for LLNs, one for Contiki and one for TinyOS, and show that the cost of interoperability is low: their performance and overhead is on par with state-of-the-art protocol stacks custom built for the two platforms. At the same time, extensive testbed results show that the ensemble performance of a mixed network with nodes running the two interoperable stacks depends heavily on implementation decisions and parameters set at multiple protocol layers. In turn, these results argue that the current industry practice of interoperability testing does not cover the crucial topic of the performance and motivate the need for generic techniques that quantify the performance of such networks and configure their run-time behavior.	contiki;interoperability;lossy compression;low-power broadcasting;overhead (computing);protocol stack;testbed;tinyos	JeongGil Ko;Joakim Eriksson;Nicolas Tsiftes;Stephen Dawson-Haggerty;Jean-Philippe Vasseur;Mathilde Durvy;Andreas Terzis;Adam Dunkels;David E.

95e32ffbe1afc751e97712400c60c76d742ee02a	caching to reduce mobile app energy consumption		Mobile applications consume device energy for their operations, and the fast rate of battery depletion on mobile devices poses a major usability hurdle. After the display, data communication is the second-biggest consumer of mobile device energy. At the same time, software applications that run on mobile devices represent a fast-growing product segment. Typically, these applications serve as front-end display mechanisms, which fetch data from remote servers and display the information to the user in an appropriate format—incurring significant data communication overheads in the process. In this work, we propose methods to reduce energy overheads in mobile devices due to data communication by leveraging data caching technology. A review of existing caching mechanisms revealed that they are primarily designed for optimizing response time performance and cannot be easily ported to mobile devices for energy savings. Further, architectural differences between traditional client-server and mobile communications infrastructures make the use of existing caching technologies unsuitable in mobile devices. In this article, we propose a set of two new caching approaches specifically designed with the constraints of mobile devices in mind: (a) a response caching approach and (b) an object caching approach. Our experiments show that, even for a small cache size of 250MB, object caching can reduce energy consumption on average by 45% compared to the no-cache case, and response caching can reduce energy consumption by 20% compared to the no-cache case. The benefits increase with larger cache sizes. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method and raise the possibility of significantly extending mobile device battery life.	android;cache (computing);client–server model;depletion region;emoticon;experiment;megabyte;mobile app;mobile device;operating system;response time (technology);server (computing);usability;web cache;world wide web	Kaushik Dutta;Debra E.

However, assessments of those new DCN architectures are mainly concentrated in load balancing, improvement of architectures and as well as some research of performance analysis in visualized environment. Moreover, none of them focus on the security in DCN architectures. In this paper, we propose contribution matrix method based on information entropy theory from the point of view of node importance which is the basic of the topology vulnerability. In addition, we conduct an experimental evaluation of the state-of-the-art Multi-rooted Tree and FiConn architectures, each respectively as a representative of the switch-centric network architecture and server-centric network architecture. Firstly, we use an undirected graph theory to describe the architecture. Secondly, we obtain the associated matrix of betweenness and degree, and calculate their weights by information entropy theory. And then, according to the definition 3 (see Section III-B); we obtain the contribution matrix for each one. Last but not least, we get the value of node importance for each node of normalized. Compared with other methods, our proposed method is effective and has a much higher accuracy. Furthermore, our method is generic and can be widely used for the new DCN architectures.	algorithm;betweenness;cloud computing;cloud computing security;computer security;data center;dynamic circuit network;entropy (information theory);graph (discrete mathematics);graph theory;information theory;load balancing (computing);matrix method;network architecture;network topology;server (computing)	Kai Peng;Rongheng Lin;Binbin Huang;Hua Zou;Fangchun Yang	2013	JNW	10.4304/jnw.8.6.1248-1254	computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;algorithm;computer network	ML	-24.82171869647164	78.2906523540467	101534

There are a number of features of the TEDServices system that illustrate active network management for such data. There is a self-aware or intelligent aspect with respect to the mechanisms for shutdown, data ordering, and propagation of data orders. Intelligent cache management and collaborative application sharing process are other features of the active network management. Additionally a very important capability is the implementation of resumable object streams, which allows either the client or server side of a request to lose network connection, regain it, and the request will continue where it left off. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	active network management;active networking;distributed computing;john d. wiley;network architecture;self-awareness;sentience;server-side;shutdown (computing);software propagation	Roy Ladner;Elizabeth Warner;Udaykiran Katikaneni;Frank P.

It allows the network to configure and reconfigure itself under environment changes without any human intervention. Our solution operates in a peer-to-peer manner and does not require any centralized entity to perform network management functions. Each mobile node implementing ADMA components is able to take the appropriate decision based on predefined high level policies and collected monitoring information. We present in this paper the basic components of an ADMA node. Then, we provide a simple self-configuring case study of our design considering Voice over IP (VoIP) as a test application.

Our produced analytical and simulation results corroborate the asymptotic insensitivity of the stationary reliability of the system in question (under the “fast” recovery of its elements) to the type of the “repair” time distribution, thus supporting the fault-tolerant system operation.	augmented reality;cache (computing);computation;fault tolerance;mathematical model;simulation;stationary process;wearable technology	Aleksandr Ometov;Dmitry Kozyrev;Vladimir Rykov;Sergey Andreev;Yulia Gaidamaka;Yevgeni Koucheryavy	2017	Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing	10.1155/2017/9625687	distributed computing;computer science;computer network;computation;augmented reality;wearable computer;delegation;mobile telephony	Mobile	-20.93810517841562	76.65528568238538	103258

242ec7b8f39a5cb4f9af98531da6b4798967fe8f	benchmarking wireless protocols for feasibility in supporting crowdsourced mobile computing		Recent advances in mobile device technology have triggered research on using their aggregate computational and/or storage resources to form edge-clouds. Whilst traditionally viewed as simple clients, smartphones and tablets today have hardware resources that allow more sophisticated software to be installed, and can be used as thick clients or even thin servers. Simultaneously, new standards and protocols, such as Wi-Fi Direct and Wi-Fi TDLS Tunneled Direct Link Setup, have been established that allow mobile devices to talk directly with each other, as opposed to over the Internet or across Wi-Fi access points. This can, potentially, lead to ubiquitous, low-latency, device-to-device D2D communication. In this paper, we study whether D2D protocols can support mobile-edge clouds by benchmarking different protocols and configurations for a specific application. The results show that decentralized device-to-device techniques can be used to efficiently disseminate multi- media contents while diminishing contention in the wireless infrastructure, allowing for upi¾źto 65i¾ź% traffic reduction at the access points.	crowdsourcing;mobile computing	João Rodrigues;Joaquim Silva;Rolando Martins;Luís M.

CIs, like many other organizations connected to the Internet, are prone to cyber-attacks. The attacks can originate from their trusted customers or peer CIs. Distributed network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) can be deployed within the network of national Network Service Providers to support cyber-attack mitigation. However, determining the optimal placement of NIDS devices is a complex problem that should take into account budget constraints, network topology, communication patterns, and more. In this paper we model interconnected CIs as a communication overlay network and propose using Group Betweenness Centrality as a guiding heuristic in optimizing placement of NIDS with respect to the overlay network. We analyze the effectiveness of the proposed placement strategy by employing standard epidemiological models and compare it to placement strategies suggested in the literature.	intrusion detection system	Rami Puzis;Marius David Klippel;Yuval Elovici;Shlomi Dolev	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-89900-6_20	intrusion detection system;budget constraint;overlay network;epidemic model;computer science;critical infrastructure;distributed computing;betweenness centrality;computer security;network topology;computer network	EDA	-24.37364435542459	78.73141211699699	104500

The purpose of SON management is thereby to jointly instrument and configure a multitude of independent SON functions according to objectives defined by the Mobile Network Operator (MNO). Existing approaches such as Policy-based SON Management (PBSM) use action policies for decision making. Utility-based SON Management (UBSM), instead, uses utility function policies, where the utility reflects the degree of satisfaction of an objective for a certain network state. The demonstrator described in this paper represents a graphical frontend for the simulation environment that allows to compare the effectiveness of UBSM with an unmanaged SON implementation.	front and back ends;radio access network;simulation;utility	Christoph Frenzel;Simon Lohmuller;Lars-Christoph Schmelz;Henning Sanneck	2016	2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794577	network management;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Arch	-20.06754493580512	82.64994967120631	104772

Abstract This document defines Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) support for the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), an authentication framework which supports multiple authentication mechanisms. In the proposed scheme, the Network Access Server (NAS) forwards EAP packets to and from the RADIUS server, encapsulated within EAP-Message attributes. This has the advantage of allowing the NAS to support any EAP authentication method, without the need for method-specific code, which resides on the RADIUS server. While EAP was originally developed for use with PPP, it is now also in use with IEEE 802.	extensible authentication protocol;internet;network access server;point-to-point protocol;radius;server (computing)	Bernard Aboba;Pat R.

Several prototypes have been proposed, but all face daunting concerns in the areas of performance, complexity, backwards compatibility, and user security and privacy. We propose a protocol which creates globally-unique data item names and embeds these names, plus associated metadata, into an IPv6 header. We then show how this allows the use of the IPsec suite of protocols to mitigate user privacy and security concerns. Next, we show that using RFC-compliant IPv6 datagrams as the named content allows content routing to be done using standard gateway protocols and also ensures backwards compatibility with unmodified networks. Lastly, we give an example of how the CLIP header's structure will simplify the design of automatic caches in the network.	application-oriented networking;backward compatibility;complexity;data item;datagram;entity;icn gps;ipsec;privacy;routing	Laura Heath;Henry Owen;Raheem A.

Applications on our personal devices should be able to autonomously and continuously harvest the information provided at that location and interrupt us only when it is important to do so. Currently, client devices are designed for explicit querying for information rather than continuous background harvesting of relevant information. To enable ubiquitous access to location-specific information, we can take advantage of the widespread deployment of WiFi networks. There is a wealth of location-specific information that network providers are willing to make publicly available to any users. However, today's models for accessing wireless networks do not easily support this due primarily to concerns over security and bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we present and compare the different methods that can be applied to solve the problem of continuous background access to location-specific information. Specifically, we compare client-pull and server-push models and show how tradeoffs can be made involving privacy, power consumption on devices, and utilization of wireless bandwidth. We also present three applications and discuss how the tradeoffs affect their design.	freedom of information laws by country;privacy;pull technology;push technology;sensor;server (computing);software deployment;ubiquitous computing	Jong Hee Kang;Gaetano Borriello	2006		10.1007/11752967_7	systems modeling;confidentiality;internationalization and localization;human–computer interaction;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;computer security;ubiquitous computing;bandwidth;telecommunications network	Mobile	-26.569218326248983	80.67940145564286	105557

Therefore, applications relying on data sharing for collaboration will increase, and effective distributed solutions for data storage become necessary. This need led to the proposal of a CoAP Usage for RELOAD, a generic P2P protocol that accepts pluggable application layers (Usages). This allows P2P overlay networks to be built where constrained systems store their data and clients are able to retrieve it. Since many smart systems rely on wireless networks to communicate, where network coding can be used to reduce packet error rate, P2P overlays should be prepared to store data from network coding based networks. More specifically, encoding vectors and encoded data must be stored, and a decoding service is required. In this article, we propose a CoAP Usage extension so that network coding based constrained networks can use RELOAD/CoAP P2P distributed storage.	constrained application protocol;linear network coding	Eman Al-Hawri;Noélia S.

This protocol is a combination of the Sensor Communication Language (SENCOMLNG) and the eXtensible Binary Enconding (XBE32). SENCOMLNG is an XML-based language. XBE32 provides an efficient encoding of the SENCOMLNG in order to reduce the bandwidth utilization and the processing cost in the WSN gateways, that in many scenarios could also be resource-restricted devices. Finally, we present a test-bed based on JAVA as well as a comparison between our proposal and other solutions showing that LWESP outperforms all the previous proposals in terms of bandwidth utilization.	communications protocol;extensibility;gw-basic;java;routing;sensor;testbed;universal plug and play;web service;xml	Ángel Cuevas;Manuel Urueña;Annett Laube;Laurent Gomez	2009	2009 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications	10.1109/ISCC.2009.5202338	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	-24.993422070660873	84.46339818012204	106292

To accelerate industrial application developments, the use of web services for networking applications is seen as important in IoT communications. In this paper, we present a RESTful web service architecture for energy-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to enable remote data collection from sensor devices in WSN nodes. Specifically, we consider both IPv6 protocol support in WSN nodes as well as an integrated gateway solution to allow any Internet clients to access these nodes. We describe the implementation of a prototype system, which demonstrates the proposed RESTful approach to collect sensing data from a WSN. A performance evaluation is presented to illustrate the simplicity and efficiency of our proposed scheme.

To enhance the capacity of smartphones, an interesting idea is to use Cloud Computing and virtualization techniques to shift the workload from smartphones to a computational infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a new framework which keeps a mirror for each smartphone on a computing infrastructure in the telecom network. With mirror, we can greatly reduce the workload and virtually expand the resources of smartphones. We show the feasibility of deploying such a framework in telecom networks by protocol design, synchronization study and scalability test. To show the benefit, we introduce two applications where both the computational workload on smartphones and network traffic in telecom networks can be significantly reduced by our techniques.	bluetooth;cloud computing;communications protocol;computation;disk mirroring;mobile app;network packet;scalability;smartphone;synchronization (computer science)	Bo Zhao;Zhi Xu;Caixia Chi;Sencun Zhu;Guohong Cao	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-29154-8_3	computer science;artificial intelligence	Mobile	-20.101057703692383	78.19146119855732	107393

Fault isolation is that action which hosts and gateways collectively take to determine that something is wrong; fault recovery is the identification and selection of an alternative route which will serve to reconnect the source to the destination. In fact, the gateways perform most of the functions of fault isolation and recovery. There are, however, a few actions which hosts must take if they wish to provide a reasonable level of service. This document describes the portion of fault isolation and recovery which is the responsibility of the host.	fault detection and isolation;network packet	David D.

To do so normally requires that the students have access to snoop and generate raw network traffic, which is a risk to privacy and security. And it normally requires each student to have a dedicated computer, and to modify the kernel. The Virtual Network System (VNS) is a teaching tool designed for undergraduate and graduate networking courses. With VNS, each student can build a router (or any packet-processing device) in user-space, in their own private, protected topology, and process real Internet traffic. VNS has been used by over 500 students at Stanford and remotely from other universities. This paper describes the VNS tool, and our experiences using it in the classroom.	debugging;firewall (computing);hands-on computing;internet;network packet;network traffic control;user space;snoop	Martín Casado;Nick McKeown	2005		10.1145/1047344.1047383	core router;network traffic control;simulation;niprnet;computer science;operating system;internet security;network simulation;one-armed router;computer security;computer network	Networks	-21.47615287694703	83.43965319471998	108143
5ca7f61d9fc64bab84c0d6cc4b251a678c8614c1	city of things: enabling resource provisioning in smart cities		In the last few years, traffic over wireless networks has been increasing exponentially due to the impact of IoT. IoT is transforming a wide range of services in different domains of urban life, such as environmental monitoring, home automation, and public transportation. The so-called smart city applications will introduce a set of stringent requirements, such as low latency and high mobility, since services must be allocated and instantiated on demand, simultaneously, close to multiple devices at different locations. Efficient resource provisioning functionalities are needed to address these demanding constraints introduced by smart city applications while minimizing resource costs and maximizing QoS. In this article, the CoT framework is presented, which provides not only data collection and analysis functionalities but also automated resource provisioning mechanisms for future smart city applications. CoT is deployed as a smart city testbed in Antwerp, Belgium, which allows researchers and developers to easily set up and validate IoT experiments. A smart city use case of air quality monitoring through the deployment of air quality sensors in moving cars is presented showing the full applicability of the CoT framework for a flexible and scalable resource provisioning in the smart city ecosystem.	ecosystem;experiment;home automation;provisioning;requirement;scalability;sensor;smart city;software deployment;testbed	Jose Santos;Thomas Vanhove;Merlijn Sebrechts;Thomas Dupont;Wannes Kerckhove;Bart Braem;Gregory van Seghbroeck;Tim Wauters;Philip Leroux;Steven Latré;Bruno Volckaert;Filip De Turck	2018	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2018.1701322	computer science;wireless network;computer network;quality of service;smart city;software deployment;latency (engineering);provisioning;testbed;home automation	Mobile	-19.691202169098446	80.43405726836777	108673

In the service, a customer can change its routing policy on the basis of a decision and set network notification policy for individual VPN users. These operations are conducted by an L1VPN NMS (network management system), which is distributed online by an L1VPN provider in EJB (enterprise java beans) format. In addition to the L1VPN NMS, EJB-based customer domain NMSs that manage individual customer domains are also delivered to individual customers. In cooperation with the provider NMS, which is for the L1VPN provider network, and the customer domain NMSs, an L1VPN NMS can update the L1VPN logical information from provider and customer domains. The L1VPN NMS receives alarm notifications from both NMSs and forwards them to IP users who are affected by the notifications. We evaluate the effect of an L1VPN on alarm notification time because swift alarm notification is critical for IP users. In addition, we evaluate the effect of deploying multiple customer domain NMSs in one Linux NMS server.	customer relationship management;end-to-end encryption;enterprise javabeans;java platform, enterprise edition;linux;no man's sky;open-source software;parallel computing;proliant;routing;server (computing);swift (programming language);systems architecture;virtual private network;wildfly	Hiroshi Matsuura;Naotaka Morita	2009	2009 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management	10.1109/INM.2009.5188869	unified modeling language;routing;computer science;operating system;tellurium;java;world wide web;computer security;network monitoring;bandwidth;server;computer network	OS	-20.124575030170668	86.28699523734625	109353

This paper describes a system researched to monitor such networks from the customer's perspective, but on behalf of the operator. The information generated allows the operator to determine whether the network is performing correctly or whether changes or customer load will require the network to be changed in some way. Such networks are increasingly important as many parts of the Internet are built on similar technologies. The paper specifically considers an architecture that encompasses all the main functionality involved in performance management of networks. Consideration is given to the management and dissemination of the data collected. A database to enhance network data mining performance is described. A method to identify the periods of significance in the measurement data based on a statistical test and a neural network is incorporated into a realization of the architecture.

One of their key features is that they utilize wireless communication media, thus freeing the user from the constraints of wired or tethered communication. In fact, the wireless medium becomes a critical component of the I/O subsystem, allowing communication with fixed servers and other users. In particular, the broadcast nature of the wireless medium can be exploited to efficiently transmit information required by a large number of PDA users (e.g. stock quotes, sports updates, etc.), with software on the PDA being used to filter the information and present only the information of interest to the PDA user.We introduce a simple model, called the airdisk, for modeling the access of data transmitted periodically over wireless media as being analogous to the access of data from a standard magnetic disk. We consider several issues related to airdisks, such as their mean rotational latency under certain assumptions. The problem of scheduling the order in which data items are broadcast is analogous to that of determining how data should be laid out on the disk. Two problems of laying out data so as to minimize read time, given information about which data items are of most interest to the clients, are defined; both are shown to be NP-complete. We discuss ways in which the information about which items are of interest to clients can be obtained. Finally we consider how to increase the performance and storage capacity of airdisks, using the magnetic disk analogy as a guide. We suggest using multiple-track airdisks or borrowing the idea of Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) which is used for magnetic disks; for the wireless data broadcast environment we call the latter approach airRAID.	access time;broadcasting (networking);floppy disk;hard disk drive performance characteristics;information filtering system;input/output;low-power broadcasting;magnetic storage;np-completeness;personal computer;personal digital assistant;raid;regular expression;scheduling (computing)	Ravi Jain;John Werth	1995	SIGARCH Computer Architecture News	10.1145/218864.218869	embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wi-fi array;wireless;raid	DB	-21.34146835456338	75.98144203595375	110452
9b1023381d8bbeb6716ff476a44d598effb2d8ab	extensions to ospf for advertising optional router capabilities		It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to know the capabilities of their neighbors and other routers in the routing domain. This document proposes extensions to OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 for advertising optional router capabilities. The Router Information (RI) Link State Advertisement (LSA) is defined for this purpose. In OSPFv2, the RI LSA will be implemented with an Opaque LSA type ID. In OSPFv3, the RI LSA will be implemented with a unique LSA type function code. In both protocols, the RI LSA can be advertised at any of the defined flooding scopes (link, area, or autonomous system (AS)). This document obsoletes RFC 4970 by providing a revised specification that includes support for advertisement of multiple instances of the RI LSA and a TLV for functional capabilities.	autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);link-state routing protocol;rs-232;router (computing);type-length-value	Acee Lindem;Naiming Shen;Jean-Philippe Vasseur;Rahul Aggarwal;Scott Shaffer	2016	RFC	10.17487/RFC7770	telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Networks	-24.15308635955908	88.30039440443286	110573

In ICN, per packet digital signature offers a built-in authentication capability down to the packet level and a fine-grained trust model, yet it is insufficient to address the emerging security challenges in service function chaining, e.g., data may be processed by fake intermediate function nodes. In this paper, we investigate a whole-chain security approach, namely Secure Function Chaining (SFC), which ensures authenticity and data integrity when delivering data content through a chain of function nodes in ICN. In particular, we propose a novel packet signature structure, which consists of a content stack and a signature stack. At the data source and each of intermediate function nodes, we prepend a fixed-length hashed content to the content stack and prepend an unmodified signature (for the hashed content) to the signature stack. The proposed solution enables a Consumer to verify not only the final delivered data content, but also each and every entity in the whole function chaining process - from a Producer to the last function node that delivered the final content. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments to evaluate the proposed function chaining process and its trust model. The results show the superior performance of the whole-chain security approach over the existing NDN security solution. The results show that the secure proposed scheme is an efficient scheme over the original hop-by-hop NDN signature scheme for a function chaining process and it can be used in substitute of the native scheme.	authentication;canonical account;computable function;data integrity;data-centric security;digital signature;experiment;future internet;hop-by-hop transport;icn gps;internet protocol suite;network packet;space-filling curve	Mehdi Bahrami;Liguang Xie;Lei Liu;Akira Ito;Yang Peng;Sevak Mnatsakanyan;Zilong Ye;Huiping Guo	2017	2017 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2017.7876164	computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-25.961541196601686	85.53571686204909	110638

65259a51b75a703ea8f9c469dedc216a18154e7c	distributed computing of management data in a telecommunications network		In this paper, we propose a concept for distributed Management Plane data computation and its delivery in the cellular networks. Architecture for proposed concept is described. Calculation of Key Performance Indicators is distributed to the cellular network edge, close to the managed network elements which reduces the volume of the Management Plane traffic. In this concept, further aggregation and refinement of data is done in the nodes located in the operator’s cloud, close to consumers of Management Plane data. Distribution of calculation to the network edge reduces load at the network operator’s central database. This paper presents an analysis to the benefits of the proposed concept. Efficient on-demand type streaming data delivery model allows network management functions to be plugged in to receive Management Plane data directly without database access. A demonstrator system has been implemented. The feasibility of the implementation is evaluated in terms of resource consumption and latency.	distributed computing;telecommunications network	Ville Kojola;Shubham Kapoor;Kimmo Hätönen	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-52712-3_11	fcaps;distributed algorithm;element management system;network planning and design;systems management;core network;open network architecture;network management station;network engineering;telecommunications control software;telecommunications service;distributed computing;telecommunications management network;network management application;structure of management information;network element;computer network;computer engineering	HPC	-19.547116142283787	82.74857794456975	111033

THIS emulates the mobile, tactical, network environment using the hardware in a static infrastructure. MATLAB-based tools implement the TENET emulation to simulate mobility induced link fragility, and the Distributed Adaptive Pre-computed Restoration (DAPR) algorithm to conduct dynamic network topology optimization. A fast, reconfigurable, full-mesh network of six nodes represents the resulting physical layer topology on a laboratory optical bench. A collection of LabVIEW programs, collectively named the Tactical Hardware Automation Tool (THAT), coordinates with TENET output and a Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based optical switch to dynamically conform the links between the six fixed nodes to the simulated network topology. Standard real-world programs are run at higher network layer protocols and respond to the dynamic physical layer accordingly. Thus, experiments utilizing this test bed can characterize network performance of the emulated mobile tactical network. This paper outlines the test bed in full, but will also briefly describe the network emulation methodology, as well as the initial results of some physical layer restoration performance to act as a baseline for future net-centric application testing.	algorithm;automation;baseline (configuration management);circuit restoration;emulator;experiment;labview;matlab;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;microelectromechanical systems;net-centric;network emulation;network performance;network topology;optical switch;radio frequency;simulation;software testing;testbed;topology optimization	William M.

7519fbf9e55f1d52e6fd45bc11c4cef266827a78	a tool for automating network simulation and processing tracing data files	ns 2;simulation analysis tool;trace file	One of the most highly regarded discrete event simulators used for network simulation is NS-2 (Network Simulator). NS-2 executes simulation scenarios producing various data of which trace files are considered the most beneficial for evaluating a simulation. In this paper we present the design considerations and implementation of a new tool that can be used both in TRAce FILe analysis and execution of simulations using NS-2. Although TRAFIL is primarily based on NS-2 trace files it can be extended to support a number of different other simulation trace file formats. It aims to make the execution of a great number of network simulations quicker, and the extraction of results from a large amount of data more flexible and productive. In order to accomplish the above tasks TRAFIL presents a novel way of interpreting, parsing, reading and eventually using NS-2 trace files. It introduces the notion of ‘‘metafiles’’ and ‘‘sub metafiles’’ throughout the procedures of trace file recognition and parsing, making the overall analysis operation substantially efficient and faster than alternative approaches. Metafiles and sub metafiles are used to encode NS-2 trace file structures enabling a more abstract approach to the trace file processing operation. Furthermore, TRAFIL facilitates the overall trace file analysis task by offering the opportunity to store each trace file as well as every Quality of Service (QoS) measurement produced for each trace file. Following the trace file recognition and processing operations, the information contained in a trace file is presented through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) offered by TRAFIL along with a variety of data, metrics and statistics related to simulation results. Finally, the tool offers the opportunity to execute custom Structured Query Language (SQL) queries to the local database and to completely automate the simulation procedure by enabling the user to execute NS-2 scripts as well as perform a simulation of a video transmission using the Evalvid-RA framework. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

516e2233fade3a4a0b614909117024686598f87c	comprehensive analysis on the vulnerability and efficiency of p2p networks under static failures and targeted attacks		Peer-to-peer systems are the networks consisting of a group of nodes possible to be as wide as the Internet. These networks are required of evaluation mechanisms and distributed control and configurations, so each peer (node) will be able to communicate with other peers. P2P networks actually act as the specific transportation systems created to provide some services such as searching, large-scale storage, context sharing, and supervisioning. Changes in configuration, possibly the resultant effects of faults and failures or of the natural nodes behavior, are one of the most important features in P2P networks. Resilience to faults and failures, and also an appropriate dealing with threats and attacks, are the main requirements of today’s most communication systems and networks. Thus, since P2P networks can be individually used as an infrastructure and an alternative for many other communication networks, they have to be more reliable, accessible, and resilient to the faults, failures and attacks compared to the client/server approach. In this work on progress, we present a detailed study on the behavior of various P2P networks toward faults and failures, and focus on fault-tolerance subject. We consider two different static failure scenarios: a) a random strategy in which nodes or edges of the network will be removed with an equal probability and without any knowledge of the network’s infrastructure, b) a targeted strategy that uses some information about the nodes, and in which the nodes with the highest degree have the most priority to be attacked. By static faults, we mean a situation where the nodes or components encounter some faults before the network starts to work or through its operation, and will remain faulty to the end of the work session. Our goal is to introduce various measures to analyzing P2P networks evaluating their vulnerability rate. The presented criteria can be used for evaluating the reliability and vulnerability of P2P networks toward both random and targeted failures. There is no limit to the number and types of failures, the presented measures are able to be used for different types of failures and even a wide range of networks.	betweenness;centrality;client–server model;continuation;distributed control system;emoticon;fault tolerance;greedy algorithm;internet;malware;matthews correlation coefficient;peer-to-peer;requirement;resultant;robustness of complex networks;server (computing);simulation;telecommunications network;vulnerability (computing)	Farshad Safaei;Hamidreza Sotoodeh	2013	CoRR		distributed computing;interdependent networks;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-28.985958559152017	75.36773605150435	112757

Research has been focused on dedicated routing and transport protocols, namely validated through simulation, with the lack of real deployments. Recently, IPv6 caught some research interest by introducing a unified technology vision between the internet and sensor networks, integrating a stack for internal IPv6 operation at the smart sensor level. Although a good approach for internet connectivity, IPv6based wireless sensor networks still lack the tools to enable ubiquitous computing, thus presenting the user with interfaces and capabilities to fully take advantage of sensing services for other applications. This paper presents a multi-channel data gathering solution with support for web visualisation, local computer application and mobile application. As a result, sensed data can be disseminated and consumed through various channels simultaneously, with adequate features and user interfaces. Moreover, the system features a Plug-and-Play like experience by abstracting hardware details and zero user configuration.	firmware;free-form deformation;graphical user interface;internet access;mobile app;multitier architecture;network performance;next-generation network;personal computer;plug and play;routing;simulation;smart transducer;three-layer architecture;throughput;ubiquitous computing;usability;user interface;web application;world wide web;zero-configuration networking	Paulo Alexandre Correia da Silva Neves;Andre Esteves;Rui Cunha;Joel Jos&#x00E9; P.

The ability to communicate seamlessly across multiple networks and domains is an open issue which is yet to be adequately addressed in smart grid architectures. In this paper, we present a framework for end-to-end interoperability in home and building area networks within smart grids. 6LoWPAN and the compact application protocol are utilized to facilitate the use of IPv6 and Zigbee application profiles such as Zigbee smart energy for network and application layer interoperability, respectively. A differential service medium access control scheme enables end-to-end connectivity between 802.15.4 and IP networks while providing quality of service guarantees for Zigbee traffic over Wi-Fi. We also address several issues including interference mitigation, load scheduling, and security and propose solutions to them.	automation	Peizhong Yi;Abiodun Iwayemi;Chi Zhou	2011	Int. J.

Nelson Traditionally, general web services used only the GET and POST methods of HTTP while several other HTTP methods like PUT, PATCH, and DELETE were rarely utilized. Additionally, the Web was mainly navigated by humans using web browsers and clicking on hyperlinks or submitting HTML forms. Clicking on a link is always a GET request while HTML forms only allow GET and POST methods. Recently, several web frameworks/libraries have started supporting RESTful web services through APIs. To support HTTP methods other than GET and POST in browsers, these frameworks have used hidden HTML form fields as a workaround to convey the desired HTTP method to the server application. In such cases, the web server is unaware of the intended HTTP method because it receives the request as POST. Middleware between the web server and the application may override the HTTP method based on special hidden form field values. Unavailability of the servers is another factor that affects the communication. Because of the stateless and synchronous nature of HTTP, a client must wait for the server to be available to perform the task and respond to the request. Browser-based communication also suffers from cross-origin restrictions for security reasons. We describe HTTP Mailbox, a mechanism to enable RESTful HTTP communication in an asynchronous mode with a full range of HTTP methods otherwise unavailable to standard clients and servers. HTTP Mailbox also allows for multicast semantics via HTTP. We evaluate a reference implementation using ApacheBench (a server stress testing tool) demonstrating high throughput (on 1,000 concurrent requests) and a systemic error rate of 0.01%. Finally, we demonstrate our HTTP Mailbox implementation in a human-assisted Web preservation application called “Preserve Me!” and a visualization application called “Preserve Me!

However, it has long been speculated that the BGP monitoring sessions between operational routers and the data collectors fail from time to time. Such session failures lead to missing update messages as well as duplicate updates during session re-establishment, making analysis results derived from such data inaccurate. Since there is no complete record of these monitoring session failures, data users either have to sanitize the data discretionarily with respect to their specific needs or, more commonly, assume that session failures are infrequent enough and simply ignore them. In this paper, we present the first systematic assessment and documentary on BGP session failures of RouteViews and RIPE data collectors over the past eight years. Our results show that monitoring session failures are rather frequent, more than 30% of BGP monitoring sessions experienced at least one failure every month. Furthermore, we observed failures that happen to multiple peer sessions on the same collector around the same time, suggesting that the collector's local problems are a major factor in the session instability. We also developed a web site as a community resource to publish all session failures detected for RouteViews and RIPE RIS data collectors to help users select and clean up BGP data before performing their analysis.	border gateway protocol;instability;participatory monitoring;route views;routing	Pei-chun Cheng;Xin Zhao;Beichuan Zhang;Lixia Zhang	2010	Computer Communication Review	10.1145/1764873.1764879	real-time computing;world wide web;computer security;computer network;data collection	Metrics	-29.50324832485875	86.13725971802552	117380

At the same time, there have been equally impressive advances in broadly deployed Internet technology. We can cite the dramatic growth in the use of XML, the """" disruptive """" impact of peer-to-peer (P2P) approaches [11] that have resulted in a slew of powerful applications, and the more orderly, but still widespread adoption, of a universal Web Service approach to Web based applications [12,13]. Grids are exemplified by the infrastructure used to allow seamless access to supercomputers or large scale integration of datasets. P2P technology facilitates sophisticated resource sharing environments between peers over the """" edges """" of the Internet, enabling ad hoc communities of low-end clients to advertise and access resources on communal computers. The deployments and utilization of Web services are driven by a slew of XML based specifications that pertain to exposing services, discovering them and accessing these securely once the requestor is authenticated and authorized. Grids, P2P Networks and Web Services consist of a sea of message based services. Services inject and extract messages whose transport and manipulation are supported by a logically distinct """" MessageGrid """" supplying the Grid Message layer. We can abstract such environments as a distributed system of """" clients """" or """" end-points """" which consist either of """" users """" or """" resources """" or proxies thereto.

The messaging infrastructure linking clients (both users and resources of course) would provide the messaging backbone. The smallest unit of this messaging infrastructure should be able to intelligently process and route messages while working with multiple underlying communication protocols. We refer to this unit as a broker, where we avoid the use of the term servers to distinguish it clearly from the application and system servers that would be among the sources/sinks to messages generated within the integrated system. For our purposes (registering, transporting and discovering information), we use the term events/messages interchangeably where events are just messages − typically with time stamps.

The proposed architecture includes a set of communication protocols in the different layers of the model. DTSN is a transport protocol used for reliable data transfer and DSDV is a routing protocol. The distributed and reactive data storage is realized using the tinyDSM middleware. The architecture provides also security features such as data secrecy and integrity. The cipher means used for this are ECC and SkipJack which have been developed for wireless sensor networks. Our homeland security architecture has been implemented as a demonstrator using 15 MicaZ motes equipped with acoustic and passive infra red sensors.

The former provides structure for the object-level content, metalevel indexing and description, and, regrettably for purists, control over the presentation and format. The latter is a platform-independent, client/server protocol defined for any packetswitched digital network that supports the lower-level TCP/IP protocol suite. HTTP is an application layer protocol that sits directly atop Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which in turn sits atop Internet Protocol (IP). HTTP is similar to File Transmission Protocol (FTP), Telnet, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and other sundry application protocols that handle the business part of the Internet’s work. HTTP is rather unique, however, in that it is “stateless.” The logical flow of an HTTP transaction sequence is: 1. Connect a client to a server (in the case of a Web browser, this typically amounts to a mouse click); 2. Make a request of the server (get data, execute a program, write data, and so forth); 3. Fulfill the request for the client; and 4.

In this paper, we note that when a node is infected by malicious programs, their propagation speeds from the node with a high level of centrality will be faster than those from the node with a low level of centrality, which identifies the most important nodes within a network. From experiments under diverse worm propagation parameters and the well-known network topologies, we evaluate the influence of Centrality-based random scanning strategy on early worm propagation rate. Therefore, we show that centrality-based random scanning strategy, where an initial infected node selects the victim based on the level of centrality, can make random scanning worms propagate rapidly compared to Anonymity-based random scanning strategy, where an initial infected node selects the victim uniformly.	centrality;software propagation	Su-kyung Kown;Bongsoo Jang;Byoung-Dai Lee;Younghae Do;Hunki Baek;Yoon-Ho Choi	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-56549-1_8	telecommunications	Crypto	-27.876429732249875	77.74964862011878	120055
45d96c87b840bd8d545facddb8d2891ecd45861f	ipv6 socket api for source address selection		Status of This Memo This memo provides information for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Abstract The IPv6 default address selection document (RFC 3484) describes the rules for selecting source and destination IPv6 addresses, and indicates that applications should be able to reverse the sense of some of the address selection rules through some unspecified API. However, no such socket API exists in the basic (RFC 3493) or advanced (RFC 3542) IPv6 socket API documents. This document fills that gap partially by specifying new socket-level options for source address selection and flags for the getaddrinfo() API to specify address selection based on the source address preference in accordance with the socket-level options that modify the default source address selection algorithm. The socket API described in this document will be particularly useful for IPv6 applications that want to choose between temporary and public addresses, and for Mobile IPv6 aware applications that want to use the care-of address for communication. It also specifies socket options and flags for selecting Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) or non-CGA source addresses.	application programming interface;care-of address;cryptographically generated address;getaddrinfo;internet;mobile ip;network socket;selection algorithm;selection rule;unix domain socket	Erik Nordmark;Samita Chakrabarti;Julien Laganier	2007	RFC	10.17487/RFC5014	engineering;operating system;unique local address;link-local address;world wide web;computer security;private network	Security	-25.250513566712307	88.2108198602694	120494

Because this API is used in a Java development environment, an NMS can be developed by utilizing the API and other commonly available Java libraries. It is thus possible to easily develop an NMS that is highly compatible with other IT systems. And operations that are generated from the API and that are exchanged between the NMS and network devices are based on NETCONF, which is standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as a next-generation network-configuration protocol. Adopting a standardized technology ensures that the NMS developed by using the API can manage network devices provided from multi-vendors in a unified manner. Furthermore, the configuration items exchanged over NETCONF are specified in an object-oriented design. They are therefore easier to manage than such items in the Management Information Base (MIB), which is defined as data to be managed by the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). We actually developed several NMSs by using the API. Evaluation of these NMSs showed that, in terms of configuration time and development time, the NMS developed by using the API performed as well as NMSs developed by using a command line interface (CLI) and SNMP. The NMS developed by using the API showed feasibility to achieve """"autonomic network management"""" and """"high interoperability with IT systems.""""."""

05055e7f7fa8d7daf9bf6574736d44357fcc5a2a	dialogue session: management using voicexml		A spoken dialogue system capable of maintaining a humanmachine conversation over a telephone must simultaneously maintain many dialogue sessions with different callers and third-party servers running applications over the Internet. There are three main issues to be addressed. First, the caller’s identity has to be passed between each dialogue turn. Secondly, the dialogue state and connections to third party servers have to be continuously maintained. Thirdly, the system interfaces have to follow some standards, especially Internet protocols. We use session tickets and session object hashes to address these issues. Each dialogue turn is encoded in a session data object and VXML page. The session tickets contain the session ID and security-related information passed between the VoiceXML interpreter and document server. The session object hash stores the third party connection handle, which is retrieved for subsequent dialogue turns.	cryptographic hash function;dialog system;internet protocol suite;server (computing);session (computer science);session id;spoken dialog systems;voicexml	Augustine Tsai;Andrew N.

Abstract This document provides a means for a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent (UA) that receives a dialog-forming request to supply its identity to the peer UA by means of a request in the reverse direction, and for that identity to be signed by an Authentication Service. Because of retargeting of a dialog-forming request (changing the value of the Request-URI), the UA that receives it (the User Agent Server, UAS) can have a different identity from that in the To header field. The same mechanism can be used to indicate a change of identity during a dialog, e.g., because of some action in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) behind a gateway.

Cooperation strategies have been considered as a solution to address these network limitations. In the presence of unstable network infrastructures, mobile nodes cooperate with each other, forwarding data and performing other specific network functionalities. This article proposes a generalized incentive-based cooperation solution for mobile services and applications called MobiCoop. This reputation-based scheme includes an application framework for mobile applications that uses a Web service to handle all the nodes reputation and network permissions. The main goal of MobiCoop is to provide Internet services to mobile devices without network connectivity through cooperation with neighbor devices. The article includes a performance evaluation study of MobiCoop considering both a real scenario (using a prototype) and a simulation-based study. Results show that the proposed approach provides network connectivity independency to users with mobile apps when Internet connectivity is unavailable. Then, it is concluded that MobiCoop improved significantly the overall system performance and the service provided for a given mobile application.	access control;application framework;control theory;experiment;glossary of computer graphics;itil;instant messaging;internet;mathematical optimization;mobile app;mobile device;multimedia pc;network architecture;network performance;performance evaluation;prototype;relay;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;shortest path problem;simulation;waypoint;web service	Bruno M.

To facilitate efficient acquisition of video content, proxy caching has been widely used by wireless service providers (WSPs), which typically deploy cache servers at mobile switching centers (MSCs). However, capacity provisioning of cache servers is challenging, given the dynamic user demands and the limited cache server resources. With increased densities of wireless service deployment, it is increasingly common that mobile users are covered by more than one WSP within an area. This brings opportunities of a collaborative caching paradigm among the cache servers deployed at different MSCs. In this paper, we explore the benefits of collaborative caching in wireless streaming services, addressing both challenges of incentives and truthfulness of selfish WSPs. We propose a collaborative mechanism that maximizes the social welfare in the context of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auctions, in which cache servers cooperate in the trading of their resources in a self-enforcing manner. Experimental results demonstrate that superior performance can be achieved with respect to the quality of video streaming.	cache (computing);digital video;edmund m. clarke;programming paradigm;provisioning;server (computing);simulation;software deployment;streaming media;web cache	Jie Dai;Fangming Liu;Bo Li;Baochun Li;Jiangchuan Liu	2012	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2012.120226	service provider;cellular network;vickrey auction;telecommunications;computer science;social welfare;internet privacy;world wide web;wireless;computer network	Mobile	-23.082260025900293	74.79069761042119	122909

However, in the real world, some of mobile individuals may not be willing to share information with others due to selfishness. So how to make the analysis of selfish behavior to encourage participants for cooperation becomes an important issue. In this paper, we firstly divide selfishness into two new types: weak selfishness and extreme selfishness. Then we develop an analytical model to evaluate the influence of selfish behavior on the information dissemination process. Numerical results demonstrate the effects of weak selfishness and extreme selfishness, respectively. In addition, the results also show the relationship among the selfish behavior, information dissemination and users’ mobility pattern.

We are all familiar with the White Pages and Yellow Pages directories of the telephone community (public switched telephone network), where the address (telephone number) of a subscriber or a service may be obtained, given the full name of that subscriber or service .

We present a scalable architecture called LambdaBridge to 'bridge' LambdaGrid applications with the terabit optical core networks. LambdaBridge will provision and control predictable- performance networks for end-systems (i.e. Grid clusters) using on-demand lambda/VLAN provisioning and end-system traffic shaping. The chief contribution of LambdaBridge is a deep understanding of how to synergistically bridge provisionable networks, end-systems, and future generation distributed terabit applications.

This is a difficult challenge because of both intermittent connectivity and potential failures in wireless infrastructure. In this paper, we present a multinetwork access-based wireless architecture and related protocols to support dependable transactions. The key idea is to allow group users to utilize access to one or more wireless networks to complete different steps of a transaction. This allows for transactions to be completed even under timeand location-dependent connectivity problems and network failures. The performance results show that access to multiple wireless networks leads to very high transaction completion probability even when individual wireless networks do not offer continuous and/or highly available access. The transaction completion probability is found to be dependent on the group size and number of steps in a transaction, and the same level of dependable performance for transactions can be achieved by increasing the number of wireless networks or improved access to individual networks. The overhead for multi-network access can be further reduced by creating preferred wireless networks and by reducing the number of critical users in different transaction stages.

This means covering a wide array of application domains and user requirements. In such scenarios it is not feasible to define a single protocol for all situations. Hence, a multi-protocol approach is required. OPC UA has strong backing from Industry 4.0 as the protocol for the Industrial Internet of Things. Interoperability of OPC UA has been investigated in the context of migration from legacy and with protocols such as DPWS. Additionally HTTP and CoAP have been investigated as possible transport mediums. However, OPC UA interoperability has not been investigated within a multi-protocol settings and no generic protocol translation exists. This paper proposes an OPC UA translator following the service translator model proposed in the Arrowhead project. Utilizing a mapping to intermediate format, it can be used along side CoAP, HTTP and MQTT protocols.	address space;constrained application protocol;create, read, update and delete;devices profile for web services;grpc;hypertext transfer protocol;industry 4.0;internet of things;interoperability;lookup table;mqtt;microservices;opc unified architecture;open platform communications;provisioning;requirement;server (computing);service discovery;service-oriented architecture;telecommunications network;user agent;user requirements document;vii	Hasan Derhamy;Jesper Ronnholm;Jerker Delsing;Jens Eliasson;Jan van Deventer	2017	2017 IEEE 15th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)	10.1109/INDIN.2017.8104744	opc data access;engineering;industrial internet;computer network;interoperability;user requirements document;mqtt;service-oriented architecture;devices profile for web services;server	Robotics	-23.74701270753846	83.90416892195172	126724

NetScript has proven useful for implementing a variety of practical network systems including Internet protocol (IP) routers, firewalls, protocol analyzers, traffic shapers, load balancers, various queuing disciplines, intrusion detection systems, Web transport protocols, and IP telephony systems. The paper illustrates the principal concepts of NetScript with an example application, an active IP router that is dynamically extended to provide firewall protection.

In this work, two different architectures and their integrations on silicon, are proposed for SecurID Authenticator. Both proposed designs are compared with the conventional one, in terms of operating frequency, allocated area resources, and throughput values. More analytically, the paper presents two alternative design solutions and efficient implementations for SecurID Authenticator: the first is suitable for high speed communications, while the second supports minimized area applications. Both proposed architectures could be used alternatively to communication networks, in order to ensure high level of security, with special needs for high speed or small area resources, respectively.	authentication;authorization;clock rate;high-level programming language;microsoft outlook for mac;rsa securid;telecommunications network;throughput	Nicolas Sklavos;Costas Efstathiou	2007	2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511060	embedded system;computer science;computer security;computer network	EDA	-29.66707854641575	78.84654436298337	127798

In this paper, we focus on incentivizing crowd workers to label a set of multi-class labeling tasks under strict budget constraint. We properly profile the tasks’ difficulty levels and workers’ quality in crowdsourcing systems, where the collected labels are aggregated with sequential Bayesian approach. To stimulate workers to undertake crowd labeling tasks, the interaction between workers and the platform is modeled as a reverse auction. We reveal that the platform utility maximization could be intractable, for which an incentive mechanism that determines the winning bid and payments with polynomial-time computation complexity is developed. Moreover, we theoretically prove that our mechanism is truthful, individually rational, and budget feasible. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our mechanism utilizes budget efficiently to achieve high platform utility with polynomial computation complexity.	computation;computer vision;crowdsourcing;entropy maximization;optical character recognition;polynomial;problem solving;programming paradigm;simulation;time complexity	Xiaoying Gan;Xiongbiao Wang;Wenhao Niu;Gai Hang;Xiaohua Tian;Xinbing Wang;Jun Xu	2017	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2017.2680838	optical character recognition;computer science;machine learning;real-time computing;the internet;reverse auction;simulation;maximization;contextual image classification;artificial intelligence;incentive;crowdsourcing;budget constraint	AI	-24.217646220008962	74.63147426711495	127863

Field Operational Test (FOT) and real-world experimentation are becoming more relevant to our research community as well as to industry and regulation. Unfortunately, available commercial solutions make experimental modifications to the protocol stack time consuming or prohibit it completely. To overcome this limitation, we implemented the ETSI ITS-G5 stack on a standard embedded PC hardware and running Linux system. OpenC2X is the first complete Open Source experimentation and prototyping platform. Our system is fully interoperable to commercial solutions, yet easily extensible with new protocols and applications for vehicular networks.	embedded system;interoperability;linux;protocol stack	Florian Klingler;Gurjashan Singh Pannu;Christoph Sommer;Bastian Bloessl;Falko Dressler	2017		10.1145/3081333.3089322	vehicular ad hoc network;protocol stack;embedded system;interoperability;operating system;extensibility;computer science	Security	-23.168796530314886	83.4647609983548	129233

The design aims to prove both comprehensive in terms of the properties we measure and easy to employ and understand for users with little technical background. We structure Netalyzr as a signed Java applet (which users access via their Web browser) that communicates with a suite of measurement-specific servers. Traffic between the two then probes for a diverse set of network properties, including outbound port filtering, hidden in-network HTTP caches, DNS manipulations, NAT behavior, path MTU issues, IPv6 support, and access-modem buffer capacity. In addition to reporting results to the user, Netalyzr also forms the foundation for an extensive measurement of edge-network properties. To this end, along with describing Netalyzr 's architecture and system implementation, we present a detailed study of 130,000 measurement sessions that the service has recorded since we made it publicly available in June 2009.	clutter;debugging;domain name system security extensions;fork (software development);hypertext transfer protocol;i. michael ross;ibm notes;java applet;kelly criterion;modem;net neutrality;software deployment;web application	Christian Kreibich;Nicholas Weaver;Boris Nechaev;Vern Paxson	2010		10.1145/1879141.1879173	real-time computing;intelligent computer network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;neutral network;artificial intelligence;operating system;network simulation;distributed computing;network performance;world wide web;computer security;java applet;computer network;maximum transmission unit	Metrics	-21.675460441121725	83.61980069959966	129450

The .NET Framework rests on many other Microsoft components, including the Windows Driver Model (WDM). This model supports four driver types, two of which were considered in this paper: protocol and miniport drivers. By compiling and executing client applications using the “raw” sockets interface, we demonstrate that insecure clients can be written with minimal programming effort (lines of code).	.net framework;application programming interface;compiler;internet protocol suite;microsoft windows;raw socket;source lines of code;wavelength-division multiplexing;windows driver frameworks;windows driver model	Tatiana Melnik;Zornitza Genova Prodanoff	2005			parallel computing;windows workflow foundation;.net framework;microsoft visual studio;distributed computing;composite ui application block;visual basic for applications;internet protocol;computer science;operating system;.net remoting;raw socket	Networks	-23.533336796434156	85.77533084124607	129531

Software defined network architecture is proposed as a new paradigm in the cognitive networking to manage and control heterogeneous networks. Monitoring is an essential application for the software defined network to collect data periodically from a multitude of data sources for global state awareness and optimization. In this paper, we extend the monitoring for software defined network controller and prototype a new application module of group localization with the hybrid Wi-Fi and Zigbee APs obeying OpenFlow interface. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate a compressed sensing based algorithm for group localization. In the end, we evaluate its performance with various scenario and parameter configuration. The initial prototype evaluation and experiment results on accuracy and latency show the hybrid WiFi and Zigbee APs can work together for group localization and the compressed sensing algorithm can work well with the scenario of WiFi/Zigbee APs with hybrid power configuration.	algorithm;cognitive network;cognitive radio;compressed sensing;dictionary;implicit shape model;interference (communication);machine learning;mathematical optimization;network architecture;network interface controller;obedience (human behavior);openflow;population;programming paradigm;prototype;software-defined networking	Guolin Sun;Feng Liu;Nengfeng Liu;Guisong Liu	2014	2014 International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)	10.1109/WPMC.2014.7014862	embedded system;neurfon;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;compressed sensing;wireless;computer network	Mobile	-19.670666713693155	81.09510925117135	130709

On one hand, the smaller form factor of today's WiFi devices allows WiFi users to access wireless networks under mobility, calling for new, mobility-aware wireless protocols that are able to sustain high performance, on the other hand, the ubiquity of WiFi devices has recently raised interest in extending WiFi's capabilities beyond communication, e.g., for human-computer interaction. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to enable fine-grained human motion detection on commodity WiFi devices by exploiting PHY layer information exposed by today's WiFi chipsets. We propose two motion detection techniques for two different application scenarios and explore their benefits on protocol performance and human-device interaction, respectively.	chipset;human–computer interaction;kinesiology;mobile device;motion detector;phy (chip);wireless access point	Li Sun;Dimitrios Koutsonikolas	2015	2015 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)	10.1109/ICNP.2015.59	embedded system;telecommunications;wireless lan controller;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;computer network	Mobile	-21.40052600829633	77.19889905993043	131023

However, inter-network boundaries dividing independent institutions often have firewalls, typically to restrict how many and which ports are accessible. In some cases, ports are opened indefinitely for Grid applications, but this compromises security significantly. On the other hand, solutions that manage port openings in an ad-hoc manner for applications are non-trivial to implement. An alternative firewall traversal technique is required that will provide manageable openings with less complexity involved. This is possible through proxies and managed tunnels using ports already authorized across the firewalls. We have developed a transparent connectivity mechanism for this, called Remus, which reroutes Grid connections through a tunnel on ports allowed across firewalls. However, a single tunnel presents a performance bottleneck. In this paper, we present the method by which Remus distributes several connections over multiple tunnels, improving throughput as a result. Rerouting wrappers hide the tunneling from applications, intercepting outgoing connections and rerouting them transparently. Well-known and mature tools and protocols, such as SSH and/or SOCKS, are utilized, instead of imposing customized, non-standard mechanisms. Results of our experiments are also presented for large file transfers over a Globus-based Grid that uses Remus.	authorization;central processing unit;experiment;firewall (computing);hoc (programming language);nat traversal;optimizing compiler;socks;throughput;tunneling protocol	Jefferson Tan;David Abramson;Colin Enticott	2009			embedded system;operating system;database;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security	HPC	-22.198521593130177	83.72113322045743	131502

Even though the SNMP technology is well documented and understood, it remains relatively unclear how SNMP is used in practice and what the typical SNMP usage patterns are. This paper discusses how to perform large-scale SNMP traffic measurements in order to develop a better understanding of how SNMP is used in production networks. The tools described in this paper have been applied to networks ranging from large national research networks to relatively small faculty networks. The goal of the research is to provide feedback to SNMP protocol developers within the IETF, researchers working within the context of the IRTF-NMRG, as well as other researchers interested in network management in general. We believe that the results are also valuable for operators and vendors who want to optimize their management interactions or understand the traffic generated by their management software.	interaction;mebibyte;simple network management protocol;tracing (software);traffic analysis	Jürgen Schönwälder;Aiko Pras;Matús Harvan;Jorrit Schippers;Remco van de Meent	2007	2007 10th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management	10.1109/INM.2007.374797	traffic generation model;network management;network traffic control;network management station;computer science;network management application;simple network management protocol;world wide web;computer security;computer network	OS	-20.117223315948312	85.1297265440645	131907

Despite the conceptual attractiveness of mobile data offloading, no concrete web server architectures integrate intelligent offloading in a production-ready and easily deployable manner without relying on vast infrastructural changes to carriers' networks. Delay-tolerant networking technology offers the means to do just this. We introduce MADServer, a novel DTN-based architecture for mobile data offloading that splits web content among multiple independent delivery vectors based on user and data context. It enables intelligent data offloading, caching, and querying solutions which can be incorporated in a manner that still satisfies user expectations for timely delivery. At the same time, it allows for users who have poor or expensive connections to the cellular network to leverage multi-hop opportunistic routing to send and receive data. We also present a preliminary implementation of MADServer and provide real-world performance evaluations.	delay-tolerant networking;mobile data offloading;routing;server (computing);web content;web server	Agoston Petz;Anders Lindgren;Pan Hui;Christine Julien	2012		10.1145/2348616.2348621	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;computer network	Mobile	-19.55176999910342	76.32166148426155	132102

Our experience suggests that launching a new network protocol stack for D2D communication on common platforms can be a daunting engineering challenge because of the lack of standard cross-platform APIs, limited documentation, and general platform restrictions to use L2 interfaces directly. Moreover, platforms are often equipped with different D2D networking technologies, forcing one to use many different means to interconnect different types of systems.	communications protocol;documentation;protocol stack	Wentao Shang;Alexander Afanasyev;Yanbiao Li;Jeff Burke;Lixia Zhang	2017		10.1145/3125719.3132101	interconnection;documentation;computer science;protocol stack;computer network;distributed computing;architecture	HPC	-22.985877852981073	83.43676547854808	132563
4866da18b6db1224eb30af5120bd5366f89e092e	pythia: diagnosing performance problems in wide area providers		Performance problem diagnosis is a critical part of network operations in ISPs. Service providers typically deploy monitoring nodes at several vantage points in their network, to record end-to-end measurements of network performance. Network operators use these measurements offline; for example, to troubleshoot customer complaints. In this work, we leverage such monitoring infrastructure deployments in ISPs to build a system for near real time performance problem detection and root cause diagnosis. Our system works with wide area interdomain monitoring, unlike approaches that require data sources from network devices (SNMP, Netflow, router logs, table dumps, etc.). Operators can input operational and domain knowledge of performance problems to the system to add diagnosis functionality. We have deployed the system on existing monitoring infrastructure in the US, diagnosing over 300 inter-domain paths. We study the extent and nature of performance problems that manifest in edge and core networks on the Internet.	algorithm;bibliothèque de l'école des chartes;brian;end-to-end principle;inter-domain;internet;internet backbone;jason;network performance;online and offline;pythia;participatory monitoring;performance tuning;real-time computing;router (computing);simple network management protocol;software deployment;warren abstract machine	Partha Kanuparthy;Constantinos Dovrolis	2014			real-time computing;simulation;operating system;computer security	OS	-19.414217082283244	84.59815277488109	132653

Service composition in MANETs should be fault-tolerant and distributed. Efforts in this area are rare and sounds not meet the requirements very well. In this paper, we present a distributed Fault-Tolerant Service Composition Protocol (FTSCP) for MANETs. FTSCP has two main features. Firstly, it is efficient for that all atomic services consisted in a composite service are discovered in just one service discovery session. Secondly, it is fault-tolerant since that service composition process is entirely under the supervision of Execution Coordinator (EC) and inaccessible services can be rediscovered transparently. Both mathematical analysis and simulation results show that FTSCP outperforms another broker-based service composition protocol for MANETs in both terms of packet overhead and promptness.	byzantine fault tolerance;context awareness;hoc (programming language);network packet;overhead (computing);requirement;service composability principle;service discovery;service-oriented modeling;simulation;usability	Zhen-guo Gao;Sheng Liu;Ming Ji;Jinhua Zhao;Lihua Liang	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-75444-2_74	fault tolerance;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;service discovery;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-28.78004594106884	83.80178797414565	133387

In particular we describe how to enable reliable and long running conversations through firewalls between Web Service peers that have no accessible network endpoints. Our solution is to implement in Java a Web services dispatcher (WSD) that is an intermediary service that forwards messages and can facilitate message exchanges by supporting SOAP RPC over HTTP and WS-addressing for asynchronous messaging. We describe how Web service clients that have no network endpoints, such as applets, can become Web Service peers by using an additional message store-and-forward service (""""mailbox"""").

bfc76263d1fefc1847606241745a9e6ebdf68612	edge-assisted content and computation-driven dynamic network selection for real-time services in the urban iot		Supporting city-wide exchange of information in Urban Internet of Things (IoT) systems using existing communication infrastructures is extremely challenging especially when traditional services operate in the same network resource. Additionally, the most advanced Urban IoT services focus on real-time data processing, which shifts the perspective and goal of the network when transporting data. In this paper, the notion of Quality of Computing (QoC) is introduced to capture the level of support the communication infrastructure provides to this family of computation applications. In this context, we propose a dynamic network selection mechanism based on Software Defined Networks (SDN) designed to provide QoC in Urban IoT scenarios where the heterogeneous network resources are shared. The proposed mechanism dynamically assigns portions of data from IoT streams over licensed and unlicensed bands to guarantee QoC while minimizing cost of operations and licensed band occupation. Instrumental to our technique is the recently proposed edge-computing architecture, where computational resources placed at the edge of wireless access networks enable the interconnection of network management to processing. We consider a real-time monitoring scenario, where sensors transmit a video stream which is processed to identify and classify objects. The supporting wireless infrastructure consists of WiFi that operates in unlicensed frequency bands and cellular communication technology, Long Term Evolution (LTE) operating in licensed bands. We demonstrate the performance by means of real-world experiments on a testbed with WiFi and LTE networks built with hostapd and OpenAirInterface.	access network;closed-circuit television;compaq lte;computation;computational resource;computer architecture;experiment;frequency band;interconnection;internet of things;mobile phone;network congestion;open-source software;real-time clock;real-time data;real-time transcription;requirement;sensor;software-defined networking;streaming media;testbed;transmitter	Sabur Baidya;Marco Levorato	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2017.8116478	hostapd;streams;architecture;heterogeneous network;network management;dynamic network analysis;software-defined networking;access network;computer network;computer science	Mobile	-19.305331044648785	80.38116295064107	135767

In order to achieve this, a global scheme is necessary to provide object identification, and specific solutions are needed to provide internetwork addressibility between applcations. A structured naming level can be built on top of existing application program interfaces, and the necessary internetwork addressing and directory query capabilities can be provided by an application-level gateway. The address mechanism on the gateway maps local proxies into foreign addresses; the originality of the scheme is that proxies are built dynamically during internetwork directory calls, thus overcoming the typical problems of proxy schemes. The functions at the gateway can be organized into a base and option set structure, and be implemented up to the desired level of sophistication. The design presented is modular, and provides hooks for possible future evolutions of network architectures.	directory service;osi model	Stefano Zatti;Philippe A.

However, the time and cost problem resulting from using heterogeneous platforms and proprietary protocols must be a burden to developing such systems and expanding their services. In this paper, we present a framework of mobile surveillance service for smartphone users. It includes the design and implementation of a video server and a mobile client called smartphone watch. A component-based architecture is employed for the server and client for easy extension and adaptation. We also employ the well-known standard web protocol HTTP to provide higher compatibility and portability than using a proprietary one. Three different video transmission modes are provided for efficient usage of limited bandwidth resource. We demonstrate our approach via real experiments on a commercial smartphone.	central processing unit;communications protocol;component-based software engineering;experiment;hypertext transfer protocol;internet;jpeg;proprietary protocol;server (computing);smartphone;software portability;video server;whole earth 'lectronic link	Won Ho Chung	2011	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-011-0435-8	embedded system;mobile search;mobile web;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web	Mobile	-26.470393194512294	77.11523112944198	137568
4cdea3bcbe46fda0f6f74c444bf4b536770fc159	performance evaluation of cellular communication systems for m2m communication in smart grid applications		The increasing power demands and growing awareness for sustainable and green energy has led to distributed generation of power from different sources. This transition from centralized to a distributed power generation has increased the necessity to upgrade the traditional grid. The future grid, i.e. Smart Grid, should offer two way flow of power and information. Smart grid needs to intelligently manage the power generation, transmission, and distribution to generate optimal power resources and adapt consumers to those power resources. In addition, it should support smart metering and monitoring to reduce energy consumption and cost. This intelligent management demand near real time communication between the power generators, consumer utilities and the control center. Thus machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is the necessity of future smart grid applications. Smart grid is a huge infrastructure and its components are located at far-off locations. Hence, wired and short range wireless communication solutions would not be ideal for smart grid applications. This paper presents the performance evaluation of different cellular communication systems as a solution for M2M communication in smart grid applications.	centralized computing;compaq lte;grid computing;internet;machine to machine;mobile phone;performance evaluation;real-time clock;real-time computing;smart meter	Ganesh Man Shrestha;Jürgen Jasperneite	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-31217-5_37	embedded system;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-19.233496961079588	79.4472306783733	137575

Network faults and outage times are mainly originated by drifts and degradations of parameters on the physical layer. Simple remotely controlled integrated measurement systems will help network operators improve network quality and reliability and save operational costs. In addition to supervision under the performance parameters of active network components, the optical fiber plant itself will be supervised by an embedded fiber monitoring system in future. We present the functionality of a demarcation point monitor as a new network element which provides information about network availability up to the home network. The operation and the performance parameters of the new monitoring systems are described, and the compatibility with the transmission system is shown in detail.

IoT can be regarded as an extension of the existing interaction between humans and applications through the new dimension of “Things” communication and integration. IoT networks in the scale of million nodes are possible even today but managing the nodes and information provided by large networks beyond that scale requires architecture scalability that is still an area to explore. The aim of this paper is to present usage scenarios and analyse requirements of a Mobile Cellular Network (MCN) based router for a secure, energy efficient, and scalable wireless network architecture. The network is composed of the MCN based edge routers and large amount of Central Processing Units (CPU), memory, and energy restricted sensor/actuator devices. Mobile routers communicate with application servers in the Internet and surrounding sensor network(s). The analysis of the scenarios highlighted common aspects and led to requirements that were used to define the MCN based router/proxy device and guide the network and system architecture design as well as the development of a prototype.	application server;central processing unit;future internet;it risk management;internet of things;network architecture;prototype;requirement;router (computing);scalability;security controls;systems architecture	Tapio Frantti;Hannu Hietalahti;Reijo Savola	2013	The International Conference on Information Networking 2013 (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2013.6496378	core router;embedded system;edge device;wireless sensor network;computer science;information security;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;one-armed router;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	-19.400514341859278	81.68249019568083	139379

These networks have a new architecture where new Network Entities carry out complex functionalities and can serve many calls at the time. In order to grant high efficiency and the best performance of the network, such a complex scenario must be monitored and controlled by a certain number of Operation & Maintenance Centres (OMCs). Typically, these centres pose queries to the underlying DBMS that require complex operations over Gigabytes or Terabytes of disk-resident data, and thus, take a very long time to execute to completion and produce exact answers. Due to the exploratory nature of these applications, an exact answer may not be required, and a user may in fact prefer a fast, approximate answer. In this paper we propose an architecture for approximate query processing to be integrated in the OTS architecture of Siemens Mobile S.p.A. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a practical application of wavelet-based synopses techniques in order to improve the performances of the management system of real telecommunication network.	wavelet	Ernesto Damiani;Stefania Marrara;Salvatore Reale;Massimiliano Torregiani	2005		10.1007/11552413_155	cellular network;availability;simulation;network architecture;telecommunications;completeness;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;wireless network;reliability;management system;database;mobile computing;computer security;algorithm;telecommunications network;statistics;satisfiability	DB	-27.7184651561789	76.09198984461025	140146

This API is based on the Hash Based Addresses andCryptographically Generated Addresses approaches, which are being developed by the IETF multi6 Working Group. The support of Multihoming implies several actions such as failure detection procedures, reachability tests, re-homing procedures and exchange of locators. Applications can benefit from transparent access to Multihoming services only if per host Multihoming parameters are defined. However, more benefits could be obtained by applications if they will be able to configure these parameters. The proposed Multihoming API provides different functions to applications which can modify some parameters and invoke some functions related with the Multihoming Layer.	algorithmic efficiency;application programming interface;authentication;color graphics adapter;computation;computational complexity theory;datagram;host adapter;identifier;multihoming;multiple homing;online locator service;public-key cryptography;quality of service;reachability;transport tycoon	Isaías Martinez-Yelmo;Alberto García-Martínez;Marcelo Bagnulo	2005		10.1007/0-387-31170-X_20	multihoming;computer network;hash function;ipv6;computer science	Networks	-24.97865427205105	87.47647717541598	140732

3983b0fe3f375d4e6f8ac357943ae7b27279586b	cloudifying mobile network management: performance tests of event distribution and rule processing		With the ever increasing number of devices, nodes and the events they create, scalability and performance become important aspects for Operation Support Systems (OSS). One solution is to distribute the work load, i.e. ‘cloudify’ the formerly centralized monitoring and decision functions. This requires remodeling Complex Event Processing (monitoring) and Policies (decision making) towards a distributed yet coordinated system. This paper describes an extended architecture, implementation and performance tests for a policy-based event processing system. The main advantage of our approach is that we use policies for event pattern matching (an advanced form of Complex Event Processing) and for the selection of corrective actions (called Distributed Governance). Policies are (a) distributed (over multiple components) and (b) coordinated (using centralized authoring). The resulting system can deal with large numbers of incoming events, as is required in a telecommunication environment. Peak load will be well above 1 million events per second, combining different data sources of a mobile network. This paper presents the motivation for such a system, along with a comprehensive presentation of its design, implementation and evaluation.

At the architectural level,aswa defines an active node whose functionalities are divided into the Node Operating System, the Execution Environment, and the Active Applications. At the implementation level,aswa is a Web Services based platform where new components could be added and deployed, in order to dynamically modify network nodes behavior. Applications can be developed with any language and communicate across heterogeneous environments, and across Internet and Intranet structures. At the deployment levelaswa uses an active node approach, and offers a controlled deployment mode. In terms of security, Authentication of deployed code and protection of the nodes is achieved by the use ofhttps and the header extensions of thesoap envelope. Finally to validate this architecture,aswa defines a Firewall as an Active Application to secure the code deployment.	world wide web	Maroun Chamoun;Rima Kilany;Ahmed Serhrouchni	2004	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/BF03179690	embedded system;engineering;computer security;computer network	Crypto	-24.92219884652025	85.29981846693813	145213

The IoT architecture includes a number of different physical objects with different communication techniques (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.15.4), which allow these things to connect themselves to the Internet. Along with the physical connectivity, a number of different IETF standards were introduced to logically interconnect devices to the Internet. However, many of the devices that consist IoT are heavily resource limited; therefore, have strict energy restrictions. Such devices, for example, batteryless devices, can face challenges when trying to support the entire IP stack for IoT (e.g., 6LoWPAN, RPL, CoAP, ICMPv6). In this paper, we propose a method of connecting the batteryless devices to IP-based networks as a radio sensor using IEEE 802.15.4 connectivity. Specifically, we propose a network architecture where a 6LoWPAN router is designated for packet translation of batteryless device-initiated packets. Our empirical results using a custom-designed batteryless platform, show that the proposed network architecture can effectively connect the prototyped batteryless device to IPv6-based networks.	64-bit computing;bluetooth;constrained application protocol;firefox;internet of things;internet protocol suite;network architecture;network packet;protocol stack;prototype;router (computing);screenshot;sensor node;web server	Jongjun Park;Jong Arm Jun;Byeong-cheol Choi	2014	2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983077	embedded system;next-generation network;6lowpan;ip forwarding;distributed computing;ip tunnel;internet traffic engineering;nat traversal;computer network;network mapping	Mobile	-23.52775366499318	82.58653909229811	146226

There is no accepted solution for an arbitrary host from the public IP network to initiate communication with a host in a private address space although attempts have been made to create one. This paper proposes the replace NATs with a more comprehensive concept we call Customer Edge Switching (CES). Customer edge switching assumes connection state on the trust boundary between the user and the core networks. The connection state is managed by implicit signaling. The state gives means for the private network operator to apply elaborate access control to packet flows arriving from the Internet to the private network. CES is a way of moving from the end-to-end principle to the trust-to-trust principle advocated by Dave Clark.	32-bit;access control;address space;customer edge;dos;denial-of-service attack;end-to-end principle;fits;firewall (computing);ipv4 address exhaustion;identifier;interaction;internet;malware;network address translation;network packet;next-generation network;overhead (computing);private network;prototype;router (computing);routing;software deployment;transmitter;trust boundary	Raimo Kantola	2010	2010 IEEE 24th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops	10.1109/WAINA.2010.27	communications protocol;routing;the internet;core network;mobile telephony;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;access control;network security;operating system;database;trustworthy computing;world wide web;computer security;server;nat traversal;computer network	Networks	-23.174614705008644	87.96743469173376	146380

To incentivize user participation in this network, we allow the users to trade their data plan and obtain a profit by selling and buying leftover data capacities (caps) from each other. We formulate the data trading association between buyers and sellers as a matching game. In this game, buyers and sellers rank each other based on preference functions that capture the buyers' demand for data and QoS requirements, the data available for purchase from the sellers and energy resources. We show that these preferences are interdependent and influenced by existing network-wide matching. For this reason, the game can be classified as a one-to-many matching game with externalities. To solve the game, we propose a distributed algorithm that combines notions from matching theory and market equilibrium. The algorithm enables the players to self-organize into a stable matching and ensures dynamic adaptation of price to data demand and supply. The properties of the resulting matching are discussed. We also calculate operator gains and the benchmark price that will encourage users to join the UPN. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields average utility per user improvements of up to 25% and 50% relative to random matching and worst case utility, respectively.	benchmark (computing);best, worst and average case;distributed algorithm;interdependence;iteration;java caps;matching (graph theory);one-to-many (data model);programming paradigm;quality of service;requirement;self-organization;simulation;stable marriage problem;video game developer;wireless access point	Beatriz Lorenzo;Francisco Javier González-Castaño	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7511376	games;data modeling;the internet;simulation;quality of service;mobile telephony;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;interference;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	-24.055630458054097	74.89573441784206	146384

a0e0a51394018c10c2e03f79002b658801957cc2	a mobile network operator's decision for partnership with zero-rating internet platforms		Zero-rating is the concept of not counting data usage of end-users for accessing the basic functions of some websites via mobile network operators (MNOs). Recently, some zero-rating platforms (e.g. Internet.org) are formed allowing the websites present their contents as zero-rated. In current setup of zero-rating platforms, no monetary reward is transferred to partner MNOs. Therefore, MNOs face a question of whether to cooperate with zero-rating platforms or not. In this paper, a variant of Stackelberg game is used to model the interaction between an MNO and its end-users toward providing their access to zero-rating services (i.e. partnership of the MNO and zero-rating platforms). We propose a bundle pricing scheme for the MNO and study the effects of including zero-rating services in the bundles. The proposed model assists the MNO to make decision on including zero-rating services in its bundles as well as appropriate pricing scheme. Numerical studies show that depending on the end- users' preferences, the MNO may increase its profit by including zero-rating services in its bundles.	game theory;internet;numerical analysis;product bundling;zero-rating	Masoud Asghari;Saleh Yousefi;Dusit Niyato	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254577	operator (computer programming);mobile network operator;computer network;the internet;stackelberg competition;mobile telephony;mobile computing;computer science;zero-rating;cellular network	Metrics	-23.85022445495409	76.07464697390732	148145

One key feature in providing the service is the crowdsourcing in which the principal obtains essential data from a large group of users, and inversely sharing the data based service with everyone for free. In this paper, we investigate the problem of how to provide continuous incentives for users to participate in the crowdsourcing activity, which can be referred to the moral hazard problem in the contract theory. First, a performance related incentive mechanism is proposed. Then, the utility maximization problem of the principal is formulated, under the constraint that each user maximizes its own utility by choosing the optimal effort in the crowdsourcing activity. Finally, the numerical results show that by using the proposed incentive mechanism, the users obtains the continuous incentives to participate in the crowdsourcing activity, and the principal successfully maximize the utilities.	crowdsourcing;download;entropy maximization;location-based service;mobile device;moral hazard;numerical analysis;simulation;smart device	Yanru Zhang;Yunan Gu;Lanchao Liu;Miao Pan;Zaher Dawy;Zhu Han	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2015.7127789	actuarial science;computer security	Mobile	-23.853472543811804	75.86790824292817	148179

It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Abstract With the increased use of DNS anycast, load balancing, and other mechanisms allowing more than one DNS name server to share a single IP address, it is sometimes difficult to tell which of a pool of name servers has answered a particular query. A standardized mechanism to determine the identity of a name server responding to a particular query would be useful, particularly as a diagnostic aid for administrators. Existing ad hoc mechanisms for addressing this need have some shortcomings, not the least of which is the lack of prior analysis of exactly how such a mechanism should be designed and deployed. This document describes the existing convention used in some widely deployed implementations of the DNS protocol, including advantages and disadvantages, and discusses some attributes of an improved mechanism.	anycast;hoc (programming language);internet;load balancing (computing);requirement;server (computing)	Suzanne Woolf;David Conrad	2007	RFC	10.17487/RFC4892	root name server;round-robin dns;computer science;dns spoofing;data mining;name server;world wide web;computer security;nsupdate;domain name system	Security	-26.254056989164123	86.24003567138658	148835

This draft presents the architecture with specific ascription to ensure effective security evaluation and integration on the SDN/NVF designs and implementations. This paper briefly introduces the proposed architecture and employs methods to analyze and verify its underlying security attributes. A unified method to review SN-SECA through symbolic analysis previews traffic process flow behavior across an infrastructure with SDN and NFV frameworks.

Spectrum databases are often far more effective, reactive, or sometimes even are required to operate, in conjunction with spectrum sensing - especially if their operation requires automation. Given such observations, this paper presents an update on the IEEE 1900.6b standards work on spectrum sensing to support such databases. Specifically, this paper provides an overview of IEEE 1900.6 and the current work towards 1900.6b, pinpointing the latest updates and thoughts on aspects of the system model incorporating spectrum databases, as well as use cases for the standard. It particularly concentrates on some of the more recent developments and challenges that IEEE 1900.6 is addressing for 1900.6b, such as sharing of sensing infrastructures with different client constraints (noting that spectrum databases - the clients - may have very different requirements in terms of measures such as accuracy and reliability), flexibility in the definition of sensing infrastructures, and security requirements, among many others. This paper finishes by presenting some detail on an experimental set-up for an upcoming trial of the IEEE 1900.6 standard as amended with IEEE 1900.6b capabilities, supporting the operation of a spectrum database as a key European showcase.	database;flow network;mathematical optimization;realms;requirement	Bernd Bochow;Oliver Holland;Konstantinos Katzis	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)	10.1109/CSCN.2016.7785179	telecommunications;computer science;data mining;computer security	Visualization	-24.366655944906935	79.6999326469265	149419

Our goal is to provide a lightweight video service for multimedia digital libraries built upon an ATM infrastructure, providing nonlinear editing and viewing of video. To accomplish this objective we have used a low overhead, high performance persistent object manager to manage the underlying video data. To test these ideas, we used the lightweight persistent object manager PTool, developed by the Laboratory for Advanced Computing at the University of Illinois at Chicago, to create persistent object stores of video data on a cluster of Unix workstations connected with an ATM switch. To improve performance, we striped the video data across the cluster. We verified that we were able to manage gigabytes of video data without performance degradation and that striping improved performance linearly up to the bandwidth of the equipment. We also compared the performance of ATM networked and ethernet networked clusters. Finally, we mention that viewing the video data as a persistent collection of objects (i.e. each frame of video as an object) provides attribute based retrieval of data, and hence allows for very simple editing, querying and retrieval of video data by attribute. It allows for the use of object associations to combine video, audio, text, etc.	atm turbo;data striping;digital library;elegant degradation;gigabyte;library (computing);nonlinear system;object manager;overhead (computing);persistent data structure;unix;workstation	Shitij Mutreja;Stuart Bailey;Robert L.

In this paper, we propose enhanced strategies for the preemptive migration of content stored in Information-Centric Networking caches at the edge of LTE mobile networks. With such strategies, the concept of content following the users interested in it becomes a reality and content within caches is more optimized towards the requests of nearby users. Results show that the strategies are feasible, efficient and, when compared to default caching strategies, ensure that content is delivered faster to end users while using bandwidth and storage resources more efficiently at the core of the network.	cpu cache;cache (computing);cloud computing;compaq lte;flight management system;mobile device;requirement;way to go	Andre S.

It defines the a messaging framework (the envelope), encoding rules and a binding protocol over the HTTP protocol. However SOAP, as it is, does not deal with conversations. To provide full interoperability, clients need to not only know the correct data formats to pass, but also the conversation level protocol involving those messages for any required Web service. This must also include the valid responses, where multiple responses are possible, and the starting and ending states of the conversation.This paper describes an XML-based conversational protocol for Web services. Each server site publishes details enabling client agents to interact with the server. This involves the publication of protocol specifications representing a finite state machine (FSM). A client agent downloads this specification, validate it for correctness, and then implement the protocol dynamically, as a state machine. This can be viewed as a negotiation of protocols where the client negotiates to implement all requirements of a server.	communications protocol;correctness (computer science);finite-state machine;interoperability;requirement;soap;server (computing);web service;xml	Zahir Tari;Mark McKinlay;Manish Malhotra	2003		10.1145/952532.952762	web service;reverse address resolution protocol;hypertext transfer protocol;general inter-orb protocol;universal composability;stateless protocol;xml protocol;computer science;operating system;ws-policy;soap;tunneling protocol;database;distributed computing;internet protocol suite;finite-state machine;programming language;ws-i basic profile;world wide web;computer security;web server	Networks	-26.022539127173324	86.7870029035621	149854

For this kind of problem, recommendation fairness and driving efficiency are two fundamental aspects. In the paper, we propose SCRAM, a sharing considered route assignment mechanism for fair taxi route recommendations. SCRAM aims to provide recommendation fairness for a group of competing taxi drivers, without sacrificing driving efficiency. By designing a concise route assignment mechanism, SCRAM achieves better recommendation fairness for competing taxis. By considering the sharing of road sections to avoid unnecessary competition, SCRAM is more efficient in terms of driving cost per customer (DCC). We test SCRAM based on a large number of historical taxi trajectories and validate the recommendation fairness and driving efficiency of SCRAM with extensive evaluations. Experimental results show that SCRAM achieves better recommendation fairness and higher driving efficiency than three compared approaches.	fairness measure;recommender system;salted challenge response authentication mechanism	Shiyou Qian;Jian Cao;Frédéric Le Mouël;Issam Sahel;Minglu Li	2015		10.1145/2783258.2783261	computer science;machine learning;taxis;computer security;recommender system	ML	-26.13188302200757	74.80622006168132	149893

3ab32e393f2a264cf61b8cce0cedf29b2fe31b90	dynamic network formation game with social awareness in d2d communications		The benefit of having a complementary network such as device-to-device (D2D) communications underlaying cellular systems lies in alleviating the traffic overloading burdens at base stations (BSs). This is critical in modern-day scenarios, e.g., in offloading and caching of mobile data traffic, and delivery of popular Internet contents to users. In this paper, we are chiefly interested in the establishment of D2D networks and how such a network evolves dynamically over time as D2D links are continuously formed and broken. Another important yet challenging research opportunity, i.e., the leverage of human users’ social ties for D2D communications, will also be addressed in this paper. To investigate the D2D network formation problem, we look at a game-theoretic framework where the utility function is designed to balance the physical and social domains—where we systematically extract social tie strengths from a real-world data set. To study the evolution of such D2D networks through time in a dynamic stochastic context, we propose a dynamic potential game and show that its equilibrium behaviors can be achieved through some strategy and payoff learning mechanisms. Simulation results verify our analysis. Using a content delivery application to assess the performance of our proposed scheme, it can be shown that major improvements can be obtained in terms of network delay, content accessibility, and BS load reduction.	accessibility;algorithm;cache (computing);digital distribution;futures studies;game theory;idle (cpu);internet;network formation;simulation;time-varying network;unavailability;utility	Quang Duy La;Tony Q.

A WMN is a collection of nodes (usually a computer with one or mint: wireless Network Interface Cards (NICs)) that are connected to one another with single or multiple hop ad hoc links forming a mesh backbone network. Ad hoc links are popular in mesh connectivity as they are self-configuring and self-healing. In this paper, we discuss WMN design and deployment issues with reference to our WiSEMesh testbed. WiSEMesh has 56 nodes deployed in the campus area providing internet connection for over 1000 users. Each node consists of a small form factor computer with three wireless NICs. We developed the WiSEMesh node software stack that contains Unix based operating system, wireless NIC drivers, tools such as DHCP server, NAT etc. WiSEMesh has properties like scalability, open source operating software, heterogeneous hardware support, high performance, globally reachable, and easy to configure network. Hence, it can spread faster as a community wireless network and also provide a flexible platform for testing communication network layers. We also address design issues of a Network Management System (NMS) that can be implemented in any wireless network. Our NMS named WiVi provides platform for software distribution and network configuration with an elaborate data collection and storage facilities. For a large and scalable network like WiSEMesh, a massive database needs to be designed. One of the WiVi design objectives is to provide a robust, flexible and scalable database. WiVi achieves database design goals by implementing a concept """"network in database"""" where network is logically divided into hierarchy of hardware components and each component is treated as an object in the database. The """"network in database"""" implementation guarantees data collection and storage flexibility. By implementing the NMS software distribution platform and the hardware independent WiSEMesh node software stack, our testbed is confirmed to achieve scalability."""	database design;digital distribution;hoc (programming language);internet access;internet backbone;management system;mesh networking;mint;network address translation;network interface controller;no man's sky;open-source software;operating system;scalability;server (computing);small form factor;software deployment;software distribution;telecommunications network;testbed;unix;wireless mesh network	Sachin Lal Shrestha;Jinsung Lee;Anseok Lee;Kyunghan Lee;Junhee Lee;Song Chong	2007	2007 3rd International Conference on Testbeds and Research Infrastructure for the Development of Networks and Communities	10.1109/TRIDENTCOM.2007.4444728	wireless mesh network;wireless ad hoc network;embedded system;service set;intelligent computer network;wireless wan;network architecture;heterogeneous network;wireless site survey;network management station;bridging;computer science;mesh networking;operating system;wireless network;network simulation;distributed computing;order one network protocol;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;network interface controller;municipal wireless network;wi-fi array;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-19.809984935120482	86.08482854941148	150563

In MANET, wide area communication on wireless networks can be realized because a node relays other node's packets by adopting a multi-hop routing protocol. Security is an indispensable issue in MANET because an unknown node may join the network easily. However, the demand for the level of authentication and its response time is different depending on the environment and applications. Thus, we focus on real-time control of the security mechanism for MANET. In this paper, we have established multi-hop communication environment and introduced methods to control secure connections by applying IPsec as an encryption scheme, on top of the general-purpose operating systems with enabled preemption for interruption. Under such conditions, we have measured response time of CPU with or without load of other applications. We have evaluated the influence of streaming as an application load and investigated on a security realization method for MANET.	authentication;autonomous robot;central processing unit;encryption;general-purpose markup language;hoc (programming language);ipsec;interrupt;operating system;preemption (computing);real-time transcription;relay;response time (technology);responsiveness;routing;streaming media	Mihoko Uno;Masato Oguchi	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications	10.1109/ISPA.2008.77	mobile ad hoc network;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Arch	-28.15777501199107	81.66588978176179	150756

Radio and battery technologies will improve over time, but are still expected to be the bottlenecks in future systems. Non-volatile memories (NVM), however, may continue experiencing significant and steady improvements in density for at least ten more years. In this paper, we propose to leverage the abundance in memory capacity of mobile devices to mitigate latency and energy issues when accessing cloud services.  We first analyze NVM technology scaling trends, and then propose a cloud service cache architecture that resides on the mobile device's NVM (pocket cloudlet). This architecture utilizes both individual user and community access models to maximize its hit rate, and subsequently reduce overall service latency and energy consumption.  As a showcase we present the design, implementation and evaluation of PocketSearch, a search and advertisement pocket cloudlet. We perform mobile search characterization to guide the design of PocketSearch and evaluate it with 200 million mobile queries from the search logs of m.bing.com. We show that PocketSearch can serve, on average, 66% of the web search queries submitted by an individual user without having to use the slow 3G link, leading to 16x service access speedup. Finally, based on experience with PocketSearch we provide additional insight and guidelines on how future pocket cloudlets should be organized, from both an architectural and an operating system perspective.	access network;bottleneck (software);cloud computing;cloudlet;image scaling;mobile device;non-volatile memory;operating system;pocket pc;speedup;user experience;web search engine;web search query	Emmanouil Koukoumidis;Dimitrios Lymberopoulos;Karin Strauss;Jie Liu;Doug Burger	2011		10.1145/1950365.1950387	parallel computing;real-time computing;mobile search;simulation;computer science;operating system;world wide web	Mobile	-19.93888726733392	74.61625164616294	151316
3a092dd783d03e04039bb3d2724fb5c941744c2e	a hybrid-based 3d streaming framework for mobile devices over iot environments		Today, we are witnessing the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), where trillions of objects are interconnected and starting to re-define the design of the Internet and its services. In fact, IoT plays a prominent role in the realization of the smart city paradigm. One of the highly demanded services in a smart city infrastructure is to enable Networked Virtual Environment (NVE) class of applications, like collaborative Augmented Reality (AR), virtual walkthroughs, and Massively Multiplayer Online games (MMOGs), on mobile things. Perversely, pre-downloading and rendering a complex 3D graphics is very computationally intensive and neither commensurate with the current mobiles hardware specifications and their dynamic mobility natures nor with the available wireless bandwidth. In addition, most IoT environments are generally deployed via a service-centric architecture which obviously suffers from a single point of failure, service latency, and scalability issues between IoT gateways and mobile devices. In order to address these problems, a framework that combines the pros of both central and distributed based schemes has been proposed. The proposed hybrid framework, referred to as STREAMIT, facilitates the 3D texture streaming over thin devices to cope with the mobile hardware resources and alleviate the challenges of client-server and ad-hoc 3D streaming. In addition, STREAMIT implements adaptive strategies to select, prioritize, and convey 3D texture graphical objects that only contribute to the user's visible scene. STREAMIT has been evaluated using NS3 discrete network simulator where extensive experiments have confirmed big achievements in terms of resource utilization, latency, throughput, and overhead.	3d computer graphics;algorithm;augmented reality;client–server model;digital distribution;download;encryption;experiment;graphical user interface;html5 in mobile devices;hoc (programming language);interaction;internet of things;massively multiplayer online role-playing game;mobile device;multiplexer;overhead (computing);pre-installed software;programming paradigm;prospective search;reliability engineering;scalability;server (computing);simulation;single point of failure;smart city;streaming media;throughput;virtual reality	Mohammad Al Ja'afreh;Moayad Aloqaily;Ismaeel Al Ridhawi;Nour Mostafa	2018	2018 Third International Conference on Fog and Mobile Edge Computing (FMEC)	10.1109/FMEC.2018.8364067	architecture;rendering (computer graphics);smart city;the internet;scalability;network simulation;virtual machine;mobile device;computer science;distributed computing	Mobile	-19.729967117706984	77.34132591701426	151431

Corresponding approaches towards coordination, resource utilization, and interoperability are still challenging. This paper introduces the concept of adaptive task-oriented message templates (ATMT) as a basis for overcoming these issues and for enabling cooperative in-network processing without additional synchronization overhead for mobile devices. An ATMT serves as a self-encapsulated message containing the operation chains that need to be executed as well as the required data. In order to address heterogeneity and interoperability issues, we integrate a lightweight ontology. Depending on the current utilization, devices can autonomously decide whether to participate in the network or not. We evaluate our approach in an indoor testbed with 8 wireless mesh nodes. The results confirm that our approach efficiently supports cooperation among heterogeneous devices towards utilizing available in-network resources while reducing network traffic.	autonomous robot;computational resource;hoc (programming language);internet;interoperability;lightweight ontology;mobile device;network processor;network traffic control;organizing (structure);overhead (computing);self-organization;testbed;wireless mesh network	The An Binh Nguyen;Christian Meurisch;Stefan Niemczyk;Doreen Böhnstedt;Kurt Geihs;Max Mühlhäuser;Ralf Steinmetz	2017	2017 International Conference on Networked Systems (NetSys)	10.1109/NetSys.2017.7903952	mobile search;engineering;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-19.784818505716643	81.15310563778279	151844

The advent of truly mobile computing in the form of smart phones and tablets has also driven the demand for Cloud resources in order to compensate for the inherent lack of local resources on these devices. Furthermore, modern mobile devices are equipped with multiple network interfaces and in combination with the rapid deployment of wireless networks, it is expected that they will always have Internet connectivity and access to Cloud resources. In this paper we will focus on traffic management for interactive multimedia services accessed by a mobile user by means of dynamic migration of a Virtual Machine. Network performance measurements are taken from a network of virtualization-enabled hosts that perform live migrations of a Virtual Machine which hosts multimedia content. The data is used as input to an equation that determines whether a migration would be beneficial in terms of traffic localization based on a user's mobility characteristics and network usage patterns. The contribution of this paper lies in the proposed mechanism of managing traffic for interactive services in the context of mobile cloud computing. This helps alleviate the increased network costs introduced by dynamic migrations driven by Quality of Service parameters and may result in increased network traffic for the benefit of improved QoS.	edge computing;hardware virtualization;mobile cloud computing;mobile computing;mobile device;network packet;network performance;quality of service;smartphone;software deployment;virtual machine	Fragkiskos Sardis;Glenford E.

In emergency-affected networks, knowledge of realistic user mobility plays a key role to provide critical services and information. Since present models fail to capture actual post-emergency user movements, a realistic post-emergency mobility model has recently been proposed. Nevertheless, this model suffers from high evacuation delay due to hotspot issue. Simultaneously, it suffers from traffic congestion because of user initiated traffic explosion while seeking services/ information. Consequently, to alleviate these limitations, this work proposes a middleware based on the Internet-of-Things to manage user mobility in the post-emergency network. The proposed middleware, operating on a user's hand-held device, analyzes the context information obtained from the surrounding smart things to select an evacuation route for the user that optimizes the evacuation delay and the traffic congestion in the post-emergency network. Simulation results have been used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed middleware.	java hotspot virtual machine;middleware;mobile device;network congestion;performance;routing;simulation;warez	Nusrat Ahmed Surobhi;Abbas Jamalipour	2014	2014 21st International Conference on Telecommunications (ICT)	10.1109/ICT.2014.6845124	internet privacy;computer security;computer network	HPC	-19.833769392035304	75.88367598248396	152601

OCP is designed with typical adaptation tasks in mind (e.g., virus and spam management, language and format translation, message anonymization, or advertisement manipulation). As defined in this document, the OCP Core consists of application-agnostic mechanisms essential for efficient support of typical adaptations.	open core protocol	Alex Rousskov	2005	RFC	10.17487/RFC4037	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;world wide web	Theory	-27.27655045670662	86.77075954140356	152974

This paper proposes a low-cost open source platform, MODiToNeS, which uses commodity hardware to support prototyping and testing of fully distributed multi-layer complex algorithms over real-world (or pseudoreal) traces. MODiToNeS platform is generic and comprises multiple interfaces that allow real-time topology and mobility control, deployment and analysis of different self-organized and self-adaptive routing algorithms, real-time content processing, and real-time environment sensing with predictive analytics. Our platform also allows rich interactivity with the user. We show deployment and analysis of two vastly different complex networking systems: a fault and disconnection-aware smart manufacturing sensor network and cognitive privacy for personal clouds. We show that our platform design can integrate both contexts transparently and organically and allows a wide range of analysis.

Indeed many systems are added to the vehicle to offer more comfort and safety to the driver. These improvements engender an increase in electronic components number and consequently of the informative flow. As vehicular computing environments become more network-oriented, the importance of network traffic monitoring and analysis intensifies to insure the security and the good progress of the inter-vehicular communication. This paper presents the design of a High Performance Ethernet traffic Monitoring and Analysis system in the Automotive field, called HP- EMAA. It can run on off-the shelf, on cost-effective computers, support high bitrates (over 400 MBps) and open a gigabyte pcapfile (over 100 Gegabytes). The monitoring and analysis task in HP- EMAA allows online and offline analysis. The effectiveness of HP- EMAA has been verified by applying it to a gateway simulator that generates high speed Ethernet traffic.	computer;data rate units;device driver;electronic component;gigabyte;information;network traffic control;online and offline;parallel computing;simulation	Hela Lajmi;Adel M.

In this research, we first present a theoretic framework and its process flow as a possible future scenario. Then we describe our empirical studies of price formation in cognitive radio networks. Our proposed pricing model describes the interaction between competing Application Service Providers, service broker and end users. We use game theory as a mathematical basis for the analysis of interactive decision-making process among the actors of the given telecommunication market. The empirical studies show that the end users do not always prefer a service provider with the cheapest unit price, but their decisions also depend on the received QoS level. The Nash equilibrium tells the service provider the ideal point where profit is maximized at the highest level of customer satisfaction.	cognitive radio;game theory;nash equilibrium;quality of service;service-oriented architecture	Gülfem Isiklar Alptekin;Ayse Basar Bener	2008	2008 34th Euromicro Conference Software Engineering and Advanced Applications	10.1109/SEAA.2008.73	service level requirement;service level objective;game theory;cognitive radio;computer science	HCI	-24.642888788623537	75.69863561368292	154795

The gateway is used to transfer management information between an XML-based manager and SNMP-based agents. SNMP is widely used for Internet management, but SNMP is insufficient to manage continuously expanding networks because of constraints in scalability and efficiency. XML–based network management architectures are newly proposed as alternatives to SNMP-based network management, but the XML-based Network Management System (XML-based NMS) cannot directly manage legacy SNMP agents. We also implemented an automatic specification translator (SNMP MIB to XML Translator) and an SNMPXML gateway.

67350a2362c6fa1820c6b93ecea87f12d11d61ef	development of a social dtn for message communication between sns group members		Smartphones have the ability to communicate with other terminals through ad hoc connections. A variety of applications have been developed to exploit this ability. The authors have developed an Android OS (operating system) application (called “social DTN manager”) that builds a DTN (delay, disruption, disconnection tolerant networking) among members of a social networking service (SNS) community using a community token. The members can exchange messages over this network. Control messages for building a DTN are forwarded to only those nodes that use the same community token in order to reduce flooding of message copies. When a source node sends a communication request to its destination node, they exchange control messages to establish a communication route. Relay nodes use these messages to create and hold routing information for these nodes in their routing tables. Thereafter, relay nodes can forward data messages based on their routing tables. This again reduces flooding of message copies. The social DTN manager incorporates these functions, Facebook Graph API and Google Nearby Connections API. The authors have installed it in Android terminals and confirmed that a social DTN can successfully be built using this application and that data messages can be exchanged between terminals via reactive routes.	android;application programming interface;delay-tolerant networking;denial-of-service attack;facebook platform;hardware restriction;hoc (programming language);internet;operating system;prototype;relay;routing table;smartphone;social graph;software prototyping;wireless access point	Hidenori Takasuka;Koichi Hirai;Kazumasa Takami	2018	Future Internet	10.3390/fi10040032	computer science;computer network;android (operating system);security token;routing table;relay;social network;exploit;graph	Mobile	-25.70850337310661	82.83566695928573	156242

In these applications multi-vendor and heterogeneous sensor nodes are deployed. Due to strict administrative control over the WSN domains, communication barrier, conflicting goal & economic interest of different vendors of sensor node in WSN make it difficult to introduce a large scale federated WSN. By allowing heterogeneous wireless sensor networks to coexist on a shared physical substrate, virtualization in sensor network may provide flexibility, promote diversity, ensure security and increase manageability. This paper surveys the novel approach of using the large scale federated WSN resources in a sensor virtualization environment. In this paper we propose sensor virtualization architecture and focus on the challenges and opportunities of research in the field of sensor network virtualization as well as to illustrate a picture of current researches in this field.	coexist (image);hardware virtualization;home automation;network architecture;sensor node;sensor web;x86 virtualization	Md.

Thus the proposed fingerprints require much less embedding capacity. Due to their very clandestine nature, collusions tend to involve a small number of buyers, so that there is plenty of use for codes providing cost-effective protection against collusions of size up to 3.	code word;fingerprint (computing);la clandestine absinthe	Francesc Sebé;Josep Domingo-Ferrer	2002		10.1007/3-540-45450-0_25	fingerprint;telecommunications;computer science;database;computer security	Security	-33.43546333065065	78.75357154793599	156747

In this paper, we design and implement control interfaces for the interconnection, which enables each ChoiceNet provider to explicitly control both OPCInet- and OpenFlow-based networks by use of a single common interface with proprietary/easily modifiable message formats for all control functions. We construct an experimental setup between the USA and Japan, and demonstrate that the OPCInet and an OpenFlow-based network placed in Japan are successfully controlled by request from the ChoiceNet provider installed in the USA. We also show that the time required to complete Telnet access to the OPCInet C-plane for each control is no more than 150 ms over the long distance from the USA to Japan.	control function (econometrics);ecosystem;experiment;ibm notes;interconnection;network packet;openflow;original chip set;orthogonal polarization spectral imaging;provisioning	Takaya Miyazawa;Hiroaki Harai;Robinson Udechukwu;Rudra Dutta	2018	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-018-0769-5	computer science;computer network;network service;openflow;interconnection;telnet;distributed computing;network packet;provisioning	Networks	-20.027816850297743	87.532706841479	157375

This is mainly because of its autoconfiguration capability a nd its cost effectiveness. Unfortunately, a single Ethernet n etwork can not scale to span a large enterprise network. A main reaso n for this is broadcast traffic resulting from many protocols running on top of Ethernet. This paper addresses Ethernet’s scalability limits due to broadcast traffic. We studied and characterized broadcast traffic in Ethernet networks using traces collected from real networks. We found that broadcast is mainly used in Ethernet for service and resource discovery. For example, the Address Resolutio n Protocol (ARP) uses broadcast to discover a MAC address that corresponds to an IP address. To avoid broadcast for service and resource discovery, we propose a new device, the EtherProxy. An EtherProxy uses caching to suppress broadcast traffic. EtherProxy is backwa rd compatible and requires no changes to existing hardware, software, or protocols. Moreover, it requires no configurat ion. In our evaluation, we used real and synthetic workloads. Using both workloads, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the EtherProxy.	2.5d;auto-configuration;backward compatibility;broadcasting (networking);cognitive dimensions of notations;communications protocol;experiment;mac address;network segmentation;prototype;scalability;synthetic intelligence;tracing (software)	Khaled Elmeleegy;Alan L.

In this context, traditional security measures do not scale well. We aim to develop trust-based security mechanisms using small world concepts to optimise formation and propagation of trust amongst entities in these vast networks. In this regard, we surmise that in a very large mobile ad hoc network, trust, risk, and recommendations can be propagated through relatively short paths connecting entities.

In this rapidly evolving environment, the configuration of WLAN access points raise the classical problem of re-using limited radio resources. In this paper, the problem of dynamic frequency allocation of WLAN access point in a highly competitive multi-provider Hot-Spots environment is addressed. Our solution aims at working in locations where planned and ad-hoc deployments might be side by side. An on-line adaptive optimization process is proposed and relies on available information delivered only by the local access points in order to maintain the quality of service as high as possible. This optimization process is implemented on a scalable and highly flexible agent-based framework. The easy deployment of intelligent agents in a real WLAN network and their integration in a simulation context allows us to perform extensive tests for small and large-scale networks. The proposed approach has been tested on a limited but practical demonstrator that showed encouraging results.	intelligent agent	Fiorenzo Gamba;Jean-Frédéric Wagen;Daniel Rossier	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-39611-6_11	adaptive optimization;scalability;simulation;frequency allocation;quality of service;internationalization and localization;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;software agent;programming language;implementation;computer security;service quality;hot spot;intelligent agent;private sector	Robotics	-27.534673370015327	76.0695636260309	161574

Hence, how to deal with the explosive data traffic in cellular networks becomes a challenging problem. Traditional methods rely on mobile offloading techniques to deviate the data traffic targeted to cellular networks, such as small cell, Wi-Fi, and opportunistic communication. Unfortunately, mobile users will still experience severe congestion when a large number of users request for data. Facing these challenges, we introduce the concept of mobile participation to assist data offloading by leveraging the mobility of mobile users and the social features among a group of users. A mobile caching user, who pre- caches certain amount of contents, can roam around congested areas to participate in data dissemination in order to satisfy users' requests, which can benefit both herself and users in the crowd simultaneously. Therefore, we propose a game theoretical approach to analyze the data offloading via mobile participation with joint considerations on network effects, congestion, social behaviors, and pricing strategy. Based on detailed performance analysis, we show the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach.	cache (computing);location-based service;mobile app;mobile device;nash equilibrium;network congestion;simulation	Xiaonan Zhang;Linke Guo;Ming Li;Yuguang Fang	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842274	pricing;games;cellular network;mobile search;mobile web;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;internet privacy;small cell;mobile computing;computer security;wireless;computer network	Mobile	-22.31616044817987	75.68906222201304	162832
515a7cb0bc54b3e218a9bbe81790ed6249f5168b	sovcan: safety-oriented vehicular controller area network		To meet the demands of vehicular networks, such as high throughput, high mobility, low latency, heterogeneity, and scalability, SDN has been applied for raising the user experience through providing high-performance communications between vehicular network nodes, reconstructing the vehicular network structure, and optimizing networking coverage, system security, communication latency, and so on. However, the existing SDN applications in the vehicular network mainly focus on the data communications between the vehicles and other network nodes or devices, while the vehicular controller area network is still limited to some particular applications, only providing users with basic services, but unable to meet the demands in a complex driving environment. Thus, this article proposes an SDN-based approach to develop the safety-oriented vehicular controller area network, which can guarantee traffic safety based on driver fatigue detection and emotional recognition, which are monitored through the driver's physiological and psychological state.	can bus;computer security;mental state;scalability;software-defined networking;throughput;user experience	Yin Zhang;Min Chen;Nadra Guizani;Jiqiang Wu;Victor C.

Among the main issues of autonomic systems is the question of self-configuration. In this paper, we describe a method for discovering and self-generating the configuration of a network device in order to dynamically push a new service into a network. On each configuration, several rules representing the semantics of the services are expressed in a logical formalism called Configuration Logic. From these rules, we show how to use traditional satisfiability methods to automatically generate or modify the configuration of a device with respect to the configuration of its neighbours. We illustrate our case with an example of a switch that automatically discovers its VLAN configuration when connected to an existing network. The results presented here have been implemented into the configuration management tool ValidMaker.	autonomic computing;autonomic networking;boolean satisfiability problem;cobham's thesis;configuration management;embedded system;formal system;modulo operation;networking hardware;node deletion;rule 90;self-organization;solver;virtual lan	Sylvain Hallé;Éric Wenaas;Roger Villemaire;Omar Cherkaoui	2006		10.1007/11880905_4	network management;configuration management database;self-organization;logic gate;computer science;autonomous system;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;semantics;configuration management;algorithm;satisfiability	AI	-23.731418538228205	81.18647164352109	163259
a3aab7457691e3b0ee199e8928bf632f13d104f8	fits checksum proposal		The checksum keywords described here provide an integrity check on the information contained in FITS HDUs. (Header and Data Units are the basic components of FITS files, consisting of header keyword records followed by optional associated data records). The CHECKSUM keyword is defined to have a value that forces the 32-bit 1’s complement checksum accumulated over all the 2880-byte FITS logical records in the HDU to equal negative 0. (Note that 1’s complement arithmetic has both positive and negative zero elements). Verifying that the accumulated checksum is still equal to -0 provides a fast and fairly reliable way to determine that the HDU has not been modified by subsequent data processing operations or corrupted while copying or storing the file on physical media. The checksum does not guard against organized transformations or malicious tampering, however, because simple transformations, such as rearranging the order of 32-bit words in the file, do not affect the computed checksum value. The checksum also does not provide any information on the authenticity of the file because the CHECKSUM keyword can always be updated after making modifications to the file, leaving no trace that the file is not the same as the original. A brief comparison with alternative checksum algorithms is given in §A.6.	32-bit;algorithm;checksum;fits;signed zero	Rob Seaman;William Pence;Arnold Rots	1995	CoRR		checksum;adler-32	OS	-32.632334523011565	82.159336163539	163400

Please refer to the current edition of the """"Internet Official Protocol Standards"""" (STD 1) for the standardization state and status of this protocol. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Abstract In certain situations, transporting a packet from one Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) speaker to another (the BGP next hop) requires that the packet be encapsulated by the first BGP speaker and decapsulated by the second. To support these situations, there needs to be some agreement between the two BGP speakers with regard to the """"encapsulation information"""", i.e., the format of the encapsulation header as well as the contents of various fields of the header. The encapsulation information need not be signaled for all encapsulation types. In cases where signaling is required (such as Layer Two Tunneling Protocol-Version 3 (L2TPv3) or Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) with key), this document specifies a method by which BGP speakers can signal encapsulation information to each other. The signaling is done by sending BGP updates using the Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) and the IPv4 or IPv6 Address Family Identifier (AFI). In cases where no encapsulation information needs to be signaled (such as GRE without Mohapatra & Rosen Standards Track [Page 1] RFC 5512 BGP Encapsulation SAFI and Tunnel Encapsulation April 2009 key), this document specifies a BGP extended community that can be attached to BGP UPDATE messages that carry payload prefixes in order to indicate the encapsulation protocol type to be used."""	border gateway protocol;encapsulation (networking);identifier;information needs;internet;network packet;pc speaker;routing;std bus;tunneling protocol	Pradosh Mohapatra;Eric C.

In addition to providing a brief survey of key existing results, we investigate two different effects that largely have been ignored in past studies. Many communication networks, such as the Internet, are too large for anyone to have global information of their topologies, which makes accurate, intentional attacks virtually impossible; most attacks in communication networks must propagate from nodes to adjacent nodes, utilizing local-network topology information only. We show that incomplete global information has a different impact on intentional attacks in different circumstances, and local information-based attacks can actually be highly efficient. Such insights will be helpful for the future development of efficient protection schemes against network attacks.	complex network;internet;network topology;telecommunications network;usb hub	Shi Xiao;Gaoxi Xiao;Tee Hiang Cheng	2008	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2008.4427244	atmospheric model;fault tolerance;the internet;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;barium;computer security;network topology;complex network;communications system;robustness;computer network	Security	-29.056606195582724	75.20650799081358	165416

An autonomic group service is supported for applications by cooperation of multiple autonomous agents. Each agent autonomously takes a class of each protocol function like retransmission. Classes taken by an agent are required to be consistent with but might be different from the others. A group is composed of views in each of which agents autonomously take protocol classes consistent with each other.

The network elements may be associated with proprietary configuration management instrumentation and may also be spread across heterogeneous network domains thereby increasing the complexity of configuration management. This paper introduces an architecture for the self-configuration of networks (SELFCON). The proposed architecture involves a directory server, which is used to maintain configuration information. The configuration information stored in the directory server is modeled using the standard DEN specification thereby allowing effective exchange of network, system and configuration management data among heterogeneous management domains. SELFCON associates configuration intelligence with the components of the network, rather than limit it to a centralized management station. The network elements are notified about related changes in configuration policies, based upon which, they perform self-configuration. SELFCON is able to provide automation of configuration management and also an effective unifying framework for enterprise management.	cops (software);centralized computing;common language infrastructure;computer network programming;configuration management;denormal number;directory (computing);directory service;end-to-end principle;event condition action;lightweight directory access protocol;linked data platform;provisioning;scalability;server (computing);simple network management protocol	Raouf Boutaba;Salima Omari;Ajay Pal Singh Virk	2001	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2001.6596962	network management;configuration management;configuration management database;embedded system;fcaps;communications protocol;lightweight directory access protocol;element management system;network architecture;index term;network management station;software configuration management;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;configuration management;network management application;processor register;configuration item;specification;telecommunications network;server;computer network;data transmission	OS	-21.607973901003056	84.61018509218431	165786

Cloud computing is the today’s latest trend which offers unlimited and flexible shared storage server in a computer system. It can be used by any organizations and institutions. It provides services anytime anywhere. It gives user satisfaction because it enhances efficiency, preserves resource utilization, and improves information sharing. This technology is very beneficial to mobile learners as it helps eliminate problems of distance barrier and the access to education in different geographical locations. Software licensing and manpower training are no longer needed with this latest technology. However real-time applications have constraint with their response time. This paper investigates the cost effective for Erlang traffic of Mobile Learning over the clouds. Throughputs over cost are analyzed. The analysis results that although Google Cloud offers a poor performance but it is the most cost effective compared to the other four clouds.	anytime algorithm;cloud computing;color gradient;computer;erlang (programming language);file server;google cloud messaging;real-time clock;response time (technology);server (computing);software license	Khaing Sandar Htun	2014	IJESMA	10.4018/ijesma.2014040101	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;marketing;operations management;operating system;world wide web	Arch	-19.98461736799823	74.91935224843199	165804

In this paper, we consider such a network where the network operator encourages some of her subscribers to operate as mobile Wi-Fi hotspots (hosts), providing Internet connectivity for other subscribers (clients). We formulate the interaction between the operator and mobile users as a two-stage game. In Stage I, the operator determines the usage-based pricing and quota-based incentive mechanism for the data usage. In Stage II, the mobile users make their decisions about whether to be a host, or a client, or not a subscriber at all. We characterize how the users' membership choices will affect each other's payoffs in Stage II, and how the operator optimizes her decision in Stage I to maximize her profit. Our theoretical and numerical results show that the operator's maximum profit increases with the user density, and the profit gain can be up to 50% in a dense network comparing with a pricing-only approach with no incentives.	client (computing);host (network);hotspot (wi-fi);internet;numerical analysis	Mohammad Mahdi Khalili;Lin Gao;Jianwei Huang;Babak Hossein Khalaj	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179434	pricing;games;mobile search;the internet;mobile telephony;public land mobile network;computer science;marketing;operating system;microeconomics;mobile computing;computer security;commerce	Metrics	-23.75866616706824	76.0177354747235	166498

Composite protocols provide an approach for rapid deployment of correct and flexible protocol stacks. A composite protocol is a collection of singlefunction protocol components arranged in an orderly manner providing a network communications capability. A network service primarily consists of two or more cooperating composite protocols. This thesis demonstrates the feasibilty of applying the composite protocol approach to design, specify and implement wider range of protocols and network services. Reliable multicast service is chosen as a case study as it consists of protocols for reliable replication of data in the network, multicast routing and group membership protocols. One of the main challenges in designing a network service is to handle interaction between multiple protocol stacks. In this thesis, we propose a solution for such co-operating protocols to communicate with each other by means of global memory objects. Global memory features, initialization,implementation and their interaction with composite protocol stacks are discussed. The functionality of all the individual protocol components and global memory objects in the multicast service that were implemented are also discussed in detail. This thesis finally reports results of various functionality and performance tests conducted on a medium-sized test network. The performance of the multicast service has been compared with Linux IP Multicast implementation.	active networking;communications protocol;linux;multicast;routing;software deployment;test-driven development	S.

A challenging task is how to maintain information security at a high level for multiple-destination video applications with the huge volume of data and dynamic property of clients. This paper proposes a novel Content-Aware Secure Multicast (CASM) protocol for video distribution that seamlessly integrates three important modules: 1)a scalable light-weight algorithm for group key management; 2) a content-aware key embedding algorithm that can make video quality distortion imperceptible and is reliable for clients to detect embedded keys; and 3) a smart two-level video encryption algorithm that can selectively encrypt a small set of video data only, and yet ensure the video as well as the embedded keys unrecognizable without a genuine key. The implementation of the CASM protocol is independent of the underlying multicast mechanism and is fully compatible with existing coding standards. Performance evaluation studies built upon a CASM prototype have demonstrated that CASM is highly robust and scalable in dynamic multicast environments. Moreover, it ensures secure distribution of key and video data with minimized communication and computation overheads. The proposed content-aware key embedding and encryption algorithms are fast enough to support real-time video multicasting.	algorithm;computation;data compression;digital distribution;digital video;distortion;embedded system;encryption;group key;high-level programming language;information security;key distribution;key management;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;prototype;real-time clock;scalability;secure multicast;streaming media;video coding format	Hao Yin;Chuang Lin;Feng Qiu;Jiangchuan Liu;Geyong Min;Bo Li	2006	IEEE Transactions on Multimedia	10.1109/TMM.2005.864316	quality management;multicast;telecommunications;content management;computer science;cryptography;video quality;information security;key management;video tracking;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security;robustness;computer network	Security	-32.67357639897702	85.30191445225698	166870

In NFV networks, network services are provided as chains of different virtual network functions (VNFs), which are instantiated and executed on dedicated VNF-compliant servers. The problem of composing those chains is referred to as the service chain composition problem. In contrast to centralized solutions that suffer from scalability and privacy issues, in this paper, we leverage non-cooperative game theory to achieve a low-complexity distributed solution to the above-mentioned problem. Specifically, to account for selfish and competitive behavior of users, we formulate the service chain composition problem as an atomic weighted congestion game with unsplittable flows and player-specific cost functions. We show that the game possesses a weighted potential function and admits a Nash equilibrium (NE). We prove that the price of anarchy is upper-bounded, and also propose a distributed and privacy-preserving algorithm which provably converges toward an NE of the game in polynomial time. Finally, through extensive numerical results, we assess the performance of the proposed distributed solution to the service chain composition problem.	algorithm;anarchy;centralized computing;game theory;nash equilibrium;network congestion;network function virtualization;numerical analysis;polynomial;privacy;programming paradigm;scalability;time complexity;transfer function	Salvatore D&#x2019;Oro;Laura Galluccio;Sergio Palazzo;Giovanni Schembra	2017	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2017.2659298	games;network functions virtualization;simulation;computer science;distributed computing;privacy;server;computer network	Metrics	-24.042883777441638	74.89443102613562	167150

This paper proposes Extensible Transparent Filter (ETF) for Ethernet using SDN, that suppresses broadcast traffic in a broadcast domain by selecting an appropriate outgoing port of the switch through which the target host of broadcast packet is reachable. ETF maintains both consistent functionality and backward compatibility of the existing networking protocols such as Address Resolution Protocol, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, and other possible protocols that work with the broadcast of a packet. ETF was developed using Trema and Floodlight, which are open source SDN controller supporting OpenFlow. The number of flooding was significantly reduced in a broadcast domain where user clients connecting to the same VLAN across multiple production SDN switches successfully performed DHCP and ARP respectively. This paper also discusses the practical deployment and operation of SDN and ETF as a part of campus network in Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad. The proposed approach improves scalability of a broadcast domain of Ethernet as an enhancement to the existing enterprise networks using SDN.	backward compatibility;broadcast domain;broadcasting (networking);communications protocol;network packet;network switch;open-source software;openflow;scalability;software deployment;software-defined networking;virtual lan	Kotaro Kataoka;Nitin Agarwal;Aditya V.

The discussion shows that there are two critical points for attacking this network: the bus arbitrator and the bus.

The purpose of this study is to improve quick response of network reconfiguration to meet users' requests. We realize the access control method based on organizational structure by cooperating OpenFlow and database that saved user information. We propose the network control scheme that users are able to edit structure information. To confirm the proposed methods, we made test bed and performed operation verification. As a result, we confirmed that the change of structure information by users was reflected in network control within 5 seconds.	access control;openflow;requirement;testbed	Takeshi Oowari;Ayumu Yoshine;Osamu Mizuno	2015	2015 10th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Information and Telecommunication Technologies (APSITT)	10.1109/APSITT.2015.7217103	network admission control;network traffic control;intelligent computer network;network architecture;network management station;computer science;network security;database;network simulation;distributed computing;network access control;computer network;network access point;network access device	Mobile	-22.51192775499047	85.57652297878964	168326

Analysis and simulation results indicate that the design works well, and it may cause all power loads to become accountable.	computer security;enterprise architecture framework;interoperability;nan;privacy;simulation;software deployment	Jing Liu;Yang Xiao;Jingcheng Gao	2014	IEEE Systems Journal	10.1109/JSYST.2013.2260697	telecommunications;computer science;engineering;information security;smart grid;internet privacy;computer security;internet of things;computer network	EDA	-23.4522393548904	79.71891010675441	170957

Internet bandwidth is becoming very accessible, what makes voice over IP used on an everyday basis. Being able to communicate with multiple people at the same time can be beneficial, but on the other hand increases the need of coordination mechanisms. Determining a moderation scheme which is fair and efficient is not a trivial problem to solve. We define conference moderation as a multiagent resource allocation problem and introduce a process based on Vickrey auctions to solve it. A concept of co-owned communication channel is what stands as a basis of our definition of fairness.	agent-based model;channel (communications);fairness measure;real life;semiconductor industry;walrasian auction	Adam Polomski	2013	2013 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems		e-commerce;simulation;teleconference;resource allocation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;management;computer security;computer network	Vision	-25.031074013519746	75.13058941422734	171765

Block-cipher modes of operation define a mechanism for probabilistic encryption of arbitrary length messages using any underlying block cipher. A mode of operation can be proven secure (say, against chosen-plaintext attacks) based on the assumption that the underlying block cipher is a pseudorandom function. Such proofs are complex and error-prone, however, and must be done from scratch whenever a new mode of operation is developed. We propose an automated approach for the security analysis of block-cipher modes of operation based on a """"local"""" analysis of the steps carried out by the mode when handling a single message block. We model these steps as a directed, acyclic graph, with nodes corresponding to instructions and edges corresponding to intermediate values. We then introduce a set of labels and constraints on the edges, and prove a meta-theorem showing that any mode for which there exists a labeling of the edges satisfying these constraints is secure (against chosen-plaintext attacks). This allows us to reduce security of a given mode to a constraint-satisfaction problem, which in turn can be handled using an SMT solver. We couple our security-analysis tool with a routine that automatically generates viable modes, together, these allow us to synthesize hundreds of secure modes."""	block cipher mode of operation;cognitive dimensions of notations;constraint satisfaction problem;directed acyclic graph;directed graph;plaintext;probabilistic encryption;pseudorandom function family;pseudorandomness;solver	Alex J.

0905612ffb7ca26aa0cecffaa414bbea90d3bae2	common biometric exchange formats framework standardization		Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework (CBEFF) provides a standardized set of definitions and procedures that support the interchange of biometric data in standard data structures called CBEFF biometric information records (BIRs). BIRs are well-defined data structures that consist of two or three parts: the standard biometric header (SBH), the biometric data block (BDB), and possibly the optional security block (SB). CBEFF permits considerable flexibility regarding BIR structures and BDB content, but does so in a way that makes it easy for biometric applications to evaluate their interest in processing a particular BIR. CBEFF imposes no restrictions on the contents of a BDB, which can conform to a standardized biometric data interchange format or can be completely proprietary. CBEFF standardizes a set of SBH data element definitions and their abstract values. A few of these data elements are mandatory in all SBHs (such as identifying the BDB format) and the rest are optional or conditional. Most of the data elements support description of various attributes of the BDB within the BIR. The optional SB provides a container for integrity and/or encryption related data that must be available to validate or process the BIR and/or BDB (such as integrity signatures and encryption algorithm identity).	algorithm;biometrics;bonaventura di bello;cbeff;data interchange format;data element;data structure;encryption;sandy bridge;signature	Fernando L.

Building global-scale distributed systems with predictable properties is one of the great challenges for computer systems engineering in the new century. Work undertaken within the Internet Engineering Task Force has led to the definition of novel architectural models for the Internet with QoS support. According to these models, the network has to be appropriately configured in order to provide applications with the required performance guarantees. In next-generation networks, enabling applications to interact with the underlying QoS services is of primary importance. Hence, several special-purpose application programming interfaces (APIs) have been defined to let applications negotiate QoS parameters across QoS-capable networks. However, so far, none of these APIs are available in different operating environments. We believe that such features should be embedded in programming environments for distributed applications. In this work we present how we included QoS control features in Tcl, a programming language that has been widely adopted for the development of distributed multimedia applications. Our work has led to the implementation of QTcl, an extended Tcl interpreter that provides programmers with a new set of primitives, in full compliance with the standard SCRAPI programming interface for the RSVP protocol. QTcl in highly portable, in that it enables standard QoS negotiation to be performed in a seamless fashion on the most common operating systems.

All designs target resource-constrained environments such as smart cards or embedded devices and therefore, have been protected against DPA attacks while keeping low-area as the most important design goal in mind. Each of the three architectures contains masking and hiding countermeasures. They solely differ with regard to the implemented secret-sharing scheme. While the first design is based on a 3-share threshold implementation TI, which does not fulfill the uniformity property, the other two make use of the 3-share approach with re-masking and the 4-share approach as proposed by Bilgini¾?eti¾?al. Our smallest, provable first-order DPA secure Keccak implementation requires only 14.5i¾?kGE which is less than half of the size of related work and contains both front-end and back-end design overheads. Moreover, we present first DPA results of the Zorro ASIC by comparing hiding and masking countermeasures.

Particularly, how to validate if a real-time network can fulfill the strict requirements on communications, in a few ms or hundreds of μs? The basic approach is by precise simulations of the underneath communication network! However, the time requirements from distributed power applications cannot be met by the general data networks. There are no methods and tools available for such simulations, including the common network simulators OPNET and NS-2, due to the difficulty of simulating different time granularities. In this paper, we propose a simulation method for the modeling and operation of the protocols. First, we analyze the modeling and simulation of real-time Ethernet protocols that are widely used for connecting the most critical and fast response devices in smart grids. Second, we simulate the packet level performance of the real-time Ethernet. Third, we implement the modules for the protocol in the OPNET simulator. As an example, we model and simulate the EtherCAT, a real-time Ethernet protocol. Our extensive simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed methods are accurate and effective in modeling and simulating the packet-level performance of the real-time Ethernets. The methods can be also implemented in other tools to validate the timing critical devices in smart grids, such as super fast protections.	ibm power systems;network packet;real-time clock;real-time computing;requirement;simulation;software deployment;telecommunications network	Ziyuan Cai;Ming Yu;Leonard J.

This paper presents mathematical models to approximate the overhead traffic created by the MA-based NMS and SNMP-based NMS on the production network, based on the complexity of the management task involved. Through our analysis and experimentation, we establish that there is range (of the number of nodes involved) wherein it is advantageous to use mobile agents. Furthermore, we demonstrate through our analytical model that this range can be estimated a priori, thereby facilitating a decision on when to deploy mobile agents and when not to.	agent-based model;approximation algorithm;experiment;imperative programming;isolation (database systems);mathematical model;mobile agent;no man's sky;overhead (computing);simple network management protocol	Huy Hoang To;Shonali Krishnaswamy;Bala Srinivasan	2005		10.1145/1066677.1066694	network management;simulation;network management station;computer science;mathematical model;mobile agent;distributed computing;computer security	Mobile	-22.04245446368817	82.02559915039843	175264

Potentially unlimited virtual memory could be found on remote servers made accessible through a wireless link, but power hungry wireless network interface cards (WNIC) may reduce the battery lifetime if not efficiently exploited, actually limiting the practical interest of network virtual memory (NVM). On the other hand, when network memory is used for swapping, service performance can be an issue. In this tutorial we discuss the feasibility of network swapping for wireless mobile terminals. First, we perform extensive experiments to compare performance and energy of network swapping with those of local swapping on microdrives and flash memories. Our results show that remote swap devices made accessible through a power-manageable WNIC can be even more efficient than local microdrives. Second, we address the issue of mobility management by presenting an infrastructure providing efficient remote memory access to mobile terminals.

Broadcasting is widely used in many protocols, like ARP [1], DHCP [2] and so on. The main reason is that in a distributed network, each node has no knowledge about the whole network. Therefore, the node has to use broadcast ways to build its knowledge. However, for those who do not need to get or answer the broadcast message, the broadcast message is nothing but a noise packet. In this paper, we propose a broadcast handling framework in software defined networking. With this framework, a network manager can minimize the broadcast behavior in the network without impacting hosts. We also implement some broadcast handling modules in this work. We evaluate our framework's performance by comparing our framework with legacy networks and other SDN network platforms. We also discuss the impact of our framework to the spanning tree protocol.	broadcast domain;legacy system;network packet;network switch;openflow;software-defined networking;spanning tree protocol	Po-Wen Chi;Yu-Cheng Huang;Jing-Wei Guo;Chin-Laung Lei	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037096	local area network;broadcast domain;broadcasting;communications protocol;broadcast radiation;real-time computing;atomic broadcast;broadcast communication network;non-broadcast multiple-access network;network switch;computer science;control system;operating system;virtual lan;distributed computing;packet forwarding;multimedia broadcast multicast service;broadcasting;server;computer network;terminating reliable broadcast	Mobile	-19.462980102817824	86.1350206439264	176254

Our method allows to represent the cost to achieve any operation involving some services in a grid environment. We demonstrate why the current monitoring tools are not sufficient in grid environments that lack high level tools to combine several sources of monitoring while taking into account particular constraints for some given applications. We show how this method has been embedded in a grid service, namely the network distance service (NDS). We illustrate the benefit of our approach in terms of accuracy, using an algorithm from graph theory on a grid planning scenario. We explain some implementation issues and discuss how the proposed NDS service can be useful to any grid service who needs some accurate evaluation for a decision making process involving such distances	algorithm;computation;embedded system;graph theory;grid computing;high-level programming language;list of algorithms;relevance;web service	Julien Gossa;Jean-Marc Pierson	2007	Fourth European Conference on Universal Multiservice Networks (ECUMN'07)	10.1109/ECUMN.2007.18	semantic grid;computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;distributed computing;grid computing	HPC	-21.660944364347202	79.35893746641166	176513

The paper proposes an interworking model based on interface elements known as gateways , the primary criterian of the model being providing transparent transport end-to-end connections between users of the networks being interconnected. Subsequently, the SNA-Sopho-Net interconnection implementation is described within the framework of the proposed model. The key issues of interworking described in the paper are the ability of the model to map network-dependent characteristics between different networks such as resource names, addresses, message formats, protocols, and data transport.

The objective is to improve the network performance in handling various types of messages by on-line adjustment of protocol parameters. The techniques of perturbation analysis of Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS), stochastic approximation (SA), and learning automata have been used in formulating the algorithm of performance management. The efficacy of the performance management tool has been demonstrated on a network testbed. The conceptual design presented offers a step forward to bridging the gap between management standards and users' demands for efficient network operations since most standards such as ISO (International Standards Organization) and IEEE address only the architecture, services, and interfaces for network management. The proposed concept for performance management can also be used as a general framework to assist design, operation, and management of various DEDS such as computer integrated manufacturing and battlefield C/sup 3/ (Command, Control, and Communications). >	telecommunications network	Suk Lee;Asok Ray	1993	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.257934	stochastic process;fcaps;element management system;systems management;simulation;network management station;telecommunications;computer science;dynamical system;perturbation theory;distributed computing;network management application;structure of management information;computer network	Mobile	-21.355613369293813	88.3308525969899	177670
f61133196f18772ca188b948545aab28ffe834e1	a truthful content auction scheme for distributee content delivery in ultra-dense networks		At the edge of the network with cache servers, researchers usually focused on how to cache the contents or how to deliver cached contents from edge network to user equipment (UE). In this paper, we study the content delivery scheme in ultra-dense network (UDN) scenario. Since small cells (SCs) are densely and largely deployed in UDNs, it is hard to operate the SCs with a central unit. Thus, our delivery scheme should be implemented in a distributed way. We firstly utilize auction to model the content delivery problem, where UE intend to acquire interested contents from SCs. Then, the content delivery relationship is constructed by the content trading process. Then, an auction based truthful and distributed content delivery (ATDCD) algorithm is designed. Within ATDCD, a distributed auctioneer protocol is introduced to effectively prevent SCs falling in to collusion and guarantee the c-resiliency for sellers. Extensive simulation results are done to show that ATDCD can achieve truthfulness as well as high performance.	algorithm;centralized computing;digital distribution;graph theory;numerical analysis;simulation	Bowen Liu;Heli Zhang;Hong Ji;Xi Li;Victor C.

d10f0af35fdbc2f22fcb5b00414828e3d9c59da8	the ltap trigger gateway for ldap directories		LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) directories are being rapidly deployed on the web. They are currently used to store data like white pages information, user profiles, and network device descriptions. LDAP directories offer scalability advantages over current database technologies, as well as being more flexible. However, as users begin to use them for Directory Enabled Networking tasks such as provisioning network services, allocating resources, reporting, managing end-to-end security, and offering mobile users customized features that follow them, LDAP’s limited functionality becomes a significant barrier to progress. For example, LDAP directories do not have active database functionality (i.e., triggers). However, triggers are necessary for monitoring changes to directories and taking appropriate actions, just as they are for databases. Such functionality is crucial to take full advantage of proposals such as the Directory Enabled Network (DEN) initiative. Currently, trigger functionality is non-standardized for LDAP and each vendor’s solution is non-portable. We built the Lightweight Trigger Access Process (LTAP) gateway to provide a portable way to add triggers to a LDAP directory. We describe the trigger language, the gateway’s implementation, as well as our experiences gained both during implementation and from our users. LTAP is currently being used in several projects.

The vision is that FLIP will be used to interconnect such devices forming clouds in the farthest branches/leaves of the Internet, while still providing connectivity with the existing IP-based Internet infrastructure. Through its flexible, customizable headers FLIP integrates just the functions required by a given application and that can be handled by the underlying device. Simple devices like sensors will benefit from incurring close to optimal overhead saving not only bandwidth, but, more importantly, energy. More sophisticated devices in the cloud can be responsible for implementing more complex functions like reliable/ordered data delivery, communication with other device clouds and with the IP infrastructure. FLIP is designed to provide a basic substrate on which to build networkand transport-level functionality. In heterogeneous environments, FLIP allows devices with varying capabilities to coexist and interoperate under the same network infrastructure. We present the basic design of FLIP and describe its implementation under Linux. We also report on FLIP’s performance when providing IPv4 and IPv6 as well as transport-layer functionality a la TCP and UDP. We show FLIP’s energy efficiency in different sensor network scenarios. For example, we use FLIP to implement the directed diffusion communication paradigm and obtain an improvement of 50% in energy savings over an existing directed diffusion implementation. Finally, we showcase FLIP’s flexibility by demonstrating its ability to incorporate new protocol functions seamlessly. In particular, we add data aggregation functionality onto FLIP and show that it significantly increases the system’s	address space;bsd;bandwidth (signal processing);berkeley sockets;byte;cloud computing;coexist (image);communications protocol;data aggregation;desktop computer;experiment;flip video;flip-flop (electronics);ip address blocking;interconnection;internet;internetworking;interoperability;laptop;linear algebra;linux;mathematical optimization;maximal set;overhead (computing);programmer;programming paradigm;requirement;seamless3d;sensor;simulation;software deployment;transistor–transistor logic;transport layer security	Ignacio Solis;Katia Obraczka	2004	MONET	10.1023/B:MONE.0000031603.28679.6f	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-19.46037111538001	82.0455287338915	179188

This paper studies the seriousness of the negative impact that free riding can have in a P2P file sharing system. We introduce the concept of utility function to measure the usefulness of peers to the system as a whole, and describe a scheme based on this concept to control free riding. A simple utility function is described to illustrate the scheme. We design and develop a simulation model to study various patterns of sharing behaviors among the peers in a file sharing community and their impact on the system. A set of experimental results is reported. The experiments indicate that the utility based free riding control can increase the lifetime of the system by 10 times, even with a simple utility function.	data quality;download;experiment;lookup table;peer-to-peer file sharing;quality of service;simulation;utility	Lakshmish Ramaswamy;Ling Liu	2003		10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174583	self-certifying file system;the internet;computer science;ssh file transfer protocol;simulation modeling;journaling file system;peer-to-peer;database;bittorrent tracker;open;internet privacy;free riding;global namespace;world wide web;file sharing	Robotics	-26.91037101795412	74.54624363634115	180188

In order to deal with the surge of data traffic, the wired network already utilizes caches in efficient ways. In recent years, there has been ongoing research in wireless networks to add caches to devices to reduce the burden of the radio resource. While many devices can support only small-sized caches and limited-sized batteries, some devices such as cars and buses may be able to include large caches and can provide contents to other devices via device-to-device (D2D) communications. In this paper, we discuss D2D offloading using caches on mobile devices by exploiting the mobility of the devices.	cpu cache;cache (computing);computation offloading;mobile device;serial experiments lain;streaming media	Soyi Kim;Eulhyeon Go;Yoonseok Song;HyungJoon Cho;Minjoong Rim;Chung G.

df98417c55bc5655ea77c498f629e4b7d47be92e	network-assisted smart access point selection for pervasive real-time mhealth applications		Due to the fast evolution of wireless access networks and high-performance mobile devices together with the spreading of wearable medical sensors, electronic healthcare (eHealth) services have recently started to receive more and more attention, especially in the mobile Health (mHealth) domain. The vast majority of mHealth services require strict medical level Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) provision. Emergency use-cases, remote patient monitoring, tele-consultation and guided surgical intervention require real-time communication and appropriate connection quality. The increasing significance of different overlapping wireless accesses makes possible to provide the required network resources for ubiquitous and pervasive mHealth applications. Aiming to support such use-cases in a heterogeneous network environment, we propose a network-assisted intelligent access point selection scheme for ubiquitous applications of Future Internet architectures focusing on real-time mobile telemedicine services. Our solution is able to discover nearby base stations that cover the current location of the mobile device efficiently and to trigger heterogeneous handovers based on the state and quality of the current access network. The solution is empirically evaluated in Wi-Fi networks used by real-life Android mobile devices and we observed that the scheme can improve the quality of mHealth applications and enhance traffic load balancing capabilities of wireless architectures. © 2014 The Authors.

c6fa27ea90df26f524c7cc28225be80b5010165a	smart coordination of autonomic component ensembles in the context of ad-hoc communication		Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (sCPS) are complex distributed decentralized systems that typically operate in an uncertain environment and thus have to be resilient to both network and individual node failures. At the same time, sCPS are commonly required to exhibit complex smart coordination while being limited in terms of resources such as network. However, optimizing network usage in a general sCPS coordination framework while maintaining the system function is complex. To better enable this, we allow incorporating key network parameters and constraints into the architecture, realized as an extension of the autonomic component ensembles paradigm. We show that when chosen well, these parameters make it possible to improve network resource usage without hampering the system utility too much. We demonstrate the parameter selection on a mobile gossip-based sCPS coordination scenario and use simulation to show the impact on overall system utility.	autonomic computing;hoc (programming language)	Tomás Bures;Petr Hnetynka;Filip Krijt;Vladimír Matena;Frantisek Plasil	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-47166-2_45	real-time computing;machine learning;distributed computing	HCI	-20.911385583394246	79.38592044320204	183973

In this paper, we examine the fundamental mobile cloudlet properties that unfold whether and when a mobile cloudlet can provide mobile application service. Specifically, we investigate the cloudlet size, cloudlet node's lifetime and reachable time. Traces and mathematical analysis demonstrate that 1) the more frequently mobile devices meet, the larger the pool of computing resources an initiator can access; 2) intermittent connection between devices has little adverse effect on the optimal computing performance of mobile cloudlet in the long run; 3) the ratio E(TC)/[E(TI)+E(TC)] indicates the connection likelihood of an initiator and a cloudlet node (i.e., reachability of the cloudlet node), where TC and TI are their contact and inter-contact time. We further derive upper and lower bounds on computing capacity and computing speed of a mobile cloudlet. An initiator can use both bounds to decide whether to offload its task to remote clouds or local mobile cloudlets for better mobile application services.	cloudlet;digital footprint;microelectronics and computer technology corporation;mobile app;mobile device;reachability;scsi initiator and target;time complexity;upload	Yujin Li;Wenye Wang	2014	IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848036	embedded system;real-time computing;mobile search;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	-20.24211018799769	75.01726635403341	184581

Integrating increasing numbers of autonomous subnetworks (each with an increasing number of hosts) makes it more difficult to determine if the network managers of the subnetworks will interoperate correctly. We propose a high level, formal specification language, NMSL, as an aid in solving this problem. NMSL has two aspects of operation, a descriptive aspect and a prescriptive aspect. In its descriptive aspect, NMSL specifies abstractions of the network components and their instantiations, and verifies the consistency of such a specification. The abstractions include the data objects and processes in a network management system. These abstractions are instantiated on network elements. Network elements are grouped together in the specification of domains of administration. An extension mechanism is provided to allow for the specification of new management characteristics that the basic language cannot express. In its prescriptive aspect, NMSL generates configuration information directly from a consistent specification. This information is used to configure network management processes to make their operation consistent with their specifications. Standard management protocols (such as the emerging ISO or IETF standards) can be used to incorporate the configuration information into running management processes.	autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);formal specification;high-level programming language;internet;internets;interoperability;specification language	David L.

Although BT has been widely deployed, many important features about it are not clear yet. For example, what parameter configuration is optimal for its download performance and to what extent is its incentive mechanism efficient in preventing free-riding. We focused our study on two aspects in this paper: the impact of maximum concurrent upload number on download speed; the efficiency of BT's incentive mechanism on fairness and download performance in the face of free-riders. Our results reveal that there is not an uniform value for the optimal maximum concurrent upload number, and that BT's incentive mechanism is robust to free-riders at a large scale, however seed's upload capacity should be good engineered and BT's incentive mechanism deserve to be improved in some aspects, e.g., optimistic unchoke.	bittorrent;download;experiment;fairness measure;optimistic concurrency control;optimization problem;upload	Dongliang Guan;Jiangtao Wang;Yue Zhang;Jun Dong	2008	Seventh International Conference on Networking (icn 2008)	10.1109/ICN.2008.16	arsenic;games;lead;thin-film transistor;sulfur;bittorrent;computer science;operating system;irrigation;internet privacy;indium;free riding;world wide web;computer security;bandwidth;computer network	HPC	-26.946128043004233	74.60256305066818	186297

When using centralized scheduling, a scheduler computes a communication schedule, which then needs to be installed into the network. This can be done using standards such CoAP and CoMI, or using a custom protocol such as OCARI. In this paper, we compute the number of messages installing and updating the schedule takes, using both approaches, on a realistic example scenario. The cost of using today’s standards is high. In some cases, a standards-based solution requires approximately 4 times more messages to be transmitted in the network, than when using a custom protocol. This paper makes three simple recommended changes to the standards which, when integrated, reduce the cost of a standardsbased solution by 18% to 74 %. Since they are still being developed, these recommendations can easily be integrated into the standards.	centralized computing;constrained application protocol;low-power broadcasting;mesh networking;overhead (computing);protocol stack;schedule (project management);scheduling (computing);wireless mesh network	Erwan Livolant;Pascale Minet;Thomas Watteyne	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-40509-4_2	embedded system;real-time computing;operating system;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-21.34859826788195	82.46597664715145	186605

The scheme uses K60 (NXP Freescale MK60DN512VLQ10) as the master chip, transplants RT-Thread, a real-time operating system, and a lightweight protocol stack LwIP, which runs TCP / UDP Socket service, listens to the host computer command. The embedded system is connected with the core processor FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) through the RMII and the UART interfaces. To realize the configuration of the image gateway, the embedded system reads the network packets from FPGA through the RMII interface and sends the security rules to FPGA through the UART.	communications protocol;configuration management;embedded system;field-programmable gate array;giove;host (network);internet of things;lightweight protocol;media-independent interface;network security;protocol stack;rt-thread;real-time operating system;real-time transcription	Yuqing Fu;Shunhao Lin;Ding Zhang;Yiqing Liu;Shimei Huang	2017	2017 10th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)	10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2017.8302324	embedded system;lightweight protocol;universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter;field-programmable gate array;standardization;network packet;computer science;multi-core processor;host (network);default gateway	Embedded	-23.7604148154085	82.27184355051952	186803

By intelligent, we refer to the capability of performing the monitoring tasks in a way that has the smallest possible impact on the managed network, facilitates the observation and summarisation of information according to a number of criteria and, in its most advanced form, permits the specification of these criteria dynamically to suit the particular policy in hand. The OSI management metric monitoring and summarisation management functions provide models that only partially satisfy the above requirements. This paper describes our extensions to the proposed models to support further capabilities, with the intention to eventually lead to fully dynamically defined monitoring policies. The concept of distributing intelligence is also discussed, including the consideration of security issues and the applicability of the model in CORBA-based environments.	common object request broker architecture;information model;intelligent agent;osi model;quality of service;requirement;telecommunications management network	George Pavlou;Kevin M.

d57b8a9f7ff89d15676260ff7ff1e7ea8b6bcdf8	profit and strategic analysis for mno-mvno partnership		We consider a mobile market driven by two Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and a new competitor Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO). The MNOs can partner with the entrant MVNO by leasing network resources; however, the MVNO can also rely on other technologies such as free WiFi access points. Moreover, in addition to its connectivity offer, the MVNO can also draw indirect revenues from services due to its brand. In that framework including many access technologies and several revenue sources, a possible partner MNO will then have to decide which wholesale price to charge the MVNO for its resources. This multi-actor context, added to the need to consider both wholesale and retail markets, represents a new challenge for the underlying decision-making process. In this paper, the optimal price setting is formulated as a multi-level optimization problem which enables us to derive closed-form expressions for the optimal MNOs wholesale prices and the optimal MVNO retail price. The price attractivity of the MVNO is also evaluated in terms of its indirect revenues and the proportion of resources leased from possible partner MNOs. Finally, through a gametheoretical approach, we characterize the scenario where both MNOs partner with the MVNO as the unique Nash equilibrium under appropriate conditions.

Most of the existing approaches assume an environment, where service provision is free (and dictated) and servers do not have an incentive to maximize their benefit. In this paper we consider the nodes in MANETs to be independent, rational agents trying to maximize their profits through service provision. We model this problem as a generalized assignment problem (GAP). We adopt a pay-as-you-go model and introduce into the proposed profit maximization algorithm expected payoffs based on estimates of server-to-client connectivity. We define connectivity as the lifetime of the network connection between a client and a server. We experimentally study cases with non-cooperative and cooperative servers and investigate the gain of the estimate based maximization algorithm versus a classic maximization algorithm, which does not take into account the networkpsilas dynamics that affect server-to-client connectivity. The results show that our approach achieves up to three-fold improved server profits compared to the classical one and is especially suited for MANETs with high-mobility.	client (computing);expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;generalized assignment problem;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;provisioning;rational agent;server (computing);simulation;sparse matrix	Christopher N.

058e7996d177651c08eb6961b65691ef3ad86b1b	a fully reconfigurable approach to emergency management		"""Emergency management is one of the most important areas where technology innovation has direct impact on social well-being and sustainability. In the past few years, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has proved to be instrumental to improve emergency management with particular focus on resilience, rapidity of response, adaptability to situations. To these ends, joint optimization of communication and computing is a promising cross-layer approach. Indeed, this paper is focused on the consideration of both cognitive and autonomic networking approaches when deploying an emergency management system. The cognitive approach was initially considered specifically for wireless communications, while the autonomic approach was initially introduced for managing complex computing systems; however, they share several similarities in dealing with fully reconfigurable systems. The future trend is to expand their influence toward the global optimization of the ICT infrastructure, as the authors show in this paper for the specific case of emergency management systems.

In fact, several studies show that damaging any critical infrastructure can create a cascade effect on other ones, generating a critical scenario that takes a long time to be resolved (Rinaldi, Peerenboom, & Kelly, 2001). Autonomicity stands for the ability of the system to react in a human-free way by following self-managing rules. As such, it is one of the most important characteristics to be taken into consideration when designing any emergency management system, so that the system can rapidly selfmanage itself without requiring human intervention as, especially in these cases, the latter should be limited. Both characteristics require a high level of reconfigurability of the system, to circumvent obstacles and to react promptly to the disaster. An emergency scenario is characterized by the presence of several users and devices that must collaborate in order to have a ready response to the emergency situation, or to be able to forecast the upcoming emergency situation in time (Chiti, Fantacci, Maccari, Marabissi, & Tarchi, 2008). The coordination among different actors working on emergency management (institutions, local administrators, volunteers, police, etc) is fundamental in order to optimize emergency responses and to reduce disaster consequences on people and things. Our focus within this context is toward the optimization of the communication infrastructure (Gucenc, Kozat, Jeong, Watanabe, & Chong, 2008; Habib & Mazzenga, 2010; Manoj & Baker, 2007) with the aim of supporting emergency prevention and management operations. This requires reliable access to all heterogeneous networks and services in a ubiquitous manner, granted to all to people operating in the disaster area with different mobile devices and terminals (cellular phones, notebooks, smartphones, etc.). The emergency telecommunication infrastructure must be deployed in a simple and effective way in case of disaster and allow functional integration with the survived systems to provide a flexible platform able to satisfy the resilience and autonomicity requirements. One should notice that, nowadays, it is possible to consider an environment where multiple means of communication coexist. This heterogeneity can be seen as a source of network diversity to be exploited in order to respect the different user requirements typical of an emergency scenario, whenever a disruptive event causes the unavailability of certain network portions. It is worth noticing that emergency management is also strictly related to modeling the physical/artificial causes and consequences of disastrous situations. Emergency forecasting and management activities are both based on very complex mathematical models, which require high-performance computing to provide clients with prompt and best-effort services (Thompson, Refstrup Sørensonb, Gavina, & Refsgaard, 2004). The most up to date trend within this context is to develop a system able to interconnect all operators and citizens within a given emergency area with high-performance computing platforms able to forecast the disaster and/or to monitor its evolution (Fantacci, Vanneschi, Bertolli, Mencagli, & Tarchi, 2009). It is worth noticing that the classical solution of high performance computing is to map the complex models to central processing centers supporting high performance architectures (e.g., clusters), but which are geographically far from the emergency area. An alternative solution is to exploit all locally available processing and communication resources, albeit heterogeneous and with limited computational capabilities (Bertolli, Menacagli, & Vanneschi, 2009). This concept allows a more resilient approach to disaster management, due to the presence of multiple devices near the emergency area, to solve these complex models by exploiting the parallel and distributed computing features. However, this approach requires the development of suitable techniques to manage interconnections among users and computing devices with the timing constraint typical of such applications. The pervasive grid computing paradigm (Parashar & Pierson, 2010) is particularly suited for these applications by allowing the development of distributed applications that can perform parallel computations using heterogeneous 19 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/fully-reconfigurable-approachemergency-management/75550?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Computer Science, Security, and Information Technology.

Implementations of ICN have demonstrated its advantages over IP, in terms of network performance and resource requirements. Because of these advantages, ICN is also considered to be a good network paradigm candidate for the Internet-of-Things (IoT), especially in scenarios involving resource constrained devices.  In this paper we propose OnboardICNg, the first secure protocol for on-boarding (authenticating and authorizing) IoT devices in ICN mesh networks. OnboardICNg can securely onboard resource constrained devices into an existing IoT network, outperforming the authentication protocol selected for the ZigBee-IP specification: EAP-PANA, i.e., the Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) combined with the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). In particular we show that, compared with EAP-PANA, OnboardICNg reduces the communication and energy consumption, by 87% and 66%, respectively.	digital distribution;extensible authentication protocol;icn gps;mesh networking;network performance;programming paradigm;protocol for carrying authentication for network access;requirement	Alberto Compagno;Mauro Conti;Ralph E.

One of the key challenges for smart grids is how to connect a large number of devices. On the other hand, 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE), the latest standard for mobile communications, was developed to provide stable service performance and higher data rates for a large number of mobile users. Therefore, LTE is considered a promising solution for wide area connectivity for SMs. In this paper, a grouped hierarchal architecture for SMs communications over LTE is introduced. Then, an efficient grouped scheduling technique is proposed for SMs transmissions over LTE. The proposed architecture efficiently solves the overload problem due to AMI traffic and guarantees a full monitoring and control for energy consumption. The results of our suggested solution showed that LTE can serve better for smart grids based AMI with particular grouping and scheduling scheme. In addition, the presented technique can able to be used in urban areas having high density of SMs.	4g-lte filter;compaq lte;quality of service;scheduling (computing);smart tv;smart meter;suicidegirls;telecommunications network	Mahmoud M.

The ACE framework defines separate profiles to specify how exactly entities interact and what security and communication protocols to use. This paper presents the novel ACE IPsec profile, which specifies how a client establishes a secure IPsec channel with a resource server, contextually using the ACE framework to enforce authorized access to remote resources. The profile makes it possible to establish IPsec Security Associations, either through their direct provisioning or through the standard IKEv2 protocol.

It is popularly known as to IoT (Internet of Things). IETF has developed a suite of protocols and open standards for accessing applications and services for wireless resource constrained networks such as IoT. Development of application requires standardized architecture and platform for design and analysis of new ideas. This paper provides a brief awareness about recent IoT architectures and platforms. It is also discussed some of the gaps issues of the platforms related to usability of the user.

The advent of smart devices like smart phones and tablets with high end processors has enabled their use in numerous processor intensive use cases that was not possible earlier. High definition streaming to multiple devices and multimedia based applications that require high performance are being considered on mobile devices. While the memory and processor speed of the devices has improved over the years to cater to such applications, the underlying wireless LAN technology has struggled to cope especially when the number of mobile devices is large. In this paper we investigate the use of reliable data transfer mechanism using an active monitor mode to improve the performance of reliable data transfer and streaming to a large number of mobile devices.	central processing unit;clock rate;linear network coding;mobile device;monitor mode;multicast;remote digital terminal;smart device;smartphone;streaming media;tablet computer;token ring;unicast	Karthik Srinivasa Gopalan;Amogha D.

To this end, the IETF has introduced a reference framework to build PBM systems. However, this framework only addresses the provisioning of relatively long validity period services based on pre-defined SLAs (Service Level Agreements). Furthermore, very little work addresses the scalability properties of the instantiation of this framework in a real network. In our previous work, we presented an extension of the IETF PBM framework in order to support dynamic provisioning of short term services (end-system signaling) as well as an instantiation scheme that is scalable (distributed provisioning of edge routers). This instantiation scheme is based on the distribution of the provisioning process while keeping centralized only the parts that involve critical resources, namely the Bandwidth Brokerage. In this paper, we propose an extensive analytical study of this extended architecture. The results of this work are intended to be used as a guideline to help network operators to design a scalable PBM system in order to offer to their customers’ services with QoS assurance in an on-demand basis.	centralized computing;design tool;internet protocol suite;management system;netpbm format;programmed data processor;provisioning;scalability;service-level agreement;software deployment;stateless protocol;universal instantiation	Kamel Haddadou;Samir Ghamri-Doudane;Yacine Ghamri-Doudane;Nazim Agoulmine	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-87359-4_15	real-time computing;operations management;business;computer network	HPC	-19.518934465589375	82.83537097803242	192187

In this emerging landscape, TV rises as the central media device integrating the home network ecosystem. In the race to create more dynamic and customizable content, computer generated 3D graphics get a prominent position combined with video and audio to provide immersive and realistic environments in advanced applications where the user interaction is crucial. However, current home devices lack the required specific hardware to perform it. The proposed 3DMaaS System faces this scenario by performing 3D cloud rendering through streaming sessions with each client device, taking benefit of the Internet connectivity and video streaming management capabilities that most of thin devices have. In order to deal with the wide spectrum of device features, 3DMaaS provides a complete set of streaming formats, including RTSP, HLS and MPEG-DASH, that also fits new trends in media consumption brought by HTML5 and HbbTV.

Clack is a router written as a Java Applet, and routes live network traffic in real-time. Students can look inside the router to see how packets are processed, and watch the dynamics of the queues. They can modify and enhance the router, making it handle packets as they wish. Clack provides multiple views of the operational router including the full network topology, the router's software components, and the packet-level view of traffic as it passes through the router. Clack's detailed visual interface to the software internals of a functioning router, as well as its ability to modify and observe live Internet traffic, provide a unique environment to aid in networking education.Over the last two years, Clack has been used in the classroom at six universities. Feedback from the students through anonymous, formal evaluations has been positive. In this paper we describe the goals and design of Clack as well as our experiences using it in the classroom.	arcs (computing);component-based software engineering;documentation;experiment;feedback;graphical user interface;ibm notes;internet;java applet;network packet;network topology;network traffic control;real-time transcription;router (computing);superuser	Dan Wendlandt;Martín Casado;Paul Tarjan;Nick McKeown	2006		10.1145/1148493.1148495	core router;software visualization;real-time computing;core network;internet traffic;computer science;component-based software engineering;distributed computing;one-armed router;network topology;java applet;computer network	Networks	-21.430160505125357	83.46093755903507	193194

With the need to manage larger pools of subscribers, the introduction of new services and applications and the need to manage new equipment in concert with legacy infrastructures, data management has not only become more complex, it is now critical to the success of a carrier’s business. However, data management is far from a core competency of most network engineers. In fact, it is far from the competency of most application engineers, who instead rely on enterprise relational database management systems (RDBMS) to handle the data management task for them. Fortunately, the skyrocketing complexity in new network infrastructure applications such as xGSNs (GPRS Service Nodes) has been matched by the dramatic increase in power of the underlying platforms. As a result, network infrastructure nodes are now powerful enough to host a specialized carrier-grade RDBMS.	autonomic computing;care-of address;carrier grade;client–server model;complex system;distributed computing;embedded system;fault tolerance;high availability;hot spare;legacy system;most bus;network switch;redundancy (engineering);relational database management system;router (computing);scalability;server (computing);smart device;solid-state drive;soliddb;total cost of ownership	Soomyung Park;Sangjoon Ahn;Sunyoung Han;Wooyong Han;Jung-Chan Na	1995		10.1109/FTDCS.1995.525015	network management;out-of-band management;fcaps;element management system;intelligent platform management interface;real-time computing;network management station;computer science;fault management;open platform management architecture;distributed computing;telecommunications management network;network management application;structure of management information;computer network	DB	-20.622422738385804	84.98176913465066	193875

If, in addition, such mechanisms are related to options for achieving cooperation of several (heterogeneous) network elements and/or domains, with the aim of reducing energy wastage and minimizing energy consumption, then the challenge becomes critical. To this aim, the present paper discusses an innovative approach, focusing upon the development of energy-aware distributed and cooperating systems for monitoring and control, centred on appropriate wireless sensor networks for the provision of radio and environmental context information. In particular, we discuss the concept of a “Self-Growing Network” that is able to efficiently incorporate autonomic and collaborative capabilities, intending to increase the level of the global network energy efficiency by using cognition-based features. Self-growing capabilities are enablers for a novel type of network flexibility. They allow optimising a heterogeneous collection of network nodes or sub-networks to be dedicated to a specific optimisation “purpose” temporarily and on-demand.	adaptive behavior;autonomic networking;cognition;distributed computing;global network;heterogeneous computing;mathematical optimization;programming paradigm;sensor web	Ioannis P.

3a6f32ed952650fba7139ea118d493189dd339c2	internet access for lorawan devices considering security issues		Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LP-WAN) are becoming the cornerstone for IoT connectivity these days, given the long range coverage and the number of devices that could be interconnected through a single gateway. Among LP-WAN proposals, LoRaWAN (Long Range WideArea Network) is receiving special attention, because of its adaptability to actual transmission and scenario conditions and its license-free operation. However, current LoRaWAN specifications especially address physical and link-level communication requirements,leaving network and higher network protocols aside. Moreover, security mechanisms currently considered suffer from lack of flexibility, requiring the pre-sharing of cryptographic material. In the Future Internet, IPv6 support for end-to-end thing connectivity is essential, and this entails a challenge for this kind of constrained networks. In this paper, we address the connectivity issue through an implementation of an IPv6 adaptation mechanism that is being defined at the IETF and we explore the security flaws that could be solved by the integration of an Internet Key Exchange (IKE)-flavoured solution especially adapted to constrained communication technologies. The security features proposed intend to cover the negotiation of key material for LP-WAN technologies above the link layer, avoiding manual and insecure configurations.	administrative domain;communications protocol;cryptography;ecosystem;end-to-end principle;future internet;internet key exchange;internet access;interoperability;known-key distinguishing attack;lp-type problem;low-power broadcasting;overhead (computing);requirement	Ramon Sanchez-Iborra;Jes&#x00FA;s S&#x00E1;nchez-G&#x00F3;mez;Salvador Pérez;P&#x00E9;dro J.

However, the current communication systems for underwater nodes are facing non-trivial challenges due to the constrained networking conditions. For instance, the sink addresses the node(s) by using their ID(s) to pull the sensed information. However, it is not obvious that the addressed nodes in request message actually are able to provide the requested data. Meanwhile, the Named Data Networking (NDN), aka Content-Centric Networking (CCN), is recently emerged as a potential future Internet architecture. NDN uses the Data Names to pull the required information rather than the IP addresses. In this paper, we check the feasibility of applying NDN into UWSN and name it as UNDN. In addition, we propose the very first naming scheme for UNDN and present the preliminary evaluations.	cyclomatic complexity;delay-tolerant networking;future internet	Safdar Hussain Bouk;Syed Hassan Ahmed;Dongkyun Kim	2017		10.1145/3019612.3019773	architecture;wireless sensor network;communications system;computer network;underwater acoustic communication;sink (computing);the internet;computer security;underwater;aka;computer science	Metrics	-24.250994080245984	82.42475413714664	194486

Secure IP multicast can be used to implement IPTV services, but it still has problems to be addressed. Current solutions require high computational power in video channel zapping situations, lack support for groups sourced at the users, and present a weak support for admission control in IP multicast for both sources and receivers in dynamically configured environments. This work proposes a new, secure and efficient IPTV solution that, cumulatively: (a) enforces individual access control to groups of real-time IPTV video channels; (b) enforces IP multicast admission control for both multicast senders and receivers; (c) supports user generated videos; (d) generates low signaling overheads; (e) does not introduce perceivable delays, particularly in video channel zapping situations. Moreover, this solution can be easily integrated in the IPTV architectures being developed by ETSI and ITU-T.

Web page performance is becoming increasingly important for end users but also more difficult to provide by web developers, in part because of the limitations of the legacy HTTP/1 protocol. The new HTTP/2 protocol was designed with performance in mind, but existing work comparing its improvements to HTTP/1 often shows contradictory results. It is unclear for developers how to profit from HTTP/2 and whether current HTTP/1 best practices such as resource concatenation, resource embedding, and hostname sharding should still be used. In this work we introduce the Speeder framework, which uses established tools and software to easily and reproducibly test various setup permutations. We compare and discuss results over many parameters (e.g., network conditions, browsers, metrics), both from synthetic and realistic test cases. We find that in most non-extreme cases HTTP/2 is on a par with HTTP/1 and that most HTTP/1 best practices are applicable to HTTP/2. We show that situations in which HTTP/2 currently underperforms are mainly caused by inefficiencies in implementations, not due to shortcomings in the protocol itself.	best practice;concatenation;experiment;firefox;h2 database engine;http/2;national fund for scientific research;network packet;sandy bridge;server (computing);shard (database architecture);stani michiels;synthetic intelligence;test case;web developer;web page	Robin Marx;Peter Quax;Axel Faes;Wim Lamotte	2017		10.5220/0006364101600173	telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;world wide web	Security	-29.086300404044458	80.81287635787284	195608

When abnormalities are detected, it is desirable to let the network tune itself under the direction of certain policies. However, self tuning tasks usually require coordination between several network components and most of the network management policies can only specify local tasks. In this paper, we propose a state machine based policy framework to address the problem of fault and performance management in the context of HN. Policies can be specified for complex management tasks as global state machines which incorporate global system behavior monitoring and reactions. We demonstrate the policy framework through a case study in which policies are specified for dynamic selection of frequency channel in order to improve wireless link quality in the presence of RF interference.	channel (communications);expectation propagation;finite-state machine;group policy;interaction;interference (communication);rf modulator;radio frequency;self-tuning	Dimosthenis Pediaditakis;Leonardo Mostarda;Changyu Dong;Naranker Dulay	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks	10.1109/POLICY.2009.30	real-time computing;engineering;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	-19.5978535738178	81.46967870609028	196694

We identify deployment trends and primary tasks a future DSLAM has to offer. The implementation is representative of applications in access networks and indicative of real-world performance. To accomplish these goals our tool flow CRACC takes a modular application description and generates code for embedded processors that can easily be ported to different platforms. The derived implementation serves as a benchmark for DSLAM systems. It therefore allows the comparison of different architectures, partitioning, and mapping decisions. In addition to a full system benchmark, our reference implementation is a functionally correct realization with defined evaluation environment, traffic sources, and load scenarios.

In most of the cases, these configurations require one traffic generator and/or analyzer for each switch port. Since this equipment is rather expensive, it is desirable to define scalable configurations that can be used with a limited number of generators. In this paper we present a methodology for the implementation of scalable connection configurations. The methodology is simple and offers a general solution to generate scalable connection configurations. Several examples of scalable configurations illustrate the methodology. The application of this methodology helps users to repeat easily performance tests under the same traffic load conditions.	atm turbo;network switch;scalability;software performance testing	Arjan Durresi;Raj Jain;Gojko Babic;Bruce S.

ae392f2c2d98c7dab1e721d9db06485afad19c48	cognitive radio based sensor network in smart grid: architectures, applications and communication technologies		The cognitive radio-based sensor network (CRSN) is envisioned as a strong driver in the development of modern power system smart grids (SGs). This can address the spectrum limitation in the sensor nodes due to interference cause by other wireless devices operating on the same unlicensed frequency in the Industrial, Scientific and Medical band. These sensor nodes are used for monitoring and control purposes in various components of a SG, ranging from generation, transmission, and distribution, and down to the consumer, including monitoring of utility network assets. A reliable SG communication network architecture is required for transferring information which needed by the SG applications, alongside the monitoring and control by CRSN. Hence, this paper investigates and explores the CRSN conceptual framework, and SG communication architecture with its applications; vis-à-vis the communication access technologies, including implementation design with quality of service support. Consequently, this paper highlights various research gaps, such as implementation design model, utilization of LPWAN for CRSN based SG deployment, and so on. This includes discussion on the future direction for various aspects of the CRSN in SG. To address these research gaps, we introduced a smart unified communication solution to improve the efficiency of the SG and mitigate various associated challenges.	cognitive radio;interference (communication);network architecture;quality of service;software deployment;suicidegirls;telecommunications network	Emmanuel U.

In this paper, we explore the requirements and overheads associated with co-locating middlebox functionality on such computing resources on networking hardware. In particular, we use an example of TCP acceleration proxy (CHART) that improves throughput over networks with delay and loss. The CHART system, developed by HP and its partners provides enhanced TCP/IP performance and service quality guarantees by deploying performance accelerating proxies, which enables legacy clients to benefit by high-performance network service. Use of the TCP proxy, however, requires manual configuration on the clients changing http proxy and/or routing table settings. Can we remove the need to configure end-hosts by inserting a {\em transparent} TCP proxy in the path, without losing performance? To address this question, we implement the accelerator on HP's x86-based processing blade designed to integrate network applications within switch architecture as well as on low-end home routers with OpenWRT. We describe the implementation detail such as flow redirection for transparency and new mechanisms required for easy insertion of proxies in the network path. We also evaluate its performance on HP's experimental testbed in terms of throughput and additional processing overhead.	approximation;byte;decibel;end-to-end principle;hardware acceleration;hypertext transfer protocol;internet protocol suite;iperf3;linux;marginal model;mebibyte;middlebox;network architecture;network congestion;network packet;network processor;networking hardware;openwrt;overhead (computing);processing delay;proxy server;requirement;routing table;tcp acceleration;tcp offload engine;testbed;throughput;x86	Jeongkeun Lee;Puneet Sharma;Jean Tourrilhes;Rick McGeer;Jack Brassil;Andy C.

In this paper we describe the current state of open APIs for M2M applications as well as some possible changes and extensions. Our article based on open standards ETSI is going to provide for the rapidly growing M2M market. An open specification, presented as an Application Programming Interface (OpenAPI), provides applications with a rich framework of core network capabilities upon which to build services while encapsulating the underlying communication protocols. OpenAPI is a portable platform for services that may be replicated and ported between different execution environments and hardware platforms. We would like to discuss the possible extensions for ETSI proposals that, by our opinion, let keep telecom development inline with the modern approaches in the web development domain.	application programming interface;open api	Manfred Schneps-Schneppe;Dmitry Namiot	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-32686-8_40	web development;porting;application programming interface;open api;communications protocol;computer network;core network;open standard;computer science	HCI	-20.948180693768077	85.3845873181213	197813

Such services are likely to be equally valuable for mobile nodes using Mobile IP when the nodes are attempting to connect to foreign domains with AAA servers. AAA servers today identify clients by using the Network Access Identifier (NAI). Our proposal defines a way for the mobile node to identify itself, by including the NAI along with the Mobile IP Registration Request.

In power transmission segments of smart grid, wired communications are usually adopted to ensure robustness of the backbone power network. In contrast, for a power distribution grid, wireless communications provide many benefits such as low cost high speed links, easy setup of connections among different devices/appliances, and so on. Connecting power equipment, devices, and appliances through wireless networks is indispensable for a smart distribution grid (SDG). However, wireless communications are usually more vulnerable to security attacks than wired ones. Developing appropriate wireless communication architecture and its security measures is extremely important for an SDG. Thus, these two problems are investigated in this paper. Firstly, a wireless communication architecture is proposed for an SDG based on wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The security framework under this communication architecture is then analyzed. More specifically, potential security attacks and possible counter-attack measures are studied. Within the security framework, a new intrusion detection and response scheme, called smart tracking firewall, is developed to meet the special requirements of SDG wireless communications. Performance results show that the smart tracking firewall can quickly detect and respond to security attacks and is thus suitable for real-time operation of an SDG.	authentication;firewall (computing);information exchange;internet backbone;intrusion detection system;key management;mesh networking;microgrid;power-line communication;real-time clock;real-time transcription;regular expression;requirement;routing;simulation;systems architecture;wireless mesh network	Xudong Wang;Ping Yi	2011	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2011.2167354	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;information security;smart grid;wired communication;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-21.682417467193893	80.21777129293827	197976

Its sole responsibility is to receive the security policy, transform it into a stack-specific format and then help implement the policy via the underlying protocol stack. Security policy manager receives the policy in a stack-independent XML format. It transforms the policy into a stack-specific format and then determines the changes in the new policy compared to the currently running one. After completing these initial tasks, the Security policy manager helps to carry out these changes in the policy while interacting with the underlying protocol stack, if there will be any conflicts then the security policy manager calls the adaptive security policy optimizer to remove some part of policy and maximizes the output.

The platform provides tools for simulating various networks in connection with real processes. The paper focuses on an extension to the MoCoNet platform [8], which is a unique environment for monitoring and controlling processes over the Internet in real-time. MoCoNet also provides capability of emulating different networks via network simulation. The platform is extremely valuable for control design in NCS, because the real processes can be first run over simulated networks and different network congestion scenarios can be experimented. This paper extends the MoCoNet system by integrating it with the well known and widely accepted network simulator [9], Ns2. The paper discusses various aspects of this novel integration of Ns2 with realtime operated control systems. The extension allows users of the MoCoNet system to test the control algorithms for NCS with numerous wired/wireless technologies available in Ns2. Furthermore, the paper discusses the development of a simple Java based GUI that is used to create virtual networks in Ns2.	algorithm;control system;emulator;graphical user interface;java;network computing system;network congestion;real-time transcription;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Shekar Nethi;Mikael Pohjola;Lasse Eriksson;Riku Jäntti	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks	10.1109/WOWMOM.2007.4351727	embedded system;real-time computing;the internet;computer science;control system;operating system;graphical user interface;network simulation;distributed computing;prototype;java;network congestion;system testing;computer network	Embedded	-20.882505548421044	83.27351403413893	198945
