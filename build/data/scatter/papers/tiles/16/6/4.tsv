aab43121a8d72c02f8c4b10a3b8164cf5a7d952e	two-level automatic adaptation of a distributed user profile for personalized news content delivery	user profile;content delivery	This paper presents a distributed client-server architecture for the personalized delivery of textual news content to mobile users. The user profile consists of two separate models, that is, the long-term interests are stored in a skeleton profile on the server and the short-term interests in a detailed profile in the handset. The user profile enables a high-level filtering of available news content on the server, followed by matching of detailed user preferences in the handset. The highest rated items are recommended to the user, by employing an efficient ranking process. The paper focuses on a two-level learning process, which is employed on the client side in order to automatically update both user profile models. It involves the use of machine learning algorithms applied to the implicit and explicit user feedback. The system’s learning performance has been systematically evaluated based on data collected from regular system users.

424a77886833d6be3164cbc91b255e6024872d30	a time-aware weighted-svm model for web service qos prediction		With the rapid development of Web services, how to identify services with high Quality of Service (QoS) becomes a hot research topic. Since time-series QoS records are highly nonlinear, complex and uncertain, it is difficult to make accurate predictions through conventional mathematic methods. In order to deal with the challenging issue, this paper proposes a novel personalized QoS prediction approach considering both the temporal dynamics of QoS attributes and the influence of different QoS records. First, slide-window based data grouping is firstly utilized to obtain training dataset for regression model. Then we take the different influence of history QoS records at different time into consideration and eventually propose a weighted-SVM model for QoS prediction. Compared to Auto-Regressive Moving Average Model (ARMA), standard SVM and Collaborative Filtering (CF), the proposed approach in the paper can improve significantly the accuracy in personalized QoS prediction.	quality of service;web service	Kai Dou;Bin Guo;Li Kuang	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-59288-6_27	computer network;quality of service;collaborative filtering;mobile qos;support vector machine;regression analysis;web service;computer science;moving-average model	ECom	-19.134440481037053	-50.5103592013202	58308

Our characterization of over 35 million read, write, and administrative requests spanning a 28-day period is done from three different blogosphere perspectives. The server view characterizes the aggregate access patterns of all users to all blogs; the user view characterizes how individual users interact with blogosphere objects (blogs); the object view characterizes how individual blogs are accessed. Our findings support two important conclusions. First, we show that the nature of interactions between users and objects is fundamentally different in blogspace than that observed in traditional web content. Access to objects in blogspace could be conceived as part of an interaction between an author and its readership. As we show in our work, such interactions range from one-to-many “broadcast-type” and many-to-one “registration-type” communication between an author and its readers, to multi-way, iterative “parlortype” dialogues among members of an interest group. This more-interactive nature of the blogosphere leads to interesting traffic and communication patterns, which are different from those observed in traditional web content. Second, we identify and characterize novel features of the blogosphere workload, and we investigate the similarities and differences between typical web server workloads and blogosphere server workloads. Given the increasing share of blogspace traffic, understanding such differences is important for capacity planning and traffic engineering purposes, for example.	aggregate data;algorithm;blog;blogosphere;file spanning;file system permissions;interaction;iteration;one-to-many (data model);pagerank;server (computing);smart objects;social network;statistical model;synthetic intelligence;tracing (software);virtual community;web content;web navigation;web page;web search engine;web server	Fernando Duarte;Bernardo Mattos;Azer Bestavros;Virgílio A.

c55836450be1355feb1c5ddfdfc1f1d17185a9a3	on the “familiar stranger” phenomenon in a large-scale vod system		Video-on-Demand (VoD) services are having more and more impact on people's daily life. The huge number of view records generated during the services reveal lots of information about video popularity and user behavior. In this work, we seek to understand user behavior from a network approach. Users who overlapped view records are defined as “familiar strangers” of each other. With network science concepts, dynamic familiar stranger networks are established based on view records from one of China's largest VoD service providers. Analysis shows that users can be separated into light users and heavy users. Community detection results show that there is a threshold of familiarity that drastically deteriorates the community structure of the familiar stranger network. Further investigation on the evolution of the communities suggests that there exists considerate number of dynamic communities with low members turnover. Our findings about the interest-based familiar stranger network unveils interesting networked user behavior patterns and provides meaningful guidelines for Internet applications like online user communities and recommendation systems.	cpu cache;internet;network science;recommender system;virtual community	Yuedong Xu;Yipeng Zhou;Xiaoming Fu	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2017.8116500	network science;internet privacy;familiar stranger;recommender system;service provider;the internet;community structure;popularity;phenomenon;business	Web+IR	-27.199660728407576	-46.665323134603746	58927

DopEnc can automatically identify the persons that users interact with in the context of encountering. DopEnc performs encounter profiling in two major steps: (1) Doppler profiling to detect that two persons approach and stop in front of each other via an effective trajectory, and (2) voice profiling to confirm that they are thereafter engaged in an interactive conversation. DopEnc is further extended to support parallel acoustic exploration of many users by incorporating a unique multiple access scheme within the limited inaudible acoustic frequency band. All implementation of DopEnc is based on commodity sensors like speakers, microphones and accelerometers integrated on commercial-off-the-shelf smartphones. We evaluate DopEnc with detailed experiments and a real use-case study of 11 participants. Overall DopEnc achieves an accuracy of 6.9% false positive and 9.7% false negative in real usage.	acoustic cryptanalysis;experiment;frequency band;microphone;sensor;smartphone	Huanle Zhang;Wan Du;Pengfei Zhou;Mo Li;Prasant Mohapatra	2016		10.1145/2973750.2973775	real-time computing;speech recognition;doppler effect	Mobile	-24.854923726462207	-38.86001724917112	59019
88bab04e3b00fb0435154c23118709f7cd797b6c	an effective location-based information filtering system on mobile devices		As mobile devices evolve, research on providing location-based services attract researchers interest. A location-based service recommends information based on users geographical location provided by a mobile device. Mobile devices are engaged with users daily activities and lots of information and services are requested by users, so suggesting the proper information on mobile devices that reflects user preferences becomes more and more difficult. Lots of recent studies have tried to tackle this issue but most of them are not successful because of reasons such as using large datasets or making suggestions based on dynamically collected ratings within different groups instead of focusing on individuals. In this paper, we propose a location based information filtering system that exposes users preferences using Bayesian inferences. A Bayesian network is constructed with conditional probability table while Users characteristics and location data are gathered by using the mobile device. After preprocessing those data, the system integrates that information and uses time to produce the most accurate suggestions. We collected a dataset from 20 restaurants in Malaysia and we gathered behavioral data from two registered users for 7 days. We conducted experiment on the dataset to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed system and to explain user preferences.	information filtering system	Marzanah A.

Multimedia shown in a web browser is one of the main sources of information for online shopping. In many cases, users are motivated to purchase a specific item by the impressions they receive when they are looking at related hypermedia: e.g. they may gain motivation to purchase a car after seeing a transportation item on a news website, especially when the users are looking at the images contained in the hypermedia. This leads to the motivation to build an intelligent system that is aware of what users are thinking when they are navigating hypermedia. This paper proposes an agent-based methodology that can first identify semantics of hypermedia images in order to derive contextual information, then recommends specific web services by anticipating needs or products in which the user may be interested. To identify and interpret the images, we propose extended ARG, which integrates ARG image content and semantics in the corresponding ontology. To show the feasibility of the idea, we developed CAMA (Context-Aware Multimedia Agent), a prototype agent-based system.	recommender system	Oh Byung Kwon	2003	Expert Syst.

16edcc268d7d5e0aaa3dfbc6ff2996e6df0e94fe	a collaborative filtering approach for recommending olap sessions	olap;personalization;query recommendation;similarity measures	While OLAP has a key role in supporting effective exploration of multidimensional cubes, the huge number of aggregations and selections that can be operated on data may make the user experience disorientating. To address this issue, in the paper we propose a recommendation approach stemming from collaborative filtering. We claim that the whole sequence of queries belonging to an OLAP session is valuable because it gives the user a compound and synergic view of data; for this reason, our goal is not to recommend single OLAP queries but OLAP sessions. Like other collaborative approaches, ours features three phases: (i) search the log for sessions that bear some similarity with the one currently being issued by the user; (ii) extract the most relevant subsessions; and (iii) adapt the top-ranked subsession to the current user’s session. However, it is the first that treats sessions as first-class citizens, using new techniques for comparing sessions, finding meaningful recommendation candidates, and adapting them to the current session. After describing our approach, we discuss the results of a large set of effectiveness and efficiency tests based on different measures of recommendation quality.

However, there have been few attempts at addressing integrated exploratory search solutions when image browsing is incorporated into the exploring loop. In this paper, we investigate the challenges of understanding users' search interests from the product images being browsed and inferring their actual search intentions. We propose a novel interactive image exploring system for allowing users to lightly switch between browse and search processes, and naturally complete visual-based exploratory search tasks in an effective and efficient way. This system enables users to specify their visual search interests in product images by circling any visual objects in web pages, and then the system automatically infers users' underlying intent by analyzing the browsing context and by analyzing the same or similar product images obtained by large-scale image search technology. Users can then utilize the recommended queries to complete intent-specific exploratory tasks. The proposed solution is one of the first attempts to understand users' interests for a visual-based exploratory product search task by integrating the browse and search activities. We have evaluated our system performance based on five million product images. The evaluation study demonstrates that the proposed system provides accurate intent-driven search results and fast response to exploratory search demands compared with the conventional image search methods, and also, provides users with robust results to satisfy their exploring experience.	browsing;exploratory search;exploratory testing;image retrieval;image viewer;programming paradigm;visual objects;web page	Shiyang Lu;Tao Mei;Jingdong Wang;Jian Zhang;Zhiyong Wang;Shipeng Li	2015	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology	10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2372272	database index;visualization;semantic search;computer science;machine learning;web page;semantics;multimedia;search analytics;web search query;world wide web;information retrieval;search engine	Web+IR	-32.02549592185557	-51.55905213302408	59156

This is achieved by representing the user's profile in order to adapt the IR system functioning to his context. This paper presents a new IR system approach capable of integrating the user in the search process. As a first step of the approach, we focused on building user interests to better understand his information needs, by capturing his judgments about the returned results. Then, our system will optimize the user query, by re-injecting relevance using a genetic algorithm. To illustrate our approach, we have realized a prototype of our system and applied it on a case study.	artificial intelligence;genetic algorithm;information access;information needs;information retrieval;personalization;prototype;relevance	Tarek Alloui;Imane Boussebough;Allaoua Chaoui	2013		10.1145/2494444.2494448	query optimization;genetic algorithm;computer science;machine learning;data mining;database;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-31.986339677455312	-51.3574432678135	59342

In most cases, traditional database-based technologies are no longer suitable for web information processing and management. For effectively processing and managing web information, it is necessary to reveal intrinsic relationships/structures among concerned web information objects such as web pages. In this work, a set of web pages that have their intrinsic relationships is called a web page community. This paper proposes a matrix-based model to describe relationships among concerned web pages. Based on this model, intrinsic relationships among pages could be revealed, and in turn a web page community could be constructed. The issues that are related to the application of the model are deeply investigated and studied. The concepts of community and intrinsic relationships, as well as the proposed matrix-based model, are then extended to other application areas such as biological data processing. Some application cases of the model in a broad range of areas are presented, demonstrating the potentials of this matrix-based model.	algorithm;dataspaces;hyperlink;information processing and management;information source;requirement;the matrix;turned a;vertex-transitive graph;web application;web page	Jingyu Hou	2007	Informatica, Lith.

Building a concept map involves creating text-based concepts and specifying their relationships with line-based links. Current concept map tools usually impose specific task structures for text and link construction, and may increase cognitive burden to generate and interact with concept maps. While pen-based devices (e.g., tablet PCs) offer users more freedom in drawing concept maps with a pen or stylus more naturally, the support for hand-drawn concept map creation and manipulation is still limited, largely due to the lack of methods to recognize the components and structures of hand-drawn concept maps. This article proposes a method to understand hand-drawn concept maps. Our algorithm can extract node blocks, or concept blocks, and link blocks of a hand-drawn concept map by combining dynamic programming and graph partitioning, recognize the text content of each concept node, and build a concept-map structure by relating concepts and links. We also design an algorithm for concept map retrieval based on hand-drawn queries. With our algorithms, we introduce structure-based intelligent manipulation techniques and ink-based retrieval techniques to support the management and modification of hand-drawn concept maps. Results from our evaluation study show high structure recognition accuracy in real time of our method, and good usability of intelligent manipulation and retrieval techniques.	algorithm;concept map;dynamic programming;graph partition;stylus (computing);tablet computer;text-based (computing);usability	Yingying Jiang;Feng Tian;Xiaolong Zhang;Guozhong Dai;Hongan Wang	2011	ACM TIST	10.1145/2036264.2036275	concept map;computer vision;computer science;graph partition;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning	AI	-32.56295753493767	-46.67490490765671	59512

In item recommendation tasks, a list of items is recommended to users by ranking, but traditional CF methods do not treat it as a ranking problem for implicit feedback datasets. In this paper, we propose MAP-kNN, an adaptive kNN approach using listwise approach for implicit feedback datasets. The similarity matrix is learned by maximizing the Mean Average Precision, which is a well-known measurement in information retrieval for representing the performance of a list of ranked items. An optimization strategy and a new sampling method are proposed to improve the learning efficiency of MAP-kNN. The complexity of our algorithm over each iteration after optimization is lower than other methods that also use listwise approach. Experimental results on two datasets indicate that our approach outperforms other state of the art recommendation approaches.	adaptive filter	Bu-Xiao Wu;Jing Xiao;Jia Zhu;Chen Ding	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-45814-4_42	collaborative filtering;learning to rank;recommender system;data mining;computer science;sampling (statistics);similarity matrix;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;ranking	NLP	-20.670568651074717	-48.626242677264315	59785

Specifically, SWE-FE provides algorithms for: i) suggesting tags for users during the tag input stage; ii) generating tag maps which provides for serendipitous browsing; and iii) personalized searching within the folksonomy.

If the query fails to precisely capture a user's real intent, for example, in most exploratory search tasks, suggested queries are likely to fail as well. If suggested queries are not only relevant to the query but also diverse in nature, it is likely that some of them are close to the user's real intent. In this paper, we propose a novel social-knowledge-directed query suggestion approach for exploratory search, which integrates the social knowledge into the probabilistic model based on query-URL bipartite graphs. Social knowledge is discovered by conducting kernel principle component analysis on the related queries, and incorporating the social knowledge with random walk on the bipartite graph can obtain diverse queries that are relevant to a given one. We have conducted a set of experiments to validate this approach and the results show that this approach outperforms other query suggestion methods in terms of supporting exploratory search.	algorithm;data mining;experiment;exploratory search;factor analysis;information needs;information retrieval;kernel principal component analysis;principal component analysis;relevance;statistical model;vagueness;web search engine	Yuqing Mao;Haifeng Shen;Chengzheng Sun	2011	2011 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/CyberC.2011.11	online aggregation;sargable;query optimization;query expansion;kernel;web query classification;ranking;bipartite graph;cloud computing;graph theory;data science;machine learning;probability;data mining;database;web search query;range query;information retrieval;query language;statistics;principal component analysis;spatial query	DB	-20.725518821029006	-46.02667277687737	60208

For example Twitter is a social network where millions of daily messages called Tweets are exchanged, within the message can be used labels, called hashtags, to identify the subject of the message, the message also may include links to other resources that expand the original content or showing interesting information and the relationships between users are represented as non reciprocal relationships named """"Following"""". The extraction of information posted on social networks is solved in this research through the use of linked data, that allow retrieving resources and link with other external sources, graphs databases that help represent the working scheme of a social network, and with social network analysis (SNA), technique to discover relevant information that goes beyond the individual properties. The scope of this paper is to use information that is published on Twitter to extract and recommend Open Educational Resources in order to help with the learning process. The results obtained are a set of recommendations on users (identified as experts) and virtual communities (lists of Twitter users) and related events, according to the learning needs described as tags."""	database;freedom of information laws by country;hashtag;linked data;social media;social network analysis;user-generated content;virtual community;web 2.0;world wide web	Jorge López-Vargas;Nelson Piedra;Janneth Chicaiza;Edmundo Tovar	2014	2014 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) Proceedings	10.1109/FIE.2014.7044454	social media optimization;computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-26.23286006296567	-49.37048723016654	60277

The wide number of communication channels available nowadays brings, with no question, enormous benefits for the users, however it brings new challenges as well. The choice of the best communication channel not only depends on the characteristics related to the channel itself (QoS, rates, etc.); the user context (location, personal agenda, etc.) affects the decision as well. The combination of all the factors generates a list of variables impossible to handle by the human being. The information available about channels, together with the information that smart devices are able to extract from the user context, make possible to introduce a computing system to help the user in selecting the most appropriate communication channel. In this paper we present RING, a context-aware ruled-based recommender system for the automatic Redirection of incomING communications based on Semantic Web, that allows users to receive any kind of communication through the best channel available depending on his context and personal preferences.	artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;channel (communications);geolocation;logic programming;recommender system;routing;semantic web;smart device	Miguel Lagares-Lemos;Daniel Villanueva Vasquez;Mateusz Radzimski;Angel Lagares Lemos;Juan Miguel Gómez-Berbís	2012			computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-29.067499340391556	-47.382463093332014	60407
b7307cc83833d3893646c9449db9ae45de89d0bc	smart government framework with geo-crowdsourcing and social media analysis		Abstract Smart government utilizes data to improve services provided to the citizen. Smart city may benefit from citizen engagement through crowdsourcing and social media. This paper proposes a city event’s prediction with map-based visualization utilizing crowdsourced geodata collected from citizen’s report. Data is aggregated according to geo-position and used to predict next day’s event. Mindmap-based visualization utilizing social media processed with topic modeling and topic similarity calculation is also proposed in this work. Proof-of-concept application and proposed system’s processing time is evaluated to prove the feasibility of the system. Proposed system utilizes geo-crowdsourcing for event prediction visualization for government instead of direct services to citizen. Proposed social media visualization use topic modeling specifically created for short text which is appropriate for social media data.	crowdsourcing;social media	Joseph Nathanael Witanto;Hyotaek Lim;Mohammed Atiquzzaman	2018	Future Generation Comp.

3eb97b8137fcb6b580b43ca62cedfaa22352a7c7	public interest analysis based on implicit feedback of iptv users		Modern information systems make it increasingly easy to gain more insight into the public interest, which is becoming more and more important in diverse public and corporate activities and processes. The disadvantage of existing research that focuses on mining the information from social networks and online communities is that it does not uniformly represent all population groups and that the content can be subjected to self-censoring or curation. In this paper, we propose and describe a framework and a method for estimating public interest from the implicit negative feedback collected from the Internet protocol television (IPTV) audience. Our research focuses primarily on the channel change events and their match with the content information obtained from closed captions. The presented framework is based on concept modeling, viewership profiling, and combines the implicit viewer reactions (channel changes) into an interest score. The proposed framework addresses both above-mentioned disadvantages or concerns. It is able to cover a much broader population, and it can detect even minor variations in user behavior. We demonstrate our approach on a large pseudonymized real-world IPTV dataset provided by an ISP, and show how the results correlate with different trending topics and with parallel classical long-term population surveys.	censoring (statistics);digital curation;iptv;information system;negative feedback;online community;profiling (computer programming);social network	Matej Kren;Andrej Kos;Yuan Zhang;Anton Kos;Urban Sedlar	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2017.2695371	iptv;computer science;public interest;the internet;information system;world wide web;population;pseudonymized;closed captioning;communication channel	ML	-26.54165302380714	-46.85622301010145	61032

We address how the lack of robustness and reliability lead to limitations and scalability issues in research robotic platforms. We propose to attend to these issues in parallel with the course of robot development. Drawing from lessons learned from our previous robots, we incorporated various fault prevention strategies into the electromechanical design. We have implemented a preliminary system, integrating sensorimotor, vision, and audio in order to test the full range of all degrees of freedom and enable the robot to engage in simple visual and verbal interaction with people. We conducted a series of experiment where the robot ran for $2 hours within 9 days at different public spaces. The robot interacted with a large number of passersby and collected at least 100,000 face images of at least 600 individuals within 4 days. We learned various lessons involving the robustness of current design and identified a set of failure modes. Lastly, we present the long term research direction for the robot.	active vision;failure cause;fault detection and isolation;fault tolerance;humanoid robot;robot;robot learning;robustness (computer science);scalability	Lijin Aryananda;Jeff Weber	2004	4th IEEE/RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots, 2004.	10.1109/ICHR.2004.1442668	human–robot interaction;mobile robot;robot learning;social relation;computer vision;simulation;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;social robot;personal robot	Robotics	-29.85490876428168	-39.569476492191605	61208

Determining the information goal is complex due to the subjective and latent nature of user information needs. This challenge is further exacerbated in media-rich websites since the semantics of media-based information is context-based and emergent. A critical step in determining information goals lies in the identification of content pages. These are the pages which contain the information the user seeks. We propose a method to automatically determine the content pages by taking into account the organization of the web site, the media-based information content, as well as the influence of a specific user browsing pattern. Given a specific browsing pattern, in our method, putative content pages are identified as the pages corresponding to the local minima of page-content entropy values. For an (unknown) user information goal this intuitively corresponds to modeling the progressive transition of the user from pages with generic information to those with specific information. Experimental investigations on media rich sites demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique and underline its potential in modeling user information needs and actions in a media-rich web.	emergence;experiment;information foraging;information needs;maxima and minima;online and offline;self-information;theory;web design	Rahul Singh;Bibek Dev Bhattarai	2010	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-010-0487-1	information needs;entropy;self-information;computer science;information mapping;information integration;information filtering system;dynamic web page;maxima and minima;multimedia;information quality;world wide web;information retrieval;information architecture;statistics	Web+IR	-32.29410970331724	-50.02021343229989	61595
0a55585184bc0bfd9205f10c17431c58d589cb9c	autolabel: labeling places from pictures and websites	text;wifi;semantic localization;smartphone	Most location based services require semantic place names such as Staples, rather than physical coordinates. Past work has mostly focussed on achieving localization accuracy, while assuming that the translation of physical coordinates to semantic names will be done manually. This paper makes an effort to automate this step, by leveraging the presence of a website corresponding to each store and the availability of a repository of WiFi-tagged pictures from different stores. By correlating the text inside the pictures, against the text extracted from store websites, our proposed system, called AutoLabel, can automatically label clusters of pictures, and the corresponding WiFi APs, with store names. Later, when a user enters a store, her mobile device scans the WiFi APs and consults a lookup table to recognize the store she is in. Experiment results from 40 different stores show recognition accuracy upwards of 87%, even with as few as 10 pictures from a store, offering hope that automatic large-scale semantic labeling may indeed be possible from pictures and websites of stores.	digital data;global positioning system;hut 8;location-based service;lookup table;mobile device;scalability;web page	Rufeng Meng;Sheng Shen;Romit Roy Choudhury;Srihari Nelakuditi	2016		10.1145/2971648.2971759	embedded system;wi-fi;computer science;operating system;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-30.585714840304334	-44.25795829076421	61738

To tackle this issue, various context awareness approaches have been developed to filter the information. Conventional context aware social filtering techniques predominantly focus on time and location as context of the users. However, another relevant context that of user׳s demographic information is often left out. The paper presents demographic context based filtering using social behavior of frogs. The approach employs shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) to perform the context modeling and handle the sparsity and scalability issues in social filtering. The work proposes two distinct methodologies to model the demographic context – SFLA based Contextual two dimensional (SC2D) and SFLA based Contextual three dimensional (SC3D) approach. SC2D approach primarily develops a model based on social behavior and subsequently incorporates the personal demographic (occupation, gender, etc.) context to compute the most relevant items. In the SC3D approach, personal demographic context is amalgamated with social behavior to develop the model and thereafter a contextual model is used to generate most relevant items. Experimental studies revealed that SC2D approach is able to reduce the error up to 15% and 8% as compared to MAC2D and GAC2D, respectively, and SC3D approach improves the accuracy upto 31% with respect to MAC3D and upto 26% as compared to GAC3D. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test results for all approaches corroborate that the differences between the means of SC2D, MAC2D and GAC2D and SC3D, MAC3D and GAC3D are highly significant. These results improve confidence in SFLA as a better optimization algorithm for context aware filtering.

9fca200d626fd8cc7cdabe57f1b1a15fa966b229	the exploratory labeling assistant: mixed-initiative label curation with large document collections		In this paper, we define the concept of exploratory labeling: the use of computational and interactive methods to help analysts categorize groups of documents into a set of unknown and evolving labels. While many computational methods exist to analyze data and build models once the data is organized around a set of predefined categories or labels, few methods address the problem of reliably discovering and curating such labels in the first place. In order to move first steps towards bridging this gap, we propose an interactive visual data analysis method that integrates human-driven label ideation, specification and refinement with machine-driven recommendations. The proposed method enables the user to progressively discover and ideate labels in an exploratory fashion and specify rules that can be used to automatically match sets of documents to labels. To support this process of ideation, specification, as well as evaluation of the labels, we use unsupervised machine learning methods that provide suggestions and data summaries. We evaluate our method by applying it to a real-world labeling problem as well as through controlled user studies to identify and reflect on patterns of interaction emerging from exploratory labeling activities.	bridging (networking);categorization;computation;digital curation;exploratory testing;machine learning;refinement (computing)	Cristian Felix;Aritra Dasgupta;Enrico Bertini	2018		10.1145/3242587.3242596	human–computer interaction;information retrieval;visualization;unsupervised learning;labeling problem;ideation;categorization;computer science;bridging (networking)	HCI	-31.833047106886017	-47.62179693262297	61872
b9015d4f1e591eba7ea21c3566c919f80f7c2afe	attentive long short-term preference modeling for personalized product search		E-commerce users may expect different products even for the same query, due to their diverse personal preferences. It is well known that there are two types of preferences: long-term ones and short-term ones. The former refers to users’ inherent purchasing bias and evolves slowly. By contrast, the latter reflects users’ purchasing inclination in a relatively short period. They both affect users’ current purchasing intentions. However, few research efforts have been dedicated to jointly model them for the personalized product search. To this end, we propose a novel Attentive Long Short-Term Preference model, dubbed as ALSTP, for personalized product search. Our model adopts the neural networks approach to learn and integrate the long- and short-term user preferences with the current query for the personalized product search. In particular, two attention networks are designed to distinguish which factors in the short-term as well as long-term user preferences are more relevant to the current query. This unique design enables our model to capture users’ current search intentions more accurately. Our work is the first to apply attention mechanisms to integrate both long- and short-term user preferences with the given query for the personalized search. Extensive experiments over four Amazon product datasets show that our model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art product search methods in terms of different evaluation metrics.		Y.

Given that one of these friends changes her brand, am I likely to do the same? Do new camera models pop up uniformly in the friendship graph? Or do early adopters then “convert” their friends? Which factors influence the conversion probability of a user? These are the kind of questions addressed in this work. Direct applications involve personalized advertising in social networks.  For our study, we crawled a complete connected component of the Flickr friendship graph with a total of 67M edges and 3.9M users. 1.2M of these users had at least one public photograph with valid model metadata, which allowed us to assign camera brands and models to users and time slots. Similarly, we used, where provided in a user’s profile, information about a user’s geographic location and the groups joined on Flickr.  Concerning brand congruence, our main findings are the following. First, a pair of friends on Flickr has a higher probability of being congruent, that is, using the same brand, compared to two random users (27% vs. 19%). Second, the degree of congruence goes up for pairs of friends (i) in the same country (29%), (ii) who both only have very few friends (30%), and (iii) with a very high cliqueness (38%). Third, given that a user changes her camera model between March-May 2007 and March-May 2008, high cliqueness friends are more likely than random users to do the same (54% vs. 48%). Fourth, users using high-end cameras are far more loyal to their brand than users using point-and-shoot cameras, with a probability of staying with the same brand of 60% vs 33%, given that a new camera is bought. Fifth, these “expert” users’ brand congruence reaches 66% for high cliqueness friends. All these differences are statistically significant at 1%.  As for the propagation of new models in the friendship graph, we observe the following. First, the growth of connected components of users converted to a particular, new camera model differs distinctly from random growth. Second, the decline of dissemination of a particular model is close to random decline. This illustrates that users influence their friends to change to a particular new model, rather than from a particular old model. Third, having many converted friends increases the probability of the user to convert herself. Here differences between friends from the same or from different countries are more pronounced for point-and-shoot than for digital single-lens reflex users. Fourth, there was again a distinct difference between arbitrary friends and high cliqueness friends in terms of prediction quality for conversion.	bookmark (world wide web);congruence of squares;connected component (graph theory);digital single-lens reflex camera;emoticon;flickr;friendship graph;geographic coordinate system;graph (discrete mathematics);image;music download;online advertising;personalization;randomness;real life;social graph;social network;software propagation;zeller's congruence	Adish Singla;Ingmar Weber	2011	TWEB	10.1145/2019643.2019647	internet privacy;world wide web;social network	Web+IR	-24.27421388036833	-45.12968363673941	62184

However, the availability of such trust information remains a challenge to the algorithms that use it, as the majority of social networks do not provide a means of explicit trust feedback. This paper presents an investigation into the inference of trust relations between actor pairs of a social network, based solely on the structural information of the bipartite graph typical of most on-line social networks. Using intuition inspired from real life observations, we argue that the popularity of an item in a social graph is inversely related to the level of trust between actor pairs who have rated it. From an existing bipartite social graph, this method computes a new social graph, linking actors together by means of symmetric weighted trust relations. Through a set of experiments performed on a real social network dataset, our method produces statistically significant results, showing strong trust prediction accuracy.	algorithm;emergence;experiment;online and offline;personalization;real life;social graph;social network	Daire O'Doherty;Salim Jouili;Peter Van Roy	2012		10.1145/2304536.2304539	bipartite graph;computer science;machine learning;data mining;statistical significance;social network	Web+IR	-20.031206174642456	-45.83641856892443	62500
e44d9ef70ac6626c6e6f0df58625fb83f5f0adb0	tag correspondence model for user tag suggestion		Some microblog services encourage users to annotate themselves with multiple tags, indicating their attributes and interests. User tags play an important role for personalized recommendation and information retrieval. In order to better understand the semantics of user tags, we propose Tag Correspondence Model (TCM) to identify complex correspondences of tags from the rich context of microblog users. The correspondence of a tag is referred to as a unique element in the context which is semantically correlated with this tag. In TCM, we divide the context of a microblog user into various sources (such as short messages, user profile, and neighbors). With a collection of users with annotated tags, TCM can automatically learn the correspondences of user tags from multiple sources. With the learned correspondences, we are able to interpret implicit semantics of tags. Moreover, for the users who have not annotated any tags, TCM can suggest tags according to users’ context information. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our method can efficiently identify correspondences of tags, which may eventually represent semantic meanings of tags.	experiment;information retrieval;personalization;toolkit for conceptual modeling;user profile	Cun-Chao Tu;Zhiyuan Liu;Maosong Sun	2015	Journal of Computer Science and Technology	10.1007/s11390-015-1582-6	computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-20.98944993500534	-47.03325499774583	62519

This hypothesis, however, can be highly useful in the real robot applications. The robot, for instance, can cover some of the corrupted sensory inputs by replacing them with its internal simulation. The accuracy of this hypothesis is strongly based on the agentpsilas experiences. As much as the agent knows about the environment, as much as it can build a strong internal representation about it. Although many works have been presented regarding to this hypothesis with various levels of success. At the sensorimotor abstraction level, where extracting data from the environment occur, however, none of them have so far used the robotpsilas vision as a sensory input. In this study, vision-sensorimotor abstraction is presented through memory-based learning in a real mobile robot ldquoHemissonrdquo to investigate the possibilities of explaining its inner world based on internal simulation of perception and action at the abstract level. The analysis of the experiments illustrate that our robot with vision sensory input has developed some kind of simple associations or anticipation mechanism through interacting with the environment, which enables, based on its history and the present situation, to guide its behavior in the absence of any external interaction.	abstraction layer;experiment;instance-based learning;interaction;mobile robot;sensor web;simulation	Fady Alnajjar;Abdul Rahman Hafiz;Indra Bin Mohd Zin;Kazuyuki Murase	2008	2008 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence)	10.1109/IJCNN.2008.4634134	mobile robot;computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network	Robotics	-28.175412113362395	-39.62161141872799	62628
177d536e56f0c1117b0bcd5cb48d44cac6ed5beb	collaborative filtering with hybrid clustering integrated method to address new-item cold-start problem		Recommender Systems (RSs) are a valuable and practical tool to cope with information overload, as they help users to find interesting products in a large space of possible options. The Collaborative Filtering (CF) approach is probably the most used technique in RSs field due to several advantages as the ease of implementation, accuracy and diversity of recommendations. Despite being much favored over Content-Based (CB) techniques, it suffers from a major problem related to the lack of sufficient data for new-item cold-start problem, which affects recommendations’ quality. This paper is focused on resolving issues related to item-side in order to produce effective recommendations. To overcome the above problem, we use a powerful content clustering based on Hybrid Features Selection Method (HFSM), to get the maximum profit from the content. Then, it will be combined side by side to CF under a hybrid RS to improve its performance and handle new-item issue. We evaluate the proposed algorithm experimentally either in no cold-start situation or in a simulation of a new-item cold-start scenario. The conducted experiments show the ability of our hybrid recommender to deliver more accurate predictions for any item and its outperformance on the classical CF approach, which doesn’t work as usual especially in cold-start situations.	collaborative filtering	Ferdaous Hdioud;Bouchra Frikh;Asmaa Benghabrit;Brahim Ouhbi	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-25017-5_27	data science;collaborative filtering;machine learning;data mining	EDA	-21.446923569842248	-48.36565966465886	62647
e9d5f56bba13180a1d8b148d370c0937bca7dd74	integrating online social network analysis in personalized web search		With the emergence of high speed internet applications and advanced Web 2.0 based Rich Internet Applications (i.e., blogs, wikis, etc.), it has become much easier for the users to publish data over the Web. This brings a challenge for the Web search solutions to let individual users find the right information as per their preferences, because traditional Web search engines have been built on “one size fits for all” concept. Different users of the Web may have different preferences. Search results for the same query raised by different users may differ in priority for individual users. In this book chapter, we present the extended version and results of our proposal on community-aware personalized Web search. It is quite challenging to know the preferences of the users by the search engines. We have designed and developed our unique approach of finding the preferences of users from the relevant parts of the user’s social network and community. We believe that the information related to the queries posed by the users may have strong correlation with the relevant information in their social networks. In order to find out personal interest and social-context, we find (1) activities of users in their social-network, and (2) relevant information from user’s social networks, based on our proposed trust and relevance matrices. We have further developed a mechanism that extracts from user’s social network information to be used to re-rank search results from a search engine. We also have discussed the implementation and evaluation details of our proposed solution.		M. Omair Shafiq;Tamer N. Jarada;Panagiotis Karampelas;Reda Alhajj;Jon G.

Such approaches are being increasingly adopted by organizations to build customized personalization applications. Leveraging the growing popularity of Web videos for such approaches necessitates the ability to classify Web videos into application-specific categories, since different applications are interested in different aspects of the user preferences. A key requirement of supervised classification models to address this is the availability of training videos labeled to the arbitrary application-specific categories. In order to address this requirement, we propose a completely automated framework to obtain training Web videos for arbitrary categories, which does not rely on any manual labeling of videos. This is achieved utilizing keywords to retrieve training videos, thereby simplifying the problem of obtaining training videos to the problem of selecting keywords to retrieve them. We show that there are two opposing objectives (proximity and diversity) that need to be considered while developing such keyword selection techniques. We propose two efficient approaches (linear combination of proximity and diversity and annealing-based alternating optimization) and study the tradeoffs between them, with respect to performance and the human input required to tune parameters of the approach. Through experiments over several sets of categories, we demonstrate the feasibility of the automated framework to select training videos for application-specific categorization. We also show that the proposed approaches lead to a substantial improvement in the performance of classification models, as compared with other automated methods.	categorization;experiment;machine learning;mathematical optimization;personalization;personalized marketing;simulated annealing;social network;supervised learning;user (computing);video clip	Chetan Kumar Verma;Sujit Dey	2015	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2461156	web query classification;biological classification;content management;computer science;machine learning;data mining;multimedia;metadata;world wide web	Web+IR	-26.481510411378917	-51.683691005613255	63416
3652b2ee55ca7fc4511a8d829ff144cfc65e2f00	semantic based network growth in instant messaging environment	semantic;instant messaging network;network growth	The instant information exchanging network of the Internet is interpreted as the consequences of invisible connection between humans. In the graph based studies the nodes are human beings and the edges represent various social relationships. The interactions among users can be interpreted via the formation and evolution of semantics. The interactive as well as intertwined behaviors are the foundation of network itself; at the same time, they shape the way how and where the network will evolve. This paper proposes a network growth model based on the semantic similarity as well as popularity of nodes. In our model, the nodes represent Sina Weibo blogs and are with semantics, the links are subscribing hyperlinks between nodes. The probability of link establishment between two nodes then calculated from the similarity between nodes. The data and experiments are based on Sina Weibo blogs, which are the continuous results of interactions by users. We collect data using WebCrawler from Sina API, obtaining a portion of the whole network. Results show that the statistic properties of Sina Weibo are in close analogy with that of social network and also the characteristic complex network. The studied network contains a number of very high-degree nodes; these nodes are the cores which small groups strongly clustered, and low-degree nodes at the fringes of the network. However, some nodes with too much semantics (especially under one category) are in decreased chances of having links from newly added nodes. The reason may lies in that the over-abundant semantics remains confusion for knowledge acquiring.	amiga reflections;application programming interface;blog;complex network;cyberspace;experiment;hyperlink;instant messaging;interaction;internet;population dynamics;real life;semantic similarity;social network	Wei Ren;Yuhui Qiu	2014	JCP	10.4304/jcp.9.10.2387-2394	weighted network;network formation;computer science;artificial intelligence;fitness model;machine learning;data mining;network simulation;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	AI	-19.56278988295493	-41.94647324067516	63644

The diversity and time-dependent evolving nature of user interests are creating difficulties in constructing and maintaining a sound user profile. This paper presents a simple but effective model, by using improved growing cell structures (GCS), to address this problem. The GCS is a kind of self-organizing map neural network with changeable network structure. By virtue of the clustering and structure adaptation capability of GCS, the proposed model maps the problem of learning and keeping track of user interests into a clustering and cluster-maintaining problem. Each cluster found by GCS represents an interest category of a user and the cluster maintaining, including cluster addition and deletion, corresponds to the addition of user's new interests and the removal of user's old interests. The proposed model has been validated by a set of experiments performed on a benchmark dataset. Results from experiments show that our model provides reasonable performance and high adaptability for learning user multiple interests and their changes.

7c8822e4bff8eaa454a7a89bf13c443a16a85dd6	on application of learning to rank for e-commerce search		E-Commerce (E-Com) search is an emerging important new application of information retrieval. Learning to Rank (LETOR) is a general effective strategy for optimizing search engines, and is thus also a key technology for E-Com search. While the use of LETOR for web search has been well studied, its use for E-Com search has not yet been well explored. In this paper, we discuss the practical challenges in applying learning to rank methods to E-Com search, including the challenges in feature representation, obtaining reliable relevance judgments, and optimally exploiting multiple user feedback signals such as click rates, add-to-cart ratios, order rates, and revenue. We study these new challenges using experiments on industry data sets and report several interesting findings that can provide guidance on how to optimally apply LETOR to E-Com search: First, popularity-based features defined solely on product items are very useful and LETOR methods were able to effectively optimize their combination with relevance-based features. Second, query attribute sparsity raises challenges for LETOR, and selecting features to reduce/avoid sparsity is beneficial. Third, while crowdsourcing is often useful for obtaining relevance judgments for Web search, it does not work as well for E-Com search due to difficulty in eliciting sufficiently fine grained relevance judgments. Finally, among the multiple feedback signals, the order rate is found to be the most robust training objective, followed by click rate, while add-to-cart ratio seems least robust, suggesting that an effective practical strategy may be to initially use click rates for training and gradually shift to using order rates as they become available.	crowdsourcing;e-commerce payment system;experiment;information retrieval;learning to rank;relevance;sparse matrix;web search engine	Shubhra Kanti Karmaker Santu;Parikshit Sondhi;ChengXiang Zhai	2017		10.1145/3077136.3080838	information retrieval;data mining;e-commerce;computer science;learning to rank;search engine;revenue;popularity;crowdsourcing	Web+IR	-20.42304789736044	-48.99608091578706	63935

When explicit ratings are not available, rating prediction algorithms are not directly applicable. Instead, data consists of positive-only user-item interactions, and the task is therefore not to predict ratings, but rather to predict good items to recommend -- item prediction. One particular challenge of positive-only data is how to interpret absent user-item interactions. These can either be seen as negative or as unknown preferences. In this paper, we propose a recency-based scheme to perform negative preference imputation in an incremental matrix factorization algorithm designed for streaming data. Our results show that this approach substantially improves the accuracy of the baseline method, outperforming both classic and state-of-the-art algorithms.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);collaborative filtering;geo-imputation;interaction;negative feedback;online community;recommender system;stream (computing)	João Vinagre;Alípio Mário Jorge;João Gama	2015		10.1145/2695664.2695998	computer science;machine learning;data mining;database;data stream mining;world wide web	ML	-19.225574347177844	-48.17688043084845	64424

In fact, we have few opportunities to look back own browsing way. Even if we check the enormous browsing logs, it is hard to convert them into sharable knowledge. Therefore, our tool measure the dwell time, the amount of scrolling and page contents and transition between pages for evaluating the importance of each page.

The mainstream technology to optimize search engine usually focuses on two basic factors, relativity and personalization, which normally makes use of items' textual information and users' historical behaviors to mine the correlation between search results and users preferences, and to rank the item-list for different users. Specifically, click and non-click are regarded as labels to define whether the current user prefers the given item or not, and then machine learning is introduced to model click-through rate for ranking the item-list returned by search engine. One disadvantage of the above-mentioned approach, however, is that some temporal information and spatial information of user behavior sequence are ignored. Besides, model training using the search log directly leads to positional bias. This paper models the user behavior sequence to optimize ranking mechanism for E-commerce search. In detail, we first propose a sampling framework in accordance with Markov process to acquire training instances. Spatial sampling is implemented in every page view to avoid the positional bias, and temporal sampling is implemented to utilize behavior information of the sequence of page views for feature design. Then LR and DNN are applied for model training. Experimental results are presented at last. To be specific, the testing and training AUC of LR can be 0.614 and 0.784, respectively, and LR has better performance than that of DNN.	e-commerce payment system;exponent bias;lr parser;machine learning;online shopping;page view;personalization;sampling (signal processing);user experience;web search engine	Chengfu Huo;Yujiao Zhao;Weijun Ren	2017		10.1145/3162957.3163045	personalization;page view;sampling (statistics);user experience design;spatial analysis;search engine;machine learning;markov process;computer science;ranking;artificial intelligence	AI	-19.869025139134724	-50.411582314113495	64807

9b970c525f3ee95351c09e6998e9a02942f694d1	a contextual group recommender mechanism for location-based service		With the increasing popularity of social media and ubiquity of mobile devices, location-based services have become a trending topic in both academia and industry. These services, such as Foursquare and Facebook Places, allow users to search and explore around them. The notion of group recommendation, though new, has started to generate interest. Many scenarios in our daily lives involve others around us, be it friends or family members. Daily activities, such as watching a movie or eating at a restaurant are often done as a group. In an effort to combine location-based service features with recommender system concepts, we propose a group contextual mechanism for venue recommendation. Our research aims to discover and recommend places that may be of high relevance to a group of people. Preference, as well as social influence and context-awareness are considered as core components in our mechanism. Our system provides an efficient and convenient platform to groups for venue discovery, and increases commercial publicity for service providers.	context awareness;location-based service;mobile device;recommender system;relevance;social media;venue (sound system)	Alvin Chang;Ting-Kai Hwang;Yung-Ming Li;Lien-Fa Lin	2015			geography;advertising;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-23.55690959942698	-44.24202100404589	64831
7cede534967238216eaf7ae3fb9ca8d17455022f	alleviating the sparsity problem in recommender systems by exploring underlying user communities		Collaborative Filtering, one of the main Recommender Systems’ approach, has been successfully employed to identify users and items that can be characterized as similar in large datasets. However, its application is limited due to the sparsity problem, which refers to a situation where information to infer similar users and predict items is missing. In this work, we address this by (i) detecting underlying user communities that aggregate similar tastes and (ii) predicting new relations within communities. As a consequence, we alleviate some of the major consequences of this problem. As shown by our experiments, our method is promising. When compared to a user-based Collaborative Filtering method, it provided gains of 20.2% in terms of sparsity decay, for instance, while improving RMSE values in only 2.8%.	aggregate data;collaborative filtering;experiment;recommender system;sensor;sparse matrix	Aline Bessa;Alberto H.

Existing work on location information extraction from user-generated travelogues has primarily focused on the contents, while in this work, we resolve both the contents and structures of travelogues, as well as investigating the interplay of the two. We propose a two-part framework to mine location representative knowledge from travelogues. The first part resolves travelogues in a geographic view. It discovers real location entities subordinated to travel destinations, then decomposes travelogues to acquire corresponding descriptions for each of these entities. Built upon the results of the first part, the second part performs content resolution in a semantic view. By extracting location characterizing concepts and the relatedness among them, it can form a representative concept network for each location entity. Based on a large collection of travelogues, the proposed framework is evaluated using both objective and subjective evaluation methods and shows promising results.	user-generated content	Zhu Zhu;Lidan Shou;Ke Chen	2016	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2015.04.129	data science;data mining;world wide web	ML	-25.564773736106915	-51.811233064615145	64982
5dfa5561e5948a153150a97663891eb57b48a915	towards reliable missing truth discovery in online social media sensing applications		Social media sensing has emerged as a new application paradigm to collect observations from online social media users about the physical environment. A fundamental problem in social media sensing applications lies in estimating the evolving truth of the measured variables and the reliability of data sources without knowing either of them a priori. This problem is referred to as dynamic truth discovery. Two major limitations exist in current truth discovery solutions: i) existing solutions cannot effectively address the missing truth problem where the measured variables do not have any reported measurements from the data sources; ii) the latent correlations among the measured variables were not fully captured and utilized in current solutions. In this paper, we proposed a Reliable Missing Truth Finder (RMTF) to address the above limitations in social media sensing applications. In particular, we develop a novel data-driven technique to identify the lagged and latent correlations among measured variables, and incorporate such correlation information into a holistic spatiotemporal inference model to infer the missing truth. We evaluated the RMTF using the real-world Twitter data feeds. The results show that the RMTF scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art truth discovery solutions by correctly inferring the missing truth of the measured variables.	authorization;baseline (configuration management);holism;programming paradigm;social media	Daniel Yue Zhang;M.A. Kovaleva;Yonghui Zhang;Dong Wang	2018	2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)	10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508655	machine learning;data mining;artificial intelligence;inference;social media;computer science	Metrics	-22.945706797088896	-43.297441726836446	65284

On the one hand one has to overcome `standard' recommender systems challenges, such as dealing with large, sparse, and long-tailed datasets. On the other, several new challenges present themselves, such as the need to model content in terms of its visual appearance, or even social dynamics, such as a preference toward a particular artist that is independent of the art they create. In this paper we build large-scale recommender systems to model the dynamics of a vibrant digital art community, Behance, consisting of tens of millions of interactions (clicks and 'appreciates') of users toward digital art. Methodologically, our main contributions are to model (a) rich content, especially in terms of its visual appearance; (b) temporal dynamics, in terms of how users prefer 'visually consistent' content within and across sessions; and (c) social dynamics, in terms of how users exhibit preferences both towards certain art styles, as well as the artists themselves.	baseline (configuration management);emoticon;interaction;markov chain;non-blocking algorithm;recommender system;sampling (signal processing);scalability;social dynamics;sparse matrix;temporal logic;time complexity	Ruining He;Chen Fang;Zhaowen Wang;Julian McAuley	2016		10.1145/2959100.2959152	markov chain;computer science;multimedia;world wide web;recommender system	Web+IR	-33.51118225984788	-48.19348833970789	65314
01cecbc97c4657f07c21e0bd8fca92412187ec77	item recommendation using tag emotion in social cataloging services		We propose a tag-based recommendation method considering users emotions in tags.The tag weight is based on the rating and the emotion value of the tag.The emotion value of the tag is obtained using SenticNet.We apply a High-Order Singular Value Decomposition.The evaluation shows that users emotion plays an important role in recommendation. Due to the overload of contents, the user suffers from difficulty in selecting items. The social cataloging services allow users to consume items and share their opinions, which influences in not only oneself but other users to choose new items. The recommendation system reduces the problem of the choice by recommending the items considering the behavior of the people and the characteristics of the items.In this study, we propose a tag-based recommendation method considering the emotions reflected in the users tags. Since the users estimation of the item is made after consuming the item, the feelings of the user obtained during consuming are directly reflected in ratings and tags. The rating has overall valence on the item, and the tag represents the detailed feelings. Therefore, we assume that the users rating for an item is the basic emotion of the tag attached to the item, and the emotion of tag is adjusted by the unique emotion value of the tag. We represent the relationships between users, items, and tags as a three-order tensor and apply tensor factorization. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better recommendation performance than baselines.	social cataloging application	Hyewon Lim;Hyoung-Joo Kim	2017	Expert Syst.

We leveraged on the joint exploitation of content-based image retrieval and relevance feedback to provide an effective mechanism to navigate through the manuscript and add custom knowledge in the form of tags. The similarity retrieval between miniature illustrations is based on covariance descriptors, integrating color, spatial and gradient information. The proposed relevance feedback technique, namely Query Remapping Feature Space Warping, accounts for the user’s opinions by accordingly warping the data points. This is obtained by means of a remapping strategy (from the Riemannian space where covariance matrices lie, referring back to Euclidean space) useful to boost the retrieval performance. Experiments are reported to show the quality of the proposal. Moreover, the complete prototype with user interaction, as already showcased at museums and exhibitions, is presented.	content-based image retrieval;data point;experiment;feature vector;gradient descent;interactivity;prototype;relevance feedback	Daniele Borghesani;Costantino Grana;Rita Cucchiara	2013	Multimedia Systems	10.1007/s00530-013-0315-3	computer vision;visual word;image retrieval;computer science;machine learning;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-33.53928503695413	-46.527739378273914	65843

Recommendation systems form one of the solutions to deal with the information overload problem by providing personalized services. Using spatial, temporal and social information on recommender systems is a recent trend that increases the performance. Also, taking into account more than one criterion can improve the performance of the recommender systems. In this paper, a location and social network aware recommender system enhanced with multi objective filtering is proposed and described. The results show that the proposed method reaches high coverage while preserving precision. Besides, the proposed method is not affected by the range of ratings and provides persistent results in different settings.	blog;cluster analysis;collaborative filtering;information overload;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;online and offline;personalization;recommender system;social network;web 2.0;web page	Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy;Faruk Polat;Reda Alhajj	2014	10th IEEE International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing		computer science;mathematical model;data mining;database;multimedia;management;world wide web;recommender system;collaboration	DB	-23.950894712928836	-48.61358314163602	66197
b275f3792025111729f89665aa92a68683e44f6c	cognitive navigation by neuro-inspired localization, mapping, and episodic memory		One of the important topics in the study of robotic cognition is to enable robot to perceive, plan, and react to situations in a real-world environment. We present a novel angle on this subject, by integrating active navigation with sequence learning. We propose a neuro-inspired cognitive navigation model which integrates the cognitive mapping ability of entorhinal cortex (EC) and episodic memory ability of hippocampus to enable the robot to perform more versatile cognitive tasks. The EC layer is modeled by a 3-D continuous attractor network structure to build the map of the environment. The hippocampus is modeled by a recurrent spiking neural network to store and retrieve task-related information. The information between cognitive map and memory network are exchanged through respective encoding and decoding schemes. The cognitive system is applied on a mobile robot platform and the robot exploration, localization, and navigation are investigated. The robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.	action potential;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;cognition;cognitive map;experiment;internationalization and localization;mobile robot;network model;programming paradigm;scalability;spiking neural network	Huajin Tang;Rui Yan;Kay Chen Tan	2018	IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems	10.1109/TCDS.2017.2776965	spatial memory;machine learning;computer science;semantic memory;encoding (memory);cognitive map;artificial intelligence;sequence learning;attractor network;mobile robot;cognition	Robotics	-29.469356868178945	-39.78395406686027	66650

Recently, Web 2.0 applications and social media have provided a convenient medium for people to share knowledge over the Internet. However, the huge amount of created knowledge can also leads to the problem of information overload. This research proposes a social knowledge navigation mechanism that utilizes the techniques of relevant knowledge network construction, knowledge importance analysis, and knowledge concept ontology construction to generate a visualized recommendation of a knowledge map of sub-concept and knowledge of an article reading sequence for supporting learning activities related to a free online encyclopedia. The results of experiments conducted on Wikipedia show that the proposed mechanism can effectively recommend useful articles and improve a knowledge seekeru0027s learning effectiveness.	recommender system	Yung-Ming Li;Lien-Fa Lin;Yu-Hui Lin	2014	Inf.

5be9d75b36515a101b3fdface3c777f4ddd97b22	crisp: an interruption management algorithm based on collaborative filtering	classification algorithm;interruption management cost estimation;collaborative filtering	Interruptions can have a significant impact on users working to complete a task. When people are collaborating, either with other users or with systems, coordinating interruptions is an important factor in maintaining efficiency and preventing information overload. Computer systems can observe user behavior, model it, and use this to optimize the interruptions to minimize disruption. However, current techniques often require long training periods that make them unsuitable for online collaborative environments where new users frequently participate.  In this paper, we present a novel synthesis between Collaborative Filtering methods and machine learning classification algorithms to create a fast learning algorithm, CRISP. CRISP exploits the similarities between users in order to apply data from known users to new users, therefore requiring less information on each person. Results from user studies indicate the algorithm significantly improves users' performances in completing the task and their perception of how long it took to complete each task.	algorithm;collaborative filtering;cross industry standard process for data mining;denial-of-service attack;hardware description language;information overload;interrupt;machine learning;performance;usability testing	Tammar Shrot;Avi Rosenfeld;Jennifer Golbeck;Sarit Kraus	2014		10.1145/2556288.2557109	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;collaborative filtering;data mining;world wide web	HCI	-28.404176714752523	-49.08025034572231	66907
96aaac4881e6f0f969e6943013014f71cccb9249	preference based filtering and recommendations for running routes		With the current trend of fitness and health tracking and quantified self, hundreds of relevant apps and devices are being released to the consumer market. Remarkably, some platforms were created to collect running-route data from these different sources in order to provide a better value for users. Such data could be employed in finding running routes based on the user’s preferences rather than being limited to the proximity to the user’s location. In this work, a classification system for running routes is introduced considering performance factors, visual factors and the nature of route. A running-route content-based recommender system is built on top of this classification enabling learning user preferences from their performance history. The system was evaluated using data from active runners and attained a promising recommendation accuracy averaging 84% among all subject users.	quantified self;recommender system;user (computing)	Hassan Issa;Amir Guirguis;Shary Beshara;Stefan Agne;Andreas Dengel	2016		10.5220/0005897801390146	data mining;filter (signal processing);computer science	Web+IR	-27.778488390801414	-45.463559869860845	66972
2d74c64eccc46113ad8510903bfb31e058abae03	learning to un-rank: quantifying search exposure for users in online communities		Search engines in online communities such as Twitter or Facebook not only return matching posts, but also provide links to the profiles of the authors. Thus, when a user appears in the top-k results for a sensitive keyword query, she becomes widely exposed in a sensitive context. The effects of such exposure can result in a serious privacy violation, ranging from embarrassment all the way to becoming a victim of organizational discrimination.  In this paper, we propose the first model for quantifying search exposure on the service provider side, casting it into a reverse k-nearest-neighbor problem. Moreover, since a single user can be exposed by a large number of queries, we also devise a learning-to-rank method for identifying the most critical queries and thus making the warnings user-friendly. We develop efficient algorithms, and present experiments with a large number of user profiles from Twitter that demonstrate the practical viability and effectiveness of our framework.	black box;computation;experiment;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;learning to rank;nearest neighbor search;online community;parallel computing;relevance;sensor;software deployment;stream processing;synergy;threat (computer);usability;user profile	Asia J.

5dcd30b4f322c2308f5a1498eff9dabbf9992887	knowledge sharing via social login: exploiting microblogging service for warming up social question answering websites		Community Question Answering (CQA) websites such as Quora are widely used for users to get high quality answers. Users are the most important resource for CQA services, and the awareness of user expertise at early stage is critical to improve user experience and reduce churn rate. However, due to the lack of engagement, it is difficult to infer the expertise levels of newcomers. Despite that newcomers expose little expertise evidence in CQA services, they might have left footprints on external social media websites. Social login is a technical mechanism to unify multiple social identities on different sites corresponding to a single person entity. We utilize the social login as a bridge and leverage social media knowledge for improving user performance prediction in CQA services. In this paper, we construct a dataset of 20,742 users who have been linked across Zhihu (similar to Quora) and Sina Weibo. We perform extensive experiments including hypothesis test and real task evaluation. The results of hypothesis test indicate that both prestige and relevance knowledge on Weibo are correlated with user performance in Zhihu. The evaluation results suggest that the social media knowledge largely improves the performance when the available training data is not sufficient.	display resolution;experiment;performance prediction;question answering;relevance;social login;social media;user experience	Yang Xiao;Wayne Xin Zhao;Kun Wang;Zhen Xiao	2014			knowledge management;data mining;world wide web	Web+IR	-19.622419867499204	-51.154739446693604	67160

We model different forms of noise which are intended to simulate output from potentially unreliable sources such as estimated fitness functions, physical sensors, or the results of a study with human subjects. We conclude that while the optimal algorithm in any situation is dependant on the expected noise pattern and the requirements of a specific application, ground truth data can be obtained in most circumstances with a predictable accuracy.	algorithm;array data structure;artificial intelligence;boolean network;digital scholarship;directed graph;experiment;fitness function;gnu scientific library;ground truth;hardiman;natural user interface;recommender system;requirement;sensor;simulation;sinewave synthesis;sort (c++);sorting algorithm	Aidan Breen;Colm O'Riordan	2016			machine learning;computer science;artificial intelligence	AI	-30.332606882774027	-42.59465681020317	67675

Inspired by recent findings in the entorhinal-hippocampal neuronal circuits, we propose a cognitive mapping model that includes continuous attractor networks of head-direction cells and conjunctive grid cells to integrate velocity information by conjunctive encodings of space and movement. Visual inputs from the local view cells in the model provide feedback cues to correct drifting errors of the attractors caused by the noisy velocity inputs. We demonstrate the mapping performance of the proposed cognitive mapping model on an open-source dataset of 66 km car journey in a 3 km × 1.6 km urban area. Experimental results show that the proposed model is robust in building a coherent semi-metric topological map of the entire urban area using a monocular camera, even though the image inputs contain various changes caused by different light conditions and terrains. The results in this study could inspire both neuroscience and robotic research to better understand the neural computational mechanisms of spatial cognition and to build robust robotic navigation systems in large-scale environments.	chimeric antigen receptor;cognition;cognitive map;coherence (physics);navigation;neuroscience discipline;open-source software;robot;robotic mapping;semiconductor industry;silo (dataset);velocity (software development)	Taiping Zeng;Bailu Si	2017		10.3389/fnbot.2017.00061	computer science;artificial intelligence;cognitive map;spatial cognition;grid;machine learning;communication;simultaneous localization and mapping;attractor;path integration;topological map	Robotics	-29.32424426989832	-40.01027140798437	67849

Although in the literature exists a variety of techniques and strategies used as part of job recommender systems, most of them fail to recommending job vacancies that fit properly to the job seekers profiles. Thus, the contributions of this work are threefold, we: i) made publicly available a new dataset formed by a set of job seekers profiles and a set of job vacancies collected from different job search engine sites; ii) put forward the proposal of a framework for job recommendation based on professional skills of job seekers; and iii) carried out an evaluation to quantify empirically the recommendation abilities of two state-of-the-art methods, considering different configurations, within the proposed framework. We thus present a general panorama of job recommendation task aiming to facilitate research and real-world application design regarding this important issue.	information overload;personalization;recommender system;systems design;web search engine	Jorge Carlos Valverde-Rebaza;Ricardo Puma;Paul Bustios;Nathalia C.

5a095da6474a42a32c81228ec014d33dc9ef80b8	mining business opportunities from location-based social networks		Urbanization's rapid progress has modernized a large number of human beings' lives. This urbanization progress is accompanied by the increase of a variety of shops (e.g., restaurants and fitness centers) to meet the increasing citizens, which means business opportunities for the investors. Nevertheless, it is difficult for the investors to catch such opportunities because opening what kind of business at which place is not easy to decide. In this paper, we take this challenge and define the business opportunity mining problem, which recommends new business categories at a partitioned business district. Specifically, we exploit the data from location-based social networks (LBSNs) to mine the business opportunities, guiding the business owners to open new commercial shops in certain categories at a particular area. First, we define the properties of a business district and propose a greedy algorithm to partition a city into different districts. Next, we propose an embedding model to learn latent representations of categories, which captures the functional correlations among business categories. Furthermore, we propose a ranking model based on the pairwise loss to recommend categories for a specific district. Finally, we conduct experiments on Yelp data, and experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline methods and resolves the problem well.	baseline (configuration management);experiment;greedy algorithm;location-based service;microsoft research;social network;wiki	Shenglin Zhao;Irwin King;Michael R.

Our proposed technique leverages sensor-collected meta-data which are automatically acquired as a continuous stream together with the video. Our approach is able to detect interesting regions and objects (hotspots) and their distances from the camera in a fully automated way. Meaningful keyframes are adaptively selected based on the popularity of the hotspots.

This type of analysis can be helpful in web performance analysis, web usability or accessibility as well. Various software is available for user behavior analysis or for analysis of user interaction with the web site. However, most of them have the user segmentation based only on statistical measurement of such information like click-through rates, identification of popular paths and others. In this paper there is presented the web site community analysis oriented to the user segmentation. The analysis is based on the users' similar behavior on the website. For the identification of similar behavioral patterns was proposed the algorithm based on sequential pattern mining method combined with clustering using generalized suffix tree data structure.	accessibility;algorithm;behavioral pattern;cluster analysis;data mining;data structure;generalized suffix tree;mathematical optimization;online advertising;sequential pattern mining;tree (data structure);web performance;web usability	Katerina Slaninová;Jan Martinovic;Tomás Novosad;Pavla Drázdilová;Lukás Vojácek;Václav Snásel	2011	2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology	10.1109/WI-IAT.2011.85	web service;algorithm design;web mining;web modeling;data web;web analytics;web mapping;computer science;social semantic web;data mining;database;world wide web;mashup	Web+IR	-30.224023473338576	-50.40949170200786	68826

This work develops a recommender system aiming to present users with items -- news stories, in our case -- on which they are likely to comment. We combine items' content with a collaborative-filtering approach (utilizing users' co-commenting patterns) in a latent factor modeling framework. Building upon previous work, we focus on a continuous, real-time approach to address the problem above. After an initial training period during which commenting activity of users is observed, the system is tested at each subsequent comment submission event by predicting which story is being commented on by a given user at a given time. Our results show that we are able to overcome the site's inherent presentation bias and outperform a strong baseline as users' commenting history grows.	aggregate data;baseline (configuration management);blog;collaborative filtering;comment (computer programming);personalization;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;recommender system;simulation;user experience	Michal Aharon;Amit Kagian;Ronny Lempel;Yehuda Koren	2012		10.1145/2365952.2365996	computer science;collaborative filtering;machine learning;personalization;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval;recommender system	Web+IR	-24.838646688024376	-47.6343947273402	69370

This user intent model is combined with the initial search result rankings in order to present recommended search results to the user as well as to reorder subsequent search engine results pages after the initial page. This paper will use data from the first three months of Surf Canyon usage to show that a user intent model built from implicit user signals can dramatically improve the relevancy of search results.	browser extension;interaction;personalization;real-time web;relevance;search engine results page;speeded up robust features;web search engine	Georg Buscher;Jacek Gwizdka;Jaime Teevan;Nicholas J.

e8d3c299ac5aaf425d53b6fe445f2d31de8be399	a personalized recommender system from probabilistic relational model and users’ preferences	cold start problem	Recommender systems are applications to retrieve useful information from large amount of online data to assist users in discovering interesting items/products in the system. Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, demographics-based filtering and hybrid approach are main approaches to realize recommendation systems. Most of the existing algorithms use a single approach to deal with recommendation problems. Besides, traditional recommendation approaches mainly deal with single dyadic relationships between users and items whereas data in real world are generally conceptualized in terms of objects and relations between them. Recommender systems based on Probabilistic Relational Model (PRM)1,2, a framework for learning probabilistic models from relational data, have tried to address this issue. However, existing PRM-based recommendation algorithms do not fit into our context where we are struggling with the contradictory situation of a real-world application that requires building a personalized recommender when no user profile exists. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to build a personalized PRM-based recommendation model with the help of users’ preferences on decision making criteria. Using our approach, content-based, collaborative filtering as well as hybrid models can be achieved from the same PRM. Applying the model on a real-world data from a cold system, we show that our model is actually capable of personalizing recommendations in coldstart situation.

Fewer current practices exploit social networking initiatives to assist in spam filtering. Social network has essentially a large number of accounts features and attributes to be considered. Instead of considering large amount of users accounts features, we construct a new model called meta-layer email network which can reduce these features by only considering individual user's actions as an indicator of user preference, these common user actions are considered to construct a social behavior-based email network. With the further analytic results from text similarity measurements for each individual email contents, the behavior-based virtual email network can be improved with much higher accuracy on user preferences. Further, a coupled selection model is developed for this email network, we are able to consider all relevant factors/features in a whole and recommend the emails practically to the user individually. The experimental results show the new approach can achieve higher precision and accuracy with better email ranking in favor of personalised preference.	email filtering;social network;spamming;user (computing)	Frank Jiang;Jin Gan;Yuanyuan Xu;Guandong Xu	2016	2016 International Conference on Behavioral, Economic and Socio-cultural Computing (BESC)	10.1109/BESC.2016.7804482	html email;computer science;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web;email authentication	Web+IR	-20.71125427036618	-46.49567718310641	69438

However, this flexibility on the part of the customer causes the respective e-commerce companies to incur heavy losses because of the delivery logistics involved and the eventual lower resale value of the product returned. In this paper, we consider data from one of the leading Indian e-commerce companies and investigate the problem of product returns across different lifestyle verticals. One of the striking observations from our measurements is that most of the returns take place for apparels/garments and the major reason for the return as cited by the customers is the “size/fit” issue. Here we develop, based on past purchase/return data, a model that given a user, a brand and a size of the product can predict whether the user is going to eventually return the product. The methodological novelty of our model is that it combines concepts from network science and machine learning to make the predictions. Across three different major verticals of various sizes, we obtain overall F-score improvements between 10%–25% over a naïve baseline where the clusters are obtained using simple random walk with restarts.	baseline (configuration management);e-commerce payment system;f1 score;logistics;machine learning;naivety;network science	Tanuj Joshi;Animesh Mukherjee;Michael Lanz	2018	2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)	10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508486	data mining;novelty;network science;e-commerce;simple random sample;norm (social);computer science	DB	-19.622530861139353	-46.93840409334816	69495
8aba78cbad57ab6a8680fdff06504bd1a21f1a74	utilizing mind-maps for information retrieval and user modelling	user modelling;information retrieval;content analysis;mind maps;inproceedings	Mind-maps have been widely neglected by the information retrieval (IR) community. However, there are an estimated two million active mind-map users, who create 5 million mind-maps every year, of which a total of 300,000 is publicly available. We believe this to be a rich source for information retrieval applications, and present eight ideas on how mind-maps could be utilized by them. For instance, mind-maps could be utilized to generate user models for recommender systems or expert search, or to calculate relatedness of web-pages that are linked in mind-maps. We evaluated the feasibility of the eight ideas, based on estimates of the number of available mind-maps, an analysis of the content of mind-maps, and an evaluation of the users’ acceptance of the ideas. We concluded that user modelling is the most promising application with respect to mind-maps. A user modelling prototype – a recommender system for the users of our mind-mapping software Docear – was implemented, and evaluated. Depending on the applied user modelling approaches, the effectiveness, i.e. click-through rate on recommendations, varied between 0.28% and 6.24%. This indicates that mind-map based user modelling is promising, but not trivial, and that further research is required to increase effectiveness.	information retrieval;list of concept- and mind-mapping software;prototype;recommender system	Jöran Beel;Stefan Langer;Marcel Genzmehr;Bela Gipp	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-08786-3_26	computer science;data mining;multimedia;information retrieval	Web+IR	-27.41542432386402	-51.792134725933806	69574

Most of the current web browsing methods and systems have been investigated to apply adaptive approaches which can extract personal contexts (e.g., interests and preferences) of the users. In this paper, we propose a contextual mashupbased collaborative browsing (co-browsing) platform, called ContextGrid, for providing online users with various knowledge sharing services. Particularly, the proposed mashup scheme can integrate heterogeneous pieces of information collected by various Open APIs, and assist the users to decide which partners should be selected for mutual collaborations. In order to evaluate the proposed mashup-based method, we have implemented a co-browsing platform which can exchange bookmarks, and measured whether the contextual mashup scheme makes a meaningful influence on improving the performance of the co-browsing process with multiple users.	mashup (web application hybrid);multi-user;web resource;world wide web	Jason J.

Socially-aware systems should integrate these complex relationship patterns in the network design. This paper studies the impact of friendship and antagonistic relationships between individuals on optimal network propagation policies. We develop a network propagation model for signed networks, and determine the optimal policies to influence a target node with an opinion while minimizing the total number of persons against it. We also provide extensions to this problem to elaborate on the impact of network parameters, such as minimum-delay propagation, while limiting the number of persons influenced against the idea before reaching the target. We provide numerical evaluations in a synthetic setup as well as the Epinions online social dataset. We demonstrate that propagation schemes with social and influence-centric constraints should take into account the relationship types in network design.	algorithm;complex system;context-aware pervasive systems;entity–relationship model;interaction;multicast;network planning and design;network topology;numerical analysis;point-to-point protocol;software propagation;synthetic data;telecommunications network	Basak Guler;Burak Varan;Kaya Tutuncuoglu;Mohamed S.

As part of this culture, people leave a variety of traces when interacting with (other people via) Social Web systems. In this paper, we investigate user modeling strategies for inferring personal interest profiles from Social Web interactions. In particular, we analyze individual micro-blogging activities on Twitter. We compare different strategies for creating user profiles based on the Twitter messages a user has published and study how these profiles change over time. Moreover, we evaluate the quality of the user modeling strategies in the context of personalized recommender systems and show that those strategies which consider the temporal dynamics of the individual profiles allow for the best performance.	blog;interaction;organizing (structure);personalization;recommender system;tracing (software);user modeling;user profile;web content;world wide web	Fabian Abel;Qi Gao;Geert-Jan Houben;Ke Tao	2011		10.1145/2527031.2527040	social web;computer science;social semantic web;data mining;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-26.49788443375002	-48.59335324599677	70084

To recruit new customers, retain the current ones, and gain competitive edge over competing companies, online vendors need to offer accurate predictions efficiently. Therefore, providing precise recommendations efficiently to many users in real time is imperative. Singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied to CF to achieve such goal. SVD-based CF systems offer reliable and accurate predictions when they own large enough data. Data collected for CF purposes, however, might be split between different companies, even competing ones. Some vendors, especially newly established ones, might have problems with available data. To increase mutual advantages, provide richer CF services, and overcome problems caused by inadequate data, companies want to integrate their data. However, due to privacy, legal, and financial reasons, they do not want to combine their data. In this article, we investigate how to provide SVD-based referrals on partitioned (horizontally or vertically) data without greatly jeopardizing data holders' privacy. We conduct real data-based experiments to assess our schemes' overall performance and analyze them in terms of privacy and supplementary costs. Our results show that it is possible to provide accurate SVD-based referrals on integrated data while preserving e-companies' privacy.	collaborative filtering;singular value decomposition	Ibrahim Yakut;Huseyin Polat	2010	International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making	10.1142/S0219622010003919	e-commerce;computer science;marketing;data mining;database;mathematics;singular value decomposition;world wide web;statistics	Theory	-20.935400191861632	-49.89213854930235	70241

The proposed vision is a methodological framework aimed to deal with intelligent personal data store that are able to automatically perform individual data mining, and that can provide proactive suggestions and support decisions, allow to share individual profiles in order to reach a level of knowledge comparable to those belonged to a collective system, and suggest interactions between individual and collective data mining in order to overtake the level of complex society knowledge extracted by the state-of-art methods.

Examples include the predicates (subject, verb, object) in knowledge bases, hyperlinks and anchor texts in the Web graphs, sensor streams (time, location, and type), social networks over time, and DBLP conference-author-keyword relations. Tensor decomposition is an important data mining tool with various applications including clustering, trend detection, and anomaly detection. However, current tensor decomposition algorithms are not scalable for large tensors with billions of sizes and hundreds millions of nonzeros: the largest tensor in the literature remains thousands of sizes and hundreds thousands of nonzeros.  Consider a knowledge base tensor consisting of about 26 million noun-phrases. The intermediate data explosion problem, associated with naive implementations of tensor decomposition algorithms, would require the materialization and the storage of a matrix whose largest dimension would be ≈7 x 1014; this amounts to ~10 Petabytes, or equivalently a few data centers worth of storage, thereby rendering the tensor analysis of this knowledge base, in the naive way, practically impossible. In this paper, we propose GIGATENSOR, a scalable distributed algorithm for large scale tensor decomposition. GIGATENSOR exploits the sparseness of the real world tensors, and avoids the intermediate data explosion problem by carefully redesigning the tensor decomposition algorithm.  Extensive experiments show that our proposed GIGATENSOR solves 100 times bigger problems than existing methods. Furthermore, we employ GIGATENSOR in order to analyze a very large real world, knowledge base tensor and present our astounding findings which include discovery of potential synonyms among millions of noun-phrases (e.g. the noun 'pollutant' and the noun-phrase 'greenhouse gases').	anomaly detection;array data structure;cluster analysis;data center;data mining;distributed algorithm;experiment;hyperlink;image scaling;knowledge base;neural coding;petabyte;scalability;social network;world wide web	U.

One of the limitations is the lack of databases that labels ingredients of recipes with their associated allergens. This limitation may cause the recommendation of inappropriate recipes to people with specific food restrictions. In order to try to solve this, this paper proposes a collaborative multi-agent system that automatically detects food allergies in nutrients and labels ingredients with their potential allergens. The proposed system is being employed in receteame.com, a recipe recommendation system which includes persuasive technologies, which are interactive technologies aimed at changing users’ attitudes or behaviors through persuasion and social influence, and social information to improve the recommendations.	best, worst and average case;database;experiment;machine learning;multi-agent system;recommender system	Yves Demazeau;Takayuki Ito;Javier Bajo;María José Escalona	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-39324-7		AI	-29.447288101077355	-47.56891692862135	70827

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to jointly model link communities and content topics by leveraging both the social graph and the content shared by users. We model a community as a distribution over users, use it as a source for topics of interest, and jointly infer both communities and topics using Gibbs sampling. While modeling communities using the social graph, or modeling topics using content have received a great deal of attention, a few recent approaches try to model topics in content-sharing platforms using both content and social graph. Our work differs from the existing generative models in that we explicitly model the social graph of users along with the user-generated content, mimicking how the two entities co-evolve in content-sharing platforms. Recent studies have found Twitter to be more of a content-sharing network and less a social network, and it seems hard to detect tightly knit communities from the follower-followee links. Still, the question of whether we can extract Twitter communities using both links and content is open. In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative. Our model discovers coherent communities and topics, as evinced by qualitative results on sub-graphs of Twitter users. Furthermore, we evaluate our model on the task of predicting follower-followee links. We show that joint modeling of links and content significantly improves link prediction performance on a sub-graph of Twitter (consisting of about 0.7 million users and over 27 million tweets), compared to generative models based on only structure or only content and paths-based methods such as Katz.	coherence (physics);entity;generative model;gibbs sampling;sampling (signal processing);social graph;social network;statistical model;user-generated content	Nagarajan Natarajan;Prithviraj Sen;Vineet Chaoji	2013	2013 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2013)	10.1145/2492517.2492546	sampling;combinatorics;content management;computer science;graph theory;machine learning;data mining;clustering coefficient;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-19.55166763562277	-44.006196545294124	71424

For instance, online newspapers want to know who is reading their articles. Previous approaches have tried to determine such audience demographics by placing cookies on users' systems, or by directly asking consumers (e.g., through surveys). The first approach may make users uncomfortable, and the second is not scalable. In this paper we focus on determining the demographics of a Website's audience by analyzing the blogs that link to the Website. We analyze both the text of the blogs and the network connectivity of the blog network to determine demographics such as whether a person """"is married"""" or """"has pets."""" Presumably bloggers linking to sites also consume the content of those sites. Therefore, the discovered demographics for the bloggers can be used to represent a proxy set of demographics for a subset of the Website's consumers. We demonstrate that in many cases we can infer sub-audiences for a site from these demographics. Further, this feasibility demonstrates that very specific demographics for sites can be generated as we improve the methods for determining them (e.g., finding people who play video games). In our study we analyze blogs collected from more than 590,000 bloggers collected over a six month period that link to more than 488,000 distinct, external websites."""	blog network;http cookie;proxy server;scalability;world wide web	Matthew Michelson;Sofus A.

888741d8dbf3b6ffe233f074e978c402eaa8ad66	using text mining to analyze real estate classifieds		Many brokers have adapted their operation to exploit the potential of the web. Despite the importance of the real estate classifieds, there has been little work in analyzing such data. In this paper we propose a two-stage regression model that exploits the textual data in real estate classifieds. We show how our model can be used to predict the price of a real estate classified. We also show how our model can be used to highlight keywords that affect the price positively or negatively. To assess our contributions, we analyze four real world data sets, which we gathered from three different property websites. The analysis shows that our model (which exploits textual features) achieves significantly lower root mean squared error across the different data sets and against variety of regression models.	mean squared error;named-entity recognition;text corpus;text mining	Sherief Abdallah	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-48308-5_19	data mining;world wide web	ML	-20.27068807811922	-51.625067713993566	72453

Despite their success in the industry, traditional recommender systems suffer from several problems. First, the sparseness of the user-item matrix seriously affects the recommendation quality. Second, traditional recommender systems ignore the connections among users, which loses the opportunity to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations. In this paper, aiming at providing more realistic and accurate recommendations, we propose a factor analysis-based optimization framework to incorporate the user trust and distrust relationships into the recommender systems. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: (1) We elaborate how user distrust information can benefit the recommender systems. (2) In terms of the trust relations, distinct from previous trust-aware recommender systems which are based on some heuristics, we systematically interpret how to constrain the objective function with trust regularization. (3) The experimental results show that the distrust relations among users are as important as the trust relations. The complexity analysis shows our method scales linearly with the number of observations, while the empirical analysis on a large Epinions dataset proves that our approaches perform better than the state-of-the-art approaches.	analysis of algorithms;distrust;factor analysis;heuristic (computer science);loss function;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;neural coding;optimization problem;personalization;recommender system;time complexity	Hao Ma;Michael R.

81b3635c7809afccd472e26b98ade7f860f436d1	object recognition for service robots through verbal interaction about multiple attribute information		In order to be effective, it is essential for service robots to be able to recognize objects in complex environments. However, it is a difficult problem for them to recognize objects autonomously without any mistakes in a real-world environment. Thus, in response to this chal- lenge we conceived of an object recognition system that would utilize information about target objects acquired from the user through simple interaction. In this paper, we propose image processing techniques to consider the shape composition and the material composition of objects in an interactive object recognition framework, and introduce a robot us- ing this interactive object recognition system. Experimental results con- firmed that the robot could indeed recognize objects by utilizing multiple attribute information obtained through interaction with the user.

In this paper, we propose hybrid music recommendation algorithms that combine information on the music content, the music context, and the user context, in particular, integrating location-aware weighting of similarities. Using state-of-the-art techniques to extract audio features and contextual web features, and a novel standardized data set of music listening activities inferred from microblogs (MusicMicro), we propose several multimodal retrieval functions.  The main contributions of this paper are (i) a systematic evaluation of mixture coefficients between state-of-the-art audio features and web features, using the first standardized microblog data set of music listening events for retrieval purposes and (ii) novel geospatial music recommendation approaches using location information of microblog users, and a comprehensive evaluation thereof.	algorithm;coefficient;collaborative filtering;location awareness;multimodal interaction;recommender system	Markus Schedl;Dominik Schnitzer	2013		10.1145/2484028.2484146	computer science;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-26.286421538261518	-50.72694205293086	72860
f89eaf7b81d2554118968cd01fc879460e544fcd	"""""""two is a crowd"""" - optimal trend adoption in social networks"""		In this paper, we study how an individual in a social network should decide whether or not to adopt a trend, based on how many people in his/her neighborhood in the social network adopted the trend. In particular we are interested in the question in what adoption policy leads to an optimal trend-adoption in the sense that an individual only adopts a trend if the majority of his/her social network will do so. We use a decision process on a Erdös-Rényi random graph model to model and study this situation. Using this model, we obtain the result that the optimal policy for an individual is to adopt a trend if two people in their neighborhood did. Interestingly, this result/behavior was experimentally observed in real social networks. We hope that this work will help towards building applications that is able to automatically push relevant content to users in online social networks.	experiment;marginal model;random graph;real life;social network	Lilin Zhang;Peter Marbach	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-30373-9_42	public relations;actuarial science;socioeconomics;business	ECom	-23.599173343693064	-43.6848769640503	72876

Furthermore, it also copes with the dynamic nature and heterogeneity of both users' behaviour and the Web, updating the clustering model over time.

The second is that social information can be easily incorporated with existing targeting methods to predict response rates. Our purpose in this paper is to investigate these requirements. We measure the relevance of a social network, the Yahoo! Instant Messenger graph, to classes of ads. We investigate the degree to which social network information complements existing user-profile information for targeting. We find that there is significant evidence in our social network of homophily, that links in the network indicate similar ad-relevant interests.

However, user's unintentional activity contains many clues about a user, that can be beneficial to take into account in designing appropriate response. Current study focuses on these unintentional traces, that left behind by use of standard input devices, keyboard and mouse, and specifically, we try to predict users age and gender. Mouse and keyboard data used in this study, are collected in six different systems between 2011 and 2017 in total from 1519 subjects. Some supervised machine learning models yield to f-scores over 0.9 when predicted both user age or gender.	computer keyboard;dynamic data;event (computing);game controller;human computer;human–computer interaction;input device;keystroke dynamics;machine learning;standard streams;supervised learning;tracing (software);user interface;user modeling;words per minute	Avar Pentel	2017		10.1145/3099023.3099105	user modeling;input device;human–computer interaction;user interface;keystroke dynamics;computer science	HCI	-27.60680294607145	-44.87878364689238	73260

One of the most successful and widely used approaches is collaborative filtering. Traditional collaborative filtering requires explicit user participation for providing his/her interest to the pages. However, they suffer from some limitations such as additional user effort, user behavior alteration and data sparsity. A possible alternative is to use an implicit indicator which measures the time a user spends on a page. In this paper, we propose a new collaborative filtering algorithm based on the fuzzy set theory, which is designed to better address the sharp boundary problem of discretizing the viewing time. The experimental results show that the proposed methods can achieve a better performance than the Traditional CF without time information.	algorithm;collaborative filtering;fuzzy set;personalization;set theory;sparse matrix;web page;world wide web	Chein-Shung Hwang;Yu-Pin Chen	2006		10.2991/jcis.2006.233	static web page;web modeling;data web;web mapping;computer science;collaborative filtering;web navigation;web page;semantic web stack;database;world wide web;website parse template;information retrieval;recommender system	Web+IR	-21.569317037811995	-48.452396889346296	73677

Users of these websites raise various types of technical questions, and answer them. These questions cover a wide range of domains in Computer Science like Networks, Data Mining, Multimedia, Multi-threading, Web Development, Mobile App Development, etc. Analyzing the actual textual content of these websites can help computer science and software engineering community better understand the needs of developers and learn about the current trends in technology. In this project, textual data from famous question and answer website called StackOverflow, is analyzed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling algorithm. The results show that this techniques help discover dominant topics in developer discussions. These topics are analyzed to find a number of interesting observations such as popular technology/language, impact of a technology, technology trends over time, relationship of a technology/language with other technologies and comparison of technologies addressing an area of computer science or software engineering.	algorithm;comparison of q&a sites;computer science;data mining;latent dirichlet allocation;mobile app;software engineering;stack overflow;text corpus;thread (computing);topic model;web development	Vishal Johri;Srividya Kona Bansal	2018	2018 IEEE 12th International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC)	10.1109/ICSC.2018.00078	market research;latent dirichlet allocation;topic model;resource management;web development;data science;computer science	SE	-24.935140949590675	-49.84639774650704	73759

However, IML did not process feedback information from various sensors for improving adaptability to working environments, so any task which was performed adapting to a change of the environment could not be programmed in IML. In this paper, an IML which is extended to process the force and on-off sensory information, as the sensory function of a robot, is described, and it is shown that task programming becomes easy by playing back the teaching data in the force control mode, and the user-defined command and the teaching data can be used just like the built-in system command. The effectiveness of IML was confirmed by actually making a robot perform some tasks programmed in IML.	robot	Shigeto Aramaki	1986	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/156855386X00120	programming;simulation;data processing;computer science;artificial intelligence;scientific control	Robotics	-32.98413794382356	-38.04570761726686	74147

The purpose of our research is to describe common environmental information in order to enable a robotic system to execute target tasks in a variety of ambient conditions. This system can correspond to various robots and various objects when we design the task information, which does not depend on the types and structures of these robots. In this paper, we focus on the door-closing task performed by robots among various other tasks and propose a robot control method that integrates the ambient intelligence. The effectiveness of the proposed system is experimentally confirmed using a refrigerator with two types of doors; a door status sensor, which we developed; a humanoid robot; and a mobile manipulator.	ambient intelligence;closing (morphology);experiment;humanoid robotics project;humanoid robot;internet;mobile manipulator;robot control;robot end effector;server (computing);ubiquitous computing	Takeshi Sakaguchi;Takeshi Ujiie;Shinichi Tsunoo;Kazuhito Yokoi;Kazuyoshi Wada	2009	2009 IEEE Workshop on Robotic Intelligence in Informationally Structured Space	10.1109/RIISS.2009.4937907	control engineering;mobile robot;embedded system;simulation;engineering;humanoid robot;social robot;robot control;ubiquitous robot;personal robot	Robotics	-32.37262254708256	-38.42789029603066	74802

Using human-robot interaction (HRI), this framework may be useful for ameliorating problems related to attracting and maintaining attention levels of children suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In the proposed framework, computational models including the amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and basal ganglia are used to simulate a range of cognitive processes such as emotional responses, episodic memory formation, and selection of appropriate behavioral responses. In the currently proposed model limbic system, we applied reinforcement and unsupervised learning-based adaptation processes to a dynamic neural field model, resulting in a system that was capable of observing and controlling the physical and cognitive processes of a humanoid robot. Several interaction scenarios were tested to evaluate the performance of the model. Finally, we compared the results of our methodology with a neural mass model.	artificial neuron;basal (phylogenetics);cognition;cognitive architecture;computational model;dopamine;electroencephalography;embedded system;experiment;futures studies;ganglia;h2 database engine;humanoid robot;human–robot interaction;input/output;matlab;mass effect trilogy;model of computation;neuromorphic engineering;population dynamics;reinforcement learning;robot control;simulation;systems architecture;unsupervised learning;verification and validation	Evren Daglarli;Sare Funda Daglarli;Gülay Öke Günel;Hatice Kose-Bagci	2016	Applied Intelligence	10.1007/s10489-016-0876-x	artificial intelligence	AI	-29.048732616825568	-39.43493504189043	75155
4aa50f19b5003d1601112779ba6babc1c3100730	beyond relevance: explicitly promoting novelty and diversity in tag recommendation	novelty;tag recommendation;relevance;topic diversity	The design and evaluation of tag recommendation methods has historically focused on maximizing the relevance of the suggested tags for a given object, such as a movie or a song. However, relevance by itself may not be enough to guarantee recommendation usefulness. Promoting novelty and diversity in tag recommendation not only increases the chances that the user will select “some” of the recommended tags but also promotes complementary information (i.e., tags), which helps to cover multiple aspects or topics related to the target object. Previous work has addressed the tag recommendation problem by exploiting at most two of the following aspects: (1) relevance, (2) explicit topic diversity, and (3) novelty. In contrast, here we tackle these three aspects conjointly, by introducing two new tag recommendation methods that cover all three aspects of the problem at different levels. Our first method, called Random Forest with topic-related attributes, or RFt, extends a relevance-driven tag recommender based on the Random Forest (RF) learning-to-rank method by including new tag attributes to capture the extent to which a candidate tag is related to the topics of the target object. This solution captures topic diversity as well as novelty at the attribute level while aiming at maximizing relevance in its objective function. Our second method, called Explicit Tag Recommendation Diversifier with Novelty Promotion, or xTReND, reranks the recommendations provided by any tag recommender to jointly promote relevance, novelty, and topic diversity. We use RFt as a basic recommender applied before the reranking, thus building a solution that addresses the problem at both attribute and objective levels. Furthermore, to enable the use of our solutions on applications in which category information is unavailable, we investigate the suitability of using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to automatically generate topics for objects. We evaluate all tag recommendation approaches using real data from five popular Web 2.0 applications. Our results show that RFt greatly outperforms the relevance-driven RF baseline in diversity while producing gains in relevance as well. We also find that our new xTReND reranker obtains considerable gains in both novelty and relevance when compared to that same baseline while keeping the same relevance levels. Furthermore, compared to our previous reranker method, xTReD, which does not consider novelty, xTReND is also quite effective, improving the novelty of the recommended tags while keeping similar relevance and diversity levels in most datasets and scenarios. Comparing our two new proposals, we find that xTReND considerably outperforms RFt in terms of novelty and diversity with only small losses (under 4%) in relevance. Overall, considering the trade-off among relevance, novelty, and diversity, our results demonstrate the superiority of xTReND over the baselines and the proposed alternative, RFt. Finally, the use of automatically generated latent topics as an alternative to manually labeled categories also provides significant improvements, which greatly enhances the applicability of our solutions to applications where the latter is not available.	baseline (configuration management);latent dirichlet allocation;learning to rank;loss function;optimization problem;radio frequency;random forest;recommender system;relevance;web 2.0	Fabiano Muniz Belém;Carolina S.

A survey of essential qualities for a successful EC site suggests that reduced user perceived latency is the second most important quality after good site navigation quality. The most successful approach towards reducing user perceived latency has been the extraction of path traversal patterns from past users access history to predict future user traversal behavior and to prefetch the required resources. However this approach is suited for only non-EC sites where there is no purchase behavior. In this paper we describe a new approach to predict user behavior in EC sites. The core of our approach involves extracting knowledge from integrated data of purchase and path traversal patterns of past users to predict the purchase and traversal behavior of future users. Simulations were conducted using synthetic data, which showed that the proposed model produces more accurate modeling of the user behavior.	e-commerce;requests	Sudhir Vallamkondu;Le Gruenwald	2003		10.1109/COEC.2003.1210257	e-commerce;hypertext transfer protocol;computer science;data mining;database;world wide web	HCI	-30.551641801652565	-51.18525038125849	75457
732f68bd3f2300ce4a1e55a61ea6187457589bb8	the impact of user sentiment aroused by the-day-of-the-week on the recommendation effectiveness in microblog		Microblogging has become an increasingly popular platform for users to post their views and comments online due to the ease of posting and replying. This generated an abundance of sentiment database which could be used to study the-day-of-the-week sentiment patterns of users. We adopted sentiment database to extract sentiment expressions from the posted Plurk messages to investigate whether there are sentiment fluctuations in the days of a week and if there are opportunities to use the-day-of-the-week sentiment patterns to maximize the effectiveness of sentiment-based product recommendation. The experimental results showed that users’ posts are significantly strong negative on Monday and strong positive on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. We speculate that the recommended products with positive sentiment words were more effective during Monday and Saturday because of the approach-avoidance motivation. People would usually have negative sentiment after 5 days continuous work during Friday working hours, so that recommended products with negative sentiment words are more effective. Whereas on Friday night the positive sentiment increased after off duty, and caused the recommendation products with positive sentiment words more effective. Negative sentiment on Sunday due to the coming blue Monday may cause negative sentiment recommendations more effective.

However, since the useru0027s home location is generally not publicly available, many researchers have been attempting to develop a more accurate home location estimation. In this study, we propose a method to estimate a Twitter useru0027s home location by using weather observation data from AMeDAS. In our method, we first estimate the weather of the area posted by an estimation target user by using the tweet, Next, we check out the estimated weather against weather observation data, and narrow down the area posted by the user. Finally, the useru0027s home location is estimated as which areas the user frequently posts from. In our experiments, the results indicate that our method functions effectively and also demonstrate that accuracy improves under certain conditions.	baseline (configuration management);experiment;social media	Yuki Kondo;Masatsugu Hangyo;Mitsuo Yoshida;Kyoji Umemura	2017	2017 International Conference on Advanced Informatics, Concepts, Theory, and Applications (ICAICTA)	10.1109/ICAICTA.2017.8090972	support vector machine;data mining;computer science;social media	HCI	-23.699861398916266	-44.957063453765166	76224
163dd3f380e4b8a8a1f927b0809242742f32dbab	landmark rating and selection for slam in dynamic environments		Goal-oriented acting in dynamic environments is a challenging task for a mobile robot. A fundamental problem to be solved is to map the environment during exploration. Since everyday, environments are typically not static, landmarks can occur and disappear at any time. Therefore, a SLAM approach must be able to cope with the characteristics of such environments. This work presents a multicriteria utility function to select landmarks for SLAM in dynamic environments. The landmark utility function takes into account the salience, the probability of reobservation, and the relevance for localization of a landmark. Taking into account these criteria, now enables the selection of landmarks for SLAM in dynamic environments. The performance of the approach is shown in a real-world experiment with a P3DX-platform in a living room environment.	approximation algorithm;landmark point;mixture model;mobile robot;relevance;simultaneous localization and mapping;utility	Siegfried Hochdorfer;Heiko Neumann;Christian Schlegel	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-08338-4_30	salience (language);landmark;computer vision;mobile robot;artificial intelligence;computer science	Robotics	-30.896777195962272	-41.18917368019488	76242

However, the potential for these social networks to aid in recommending items is largely ignored. We propose a recommender system that works directly with these networks to distribute and recommend items: the informal exchange of information (word of mouth communication) is supported rather than replaced. The paper describes the push-poll approach and evaluates its performance at predicting user ratings for movies against a collaborative filtering algorithm. Overall, the push-poll approach performs significantly better while being computationally efficient and suitable for dynamic domains (e.g. recommending items from RSS feeds).	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;coefficient;collaborative filtering;genetic algorithm;interaction;rss;recommender system;social network	Andrew Webster;Julita Vassileva	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-73078-1_31	computer science;data mining;multimedia;world wide web;recommender system	AI	-20.80462563553269	-47.856505625051504	76360

Environment classification is a critical technology for the CHIL Connector service [1] in that Connector relies on maintaining awareness of user state to make intelligent decisions about the optimal times, places, and methods to deal with requests for human-to-human communication. Environment is an important aspect of user state with respect to this problem; humans may be more or less able to deal with voice or text communications depending on whether they are, for instance, in an office, a car, a cafe, or a cinema. We unfortunately cannot rely on the availability of the full CHIL sensor suite when users are not in the CHIL room; hence, we are motivated to explore the use of the only sensor which is reliably available on every mobile communication device: the microphone.	acoustic cryptanalysis	Robert Malkin	2006		10.1007/978-3-540-69568-4_30	embedded system;simulation;engineering;communication	NLP	-24.736257099087283	-38.94971473607571	76426
785fe23e26cca1a3e36b141d762593cb1ab523a9	mobile devices and professional equipment synergies for sport summary production		We present a novel approach for sport video summary production that leverages the best aspects of mobile devices and professional equipment. The proposed recording set-up and workflow, consisting of both types of devices has two main advantages compared to conventional techniques. Firstly, it reduces cost of content production by reducing the cost of equipment and crew required for content capture. Secondly, it reduces the time for content production by leveraging automation. Subsequently, a tunable summary production approach is presented for creating a multi-camera representation of a salient event. Incorporating cinematic rules creates aesthetically pleasant viewing experience. Interactive production of the summary enables professional users as well as second screen device (mobile, tablet, etc.) users to create a summary, where inclusion of highly ranked salient events can be done based on the subjective viewing value. Furthermore, automation provides a framework for easy inclusion of crowdsourced content. The proposed hybrid production method is illustrated here by considering basketball as an example.	anomaly detection;automatic summarization;crowdsourcing;interactivity;mobile device;mobile phone;precision and recall;second screen;social media;synergy;tablet computer	Sujeet Mate;Igor D.

The increasing availability of online social networks provides one approach to this problem: people linked in these networks often share preferences, allowing inference of interest in products based on knowledge of a consumer’s network neighbors and their interests. This paper evaluates the benefits of inference from online social networks in two contexts: a random graph model and a web site allowing people to both express preferences and form distinct social and preference links. We determine conditions on network topology and preference correlations leading to extended clusters of people with similar interests. Knowledge of when such clusters occur improves the usefulness of social network-based inference for identifying products likely to interest consumers based on information from a few people in the network. Such estimates could help sellers design customized bundles of products and improve combinatorial auctions for complementary products.	e-commerce;network topology;random graph;social network	Tad Hogg	2010	Electronic Commerce Research and Applications	10.1016/j.elerap.2009.04.006	e-commerce;network science;social science;combinatorial auction;computer science;marketing;advertising;world wide web;network topology;commerce;social network	ECom	-19.938462515980724	-44.60875420490644	76983
41bbc1687f6b1ffeaa4077a347300ea1c37ad1c1	two-layer recommendation-based real time bidding (rtb)		Real-time bidding (RTB) has recently become the predominant technique in online advertising. Although, RTB is very effective, compared to classical approaches, a lot can be done to improve the accuracy of display advertising. In fact, a major drawback of existing RTB systems is the use of the bidding price and the current user profile as the primary features to display advertising. However, in doing so, the user may not always get the appropriate ad, and the same ad may be presented several times to the same user, which leads to its frustration. To overcome this limitation, we propose in this paper, an approach to serve the right ad to the right user at the right time. Our approach consists of incorporating the notion of recommender systems into the RTB architecture. Specifically, we design a two-layer approach. The first layer implements the item-based collaboratif filtering technique, while the second layer implements the factorization machines model. This allows to capture and use the information of other users (more specifically, those who are similar to the current user) to enhance the accuracy of display advertising. We show how these two layers collaborate to reach our goal, and validate our approach through an experimental study.	collaborative filtering;digital signal processor;display advertising;ecosystem;experiment;online advertising;real-time bidding;real-time transcription;recommender system;user profile	Keonho Son;Karim Benouaret;Djamal Benslimane;Salim Berbar	2018	2018 IEEE 27th International Conference on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises (WETICE)	10.1109/WETICE.2018.00024	online advertising;recommender system;real-time bidding;computer science;distributed computing;architecture;display advertising;bidding;frustration;user profile	SE	-24.559653057041128	-47.28780762112843	77208
b84ffbbdc5675aabdd08f0f80c97b2149a6d2bb1	expediting exploration by attribute-to-feature mapping for cold-start recommendations		The item cold-start problem is inherent to collaborative filtering (CF) recommenders where items and users are represented by vectors in a latent space. It emerges since CF recommenders rely solely on historical user interactions to characterize their item inventory. As a result, an effective serving of new and trendy items to users may be delayed until enough user feedback is received, thus, reducing both users' and content suppliers' satisfaction. To mitigate this problem, many commercial recommenders apply random exploration and devote a small portion of their traffic to explore new items and gather interactions from random users. Alternatively, content or context information is combined into the CF recommender, resulting in a hybrid system. Another hybrid approach is to learn a mapping between the item attribute space and the CF latent feature space, and use it to characterize the new items providing initial estimates for their latent vectors.  In this paper, we adopt the attribute-to-feature mapping approach to expedite random exploration of new items and present LearnAROMA - an advanced algorithm for learning the mapping, previously proposed in the context of classification. In particular, LearnAROMA learns a Gaussian distribution over the mapping matrix. Numerical evaluation demonstrates that this learning technique achieves more accurate initial estimates than logistic regression methods. We then consider a random exploration setting, in which new items are further explored as user interactions arrive. To leverage the initial latent vector estimates with the incoming interactions, we propose DynamicBPR - an algorithm for updating the new item latent vectors without retraining the CF model. Numerical evaluation reveals that DynamicBPR achieves similar accuracy as a CF model trained on all the ratings, using 71% less exploring users than conventional random exploration.	algorithm;cold start;collaborative filtering;feature vector;hybrid system;interaction;logistic regression;recommender system	Deborah Cohen;Michal Aharon;Yair Koren;Oren Somekh;Raz Nissim	2017		10.1145/3109859.3109880	expediting;leverage (finance);machine learning;collaborative filtering;artificial intelligence;recommender system;data mining;retraining;logistic regression;hybrid system;computer science;feature vector	AI	-19.222816651006642	-49.61997108767099	77334

However, till date, there has been no method to automatically capture fine-grained social interactions between people and utilize it to better model the diffusion process. In this paper, we describe the use of socially-aware mobile phones to capture face-to-face interactions and music diffusion for eighty-percent of the residents of an undergraduate dormitory. We show that observations of diffusion can be used as an `active probe’ to parse the network structure and the type of relationship between nodes more accurately than with ‘passive’ mobile sensor data alone. We propose that automatically captured social interactions can be used to create more accurate quantitative models of real-world diffusion and influence.	context-aware pervasive systems;dyadic transformation;expect;group cohesiveness;interaction;mobile phone;parsing;social network	Anmol Madan;Alex Pentland	2009			machine learning;artificial intelligence;simulation;human–computer interaction;social computing;mobile phone;social relation;reality mining;social consciousness;computer science;social network;diffusion process;sociological theory of diffusion	HCI	-21.80411738789626	-42.53905983534248	77366

The field encountered its first revolution when it started to deal with huge amounts of Web pages. Then, a major step was accomplished when engines started to consider the structure of the Web graph and link analysis became a differentiator in both crawling and ranking. Finally, a more discrete, but not less critical step, was made when search engines started to monitor and mine the numerous (mostly implicit) signals provided by users while interacting with the search engine. We focus here on this third """"revolution"""" of large scale usage data. We detail the different shapes it takes, illustrating its benefits through a review of some winning search features that could not have been possible without it. We also discuss its limitations and how in some cases it even conflicts with some natural users' aspirations such as personalization and privacy. We conclude by discussing how some of these conflicts can be circumvented by using adequate aggregation principles to create """"ad hoc"""" crowds."""	usage data;web search engine	Ricardo A.

124906f9673924c85c31e26a577ae319b2495857	idetector: automate underground forum analysis based on heterogeneous information network		Online underground forums have been widely used by cybercriminals to trade the illicit products, resources and services, which have played a central role in the cybercrim-inal ecosystem. Unfortunately, due to the number of forums, their size, and the expertise required, it's infeasible to perform manual exploration to understand their behavioral processes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named iDetector to automate the analysis of underground forums for the detection of cybercrime-suspected threads. In iDetector, to detect whether the given threads are cybercrime-suspected threads, we not only analyze the content in the threads, but also utilize the relations among threads, users, replies, and topics. To model this kind of rich semantic relationships (i.e., thread-user, thread-reply, thread-topic, reply-user and reply-topic relations), we introduce a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN) for representation, which is capable to be composed of different types of entities and relations. To capture the complex relationships (e.g., two threads are relevant if they were posted by the same user and discussed the same topic), we use a meta-structure based approach to characterize the semantic relatedness over threads. As different meta-structures depict the relatedness over threads at different views, we then build a classifier using Laplacian scores to aggregate different similarities formulated by different meta-structures to make predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use structural HIN to automate underground forum analysis. Comprehensive experiments on real data collections from underground forums (e.g., Hack Forums) are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our developed system iDetector in cybercrime-suspected thread detection by comparisons with other alternative methods.	aggregate data;artificial intelligence;cybercrime;ecosystem;entity;experiment;semantic similarity;similarity measure;statistical classification;underground	Yiming Zhang;Yujie Fan;Shifu Hou;Jian Liu;Yanfang Ye;Thirimachos Bourlai	2018	2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)	10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508414	machine learning;semantic similarity;data mining;thread (computing);artificial intelligence;computer science	DB	-24.631083000249934	-51.24244725859897	77603

The essence is that each object is perceived by its affordances (graspable, moveable, etc), instead of its properties (color, size, etc). Previous work mainly associates an affordance to a primitive or reactive action of single robot, and the whole task is finished after that action has been executed. However, robots often need to cooperate in tasks such as rescue and exploration, where the perceived information could be shared to match affordances between the robots and objects. As far as we are concerned, this paper is the first one to carry out affordance research in multi-robot. This paper proposes a new definition and formalization for the affordance in multi-robot, and describes a robot in terms of its capabilities which are more affordance-oriented. In the simulation experiment, two robots with different capabilities could share the perceived information to match affordances, and the work efficiency is higher than the non-affordance approach.	color;encode;match moving;regular expression;robot;simulation	Chang'an Yi;Huaqing Min;Ronghua Luo	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2015.7414625	statistical classification;mobile robot;computer vision;navigation;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;social robot;robot control;robot kinematics	Robotics	-31.29575300316666	-39.66949327733213	77659

This applies to content being permanently available like videos of online video services as well as broadcast content like in the TV or radio domain. A promising solution for this problem is personalization. In the context of this paper, we refer to the selection and recommendation of content with respect to user's interests and preferences as personalization. These recommendations can either be presented to the user herself or be further used by services like a personalized electronic program guide (EPG) in the TV domain or for automated and personalized selection of content of online video services.  This paper introduces an approach to personalize digital multimedia content based on user profile information. For this, two main mechanisms were developed: a profile generator that automatically creates user profiles representing the user preferences, and a content-based recommendation algorithm that estimates the user's interest in unknown content by matching her profile to metadata descriptions of the content. Both features are integrated into a personalization system.	algorithm;eye tracking;personalization;precision and recall;prototype;systems architecture;usability testing;user (computing);user profile;video clip	Diana Weiß;Johannes Scheuerer;Michael Wenleder;Alexander Erk;Mark Gülbahar;Claudia Linnhoff-Popien	2008		10.1145/1413634.1413687	computer science;personalization;profiling;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;recommender system	Web+IR	-28.136491186583143	-51.004870443765746	77821

These sites often contain overwhelming amounts of information that are also being updated rapidly. To help users locate their interests at such sites (e.g., interesting blogs to read or discussion forums to join), researchers have developed a number of recommendation technologies. However, it is difficult to make effective recommendations for new users (a.k.a. the cold start problem) due to a lack of user information (e.g., preferences and interests). Furthermore, the complexity of recommendation algorithms often prevents users from comprehending let alone trusting the recommended results. To tackle these above two challenges, we are building a social map-based recommender system called Pharos. A social map summarizes users’ content-related social behavior over time (e.g., reading, writing, and commenting behavior during the past week) as a set of latent communities. For a given time interval, each community is characterized by the theme of the content being discussed and the key people involved. By discovering, ranking, and displaying the most popular latent communities at different time intervals, Pharos creates a time-sensitive, visual social map of a Web site. This enables new users to obtain a quick overview of the site, alleviating the cold start problem. Furthermore, we use the social map as a context to help explain Pharos-recommended content and people. Users can also interactively explore the social map to locate the content in which they are interested or people that are not being explicitly recommended, compensating for the imperfections in the recommendation algorithms. We have developed several Pharos applications, one of which is deployed within our company. Our preliminary evaluation of the deployed application shows the usefulness of Pharos.	algorithm;blog;cold start;interactive media;join (sql);recommender system;trust (emotion)	Shiwan Zhao;Michelle X.

07835544850b06221b019bb9be7f8836129f0cd5	tag tree creation of social image for personalized recommendation		The tags are usually tagged by different users in social image sharing websites, which can indicate image semantic information and imply user's preference. Therefore, the tags can contribute to personalized recommendation of social image. However, the present social image tags models only consider single tag, resulting in the relationships among tags are ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel method to create tag tree of social image for personalized recommendation. Firstly, the tag ranking is realized to remove noisy tags. Then, the first layer tags are selected from re-ranked tags lists. To sufficiently express tag's significances, the tag subtrees can be created based on different image categories and combined with first layer tags to create tag tree. Finally, the personalized recommendation of social image is achieved by using tag tree. Experimental results show that our tag tree can effectively express the relationships among tags as well as obtain satisfactory results in personalized recommendation of social image.	personalization;tree (data structure)	Ying Yang;Jing Zhang;Jihong Liu;Jiafeng Li;Li Zhuo	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	10.1109/ICIP.2017.8296665	computer science;information retrieval;image sharing;computational linguistics;data mining;ranking	HCI	-21.931603569040814	-47.445894348105895	78579

A good understanding of usage characteristics of such systems is necessary to improve the design of current and next generation of tagging systems. To this end, this work explores three aspects of user behavior in CiteULike and Connotea, two systems that include tagging features to support online personalized management of scientific publications. First, this study characterizes the degree to which users re-tag previously published items and reuse tags: 10 to 20% of the daily activity can be characterized as re-tagging and about 75% of the activity as tag reuse. Second, we use the pairwise similarity between users' activity to characterize the interest sharing in the system. We present the interest sharing distribution across the system, show that this metric encodes information about existing usage patterns, and attempt to correlate interest sharing levels to indicators of collaboration such as co-membership in discussion groups and semantic similarity of tag vocabularies. Finally, we show that interest sharing leads to an implicit structure that exhibit a natural segmentation. Throughout the paper we discuss the potential impact of our findings on the design of mechanisms that support tagging systems.	focus group;next-generation network;personalization;scientific literature;semantic similarity;tag (metadata);vocabulary	Elizeu Santos-Neto;David Condon;Nazareno Andrade;Adriana Iamnitchi;Matei Ripeanu	2009		10.1145/1557914.1557947	semantic similarity;null model;social behavior;computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	HCI	-26.699279998671276	-48.56061462986625	78589

Understanding these new exploration behaviors is crucial for the development of efficient techniques for processing, coding, delivering and rendering omnidirectional content to offer the highest possible Quality of Experience (QoE). Progress has already been made on visual attention (VA) modeling for 360° content. In this paper we briefly review the current status of research on this topic that led us to propose a benchmarking platform for evaluating and comparing the performance of models for saliency and scanpath prediction for 360° content.

In this context, it is normal to assume that some of the measures collected are having an effect on other measures, potentially with some delay (or “lag”) in the effect. Such delay in the effect may even vary over time, making the identification of the effect difficult. In this paper, we present our initial ideas on a simple analysis method for such situation, in which peaks from the two time series in question are analyzed, and similar ones are	software metric;software repository;time series	Josée Tassé	2015		10.18293/SEKE2015-42	data science;software metric;computer science;software;lag;data mining	SE	-23.911658107952388	-38.16946980701238	78791
cd5a8d53b513ba396c9e850c1a3714e994f88e3a	trust prediction with propagation and similarity regularization		Online social networks have been used for a variety of rich activities in recent years, such as investigating potential employees and seeking recommendations of high quality services and service providers. In such activities, trust is one of the most critical factors for the decisionmaking of users. In the literature, the state-of-the-art trust prediction approaches focus on either dispositional trust tendency and propagated trust of the pair-wise trust relationships along a path or the similarity of trust rating values. However, there are other influential factors that should be taken into account, such as the similarity of the trust rating distributions. In addition, tendency, propagated trust and similarity are of different types, as either personal properties or interpersonal properties. But the difference has been neglected in existing models. Therefore, in trust prediction, it is necessary to take all the above factors into consideration in modeling, and process them separately and differently. In this paper we propose a new trust prediction model based on trust decomposition and matrix factorization, considering all the above influential factors and differentiating both personal and interpersonal properties. In this model, we first decompose trust into trust tendency and tendency-reduced trust. Then, based on tendencyreduced trust ratings, matrix factorization with a regularization term is leveraged to predict the tendencyreduced values of missing trust ratings, incorporating both propagated trust and the similarity of users’ rating habits. In the end, the missing trust ratings are composed with predicted tendency-reduced values and trust tendency values. Experiments conducted on a realworld dataset illustrate significant improvement delivered by our approach in trust prediction accuracy over the state-of-the-art approaches.	display resolution;experiment;matrix regularization;social network;software propagation;the matrix;ws-trust	Xiaoming Zheng;Yan Wang;Mehmet A.

First, we show how distance estimation can be improved autonomously. We consider our approach to be autonomous because the robot learns to accurately estimate distance without a human teacher providing the distances to training targets. We find that actions that, in principle, do not alter the robot's distance to the target are a powerful tool for exposing estimation errors. These errors can be used to train a distance estimator. Furthermore, the simple action used (i.e., neck rotation) does not require high level cognitive processing or fine motor skill. Next, we investigate how interaction with humans can further improve visual distance estimates. We find that human interaction can improve distance estimates for far targets outside of the robot's peripersonal space. This is accomplished by extending our autonomous approach above to integrate additional information provided by a human. Together these experiments suggest that both action and interaction are important tools for improving perceptual estimates.	autonomous agent;autonomous robot;binocular vision;cognition;experiment;high-level programming language;humanoid robot;interactivity;randomness	Timothy Arthur Mann;Yunjung Park;Sungmoon Jeong;Minho Lee;Yoonsuck Choe	2013	IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development	10.1109/TAMD.2012.2216524	human–robot interaction;mobile robot;computer vision;simulation;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;social robot;estimation theory;communication	Robotics	-31.325317698385557	-40.606033634719815	79242
3c9ce6e184f1c31adcc118f92b0386b2909d9a0f	topic-constrained influence maximization in social networks		Understanding the spread of influence and maximizing it through online social networks lead to gain a lot of benefits for various practical applications such as viral marketing, personalized recommendation, cascade detection, and information monitoring. However, most existing studies have commonly concentrated on models of social influence propagation without considering information of individuals' interests and experiences, whereas influence and adoption are in fact evidently topic-dependent. Therefore, in this paper, we incorporate topical aspect with the analysis of social influence. We propose the topic-constrained influence maximization model that aims to accurately describe real-world cascades. Particularly, we first introduce a graph clustering-based topic modeling technique to extract topics of textual content associated with each user in the network. For a given topic, we consider user-to-user interactions concerning that topic and further estimate inter-personal influence likelihoods over the network before invoking influence propagation using a standard greedy-based algorithm. Experimental results conducted on real Twitter data show that the proposed approach explores promising efforts for topic-dependent cascades with significantly higher performance than state-of-the-art methods.	cluster analysis;expectation–maximization algorithm;experience;greedy algorithm;interaction;personalization;social network;software propagation;topic model	Bundit Manaskasemsak;Rattana Phuangpanya;Arnon Rungsawang	2017		10.1145/3162957.3162997	topic model;viral marketing;machine learning;clustering coefficient;social network;social influence;maximization;computer science;artificial intelligence	AI	-19.21347650123158	-45.95901792213242	79552

Robots can help people by gathering and arranging information intelligently instead of people themselves. Our prototyping system called Kappa III is an office work assistant robot that can tell people location of daily goods in office. It firstly looks around to capture images of desks in order to remember what and where such goods. Then it can identify them by cutting them out from the background and categorizing them by color, shape, and figure. People can ask it to take goods in office by either specifying names or features such as color.

In order to judge the validity of information, it is important to know how trustworthy its creator is. Since no individual can have direct knowledge of more than a small fraction of information authors, methods for inferring trust are needed. We propose a new trust inference scheme based on the idea that a trust network can be viewed as a random graph, and a chain of trust as a path in that graph. In addition to having an intuitive interpretation, our algorithm has several advantages, noteworthy among which is the creation of an inferred trust-metric space where the shorter the distance between two people, the higher their trust. Metric spaces have rigorous algorithms for clustering, visualization, and related problems, any of which is directly applicable to our results.	algorithm;chain of trust;cluster analysis;random graph;trust (emotion);trust metric;world wide web	Thomas DuBois;Jennifer Golbeck;Aravind Srinivasan	2009	2009 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology	10.1109/WI-IAT.2009.109	random graph;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;data mining;world wide web;intelligent agent	DB	-20.562326417441465	-44.97999257307098	79622

While there are different ways of approximating this conditional probability, the expression is generally taken to refer to the frequency of co-occurrence of items in the same basket, or other user-specific item lists, rather than being seen as the co-occurrence of χj with χi as a proportion of all other items bought alongside χi. This paper proposes a probabilistic calculus for the calculation of conditionals based on item rather than basket counts. The proposed method has the consequence that items bough together as part of small baskets are more predictive of each other than if they co-occur in large baskets. Empirical results suggests that this may result in better take-up of personalised recommendations.	recommender system;statistical model	Ming Li;M. Benjamin Dias;Wael El-Deredy;Paulo J. G.

The network is effective as a model for contemporary inter-working terrorists where large hub persons do not exist. Absense of large hub persons results in that the observed communication flow is also homogeneous. Clues regarding invisible relevant persons are hardly found in communication records. This task is, therefore, generally difficult. We demonstrate that our algorithm identifies the portion of the market baskets representing communication records, where invisible relevant persons are likely to be hidden, with good precision.	algorithm;computer simulation;sensor;social network;traffic flow (computer networking);usb hub	Yoshiharu Maeno;Kiichi Ito;Yukio Ohsawa	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-72590-9_10	computer simulation;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;social network	AI	-19.32260716803009	-42.34221371583719	80737
7074c7e903edb3d02a7661bee0ab5b10621724c5	improving daily deals recommendation using explore-then-exploit strategies	armed bandit setting;daily deals sites;recommender systems	Daily-Deals Sites (DDSs) enable local businesses, such as restaurants and stores, to promote their products and services and to increase their sales by offering customers significantly reduced prices. If a customer finds a relevant deal in the catalog of electronic coupons, she can purchase it and the DDS receives a commission. Thus, offering relevant deals to customers maximizes the profitability of the DDS. An immediate strategy, therefore, would be to apply existing recommendation algorithms to suggest deals that are potentially relevant to specific customers, enabling more appealing, effective and personalized catalogs. However, this strategy may be innocuous because (1) most of the customers are sporadic bargain hunters, and thus past preference data is extremely sparse, (2) deals have a short living period, and thus data is extremely volatile, and (3) customers’ taste and interest may undergo temporal drifts. In order to address such a particularly challenging scenario, we propose a new algorithm for daily deals recommendation based on an explore-then-exploit strategy. Basically, we choose a fraction of the customers to gather feedback on the current catalog in the exploration phase, and the remaining customers to receive improved recommendations based on the previously gathered feedback in a posterior exploitation phase. During exploration, a co-purchase network structure is updated with customer feedback (i.e., the purchases of the day), and during exploitation the updated network is used to enrich the recommendation algorithm. An advantage of our approach is that it is agnostic to the underlying recommender algorithm. Using real data obtained from a large DDS in Brazil, we show that the way in which we split customers into exploration and exploitation impacts by large the effectiveness of the recommendations. We evaluate different splitting strategies based on network centrality metrics and show that our approach offers gains in mean average precision and mean reciprocal rank ranging from 14 to 34 % when applied on top of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.	a/b testing;algorithm;bargain buddy;centrality;deal of the day;experiment;feedback;interaction;personalization;purchasing;recommender system;sparse matrix	Anísio Lacerda;Rodrygo L.

Platforms like Wikipedia act as information conduits through which informational elements (e.g. topic pages) cater to the information seeking needs of users worldwide. While usage data from these informational elements help us to predict the information seeking behavior of users, especially in reaction to external news events, what has been largely ignored in past literature is the predictive value of the underlying informational network that connects these elements. In this study, we uncover causal linkages in information seeking behavior among related informational elements on Wikipedia. We demonstrate that incorporating this causal information leads to better predictions of page view counts of relevant Wikipedia pages, when compared to models that ignore such underlying causal linkages. We also provide additional evidence about the efficacy of our approach from the real world, by performing a judgment study with human annotators. This research is among the first to investigate and uncover the value of understanding the underlying relationships among informational elements.	causal filter;causality;information seeking behavior;information source;internet;page view;usage data;wikipedia	Prasanta Bhattacharya;Rishabh Mehrotra	2016		10.1145/2854946.2854974	computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-21.22351262980171	-43.65962840661348	80940

Take the Last.fm for example (which is a popular music sharing website), users with common interests can join groups where they can share and discuss their loved songs. However, since the number of groups grows over time, users often need effective group recommendation (also called affiliation or community recommendation) in order to meet like-minded users. In this paper, based on the matrix factorization mechanism, we have investigated how to improve the accuracy of group recommendation by fusing other potentially useful information resources. Particulary, we adopt the collective factorization model to incorporate the user-item preference data, and the similarity-integrated regularization model to fuse the friendship data. The experiment on two real-world datasets (namely Last.fm and Douban) shows the outperforming impact of the chosen models relative to others on addressing the data sparsity problem and enhancing the algorithm’s accuracy. Moreover, the experimental results identify that the user-item preference data can be more effective than the friendship in terms of benefiting the group recommendation.	algorithm;amiga enhanced chip set;file sharing;last.fm;latent variable;matrix regularization;similarity measure;social media;sparse matrix;the matrix;unified framework	Wei Zeng;Li Chen	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-38577-3_37	computer science;artificial intelligence;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-19.460348423781497	-47.14530031561562	81787

Our approach aims to provide personalization in web search engines by coupling data mining techniques with the underlying semantics of the web content. To this purpose, we exploit reference ontologies that emerge from web catalogs (such as ODP - Open Directory Project), which can scale to the growth of the web. Our methodology uses ontologies to provide the semantic profiling of users’ interests, based on the implicit logging of their behavior and the on-the-fly semantic analysis and annotation of the web results summaries. Experimental evaluation of our approach shows that the objectives expected from semantic users’ clustering in search engines are achievable.	ontology (information science);personalization	John D.

c68c5c969b7a6e32584ddc44ba0fca398c310f66	an association based approach to propagate social trust in social networks	social networks	The behaviour based trust models generally compute social trust using interactions of a member with other members, referred to as “friends”. These models largely ignore the interactions of friends with their friends, referred to as “friendship effects”. Results from social studies and behavioural science show that friends have a significant influence on the behaviour of the members in the community. Following the famous Spanish proverb on friendship “Tell Me Your Friends and I Will Tell You Who You Are”, we extend our behaviour based trust model by incorporating the “friendship effect”. In this paper, we present a trust propagation model based on associations which combines the behaviour of both individual members and their friends. The propagation of trust in our model depends on three key factors: the density of interactions, the degree of separation and the decay of friendship effect. We evaluate our model using a real dataset and make observations on what happens in a social network with models with and without trust propagation. We report the results in this paper.	interaction;six degrees of separation;social network;software propagation;trust metric	Surya Nepal;Sanat Kumar Bista;Cécile Paris	2012			friendship;social psychology;political science;social network;behavioural sciences;social studies	AI	-19.72389833610016	-42.882140860878664	82065
fdbcb99fb7ebc5be1108eaff1c01d70ae399a197	private attribute inference from facebook's public text metadata: a case study of korean users		Purpose – As the number of users on social network services (SNSs) continues to increase at a remarkable rate, privacy and security issues are consistently arising. Although users may not want to disclose their private attributes, these can be inferred from their public behavior on social media. In order to investigate the severity of the leakage of private information in this manner, the purpose of this paper is to present a method to infer undisclosed personal attributes of users based only on the data available on their public profiles on Facebook. Design/methodology/approach – Facebook profile data consisting of 32 attributes were collected for 111,123 Korean users. Inferences were made for four private attributes (gender, age, marital status, and relationship status) based on five machine learning-based classification algorithms and three regression algorithms. Findings – Experimental results showed that users’ gender can be inferred very accurately, whereas marital status and relationship status can be predicted more accurately with the authors’ algorithms than with a random model. Moreover, the average difference between the actual and predicted ages of users was only 0.5 years. The results show that some private attributes can be easily inferred from only a few pieces of user profile information, which can jeopardize personal information and may increase the risk to dignity. Research limitations/implications – In this paper, the authors’ only utilized each user’s own profile data, especially text information. Since users in SNSs are directly or indirectly connected, inference performance can be improved if the profile data of the friends of a given user are additionally considered. Moreover, utilizing non-text profile information, such as profile images, can help increase inference accuracy. The authors’ can also provide a more generalized inference performance if a larger data set of Facebook users is available. Practical implications – A private attribute leakage alarm system based on the inference model would be helpful for users not desirous of the disclosure of their private attributes on SNSs. SNS service providers can measure and monitor the risk of privacy leakage in their system to protect their users and optimize the target marketing based on the inferred information if users agree to use it. Originality/value – This paper investigates whether private attributes of SNS users can be inferred with a few pieces of publicly available information although users are not willing to disclose them. The experimental results showed that gender, age, marital status, and relationship status, can be inferred by machine-learning algorithms. Based on these results, an early warning system was designed to help both service providers and users to protect the users’ privacy.	algorithm;machine learning;personally identifiable information;social media;social network;spectral leakage;user profile	Daeseon Choi;Younho Lee;Seokhyun Kim;Pilsung Kang	2017	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/IMDS-07-2016-0276		HCI	-21.383370639019873	-50.70578492237469	82286

Patterns are important for site administrators in revising Web sites but are difficult to find empirically. We propose a method for detecting such patterns.  The first step in the method is viewing a Web site as a directed graph, and identifying pages that have the same substructure by the Anti-Foundation Axiom (AFA). The AFA is a non-standard set theory that allows for a circular structure. The pages identified by AFA are divided into connected components. Then, meaningful sets of pages are selected as patterns by using the Galois lattice of the binary relation between the pages and the connected components.  We apply our method to three actual Web sites and succeed in detecting patterns within the target sites.	alternating finite automaton;connected component (graph theory);directed graph;formal concept analysis;sensor;set theory	Ikumi Horie;Kazunori Yamaguchi;Kenji Kashiwabara	2007		10.1145/1316902.1316921	connected component;directed graph;link analysis;machine learning;binary relation;data mining;set theory	ML	-21.539862022846233	-39.350286873807555	82345

These systems have been incorporated into applications ranging from e-commerce to leisure, successfully enhancing user experience. Moreover, recommender systems are now being applied to a wider diversity of emerging context applications on the Internet including social media and online platforms for communities. In this study, we present a novel collaborative filtering recommender system model. This model differentiates from other recommender system models in that it utilizes two aggregation operators, namely OWA and uninorm, to compute similarity degrees between users. We demonstrate the application of the proposed model by integrating it in the HARMONISE platform for communities in the Urban Resilience domain. The application example illustrates how the proposed model of collaborative filtering recommender system can predict content of interest to users in the platform, based not only on user preferences but also on features of their user profile.	collaborative filtering;cyber resilience;e-commerce;recommender system;social media;user (computing);user experience;user profile	Iván Palomares;Fiona Browne;Hui Wang;Peadar Davis	2015	2015 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Knowledge Engineering (ISKE)	10.1109/ISKE.2015.36	computer science;knowledge management;collaborative filtering;multimedia;world wide web;recommender system	Web+IR	-22.22271602642918	-41.916664876767435	82357

Newest information is accessible in this social web service through a large volume of real-time tweets. Tweets are short and they are more informative when they are coupled with URLs. Due to tweet overload in Twitter, we believe that an accurate URL recommender system is a beneficial tool for information seekers. In this paper, we focus on a neighborhood-based recommender system that recommends URLs to Twitter users. We consider one of the major elements of tweets, hashtags, as topic representatives of URLs in our approach. We propose methods for incorporating hashtags in measuring the relevancy of URLs. Our experiments show that our neighborhood-based recommender system outperforms the matrix factorizationbased system significantly. We also show that the accuracy of URL recommendation in Twitter is time-dependent. A higher recommendation accuracy is obtained when more recent data is provided for recommendation. c © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	aggregate data;blog;collaborative filtering;experiment;hashtag;information;real-time web;recommender system;relevance;singular value decomposition;the matrix;web service	Nazpar Yazdanfar;Alex Thomo	2013		10.1016/j.procs.2013.06.056	semantic url;computer science;machine learning;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web;information retrieval;recommender system	ML	-23.63495212745748	-49.65658973884456	82383

Stability is a desired property of recommendation algorithms and has important implications on users' trust and acceptance of recommendations. Prior research has reported that some popular recommendation algorithms can suffer from a high degree of instability. In this study we propose a scalable, general-purpose iterative smoothing approach that can be used in conjunction with different traditional recommendation algorithms to improve their stability. Our experimental results on real-world rating data demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve substantially higher stability as compared to the original recommendation algorithms. Importantly, the proposed approach not only does not sacrifice the predictive accuracy in order to improve recommendation stability, but is actually able to provide additional accuracy improvements at the same time.	algorithm;general-purpose modeling;instability;iterative method;recommender system;scalability;smoothing	Gediminas Adomavicius;Jingjing Zhang	2012				AI	-20.207167116292123	-48.77630518351111	82667
41e3dc088feef04296791600c51e9cde3f828386	content-centric flow mining for influence analysis in social streams	flow mining;influence analysis;content analysis;social streams	The problem of discovering information flow trends and influencers in social networks has become increasingly relevant both because of the increasing amount of content available from online networks in the form of social streams, and because of its relevance as a tool for content trends analysis. An important part of this analysis is to determine the key patterns of flow and corresponding influencers in the underlying network. Almost all the work on influence analysis has focused on fixed models of the network structure, and edge-based transmission between nodes. In this paper, we propose a fully content-centered model of flow analysis in social network streams, in which the analysis is based on actual content transmissions in the network, rather than a static model of transmission on the edges. First, we introduce the problem of information flow mining in social streams, and then propose a novel algorithm InFlowMine to discover the information flow patterns in the network. We then leverage this approach to determine the key influencers in the network. Our approach is flexible, since it can also determine topic-specific influencers. We experimentally show the effectiveness and efficiency of our model.	algorithm;data-flow analysis;experiment;information flow (information theory);relevance;semantic network;social network;software propagation	Karthik Subbian;Charu C.

Multimedia search becomes more important and challenging, as users demand higher retrieval quality. To achieve this goal, multimedia search needs to take users' personalized information into consideration. Collaborative tagging systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags, which provide a simple but powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social media. The user profiles obtained from collaborative tagging systems should be very useful for resource retrieval. In this paper, we propose a new method to model user profiles and resource profiles from wider perspectives and apply them to personalized resource search in a collaborative tagging environment. We implement a prototype system named as FMRS. Experiments in FMRS show that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods.	user profile	Yi Cai;Qing Li;Haoran Xie;Lijuan Yu	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-17616-6_45	social media;computer science;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval	AI	-27.235609540614725	-50.626085618679014	83030
d7e52a6a53147077183260a4ad029a75ab8e9e87	identifying users with alternate behaviors of lurking and active participation in multilayer social networks		With the growing complexity of scenarios relating to online social networks (OSNs), there is an emergence of effective models and methods for understanding the characteristics and dynamics of multiple interconnected types of user relations. Profiles on different OSNs belonging to the same user can be linked using the multilayer structure, opening to unprecedented opportunities for user behavior analysis in a complex system. In this paper, we leverage the importance of studying the dichotomy between information-producers (contributors) and information-consumers (lurkers), and their interplay over a multilayer network, in order to effectively analyze such different roles a user may take on different OSNs. In this respect, we address the novel problem of identification and characterization of opposite behaviors that users may alternately exhibit over multiple layers of a complex network. We propose the first ranking method for alternate lurker-contributor behaviors on a multilayer OSN, dubbed mlALCR. Performance of mlALCR has been assessed quantitatively as well as qualitatively, and comparatively against methods designed for ranking either contributors or lurkers, on four real-world multilayer networks. Empirical evidence shows the significance and uniqueness of mlALCR in being able to mine alternate lurker-contributor behaviors over different layer networks.	assortativity;centrality;complex network;complex system;emergence;gradient;lurker;mathematical optimization;multilayer perceptron;social network	Diego Perna;Roberto Interdonato;Andrea Tagarelli	2018	IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems	10.1109/TCSS.2017.2762730	machine learning;complex system;artificial intelligence;uniqueness;complex system;complex network;knowledge engineering;computer science;social network;empirical evidence;ranking	Metrics	-19.231695424917145	-41.878569226144634	83071

The difficulty for people to understand how robots work and how they must be controlled will be one of the mains limit for broad robotics. In this paper, we study a new way of interacting with robots without needing to understand how robots work or to give them explicit instructions. This work is based on psychological data showing that synchronization and rhythm are very important features for pleasant interaction. We propose a biologically inspired architecture using rhythm detection to build an internal reward for learning. After showing the results of keyboard interactions, we present and discuss the results of real human-robots (Aibo and Nao) interactions. We show that our minimalist control architecture allows the discovery and learning of arbitrary sensorimotor associations games with expert users. With nonexpert users, we show that using only the rhythm information is not sufficient for learning all the associations due to the different strategies used by the human. Nevertheless, this last experiment shows that the rhythm is still allowing the discovery of subsets of associations, being one of the promising signal of tomorrow social applications.	aibo;artificial intelligence;autonomous robot;categorization;experiment;framing (world wide web);gene regulatory network;hoc (programming language);human–robot interaction;learning rule;robot;robotics	Pierre Andry;Arnaud J.

86ecb725942e6af71dcfd408c6a433b1a1060107	sr-lda: mining effective representations for generating service ecosystem knowledge maps		As the quantity of Web services grow continuously, it becomes more challenging for developers to navigate through and make use of them. Thus, a knowledge map consisting of a summary of individual services and their relations has become increasingly useful. There are two challenges in building such a knowledge graph for Web service ecosystems. First, services keep evolving in terms of function and usage pattern, while their descriptions typically remain static and obsolete. Second, service profiles usually comprise some common background terms which do not differentiate services. To address the two challenges, we developed a novel tailored topic model, named Service Representation-LDA (SR-LDA), to mine effective representations beyond service profiles to build a knowledge map. The key idea is to incorporate mashup descriptions as an indication of service evolution, and introduce a global filter to identify and filter out background terms. Extensive experiments show that the tailored model is more effective than baselines. The methodology of building knowledge maps for the real-world ProgrammableWeb service ecosystem based on the learned representations is also presented, together with the analyses of representative functionality patterns.	baseline (configuration management);cognition;cognitive map;ecosystem;experiment;knowledge graph;knowledge management;local-density approximation;mashup (web application hybrid);programmableweb;topic model;web service;world wide web	Bing Bai;Yushun Fan;Wei Tan;Jia Zhang	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)	10.1109/SCC.2017.23	mashup;web service;data mining;baseline (configuration management);topic model;computer science;graph	Web+IR	-26.8121228469853	-50.77044161997147	84133

While at the same time users may easily lost in the information space of a large number of goods and can’t successfully find their own needed goods. In order to meet the needs of users in this area, the recommendation system arises at the historic moment. This paper extends Davis’s (1989) technology acceptance model (TAM) to find factors influencing users’ adoption intention of e-commerce recommendation system and improve the users’ intention to adopt recommendation system. On the basis of previous studies and related literatures, this paper presents users’ adoption intention model of e-commerce recommendation system and collects 271 valid data in the form of internet survey. Moreover, this paper evaluates the recommendation system adoption model using the path analysis principle, and explores the relationship between external and internal variables included by the model. Finally, according to the analysis results and specific factors, the paper analyses and discusses the research results from two aspects, and proposes the suggestion for improving the adoption of e-commerce recommendation system.	e-commerce payment system;recommender system	Xiaobing Gan;Yanmin Jiao;Lei Liu;Yanhua Zhang	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-93803-5_53	the internet;e-commerce;recommender system;data mining;information space;technology acceptance model;computer science;popularity	AI	-24.41742954480674	-47.95772346988444	84670

Social media provides us an unprecedented way to collect and analyze billions of users’ information. Proper user attribute identification or profile inference becomes increasingly attractive and feasible. However, the flourishing social records also pose great challenge in effective feature selection and integration for user profile inference, which is mainly caused by the text diversity and complex community structures. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework to infer the user occupation from his/her social activities recorded in the micro-blog system, which is a multi-source integration framework that combines both content and network information. We first identify some beneficial content features, and propose a machine learning classification model, named content model. We proceed to exploit the social network information, which tailors a community discovery based latent dimension solution to extract community-based feature, and utilizes the neighbor predictions for inference updating.

7a8e71e471575e109bafd42dbd1946864b820ed9	user's social media profile as predictor of empathy		The use of social media, like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, is nowadays very common and quite for sure each one of us has at least a digital profile on them. The information left of these platforms such as likes, posts, tweets and photos are very informative and can be used for deducting our preferences, tendencies and behaviors. The analysis of the social media footprints has become a relevant research topic in the last decade and many works have demonstrated how to extract some traits of the useru0027s affective sphere. In this paper, we focus on the prediction of empathic tendencies of a subject as an index of the influence of emotions during decisional processes. This value can be included in the user profile and can be relevant in some scenarios, such as music and movie recommender systems, where the emotional component is strongly delineated. We propose an approach of empathy level prediction based on a linear regression algorithm over Facebook profiles. We use a word2vec representation of the textual contents of the useru0027s time-line posts, a LDA and SVD vector representation of the useru0027s likes and other general descriptive data. The evaluation performed has demonstrated the validity of the approach for predicting the empathy tendency and the results have showed some relevant correlations with some specific groups of useru0027s descriptive features.	algorithm;branch predictor;experiment;feature selection;information;linear discriminant analysis;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;personalization;recommender system;relevance;requirement;singular value decomposition;social media;user profile;word2vec	Marco Polignano;Pierpaolo Basile;Gaetano Rossiello;Marco Degemmis;Giovanni Semeraro	2017		10.1145/3099023.3099103	data mining;word2vec;recommender system;linear regression;affect (psychology);empathy;social media;artificial intelligence;descriptive statistics;machine learning;computer science;user profile	AI	-21.304102325651858	-45.31165739614515	85231

In this paper we propose a two-side matching framework for online dating recommendations and design an Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to learn the user preferences from the observed user messaging behavior and user profile features. Experimental results using data from a large online dating website shows that two-sided matching improves the rate of successful matches by as much as 45%.

We demonstrate how we weigh in among different recommendation algorithms and optimization methods. To enhance recommendation accuracy and handling time-sensitive questions, we propose a large scale real-time RS based on the combination of machine learning algorithms and the stream computing technology. Considering of algorithm flexibility and performance, we use the maximum entropy model as the fundamental model design in the CTR (click-through rate) prediction of recommendation items. In the perspective of the Enlister system architecture, we illustrate how we divide and conquer massive data processing problem with a novel stream computing design which reduces the data process latency down to seconds.

778deea6699f3a50359ee0c16dd2b93d8a337998	movie recommender system for profit maximization (short lbp)	movies;recommender systems	In this paper we provide an algorithm for utility maximization of a movie supplier service, in two different settings, one with prices and the other without. This algorithm is provided along with an extensive experiment demonstrating its performance. We also uncover a phenomenon where movie consumers prefer watching and even paying for movies that they have already seen in the past than movies that are new to them. Introduction & Related Work The main goal in designing recommender systems is usually to predict the user’s wish list and to supply her with the best list of recommendations. However, in most cases, the engineers that design the recommender system are hired by the business which provides the suggestions. The business’ end goal is usually to increase sales, revenues, user engagement, or some other metric. In that sense, the user is not the end customer of the recommendation system, although she sees the recommendations (Lewis 2010). Still, one could argue that it is better for the business to give the user the best possible recommendations, as it will also maximize the business’ profit, either in the short run (no point in giving recommendations which are not followed by the users) or at least in the long run (good recommendations make users happy). In this paper, we provide evidence that a business may gain significantly (with little or no long-term loss) by providing users with recommendations that may not be best from the users point of view but serve the business’ needs. We provide an algorithm which uses a general recommender system as a black-box and increases the utility of the business. We perform extensive experiments with it in various cases. In particular, we consider two settings: 1. The Hidden Agenda setting: In this setting, the business has items that it wants to promote, in a way which is opaque to the user. For example, a movie supplier which provides movies on a monthly fee basis but has different costs for different movies. 2. The Revenue Maximizing setting: In this case the goal of the recommender system is to maximize the expected revenue, e.g. by recommending expensive items. In this Copyright c © 2013, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. setting, there is an inherent conflict between the user and the business. An interesting phenomenon that we uncover is that subjects are more willing to pay for movies that they’ve already seen. While a similar phenomena is known for other types of consumer goods, coming across it with regards to movies is new and somewhat counter-intuitive. We supply some explanation for this phenomenon, and explain how it can improve the design of recommender systems for movies. However, further research is required. Chen et al. (2008) develop a recommender system which tries to maximize product profitability. Chen et al. assume the usage of a collaborative filtering recommender system which, as part of its construction, provides a theoreticallybased probability that a user will purchase each item. They multiply this probability by the revenue from each item and recommend the items which yield the highest expected revenue. However, in practice, many recommender systems do not rely only upon collaborative filtering, but also rely on different engines (such as popularity, semantic similarity, etc.). Therefore, we assume a generic recommender system which is treated as a black-box component, and dedicate most of our work to building a human model in order to predict the acceptance rate of a given item using a generic recommender system. In (Azaria et al. 2012) we model the long-term affect of advice given by a self-interested system on the users in path selection problems. However, in (Azaria et al. 2012) we assume that the user must select his action among a limited number of options and the system merely recommends a certain action. Therefore the system does not act as a classic recommender system, which recommends a limited number of items from a very large corpus. Still, this work may be found useful if combined with the approach given in this paper, when considering repeated interactions scenarios. Profit and Utility Maximizing Algorithm In this section we present the Profit and Utility Maximizer Algorithm (PUMA) for the revenue maximizing setting. PUMA mounts a black-boxed recommender system which supplies a ranked list of movies. In order to learn the impact of the price on the likelihood of the users buying a movie, we use the recommender system as is, providing recommendations from 1 to n.

However, a user of an EC site must possess certain skills to search for his/her desired product from the numerous web pages. A mixed-reality web-shopping system with panoramic views mitigates this problem. The users of this system can shop in the same manner as they do in a real shop, by viewing the panoramic photographs taken inside the shop. However, one problem with this system is the detection of a product selected in the panoramic view by the user. Although we proposed a product identification system using convolutional neural networks (CNN), its performance was not satisfactory. In this research, we propose a method to improve the recognition rate of the CNN.	artificial neural network;convolutional neural network;e-commerce;mixed reality;online shopping;web page;world wide web	Kazuki Shibata;Hotaka Niwa;Masaya Ohta	2017	2017 IEEE 6th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)	10.1109/GCCE.2017.8229381	web page;mixed reality;convolutional neural network;machine learning;computer science;artificial intelligence	Robotics	-28.46431275976735	-43.253700558555224	86286

By introducing the fitness, extracted kansei rules have priority. Therefore, kansei rules can be used effectively. 3D characters created by the proposed system and the user's evaluation values are stored as data, and kansei rules are extracted by analyzing the data.

With the increasing of micro-blog users, there are more and more new topics emerging on this kind of platform, which has made the users difficult in finding out their own interesting topics. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a micro-blog topic recommendation system which can give corresponding suggestions/strategies for users. Firstly, the user relationship (i.e., a user adds a follow hyperlink to another user) in micro-blog can be effectively analyzed and saved to the user graph. In addition, an algorithm of computing user authority (which is similar to the idea of PageRank) is proposed to catch influential users based on the built user graph. Secondly, Topic Feature Graph (TFG) and User Micro-blog Feature Graph (UMFG) are respectively constructed based on the micro-blog text corpus of a topic and the micro-blog texts followed by a given user. Based on TFG and UMFG, User Topic Feature Vector (UTFV) and User Topic Feature Matrix (UTFM) can be achieved. After that, users’ similarity is calculated based on the User Topic Feature Vector and User Topic Feature Matrix to realize the users clustering by the help of the hierarchical clustering algorithm. Incorporating topic heat degree and user authority, the recommendation algorithm is presented to realize Micro-blog topic personalized recommendation within user clustering set. Experiments show that our proposed recommendation system has a good accuracy which is up to 50.2%.	blog;recommender system	Shunxiang Zhang;Shiyao Zhang;Neil Y.

However, the motivation, requirement and experience of users may dynamically change, which cause difficulty in exactly refining a stable behavior pattern and describing their shifted interest. This paper introduces an optimized ant colony clustering algorithm (OACA) in dynamic pattern discovery, and explores the structured formula to describe the users’ browsing behavior patterns as well as to analyze their characteristics adaptively. The test and results show that users are clustered accurately based on their similar browsing behavior from dynamic Web log data.	algorithm;ant colony;browsing;cluster analysis;requirement;world wide web	Xiaohua Hu;Tao Mu;Weihui Dai;Hongzhi Hu;Genghui Dai	2012	JCP	10.4304/jcp.7.12.3096-3102	simulation;swarm intelligence;computer science;machine learning;multimedia;cluster analysis;world wide web	Web+IR	-30.681432764498652	-50.66087050078527	87003

It is a way to express ourselves. Its importance gave rise to music Recommender Systems (RS) through e-commerce applications. The most commonly used technique in such applications is Collaborative Filtering (CF) that uses the User-Item (UI) matrix. The latter codes the users' preferences for items. The advantage of using CF methods is their simplicity and their relatively high efficiency. However, data sparsity deteriorates their efficiency. In this paper, we propose a process that can enhance the similarities among users in a way that can address the sparsity problem. The proposed user based CF algorithm alters the values of similarity matrix between users by incorporating a graph based method, improving the performance of the RS. We also propose a method that groups users using spectral clustering and together with the graph-based similarity method yield even more accurate predictions. Experiments have been conducted on a music dataset, highlighting the superiority of the proposed method against typical user-based CF.	algorithm;cluster analysis;code;collaborative filtering;e-commerce;emoticon;experiment;recommender system;similarity measure;sparse matrix;spectral clustering;theory;user interface	Vasileios Gavriilidis;Anastasios Tefas;Constantine Kotropoulos;Nikos Nikolaidis	2016	2016 Digital Media Industry & Academic Forum (DMIAF)	10.1109/DMIAF.2016.7574913	computer science;theoretical computer science;world wide web;information retrieval;recommender system	Web+IR	-20.595407605406017	-47.25708391127162	87362

Also the cosmopolitan and cultural-aware music aficionado is likely be interested in which music is currently “hot” in other parts of the world. We therefore propose four approaches to determine artist popularity rankings on the country-level. To this end, we mine the following data sources: page counts from Web search engines, user posts on Twitter, shared folders on the Gnutella file sharing network, and playcount data from last.fm. We propose methods to derive artist rankings based on these four sources and perform cross-comparison of the resulting rankings via overlap scores.

The major concerns with these methods are: (1) they are sometimes being overly confident; (2) they are prone to disregard some useful information in the user profiles; (3) they often imply some untrustworthy inferences in making a prediction. This work investigates the drawbacks of these methods, and then proposes a collaborative filtering approach based on heuristic formulated inferences. The proposed approach is based on the fact that any two users may have some common interest genres as well as different ones. Different from most existing methods, this approach introduces a more reasonable similarity measure metric, considers users’ preferences and rating patterns, and promotes rational individual prediction, thus more comprehensively measures the relevance between user and item. Experimental results from two popular public datasets show that the proposed approach improves the prediction quality significantly over several other popular methods. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

d19efc90ed905676af34e3f735b4250c7beddfd4	parallel data-driven modeling of information spread in social networks		Models of information spread in social networks are widely used to explore the drivers of content contagion and to predict the effect of new information messages. Most of the existing models (aggregated as SIR-like or network-based as independent cascades) use the assumption of homogeneity of an audience. However, to make a model plausible for a description of real-world processes and to measure the accumulated impact of information on individuals, one needs to personalize the characteristics of users as well as sources of information. In this paper, we propose an approach to data-driven simulation of information spread in social networks which combines a set of different models in a unified framework. It includes a model of a user (including sub-models of reaction and daily activity), a model of message generation by information source and a model of message transfer within a user network. The parameters of models (e.g. for different types of agents) are identified by data from the largest Russian social network vk.com. For this study, we collected the network of users associated with charity community (~33.7 million nodes).

The volume of data increases daily, making it difficult to access the data efficiently. To tackle the problems, we can represent the data in a summarised form using fuzzy formal concept lattices. In a situation where data is added dynamically, the concept lattices may evolve and the degree of change can be measured using a distance metric. In previous studies, we have successfully measured the change between two fuzzy lattices, based on pairing concepts in the two lattices and finding the cost of converting each concept to its counterpart. In this paper, we present a modification to the distance measurement, namely Support-based Distance Measurement. The aim of this method is to measure the change between lattices with disjoint sets of objects and identical attributes. The distance is found by considering the change in support (or relative cardinality) for each concept's extension. The method is illustrated by showing simple examples of its application to product review sites.	blog;digital data;email;lattice graph;semiconductor industry;web page	N. H. Abd Rahim;Trevor P.

However, such understanding can significantly help brand marketers generate desired engagements with their target audience in marketing campaigns. In this paper, we study the problem of predicting a brand's user interactions on social media using the example of Pinterest, an emerging platform that has provided a large volume of brand as well as user data in the form of images. Specifically, we treat the prediction of a brand's user interactions, captured through """"repinnings"""" on Pinterest, as the retrieval of relevant user-pinned images given a brand image. The prototype system that we build incorporates this basic principle, and is tested on a large-scale Pinterest dataset of more than one million images. We demonstrate that our system achieves significant lifts in recalling ground truth repinners of brand images for a variety of brands across several major industry categories."""	ground truth;interaction;prototype;social media	Shantanu Singh;Yan Wang;Li-liang Ding	2013		10.1145/2501217.2501218	engineering;marketing;multimedia;advertising;brand awareness	Web+IR	-20.16423760071719	-51.26823763261681	87909
dcfc8ca8f8dad101a06399cb2d26d6246c816717	efficient algorithms for discovering high utility user behavior patterns in mobile commerce environments		Mining user behavior patterns in mobile environments is an emerging topic in data mining fields with wide applications. By integrating moving paths with purchasing transactions, one can find the sequential purchasing patterns with the moving paths, which are called mobile sequential patterns of the mobile users. Mobile sequential patterns can be applied not only for planning mobile commerce environments but also for analyzing and managing online shopping websites. However, unit profits and purchased numbers of the items are not considered in traditional framework of mobile sequential pattern mining. Thus, the patterns with high utility (i.e., profit here) cannot be found. In view of this, we aim at integrating mobile data mining with utility mining for finding high-utility mobile sequential patterns in this study. Two types of algorithms, namely level-wise and tree-based methods, are proposed for mining high-utility mobile sequential patterns. A series of analyses and comparisons on the performance of the two different types of algorithms are conducted through experimental evaluations. The results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art mobile sequential pattern algorithms and that the tree-based algorithms deliver better performance than the level-wise ones under various conditions.	algorithm;data mining;mobile commerce;online shopping;purchasing;sequential pattern mining;text mining	Bai-En Shie;Hui-Fang Hsiao;Vincent S.

5c9fa4d2920f80c05bfe5626c020173ca874cf63	on early detection of high voted q&a on stack overflow		Early detection of high quality content on community question answering platforms is an important emerging problem in which the main goal is the detection of high quality questions and answers in a short time right after their submission. Improving the process of question routing, reducing the number of questions with no answers, improving the user experience and also promoting the content quality of a CQA by rejecting low quality contents are all benefits of solving the early detection of high quality content problem in CQA. The main challenge of solving this problem is that the value of a few features is available in a short time after submission of a content in CQA. In other words, unlike previous related research, it is not possible to utilize comprehensive set of features to detect high quality content. In this paper, we view the content quality from the perspective of the voting outcome. Specifically, we consider those Q&A which will get more votes than a certain threshold as high quality posts. Analyzing large amount of data in a CQA, we observed two important patterns which help us with early detection of high quality content. We named the first pattern as accepted answer effect and the second pattern as answer competition effect . According to the first pattern, the chance of a high quality question to get an accepted answer is higher than the chance of other questions and vice versa. According to the second pattern, only few number of answers of a specific question will be high quality answers. We show that these patterns are valid in a short time after the submission of content on CQA. Utilizing these patterns, we propose a unified relational classification framework to solve the problem. In our proposed framework, the quality of a given question and its associated answers can be predicted simultaneously soon after their submission. We conduct several experiments on six data collections gathered from Stack Overflow in order to show the efficiency of the proposed models. Our experiments indicate that the performance of high quality content detection can improve up to 10.7% and 35.3% in comparison with a state-of-the-art independent classifier for questions and answers, respectively. Moreover, we found 1.2% and 11.8% F-measure gain in average versus a recent strong baseline by Yao et al. (2015) for questions and answers, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Typical solutions to this problem require analysis of the correlation among different attributes of the photos, including the correlation between the textual features and visual features computed from a photo. However, most on-line photos have very few tags or even no tags, and thus they contribute little or none to the analysis of tag-photo correlation, which is a key component in those schemes that rely on such analysis for tag recommendation. To address this practical challenge, we propose an active learning method for incorporating photos with no or few tags so as to enhance the correlation analysis for improved performance in tag recommendation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a dataset of more than 33,000 photos collected from Flickr.	active learning (machine learning);flickr;online and offline	Yajun Gao;Baoxin Li	2012	2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467498	the internet;computer science;multimedia;active learning;world wide web;information retrieval;recommender system	Robotics	-22.86440512448154	-49.54164482018875	89377
84c73d0c61f439199bb78a337a44bb0e5cab149d	improving reachability and navigability in recommender systems.		In this paper, we investigate recommender systems from a network perspective and investigate recommendation networks, where nodes are items (e.g., movies) and edges are constructed from top-N recommendations (e.g., related movies). In particular, we focus on evaluating the reachability and navigability of recommendation networks and investigate the following questions: (i) How well do recommendation networks support navigation and exploratory search? (ii) What is the influence of parameters, in particular different recommendation algorithms and the number of recommendations shown, on reachability and navigability? and (iii) How can reachability and navigability be improved in these networks? We tackle these questions by first evaluating the reachability of recommendation networks by investigating their structural properties. Second, we evaluate navigability by simulating three different models of information seeking scenarios. We find that with standard algorithms, recommender systems are not well suited to navigation and exploration and propose methods to modify recommendations to improve this. Our work extends from one-click-based evaluations of recommender systems towards multi-click analysis (i.e., sequences of dependent clicks) and presents a general, comprehensive approach to evaluating navigability of arbitrary recommendation networks.	1-click;algorithm;exploratory search;information seeking;reachability;recommender system;simulation	Daniel Lamprecht;Markus Strohmaier;Denis Helic	2015	CoRR		recommender system;data mining;information retrieval;exploratory search;computer science;standard algorithms;reachability;navigability;information seeking	Web+IR	-31.451810605493428	-50.81663921506355	89680
57a04680c49f9c639c5cd7607768c986a8d3451d	local business ambience characterization through mobile audio sensing	business ambience;audio sensing;local search	Local search users today decide what business to visit solely based on distance information, and business ratings that can be sparse or stale. We believe that when users search for local businesses, such as bars or restaurants, they need to know more about the ambience of each business, such as how crowded it is, how loud and of what type the music it plays is, as well as how loud the human chatter in the business is. Unfortunately, this information doesn't exist today. In this paper, we propose to automatically crowdsource such rich, local business ambience metadata through real user check-in events. Every time a user checks into a business, the phone is in user's hands, and the phone's sensors can sense the business environment. We leverage the phone's microphone during this time to infer the occupancy and human chatter levels, the music type, as well as the music and noise levels in the business. As people check-in to businesses throughout the day, business metadata can be automatically updated over time, enabling a new generation of local search experience. Using approximately 150 audio traces collected from real businesses of various types over a period of 3 months, we show that by properly extracting the temporal and frequency signatures of the audio signal, it is feasible to train models that can simultaneously infer occupancy, human chatter, music, and noise levels in a business, with higher than 79% accuracy.	crowdsourcing;image noise;local search (optimization);microphone;need to know;peek (data type operation);scalability;sensor;sparse matrix;tracing (software);type signature;user experience	Junyu Wang;Dimitrios Lymberopoulos;Jie Liu	2014		10.1145/2566486.2568027	simulation;computer science;local search;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-24.32811965433019	-45.37724211400297	89701
aa4bdf1e8b2b5df78644b39e789b92da3fd8ddb9	interacting with recommenders - overview and research directions		Automated recommendations have become a ubiquitous part of today’s online user experience. These systems point us to additional items to purchase in online shops, they make suggestions to us on movies to watch, or recommend us people to connect with on social websites. In many of today’s applications, however, the only way for users to interact with the system is to inspect the recommended items. Often, no mechanisms are implemented for users to give the system feedback on the recommendations or to explicitly specify preferences, which can limit the potential overall value of the system for its users.  Academic research in recommender systems is largely focused on algorithmic approaches for item selection and ranking. Nonetheless, over the years a variety of proposals were made on how to design more interactive recommenders. This work provides a comprehensive overview on the existing literature on user interaction aspects in recommender systems. We cover existing approaches for preference elicitation and result presentation, as well as proposals that consider recommendation as an interactive process. Throughout the work, we furthermore discuss examples of real-world systems and outline possible directions for future works.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;design of experiments;human–computer interaction;information filtering system;information retrieval;netflix prize;online shopping;precision and recall;preference elicitation;recommender system;reed–solomon error correction;report;user experience;world-system	Michael Jugovac;Dietmar Jannach	2017	TiiS	10.1145/3001837	distributed computing;human–computer interaction;recommender system;preference elicitation;user experience design;computer science;knowledge management;user interface;ranking	HCI	-33.39649915416197	-50.78343186463496	89738

Reputation system is a popular technique currently used for providing a global quality score of sellers to consumers. However, such global information is far enough for clients to choose the most qualified products. In the real word, we always ask our trusted friends for some recommended information or trust the information recommended by the clients who have similar preference in recommender systems. Aiming at providing some more useful trust information to consumers, we propose a computational trust model based on the social network which is constructed by the similarity of users in the C2C e-commerce environment, and use a local trust metric for propagating trust in the constructed network. Experiments show that our model can produce a personalized recommended trust value for a specific user, which is more accuracy than a global value in some cases.	computation;computational trust;e-commerce;experiment;machine learning;personalization;recommender system;reputation system;simulation;social network;trust metric	Jun Li;Xiaolin Zheng;Yafeng Wu;Deren Chen	2010	2010 IEEE 7th International Conference on E-Business Engineering	10.1109/ICEBE.2010.27	e-commerce;reputation;computer science;knowledge management;accuracy and precision;internet privacy;trustworthy computing;computational model;world wide web;computational trust;measurement;robustness;recommender system;social network	DB	-21.367222544231428	-46.31568881132807	89767

Messages received by a user mainly depend on whom the user follows. Thus, recommending users with similar interests may improve the experience quality for information receiving. Since messages posted by microblogging users reflect their interests, and the keywords in the messages indicate their main focus to a large extent, we can discover users' preferences by analyzing the user-generated contents. Moreover, users' interests are not static, on the contrary, they change as time goes by. Based on such intuitions, in this paper, we propose a temporal-topic model to analyze users' possible behaviors and predict their potential friends in microblogging. The model learns users' latent preferences by extracting keywords on aggregated messages over a period of time via a topic model, and then the impact of time is considered to deal with interest drifts. The experimental results of friend recommendations on Sina Weibo, one of the most popular microblogging sites in China, have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model.	cold start;experiment;performance;personalization;recommender system;time complexity;timeline;topic model;user-generated content	Nan Zheng;Shuangyong Song;Hongyun Bao	2015	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems	10.1109/TSMC.2015.2391262	computer science;microblogging;machine learning;semantics;predictive modelling;multimedia;internet privacy;topic model;computational model;world wide web	Web+IR	-21.187975634677574	-45.32115056213086	90286

Some Web-based music stores can recommend popular music which has been rated by many people. However, three problems that need to be resolved in the current methods are: (a) how to recommend the ‘favored music’ which has not been rated by anyone, (b) how to avoid repeatedly recommending the ‘disfavored music’ for users, and (c) how to recommend more interesting music for users besides the ones users have been used to listen. To achieve these goals, we proposed a novel method called personalized hybrid music recommendation, which combines the content-based, collaboration-based and emotion-based methods by computing the weights of the methods according to users’ interests. Furthermore, to evaluate the recommendation accuracy, we constructed a system that can recommend the music to users after mining users’ logs on music listening records. By the feedback of the user’s options, the proposed methods accommodate the variations of the users’ musical interests and then promptly recommend the favored and more interesting music via consecutive recommendations. Experimental results show that the recommendation accuracy achieved by our method is as good as 90%. Hence, it is helpful for recommending the ‘favored music’ to users, provided that each music object is annotated with the related music emotions. The framework in this paper could serve as a useful basis for studies on music recommendation. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Experimental results based on three real data sets demonstrate that our method is more effective than other approaches, both in accuracy and coverage of recommendations."""	cold start;collaborative filtering;display resolution;effective method;recommender system;sparse matrix	Guibing Guo;Jie Zhang;Daniel Thalmann	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-31454-4_10	computer science;data mining;database;world wide web	AI	-20.925414029162265	-48.08578568294158	90967
46de85fbe6c1ca55422ed2f13b73ffd53642293a	discovering community preference influence network by social network opinion posts mining		The popularity of posts, topics, and opinions on social media web- sites and the influence ability of users can be discovered by analyzing the res- ponses of users (e.g., likes/dislikes, comments, ratings). Existing web opinion mining systems such as OpinionMiner is based on opinion text similarity scor- ing of users' review texts and product ratings to generate database table of fea- tures, functions and opinions mined through classification to identify arriving opinions as positive or negative on user-service networks or interest networks (e.g., Amazon.com). These systems are not directly applicable to user-user net- works or friendship networks (e.g., Facebook.com) since they do not consider multiple posts on multiple products, users' relationships (such as influence), and diverse posts and comments. This paper proposes a new influence network (IN) generation algorithm (Opinion Based IN:OBIN) through opinion mining of friendship networks. OBIN mines opinions using extended OpinionMiner that considers multiple posts and relationships (influences) between users. Approach used includes frequent pattern mining algorithm for determining community (positive or negative) preferences for a given product as input to standard influ- ence maximization algorithms like CELF for target marketing.	social network	Tamanna S.

There are growing needs to get useful information from Twitter, because an enormous amount of information is transmitted in real time. Twitter users, who play an important role as information sources, typically transmit information about some particular topics which they are interested in. Therefore, to identify useful information, it is very important to know which topics a user tends to transmit. In this paper, we propose a method to discover appropriate topics for a user by using Twitter list.

Aiming at this problem, the key users determination method based on density peak clustering is proposed, which can effectively distinguish the key users of the recommendation system. Furthermore, the recommendation algorithm based on density peak clustering and key users is proposed. The proposed algorithm is efficient through experimental verification, which not only improves the recommendation efficiency, but also improves the recommendation accuracy and diversity.	algorithm;cluster analysis;collaborative filtering;data mining;experiment;recommender system;scalability;sparse matrix	Pei-pei Wang;Pei-yu Liu;Ru Wang;Zhen-fang Zhu	2017	2017 13th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)	10.1109/FSKD.2017.8393314	machine learning;recommender system;software;artificial intelligence;cluster analysis;robustness (computer science);computer science;algorithm;information science	ML	-21.05260561340838	-48.20614120747499	91243
205c29d7aab8e820e9f594ec4e41206a9a8434ca	tracking the diffusion of named entities		Existing studies of how information diffuses across social networks have thus far concentrated on analysing and recovering the spread of deterministic innovations such as URLs, hashtags, and group membership. However investigating how mentions of real-world entities appear and spread has yet to be explored, largely due to the computationally intractable nature of performing large-scale entity extraction. In this paper we present, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first pieces of work to closely examine the diffusion of named entities on social media, using Reddit as our case study platform. We first investigate how named entities can be accurately recognised and extracted from discussion posts. We then use these extracted entities to study the patterns of entity cascades and how the probability of a user adopting an entity (i.e. mentioning it) is associated with exposures to the entity. We put these pieces together by presenting a parallelised diffusion model that can forecast the probability of entity adoption, finding that the influence of adoption between users can be characterised by their prior interactions – as opposed to whether the users propagated entity-adoptions beforehand. Our findings have important implications for researchers studying influence and language, and for community analysts who wish to understand entity-level influence dynamics.	blogosphere;brown clustering;cluster analysis;computational complexity theory;hashtag;hyperlink;interaction;named entity;named-entity recognition;social media;social network;structured prediction;text corpus;threshold model;tracing (software)	Leon Derczynski;Matthew Rowe	2017	CoRR		natural language processing;artificial intelligence;computer science;social network;diffusion (business);social media	Web+IR	-19.31420848703212	-43.039902942021385	91392

Since ancient times, concept hierarchies have been used to organize and access information. In some situations, task-specific and user-specific concept hierarchies are necessary to allow an overview and easy access a large set of documents. For example, in regulatory reforms, rule-makers in government regulatory agencies must quickly identify and respond to issues raised in public comments. A concept hierarchy constructed for a set of public comments hierarchically organizes the comments and a user is able to easily """"drill down"""" into documents that discuss a specific topic.  Particularly, this dissertation addresses how to construct concept hierarchies from text collections automatically or with a-human-in-the-loop. The novel metric-based concept hierarchy construction framework transforms concept hierarchy construction into a multicriterion optimization problem. It incrementally clusters concepts based on minimum evolution of hierarchy structure, as well as optimization derived from the modeling of concept abstractness and concept coherence. Moreover, this dissertation represents the semantic distance between concepts as a wide range of features, each of which corresponds to a state-ofthe- art concept hierarchy construction technique, such as lexico-syntactic pattern, contextual information, and co-occurrence. The use of multiple features allows a further study of the interaction between features and different types of semantic relations as well as the interaction between features and concepts at different abstraction levels.  Besides the automatic framework for concept hierarchy construction, this dissertation also proposes an effective human-guided concept hierarchy construction framework to address personalization by learning from periodic manual guidance and directing the learned models towards personal preferences. Through human-computer interactions, the human and the machine work together to organize concepts into hierarchies. The machine's predictions not only save the user's effort but also make sensible suggestions to assist the user. This is one of the first works of real-time machine learning for organizing personalized information in an interactive paradigm.  This dissertation also studies user behaviors during concept hierarchy construction. It explores whether people create concept hierarchies more quickly or more consistently using the proposed frameworks, whether there are consistent dataset-specific or user-specific differences in the hierarchies that people construct, whether people are self-consistent, and how these factors interact with different construction methods. The user study elaborates that dataset difficulty is a major factor affecting how people organize information into concept hierarchies. It also reveals that people are quite self-consistent in building hierarchies. This novel finding provides foundations to study the differences in concept hierarchy construction behaviors between individuals.  Last but not least, the dissertation proposes a novel similarity metric for measuring hierarchy similarity. Fragment-based Similarity (FBS) employs a unique bag-of-word representation for hierarchies and takes a fragment-based view to calculate hierarchy similarity. FBS well approximates tree edit distance and greatly improves tree edit distance's efficiency from NP-hard to only O(n3) and O(n) if pairwise node similarities are pre-calculated.  The research in this dissertation is an important step forward of concept hierarchy construction. It addresses important problems of concept hierarchy construction, especially considers how to better model these problems with good theoretical foundations, to study these problems via extensive empirical experiments and user studies, and to solve these problems by developing practical applications for constructing personal concept hierarchies.

Aiming at the shortcomings of the traditional method, with the practical application of recommendation system, a new collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm is proposed which selects neighbors for each target item. Ratings based on item type determine preliminary neighbors from the users, for each target item computing neighbors of the target user, and in the case of not rating the target item, the expanded neighbors are considered, finally predicting and recommending target items. The experimental results show that the algorithm improves the accuracy of similarity calculation and the error performance when comparing with other classic algorithms, and effectively alleviates the user rating data sparsity problem, while improving the accuracy of the forecast.	algorithm;collaborative filtering;recommender system;sparse matrix	Yaqiong Guo;Mengxing Huang;Longfei Sun	2014	2014 11th Web Information System and Application Conference	10.1109/WISA.2014.33	computer science;collaborative filtering;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval;recommender system	ML	-21.297762592556374	-48.719913330886165	91786

Very often, online shopping customers read reviews written by other customers to compare similar items. However, the number of customer reviews is typically too large to look through in a reasonable amount of time. To extract information that can be used for online shopping decision support, this paper investigates a novel data mining problem of mining distinguishing customer focus sets from customer reviews. We demonstrate that this problem has many applications, and at the same time, is challenging. We present dFocus-Miner, a mining method with various techniques that makes the mined results interpretable and user-friendly. Our experimental results on real world data sets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.	online shopping	Lu Liu;Lei Duan;Hao Yang;Jyrki Nummenmaa;Guozhu Dong;Pan Qin	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-49586-6_4	data mining;customer intelligence	AI	-21.128070564108697	-51.07332796072118	92423

This indicates most users' attitudes towards emerging technologies that happened recently. To obtain the data on social media, the traditional Web crawler is only able to obtain part of the information by collecting data in a non-login status because the crawler is not provided with the capabilities to log into the system. To enable information sharing among users, the SINA Microblog Open Platform offers a number APIs in which certain limitations such as those on the number of user requests of the microblog server, still exist. In this paper, a method that simulates user login to collect Microblog data related to hot topics on the SINA platform is proposed. What's more, the method overcomes the limitations of the SINA Microblog APIs, thus leading to getting more data from the system. In addition, the typical user behaviors, through the collected data, is found when they interact with social media.	application programming interface;login;open platform;server (computing);social media;web crawler;world wide web	Songsong Zhang;Jing Zhou;Minyong Shi;Chunfang Li	2016	2016 IEEE/ACIS 15th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS)	10.1109/ICIS.2016.7550943	media;social media;html;computer science;web crawler;database;internet privacy;java;world wide web;data collection	DB	-28.844193131907772	-50.15452705186529	92551

They are perceived as a vast source of information about their users. Variety of different methods and techniques has been proposed to analyze these networks in order to extract valuable information about the users – things they do and like/dislike. A lot of effort is put into improvement of analytical methods in order to grasp a more accurate and detailed image of users. Such information would have an impact on many aspects of everyday life of people – from politics, via professional life, to shopping and entertainment. The theory of fuzzy sets and systems, introduced in 1965, has the ability to handle imprecise and ambiguous information, and to cope with linguistic terms. The theory has evolved into such areas like possibility theory and computing with words. It is very suitable for processing data in a human-like way, and providing the results in a human-oriented manner. The paper presents a short survey of works that use fuzzy-based technologies for analysis of social networks. We pose an idea that fuzzy-based techniques allow for introduction of humancentric and human-like data analysis processes. We include here detailed descriptions of a few target areas of social network analysis that could benefit from applications of fuzzy sets and systems methods.	social network	Lotfi A. Zadeh;Ali M.

However, most of these marketing accounts merely focus on the contents of their tweets. Less effort has been made on understanding tweeting time, which is a major contributing factor in terms of attracting customers' attention and maximizing the influence of a social marketing campaign. To that end, in this paper, we provide a focused study of temporal retweeting patterns and their influence on social media marketing campaigns. Specifically, we investigate the users' retweeting patterns by modeling their retweeting behaviors as a generative process, which considers temporal, social, and topical factors. Moreover, we validate the predictive power of the model on the dataset collected from Sina Weibo, the most popular micro blog platform in China. By discovering the temporal retweeting patterns, we analyze the temporal popular topics and recommend tweets to users in a time-aware manner. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other baseline methods. This model is applicable for companies to conduct their marketing campaigns at the right time on social media.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);blog;generative model;reblogging;social media marketing;social network	Guannan Liu;Yanjie Fu;Tong Xu;Hui Xiong;Guoqing Chen	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining	10.1109/ICDM.2014.48	media;computer science;machine learning;data mining;predictive modelling;context model	ML	-19.60079222182225	-45.706713171183225	92659

Although users may avoid checking in places which they regard as sensitive, adversaries can still infer where a user has been through linkage of multiple background information. In this paper, we propose a new location privacy attack in GeoSNs, called hidden location inference attack, in which adversaries infer users’ location based on users’ check-in history as well as check-in history of her friends and similar users. Then we develop three inference models (baseline inference model, CF-based inference model and HMM-based inference model) to capture the hidden location privacy leakage probability. Moreover, we design a privacy alert framework to warn users the most probable leaked locations. At last, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation using two real-world datasets collected from Gowalla and Brightkite.

We present two intuitive interfaces for navigating content by topics and their related news events as well as serendipitously learning about a news topic. These two interfaces trade-off between user-controlled and serendipitous exploration of news while retaining the story context.

Ask’nSeek asks users to guess the location of a hidden region within an image with the help of semantic and topological clues. The information collected from game logs is combined with results from content analysis algorithms and used to feed a machine learning algorithm that outputs the outline of the most relevant regions within the image and their names. Two noteworthy aspects of the proposed game are: (i) it solves two computer vision problems – object detection and labeling – in a single game; and (ii) it learns spatial relations within the image from game logs. The game has been evaluated through user studies, which confirmed that it was easy to understand, intuitive, and fun to play.	algorithm;computer vision;game mechanics;machine learning;multi-touch;object detection;semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;sequence labeling;supervised learning;touchscreen;usability testing;web application	Axel Carlier;Oge Marques;Vincent Charvillat	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33863-2_25	computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;multimedia;algorithmic game theory	HCI	-32.676597944703616	-45.26622475863432	93715

6c3432cfd20bab266d904ba144093190e8b23ed1	extending recommendation systems with semantics and context-awareness: pre-filtering algorithms		During the last decade, several recommendation systems have been proposed that help people to tackle information overload of digital content by effectively presenting content adapted to user’s tastes and needs. However, these personalization technologies are far from perfect and much research is needed to improve the quality of recommendations and, particularly, user satisfaction. In this paper we analyze and extend two relatively recent approaches for improving the effectiveness of recommendation systems: context-aware recommenders, which mainly focus on incorporating contextual information to the recommendation process; and semantically-enhanced recommenders, which focus on incorporating domain semantics. Although these approaches are compatible, how to properly combine them to maximize their strengths is still an unexplored research issue. The objective of this work is to provide the basis for this research. Concretely, we propose and evaluate an improved content-based model that exploits semantics and contextual information in an integrated way.	algorithm;cold start;collaborative filtering;computer user satisfaction;context awareness;digital recording;experiment;heuristic;information overload;personalization;programming paradigm;recommender system	Victor Codina;Luigi Ceccaroni	2011		10.3233/978-1-60750-842-7-81	recommender system;filter (signal processing);semantics;information retrieval;context awareness;computer science	Web+IR	-28.555838336614954	-47.480619306847146	93830

As we know the time is one of the important factors on recommending places with proper time for users, since the pleasure of visiting a place could be diminished if arriving at wrong time, we propose to infer the visiting time distributions of locations. We assume the check-in data used is incomplete because in real-world scenarios it is hard or unavailable to collect all the temporal information of locations and the check-in behaviors might be abnormal. To tackle such problem, we devise a visiting time inference framework, VisTime-Miner, which considers the route-based visiting correlation of time labels to model the visiting behavior of a location. Experiments on a large-scaled Gowalla check-in data show a promising result.	location-based service	Hsun-Ping Hsieh;Cheng-Te Li	2014		10.1145/2567948.2577362	data mining;world wide web	Web+IR	-23.252156604376378	-45.12891592155815	94171

To make informed decisions, shared knowledge should be managed in a way to be accessible for relevant group members to each of the contents. One of the main factors that contribute to the quality of contents recommendations to the relevant users is the quality of the users and contents identification. A variety of automatic and semi-automatic methods exist for extracting or assigning identity to online resources. Although users’ perception about contents and also their interests might change over time, most current approaches define a fixed identity for the objects and always recommend them to the users based on their fixed, defined identities because they use a source of knowledge that does not evolve. In our approach, we update identities of the users and Web contents dynamically based on the latest collective opinion of the evolving communities of users related to them in a social semantic tagging system.

Recommender Systems have been widely used for product recommendations such as books and movies as well as, it is also gaining ground in service recommendations such as hotels, restaurants and travel attractions. Collaborative filtering based on reviews and ratings is usually applied that uses Clustering technique. The primary step of converting textual reviews into a Feature Matrix (FM) can be greatly refined by using semantic similarity between terms. In this paper Wordnet based Synset grouping approach is presented that not only reduces dimensions in FM but also generates Feature vectors (FV) for each cluster with significantly improved cluster quality. The paper presents a three step approach of validating the reviews, grouping of reviews and review based recommendations using Feature vector. Real datasets extracted from travel sites are used for experiments.	book;cluster analysis;collaborative filtering;computer cluster;e-commerce payment system;experiment;fm broadcasting;farmville;feature vector;recommender system;semantic similarity;synonym ring;wordnet	Prafulla Bharat Bafna;Shailaja Shirwaikar;Dhanya Pramod	2016		10.1145/2998476.2998487	feature vector;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;database;world wide web;information retrieval;recommender system	Web+IR	-21.84289746273956	-49.563268657326944	94504

df8b747edcf25054ba08ec36b367729bb8e21ede	leveraging biosignal and collaborative filtering for context-aware recommendation	context awareness;collaborative context;context aware recommendation;context	Recommender systems are powerful tools that support the user in their quest to find the multimedia they are looking for. Such systems present multimedia contents or provide recommendations by taking into consideration two dimensions of inputs: content (item), and user (consumer). Little attention has been paid to increasing the quality of the experience by understanding the contextual aspect of the user when he/she wants to consume multimedia content. By including user's biological signal and leveraging collaborative filtering, we can build a context-aware model that establish the bridge between the multimedia content, and the user's context containing physiological parameters. Hence, the proposed model finds the latent preferences of users in a given context from other similar users. The model also finds the latent items consumed in a given context from other similar items. We then map context-based items for a particular user to find most relevant items in that context. Our experimental results have shown the feasibility to personalize the recommendation according to the user's context.	collaborative filtering;personalization;recommender system	Mohammed F.

Although a number of studies have been done on this topic, few of them take into account the temporal property for web user's navigation patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Temporal N-Gram (TN-Gram) for constructing prediction models of Web user navigation by considering the temporality property in Web usage evolution. Moreover, three kinds of new measures are proposed for evaluating the temporal evolution of navigation patterns under different time periods. Through experimental evaluation on both of real-life and simulated datasets, the proposed TN-Gram model is shown to outperform other approaches like N-gram modeling in terms of the prediction precision, in particular when the web user's navigating behavior changes with temporal evolution.	e-commerce payment system;n-gram;personalization;real life;twisted nematic field effect	Vincent S.

We propose a social trust model using matrix factorization method to estimate users taste by incorporating user-item matrix. The effect of users friends tastes is modeled based on centrality metrics and similarity algorithms between users. The proposed method is validated using Epinions Dataset. To identify abnormal users in social recommender systems, we propose a classification approach. We define attributes to provide likelihood of a user having a profile of that of an attacker. Using user-item rating matrix and user-connection matrix, we find if the ratings are abnormal and if connections are random. We use k-means clustering to categorize users into authentic users and attackers.

453ef7448c8580c55d7b3b5783012dcde4c76b37	an analysis of group recommendation heuristics for high- and low-involvement items		Group recommender systems are based on aggregation heuristics that help to determine a recommendation for a group. These heuristics aggregate the preferences of individual users in order to reflect the preferences of the whole group. There exist a couple of different aggregation heuristics (e.g., most pleasure, least misery, and average voting) that are applied in group recommendation scenarios. However, to some extent it is still unclear which heuristics should be applied in which context. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the item domain (low involvement vs. high involvement) on the appropriateness of aggregation heuristics (we use restaurants as an example of low-involvement items and shared apartments as an example of high-involvement ones). The results of our study show that aggregation heuristics in group recommendation should be tailored to the underlying item domain.	heuristic (computer science)	Alexander Felfernig;Muesluem Atas;Thi Ngoc Trang Tran;Martin Stettinger;Seda Polat Erdeniz;Gerhard Leitner	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-60042-0_39	pleasure;data mining;recommender system;voting;group decision-making;business;heuristics	AI	-21.94735948965678	-46.99432349900742	95309

b73af20e159103f919d3a0165d41594e3bd124e0	important weblog identification and hot story summarization		In this paper, we propose the architecture for a weblog data mining system. Our objective is to allow users to interactively understand the blogspace by providing a system framework for retrieving relevant weblogs and obtaining highlighted information. We focus on two important technical components in the system. The first is weblog ranking. We introduce weighted link-based weblog ranking, which ranks the popularity of weblogs according to their entry semantic content and time delay of citation. Furthermore, our weblog ranking algorithms provide the flexibility to rank weblogs not only based on their different roles in the society, but also based on end-users’ different ranking interests. The second component is hot story summarization. A hot story is the discussion that attracts various weblogs’ attention. Influential bloggers are useful in identifying hot conversations because these bloggers are likely to be the leader in such conversations. We propose a method based on first discovering weblogs that take important roles in the society, and then extracting hot story from these important weblogs.	algorithm;blog;blogosphere;broadcast delay;cave story;data mining;interactivity	Yi Wu;Belle L.

However, social information has not been fully used, especially in question and answer Q&A systems. This study describes a contextual recommendation method in which diverse repliers are recommended for new questions using incorporated social information in Q&A communities. We have mined multiple kinds of social information by analysing social behaviours and relations found in a Q&A community and proposed an algorithm to incorporate different social information in various social contexts to perform diverse repliers' recommendations. Recommendation diversity and social contexts have been considered and the properly used social information has been emphasized in this study. We conducted experiments using a dataset collected from the Stack Overflow website. The results demonstrate that different social information makes different contributions in promoting question answering, and incorporating social information properly could improve recommendation diversity and performance, which would then result in the promotion of satisfactory question solving.

2c821e02b734ac353e799cc26899637431c48233	modeling multiple interactions with a markov random field in query expansion for session search		How to automatically understand and answer usersu0027 questions (eg, queries issued to a search engine) expressed with natural language has become an important yet difficult problem across the research fields of information retrieval and artificial intelligence. In a typical interactive Web search scenario, namely, session search, to obtain relevant information, the user usually interacts with the search engine for several rounds in the forms of, eg, query reformulations, clicks, and skips. These interactions are usually mixed and intertwined with each other in a complex way. For the ideal goal, an intelligent search engine can be seen as an artificial intelligence agent that is able to infer what information the user needs from these interactions. However, there still exists a big gap between the current state of the art and this goal. In this paper, in order to bridge the gap, we propose a Markov random field–based approach to capture dependence relations among interactions, queries, and clicked documents for automatic query expansion (as a way of inferring the information needs of the user). An extensive empirical evaluation is conducted on large-scale web search data sets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models.

The method is based on the assumption that friends share some interests and their smartphone usage reflects this. The authors combine a supervised link prediction method with matrix factorization which incorporates latent features acquired from the application usage and Internet access. The latent features are optimized jointly with the process of link prediction. Moreover, the method employs the sigmoidal function to estimate user affinities from the polarized latent user features. To validate the method, fifty university students volunteered to have their smartphone usage monitored for 6 months. The results of this empirical study show that the proposal offers higher friendship prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art link prediction methods.	embedded system;factory instrumentation protocol;interaction;internet access;mathematical optimization;processor affinity;scalability;semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;sigmoid function;smartphone;stochastic gradient descent;supervised learning;usage data	Yuka Ikebe;Masaji Katagiri;Haruo Takemura	2012			pattern recognition;internet privacy;world wide web	AI	-22.22915025981653	-45.54882314731248	95831

Althoug h the efficiency of such advertising systems can be improved if the display is aware of the identity and interests of the audience, this k nowledge is difficult to acquire when users are not actively interacti ng with the display. To this end, we present BluScreen, an intelligent public display, which selects and displays adverts in response to user s detected in the audience. Here, users are identified and their advert v iewing history tracked, by detecting any Bluetooth-enabled devic es they are carrying (e.g. phones, PDAs, etc.). Within BluScreenwe have implemented an agent system that utilises an auction-based marke tpl ce to efficiently select adverts for the display, and deployed thi s within an installation in our Department. We demonstrate, by means of an empirical evaluation, that the performance of this auction-b ased mechanism when used with our proposed bidding strategy, efficien tly selects the best adverts in response to the audience presence. We b nchmarked our advertising method with two other commonly appli ed selection methods for displaying adverts on public display s; specifically theRound-Robinand theRandomapproaches.

An overlay network specifies the logical connections among peers in a network and is distinct from the physical connections of the network. It determines the order in which peers will be queried when a user is searching for a specific file. To better understand the role of the network overlay structure in the performance of peer-to-peer file sharing protocols, we compare several methods for creating overlay networks. We analyze the networks using data from a campus network for peer-to-peer file sharing that recorded anonymized data on 6,528 users sharing 291,925 music files over an 81-day period. We propose a novel protocol for overlay creation based on a model of user preference identified by latent-variable clustering with hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs). Our simulations and empirical studies show that the clusters of songs created by HDPs effectively model user behavior and can be used to create desirable network overlays that outperform alternative approaches.	cluster analysis;granular computing;overlay network;peer-to-peer file sharing;simulation;social network	Andrew S.

Gesture-based interaction usually requires vision-based recognition and classification of the gesture from the swarm. At this aim, existing methods for cooperative sensing and recognition make use of distributed consensus algorithms, which include for instance averaging and frequency counting. In this work we present a distributed consensus protocol that allows robot swarms to learn efficiently gestures from online interactions with a human teacher. The protocol also facilitates the integration of different consensus algorithms. Experiments have been performed in emulation using on real data acquired by a swarm of robots. The results indicate that effectively exploiting the collective decision-making of the swarm is a viable way to rapidly achieve good learning performance.	algorithm;consensus (computer science);experiment;horizontal situation indicator;interaction;robot;software deployment;swarm	Jawad Nagi;Hung Quoc Ngo;Luca Maria Gambardella;Gianni A.

0a710c257c022d3eef1f9d55a346209b51487134	a temporally heterogeneous survival framework with application to social behavior dynamics		Social behavior dynamics is one of the central building blocks in understanding and modeling complex social dynamic phenomena, such as information spreading, opinion formation, and social mobilization. While a wide range of models for social behavior dynamics have been proposed in recent years, the essential ingredients and the minimum model for social behavior dynamics is still largely unanswered. Here, we find that human interaction behavior dynamics exhibit rich complexities over the response time dimension and natural time dimension by exploring a large scale social communication dataset. To tackle this challenge, we develop a temporal Heterogeneous Survival framework where the regularities in response time dimension and natural time dimension can be organically integrated. We apply our model in two online social communication datasets. Our model can successfully regenerate the interaction patterns in the social communication datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art baselines. Meanwhile, the learnt parameters and discovered statistical regularities can lead to multiple potential applications.	baseline (configuration management);experiment;han unification;international bibliography of the social sciences;response time (technology);social dynamics	Linyun Yu;Peng Cui;Chaoming Song;Tianyang Zhang;Shiqiang Yang	2017		10.1145/3097983.3098189	artificial intelligence;data mining;computer science;machine learning;multiple time dimensions;baseline (configuration management);response time;human behavior;social dynamics	ML	-20.223974851501712	-38.07283234890589	97402

On a test data, FRM shows significant improvement in CTR prediction as compared to earlier click models.	ad serving;online advertising;server (computing);test data	Xin Xin;Irwin King;Ritesh Agrawal;Michael R.

477d10cca3a0214489c3449686fa262d06932fac	a heterogeneous hidden markov model for mobile app recommendation	recommender systems;app recommendation;mobile apps;heterogeneous models	Recent proliferation of ubiquitous smart phones has led to the emergence of a wide variety of apps. Selecting apps through keyword search or recommendations from friends or social networks (e.g., Facebook) may not match the real preferences of users, especially when the need is just-in-time and context specific. Although there are many collaborative filtering approaches that are capable of generating time-aware recommendations, most of them work on modeling of the time stamps (the time that events happen) rather than modeling of the sequential patterns (in cases that time stamps are not available) as well as investigating the factors behind those patterns. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for modeling three important factors governing the app installation of smart phone users: (1) short-term context, (2) co-installation pattern, and (3) random choice. Specifically, we use a hidden Markov model equipped with heterogeneous emission distributions to incorporate these factors. Apps being installed are probabilistically categorized into one of these factors, and app recommendations for users are carried out accordingly. This coherent model can be inferred effectively by using Gibbs sampling. The formulation has a significant advantage that the performance is less sensitive to data sparsity and incompleteness. Empirical results show that it has higher performance in recommending mobile apps to smart phone users, measured in terms of precision and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Besides, the proposed model allows the nature of the apps, with respect to the three factors, to be revealed as well as the extent to which each user is affected by the three factors to be inferred, providing additional insights on the users’ behavior.	app store;baseline (configuration management);categorization;coherence (physics);collaborative filtering;emergence;gibbs sampling;hidden markov model;information privacy;markov chain;midwoofer-tweeter-midwoofer;mobile app;multinomial logistic regression;receiver operating characteristic;sampling (signal processing);search algorithm;smartphone;social network;sparse matrix;test data;the movies	Victor C.

This paper shows how a content selection algorithm has been implemented using an efficient combination of XML/XSL technology and the framework of RST for discourse modeling. The system generates multilingual documents adapted to user profiles in a learning environment for the web. This CourseViewGenerator applies simplified RST schemes to the elaboration of a master document in XML from which content segments are chosen to suit the user's needs. The personalisation of the document is achieved through the application of a sequence of filtering levels of text selection based on the user aspects given as input. These cascading filters are implemented in XSL.	intel matrix raid;personalization;selection (user interface);selection algorithm;user profile;xml	Guillermo Barrutieta Anduiza;Joseba Abaitua;Josuka Diaz-Labrador	2002			well-formed document;computer science;database;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-32.21464129632428	-48.289752502191575	97732
4e6a46eb4cb6ef7d50758d69b1a5d8febf9ad2fd	automated link generation for sensor-enriched smartphone images	collaboration;hyperlinking;smartphone;images	The ubiquity of the smartphones makes them ideal platforms for generating in-situ content. In well-attended events, photos captured by attendees have diverse views that could be subjected to occlusion and abnormal lighting effects that could obscure the view. Such unstructured photo collections also have significant redundancy. Thus, a scene that is partially occluded or has bad contrast in one photo may be captured in another photo, possibly with higher details. We propose an application called Autolink that automatically establishes content-based links between sensor-annotated photos in unstructured photo collections captured using smartphones, such that users could navigate between high-context and high-detail images. This hierarchically structured image collection facilitates the design of applications for navigation and discovery, analytics about user photography patterns, user taste, and content/event popularity. Autolink includes a framework that constructs this hierarchy efficiently and with little content-specific training data by combining photo content processing with associated sensor logs obtained from multiple participants. We evaluated the performance of Autolink on two real-world sensor tagged photo datasets. The result shows that Autolink is able to efficiently cluster photos at 20 times faster than candidate algorithms, into the appropriate hierarchy with at least 70% precision and 37% better recall than candidate algorithms.	algorithm;hidden surface determination;sensor;smartphone	Padmanabha Venkatagiri Seshadri;Mun Choon Chan;Wei Tsang Ooi	2015	TOMCCAP	10.1145/2808209	computer vision;computer science;hyperlink;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;collaboration	HCI	-26.219137203449733	-44.348011040402085	97903

We thus propose a strategy to analyze users' interactions in mobile networks where users act according to their interests and activity dynamics. Our strategy, named Random rElationship ClASsifier sTrategy (RECAST), allows classifying users' wireless interactions, separating random interactions from different kinds of social ties. To that end, RECAST observes how the real system differs from an equivalent one where entities' decisions are completely random. We evaluate the effectiveness of the RECAST classification on real-world user contact datasets collected in diverse networking contexts. Our analysis unveils significant differences among the dynamics of users' wireless interactions in the datasets, which we leverage to unveil the impact of social ties on opportunistic routing.	entity;interaction;relevance;routing;social network;social structure;synthetic intelligence;telecommunications network;tracing (software)	Pedro O.

e782f9d24021b84132472acc204ddb96c14ff792	a similarity scenario-based recommendation model with small disturbances for unknown items in social networks	similarity scenario based recommendation model excessively mature recommendation issue cold start issue rm ui scheme recommendation probability trust based recommendation model social network unknown item small disturbance;social networking online probability recommender systems;social network services collaboration filtering computational modeling analytical models probabilistic logic recommender systems;social networks recommendation system small recommendation probability trust	In existing recommendation systems, there exist the issues of “cold start” and “excessively mature recommendation,” which cause the recommendation systems to have weak effectiveness; thus, a trust-based recommendation model with a small recommendation probability for unknown items (RM-UI) is proposed for social networks. In the RM-UI scheme, the recommendation values of items are primarily derived from the probabilities calculated by a similar mature recommendation system during the initiation stage of the recommendation system. Thus, the “cold start” phenomenon can be overcome. When the recommendation system enters the period of maturation, the recommendation probabilities mainly adopt the recommendation values computed by the self-system. However, in the existing recommendation systems, there remains the problem of “excessively mature recommendation,” which causes the system to lose the opportunity to recommend more optimized items. Thus, in the RM-UI scheme, except for recommending items with higher recommendation probabilities, we recommend items with lower recommendation probabilities with a small probability to enable those items that can bring greater welfare to recommendation systems to be recommended. This breaks the weakness of a confined recommendation that exists in previous recommendation systems, and it enlarges the welfare of the system. After theoretical analysis, it has been proven that the RM-UI scheme can achieve greater welfare than the previous recommendation scheme and gain more vitality. Experiments based on real social network data are conducted to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the RM-UI scheme: in the initiation stage, the performance criteria of precision ratio, recall ratio, and F1-measure are improved by approximately 21.08%, 21.57%, and 21.32%, respectively, over the previous schemes, and in the mature stage, although the three indications are similar to those of the previous schemes, the improvement in the overall revenue of the system is 17.6%.	cold start;existential quantification;experiment;f1 score;polynomial-time approximation scheme;recommender system;social network;user interface	Ting Li;Anfeng Liu;Changqin Huang	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2647236	computer science;knowledge management;data mining;world wide web	Web+IR	-21.35690528185654	-46.8054427069799	98143

A crucial problem for these repositories remains timely and appropriate document access. In this article, we borrow a model from psychological research on human memory, which has long studied retrieval of memory items based on frequency and recency rates of past item occurrences. Specifically, the model uses frequency and recency rates of prior document accesses to predict future document requests. The model is illustrated by analyzing the log file of document accesses to the Georgia Institute of Technology World Wide Web (WWW) repository, a large multimedia respository exhibiting high access rates. Results show that the model predicts document access rates with a reliable degree of accuracy. We describe extensions to the basic approach that combine the recency and frequency analyses and which incorporate respository structure and document type. These results have implications for the formulation of descriptive user models of information access in large repositories. In addition, we sketch applications in the areas of design of information systems and interfaces and their document-caching algorithms.	algorithm;database;information access;information system;library (computing);software repository;www;world wide web	Mimi Recker;James E.

While existing systems tend to rely on expensive computation of comparatively largedimension data sets, ours leverages information from a small number of fundamentally different sensor measurements that provide context information pertaining the person's location, and action information by observing the motion of the body and arms. Camera nodes are placed on the ceiling to track people in the environment, and place them in the context of a building map where areas and objects of interest are premarked. Additionally, a single inertial sensor node is placed on the subject's arm to infer arm pose, heading and motion frequency using an accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. These four measurements are parsed using a lightweight hierarchy of finite state machines, yielding recognition rates with high precision and recall values (0.92 and 0.93, respectively).	activity recognition;brushing and linking;coat of arms;computation;course (navigation);demarcation point;finite-state machine;gyroscope;heuristic;overhead (computing);parsing;pose (computer vision);precision and recall;prototype;relevance;sensor node;tracing (software);wearable computer	Thiago Teixeira;Deokwoo Jung;Gershon Dublon;Andreas Savvides	2009	2009 Third ACM/IEEE International Conference on Distributed Smart Cameras (ICDSC)	10.1109/ICDSC.2009.5289370	acceleration;embedded system;computer vision;simulation;gravity;computer science;image sensor;finite-state machine;silicon;accelerometer	Robotics	-32.86864871341535	-42.665386872082166	98528

Developing such a distributed, physical, interpretable representation of objects will facilitate intelligent agents to better explore and interact with the world. In this paper, we study physical primitive decomposition—understanding an object through its components, each with physical and geometric attributes. As annotated data for object parts and physics are rare, we propose a novel formulation that learns physical primitives by explaining both an object’s appearance and its behaviors in physical events. Our model performs well on block towers and tools in both synthetic and real scenarios; we also demonstrate that visual and physical observations often provide complementary signals. We further present ablation and behavioral studies to better understand our model and contrast it with human performance.	approximation algorithm;human reliability;ibm notes;intelligent agent;synthetic intelligence	Zhijian Liu;William T.

1408064da55d6d60c6afd722e179419d34433a21	a hybrid model for linking multiple social identities across heterogeneous online social networks		Automated online profiling consists of the accurate identification and linking of multiple online identities across heterogeneous online social networks that correspond to the same entity in the physical world. The paper proposes a hybrid profile correlation model which relies on a diversity of techniques from different application domains, such as record linkage and data integration, image and text similarity, and machine learning. It involves distance-based comparison methods and the exploitation of information produced by a social network identification process for use as external knowledge towards searches on other social networks; thus, the remaining identification tasks for the same individual are optimized. The experimental study shows that, even with limited resources, the proposed method collects and combines accurate information effectively from different online sources in a fully-automated way. The mined knowledge then becomes a powerful toolkit to carry out social engineering and other attacks, or for profit and decision-making data mining purposes.	coefficient;data mining;database schema;digital footprint;experiment;lexicographical order;linkage (software);machine learning;mined;performance evaluation;personally identifiable information;social engineering (security);social network;user profile	Athanasios Kokkos;Theodoros Tzouramanis;Yannis Manolopoulos	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-51963-0_33	distributed computing	AI	-24.698811712399053	-50.63731540103487	99161

User similarity is usually calculated by cosine similarity or Pearson correlation coefficient. However, both of them consider only the direction of rating vectors, and suffer from a range of drawbacks. To solve these issues, we propose a novel Bayesian similarity measure based on the Dirichlet distribution, taking into consideration both the direction and length of rating vectors. Further, our principled method reduces correlation due to chance. Experimental results on six real-world data sets show that our method achieves superior accuracy.	bayesian network;cos;coefficient;collaborative filtering;cosine similarity;information retrieval;network interface device;numerical analysis;proof-carrying code;recommender system;similarity measure;tier 2 network;word lists by frequency	Guibing Guo;Jie Zhang;Neil Yorke-Smith	2013			computer science;pattern recognition;data mining;mathematics;information retrieval	AI	-20.840515307323894	-48.717552151951416	99229

This paper presents the tool STRATDYN, developed as an add-on module to the Web Usage Miner WUM. WUM not only discovers frequent sequences, but it also allows the inspection of the different paths through the site. STRATDYN extends these capabilities: It tests differences between navigation patterns, described by a number of measures of success and strategy, for statistical significance. This can help to single out the relevant differences between users' behaviors, and it can determine whether a change in the site's design has had the desired effect. STRATDYN also exploits the site's semantics in the classification of navigation behavior and in the visualization of results, displaying navigation patterns as alternative paths through a strategy space. This helps to understand the Web logs, and to communicate analysis results to non-experts. Two case studies investigate search in an online catalog and interaction with an electronic shopping agent in an online store. They show how the results of analysis can lead to proposals for improving a Web site. These highlight the importance of investigating measures not only of eventual success, but also of process, to help users navigate towards the site's offers.	add-ons for firefox;affinity analysis;aggregate data;analysis of algorithms;association rule learning;blog;chi;cognition;complementarity theory;computational complexity theory;context-free language;contingency table;continuation;data mining;expressive power (computer science);grams;graphical user interface;interaction;interactivity;microsoft outlook for mac;numerical analysis;online shopping;pattern matching;personalization;regular expression;rewrite (programming);testbed;user modeling;web mining;web navigation;web page;word lists by frequency;world wide web	Bettina Berendt	2002	Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery	10.1023/A:1013280719795	sequential pattern mining;web mining;web modeling;simulation;visualization;computer science;data mining;statistical significance;world wide web;satisfiability	HCI	-31.313434887315587	-50.76271192006142	99633

Social networking is generating an incredible amount of information that is sometimes difficult for users to process, especially from mobile phones. Several links, activities, and recommendations are proposed by networked friends every hour, which together are nearly impossible to manage. There is a need to filter and make accessible such information to users, which is the motivation behind developing a mobile recommender that exploits social network information. Thus, in this paper, we propose the design and the implementation of a SOcial Mobile Activity Recommender (SOMAR) that can integrate Facebook social network mobile data and sensor data to propose activities to the user. The recommendations are completely calculated in situ in the mobile device with an embedded data mining component that is the basis to compute a social graph of the user relationships that will be later used for the recommendation process. The paper also presents some experiments that analyze the performance of the proposed method.	computation;data mining;embedded system;experiment;mobile device;mobile phone;recommender system;social graph;social network	Andrea Zanda;Ernestina Menasalvas Ruiz;Santiago Eibe	2011	2011 11th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications	10.1109/ISDA.2011.6121704	mobile search;mobile web;mobile database;computer science;social mobility;mobile device;multimedia;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;recommender system;social network	Mobile	-24.047258709455246	-47.10817789895614	99788
8dc9aabec17aaba063eefa4e2c352d8dbf4528e0	metalearning and recommender systems: a literature review and empirical study on the algorithm selection problem for collaborative filtering		The problem of information overload motivated the appearance of Recommender Systems. From the several open problems in this area, the decision of which is the best recommendation algorithm for a specific problem is one of the most important and less studied. The current trend to solve this problem is the experimental evaluation of several recommendation algorithms in a handful of datasets. However, these studies require an extensive amount of computational resources, particularly processing time. To avoid these drawbacks, researchers have investigated the use of Metalearning to select the best recommendation algorithms in different scopes. Such studies allow to understand the relationships between data characteristics and the relative performance of recommendation algorithms, which can be used to select the best algorithm(s) for a new problem. The contributions of this study are two-fold: 1) to identify and discuss the key concepts of algorithm selection for recommendation algorithms via a systematic literature review and 2) to perform an experimental study on the Metalearning approaches reviewed in order to identify the most promising concepts for automatic selection of recommendation algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Although, a set of movie recommendation systems have been proposed, most of these either cannot recommend a movie to the existing users efficiently or to a new user by any means. In this paper we propose a movie recommendation system that has the ability to recommend movies to a new user as well as the others. It mines movie databases to collect all the important information, such as, popularity and attractiveness, required for recommendation. It generates movie swarms not only convenient for movie producer to plan a new movie but also useful for movie recommendation. Experimental studies on the real data reveal the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed system.	algorithm;angular defect;data mining;database;experiment;movielens;recommender system;swarm;the movies	Sajal Halder;A.

The recommendation of friends in academic social networks is to use scholarsu0027 social genes to recommend scholars who have similar social genes with that scholar. In order to consider the social network structure of users and the attributes of users themselves, SPDNA (Scholar Profile DNA) model is proposed in this paper. The SPDNA model is the user attributes, user preference factor will be extracted according to the DNA model, while the user is formed in the academic social networku0027s influence as the user influence factor, SPDNA factor is used to measure the size of the carrier. The constructed SPDNA model can reflect the personal attributes and behavior preferences of users in academic social networks, and also consider the influence of users in social networks. In the recommended for the user, according to each user to get the SPDNA string matching factor, then the various factors of the SPDNA string similarity calculation summation, then the similarity value obtained in TopK sequencing, end user recommendation set by user influence factor threshold filtering. In addition, through experiments and comparisons, the SPDNA model proposed in this paper also achieves good results in the recommendation of friends, and provides a new solution for the recommendation of friends in academic social networks.	experiment;social network;string metric;string searching algorithm	Chengzhou Fu;Yong Tang;Weiquan Zeng;Jianguo Li	2017		10.1145/3127404.3127409	end user;string searching algorithm;data mining;computer science;social network;string metric	Web+IR	-23.88826132469761	-46.027343785395814	99866

One way to overcome this is by basing recommendations on items from different domains, for example recommending movies based on the target user's book item ratings. This technique is called cross-domain recommendation. When basing recommendations on a source domain that is different from the target domain a question arises, from which domain should items be chosen? Is there a source domain that is a better predictor for each target domain? Do books better predict a users' taste in movies or perhaps it's their music preferences? In this study we present initial results of work in progress that ranks and maps between pairs of domains based on the ability to create recommendations in domain one using ratings of items from the other domain. The recommendations are made using cross domain collaborative filtering, and evaluated on the social networking profiles of 2148 users. Initial results show that information that is freely available in social networks can be used for cross domain recommendation and that there are differences between the source domains with respect to the quality of the recommendations.

3d763e753e313fe325380dee2119f7a340819349	on the measurement and prediction of web content utility: a review		Nowadays, various types and large amount of content are available on the Web. Characterizing the Web content and predicting its inherent usefulness become important problems that may benefit many applications such as information filtering and content recommendation. In this article, we present a brief review of the existing measurements and the corresponding prediction methods for Web content utility. Specially, we focus on three close and widely studied tasks, i.e., content popularity prediction, content quality prediction, and scientific article impact prediction. While reviewing the existing work in each of the above three tasks, we mainly aim to answer the following two fundamental questions: how to measure the Web content utility, and how to make the predictions under the measurement. We find that while the three tasks are closely related, they bear subtle differences in terms of prediction urgency, feature extraction, and algorithm design. After that, we discuss some future directions in measuring and predicting Web content utility	algorithm design;categorization;contextual advertising;feature extraction;information filtering system;journal citation reports;scientific literature;software quality;venue (sound system);web content;world wide web	Yuan Yao;Hanghang Tong;Feng Xu;Jian Lu	2017	SIGKDD Explorations	10.1145/3166054.3166056	data mining;computer science;algorithm design;feature extraction;web content;popularity	Web+IR	-23.87731841751148	-49.97679857747725	100245

However, users still face many limitations when searching for the most relevant, most popular, and often most useful video/audio source. This work presents a novel algorithm implemented in the form of an iPhone Application (i.e., App) useful in detecting and classifying the most relevantly searched You-Tube videos A video searching algorithm is first implemented using Google's sophisticated You-Tube Application Interface (API) and is thus integrated with the Objective-C iPhone App. The You-Tube API provides a convenient mechanism for identifying a list of likely video candidates based on a set of search criteria as provided by the user. Next, viewer's comments are extracted from each candidate and subsequently matched with a list of pre-specified key words. A score is computed from the matching algorithm resulting in a classification of the you-tube video. The algorithm is tested on the music video genre available at you-tube. Classification results are applied to 188 music videos as performed by The Beatles.	application programming interface;comment (computer programming);mobile operating system;objective-c;relevance;search algorithm;sensor;streaming media;web search engine	Mark S.

f37e4c7efb73d0f45bafe0c063498665b77c1328	social media as sensor in real world: geolocate user with microblog		People always exist in the two dimensional space, i.e. time and space, in the real world. How to detect users’ locations automatically is significant for many location-based applications such as dietary recommendation and tourism planning. With the rapid development of social media such as Sina Weibo and Twitter, more and more people publish messages at any time which contain their real-time location information. This makes it possible to detect users’ locations automatically by social media. In this paper, we propose a method to detect a user’s city-level locations only based on his/her published posts in social media. Our approach considers two components: a Chinese location library and a model based on words distribution over locations. The former one is used to match whether there is a location name mentioned in the post. The latter one is utilized to mine the implied location information under the non-location words in the post. Furthermore, for a user’s detected location sequence, we consider the transfer speed between two adjacent locations to smooth the sequence in context. Experiments on real dataset from Sina Weibo demonstrate that our approach can outperform baseline methods significantly in terms of Precision, Recall and F1.

fc16695f96172660e8af029035b2acf7c7334170	explaining the emergence of online popularity through a model of information diffusion		This paper proposes a new formal modeling approach to popularity dynamics based on a generic notion of message propagation within society. The approach is demonstrated with two original models of information diffusion. These are a branching model of popularity and a epidemic model of popularity. The first is based on the principles of a branching process, while the second emulates an epidemic equation with a specific infection rate. This allows us to consider the replication phenomena on information diffusion. The approach is validated using a very large dataset collected online that involves keywords in blogs and hashtags on Twitter. Our main results point to an overall good fit of both models, both when the process of popularity grows and when it decays. This is due to endogenous information transfer, as in an epidemic process, but also when the process is initially triggered by an external event. Overall, on balance, our models confirm that popularity builds through message diffusion, which is of the multiplicative kind.	emergence	António Fonseca;Jorge Louçã	2018	Computational & Mathematical Organization Theory	10.1007/s10588-017-9253-5	branching (version control);management science;machine learning;computer science;simulation;branching process;popularity;artificial intelligence;information transfer;epidemic model;infection rate	Vision	-19.318318416559826	-42.4409273628241	101072

LBSNs give users the opportunity, not only to communicate with each other, but also to share images, videos, locations, and activities. In this paper, we have implemented an online recommender system for LBSNs, called GeoSocialRec, where users can get explanations along with the recommendations on friends, locations and activities. We have conducted a user study, which shows that users tend to prefer their friends opinion more than the overall users’ opinion. Moreover, in friend recommendation, the users’ favorite explanation style is the one that presents all human chains (i.e. pathways of more than length 2) that connect a person with his candidate friends.	location-based service;recommender system;social network;usability testing	Panagiotis Symeonidis;Antonis Krinis;Yannis Manolopoulos	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40683-6_7	data mining;recommender system;computer science;social network	ML	-24.15903585917673	-43.80577232244067	101462

Collaborative Filtering (CF), the best known technology for recommender systems, is based on the idea that a set of like-minded users can help each other find useful information. A new user poses a challenge to CF recommenders, since the system has no knowledge about the preferences of the new user, and therefore cannot provide personalized recommendations. A new user preference elicitation strategy needs to ensure that the user does not a) abandon a lengthy signup process, and b) lose interest in returning to the site due to the low quality of initial recommendations. We extend the work of [23] in this paper by incrementally developing a set of information theoretic strategies for the new user problem. We propose an offline simulation framework, and evaluate the strategies through extensive offline simulations and an online experiment with real users of a live recommender system.	collaborative filtering;emoticon;information theory;online and offline;personalization;preference elicitation;recommender system;simulation	Al Mamunur Rashid;George Karypis;John Riedl	2008	SIGKDD Explorations	10.1145/1540276.1540302	computer science;knowledge management;collaborative filtering;machine learning;iterative and incremental development;data mining;cluster analysis;probabilistic latent semantic analysis;singular value decomposition;world wide web;recommender system	Web+IR	-21.41299152057879	-47.910646035716034	102129

Until now, this has been difficult to investigate on a large scale, but the huge volume of data available from online location-based social services now makes it possible to examine the friendships and mobility of many thousands of people, and to investigate the relationship between meetings at places and the structure of the social network. In this paper, we analyze a large dataset from Foursquare, the most popular online location-based social network. We examine the properties of city-based social networks, finding that they have common structural properties, and that the category of place where two people meet has very strong influence on the likelihood of their being friends. Inspired by these observations in combination with the focused organization theory, we then present a model to generate city-level social networks, and show that it produces networks with the structural properties seen in empirical data.	expectation propagation;fits;geosocial networking;location-based service;mobile computing;organizational behavior;social network;vii;whole earth 'lectronic link	Chloë Brown;Anastasios Noulas;Cecilia Mascolo;Vincent D.

However, not all comments are useful to all people as both authors of comments and readers have different intentions and perspectives. Consequently, the development of automated approaches for the ranking of comments and the optimization of viewers' interaction experiences are becoming increasingly important. This work proposes an adaptive faceted ranking framework which enriches comments along multiple semantic facets (e.g., subjectivity, informativeness, and topics), thus enabling users to explore different facets and select combinations of facets in order to extract and rank comments that match their interests. A prototype implementation of the framework has been developed which allows us to evaluate different ranking strategies of the proposed framework. We find that adaptive faceted ranking shows significant improvements over prevalent ranking methods which are utilized by many platforms such as YouTube or The Economist. We observe substantial improvements in user experience when enriching each element of a comment along multiple explicit semantic facets rather than in a single topic or subjective facets.	comment (computer programming);facet (geometry);faceted classification;gene ontology term enrichment;interaction;mathematical optimization;media ecology;personalization;prototype;relevance;social media;user experience;user-generated content	Elaheh Momeni;Reza Rawassizadeh;Eytan Adar	2017		10.1145/3078971.3079004	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;user experience design;social media;subjectivity;ranking	Web+IR	-26.111127351819267	-50.01539124723095	103076

As we move toward ubiquitous computing, there is a great potential for individuals to share all kinds of information about places and things to do, see and buy, but the privacy risks are severe. In this paper we describe a new method for collaborative filtering which protects the privacy of individual data. The method is based on a probabilistic factor analysis model. Privacy protection is provided by a peer-to-peer protocol which is described elsewhere, but outlined in this paper. The factor analysis approach handles missing data without requiring default values for them. We give several experiments that suggest that this is most accurate method for CF to date. The new algorithm has other advantages in speed and storage over previous algorithms. Finally, we suggest applications of the approach to other kinds of statistical analyses of survey or questionaire data.	algorithm;collaborative filtering;e-commerce;experiment;factor analysis;missing data;peer-to-peer;privacy;ubiquitous computing	John F.

Microbloggers can be kept up to date with current information from microblog senders, however, Web users cannot be simultaneously updated by microblogs, to obtain the most recent information, whilst they browse Web pages since these are not updated in real time. To circumvent this time lag and provide Web users with up to date information, it is thought that an appropriate method is to associate microblogs and Web pages. Therefore, we have developed a location-based microblog viewing system to support Web users. Our system can present microblogs that are synchronized with Web pages in order to help Web users grasp the current situation in real time, both easily and effectively. In order to map heterogeneous media, we extract the relationship between microblogs and Web pages by generating queries based on common location names.

Two key concepts in information diffusion are influence and relevance. Influence is the ability to popularize content in an online community. To this end, influentials introduce and propagate relevant content, in the sense that such content satisfies the information needs of a significant portion of this community.  In this paper, we study the problem of identifying influential users and relevant content in information diffusion data. We propose ProfileRank, a new information diffusion model based on random walks over a user-content graph. ProfileRank is a PageRank inspired model that exploits the principle that relevant content is created and propagated by influential users and influential users create relevant content. A convenient property of ProfileRank is that it can be adapted to provide personalized recommendations.  Experimental results demonstrate that ProfileRank makes accurate recommendations, outperforming baseline techniques. We also illustrate relevant content and influential users discovered using ProfileRank. Our analysis shows that ProfileRank scores are more correlated with content diffusion than with the network structure. We also show that our new modeling is more efficient than PageRank to perform these calculations.	baseline (configuration management);information needs;information retrieval;online community;pagerank;personalization;recommender system;relevance;social media;world wide web	Arlei Silva;Sara Guimarães;Wagner Meira;Mohammed J.

064f43634ab519af1aedfceb887ed706167fb7e2	exploring the interactions of storylines from informative news events		Today’s news readers can be easily overwhelmed by the numerous news articles online. To cope with information overload, online news media publishes timelines for continuously developing news topics. However, the timeline summary does not show the relationship of storylines, and is not intuitive for readers to comprehend the development of a complex news topic. In this paper, we study a novel problem of exploring the interactions of storylines in a news topic. An interaction of two storylines is signified by informative news events that play a key role in both storylines. Storyline interactions can indicate key phases of a news topic, and reveal the latent connections among various aspects of the story. We address the coherence between news articles which is not considered in traditional similarity-based methods, and discover salient storyline interactions to form a clear, global picture of the news topic. User preference can be naturally integrated into our method to generate query-specific results. Comprehensive experiments on ten news topics show the effectiveness of our method over alternative approaches.	experiment;information overload;interaction;search algorithm;text mining;timeline	Po Hu;Minlie Huang;Xiaoyan Zhu	2014	Journal of Computer Science and Technology	10.1007/s11390-014-1445-6	multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-24.525107750149637	-50.706815986394055	103534
c892d9b4713ca42487747a2c07d27d94a165fbb8	using a social-based collaborative filtering with classification techniques		In this paper, a social-based collaborative filtering model named SBCF is proposed to make personalized recommendations of friends in a social networking context. The social information is formalized and combined with the collaborative filtering algorithm. Furthermore, in order to optimize the performance of the recommendation process, two classification techniques are used: an unsupervised technique applied initially to all users using the Incremental K-means algorithm and a supervised technique applied to newly added users using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (K-NN). Based on the proposed approach, a prototype of a recommender system is developed and a set of experiments has been conducted using the Yelp database.	collaborative filtering	Lamia Berkani	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-89743-1_24	artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;collaborative filtering;recommender system;k-means clustering;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;social network	Web+IR	-20.812608177088126	-47.795452172778894	103750

With most previous “query-by-example” interfaces used for similarity-based searching, for the same query and music collection a user will always receive the same list of musical pieces ranked by their similarity and opportunities to encounter unfamiliar musical pieces in the collection are limited. Musicream facilitates active, flexible, and unexpected encounters with musical pieces by providing four functions: the music-disc streaming function which creates a flow of many musical-piece entities (discs) from a (huge) music collection, the similaritybased sticking function which allows a user to easily pick out and listen to similar pieces from the flow, the metaplaylist function which can generate a playlist of playlists (ordered lists of pieces) while editing them with a high degree of freedom, and the time-machine function which automatically records all Musicream activities and allows a user to visit and retrieve a past state as if using a time machine. In our experiments, these functions were used seamlessly to achieve active and creative querying and browsing of music collections, confirming the effectiveness of Musicream.	chorusos;collaborative filtering;dimensionality reduction;entity;experiment;flat rate;information retrieval;internet;online music store;organizing (structure);query by example;seamless3d;self-organization;self-organizing map;similarity measure;sorting;streaming media	Masataka Goto;Takayuki Goto	2005			musical;multimedia;computer science;query by example;sorting;ranking	Web+IR	-30.656746815789862	-51.947199689658646	103765
dc4ed2b22123596bb329221a18c8b92176fc7263	multi-level preference regression for cold-start recommendations		Due to the absence of historical ratings of new users/items, cold-start recommendation remains a challenge for collaborative filtering. Many matrix factorization based methods are used to predict new user’s/ item’s latent profile before predicting ratings. This kind of methods is usually non-convex. In this work, we design a new convex framework for cold-start recommendations, multi-level preference regression (MPR), directly to predict the ratings rather than latent profiles. We suppose that ratings are mainly affected by three components: 1) correlation between user’s attributes (such as age and gender) and item’s attributes (such as genre and producer); 2) each user’s preference on item’s attributes; 3) item’s popularity in a group of users with some attributes. Adjusting the impact of the three components, we can tackle three cold-start scenarios of user, item, and system. In the MPR framework, three different learning strategies are discussed: pointwise regression, pairwise regression, and large-margin learning. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve the state of the art in the user cold-start scenario and the best performance in other scenarios.	algorithm;archive;cold start;collaborative filtering;convex function;experiment;linear model;minkowski portal refinement;portland pattern repository;preference regression	Furong Peng;Xuan Lu;Chao Ma;Yuhua Qian;Jianfeng Lu;Jingyu Yang	2018	Int.

41cebe99de3c7ccc9cd76932146bbdd32c6f933f	social media brand engagement as a proxy for e-commerce activities: a case study of sina weibo and jd		E-commerce platforms facilitate sales of products while product vendors engage in Social Media Activities (SMA) to drive E-commerce Platform Activities (EPA) of consumers, enticing them to search, browse and buy products. The frequency and timing of SMA are expected to affect levels of EPA, increasing the number of brand related queries, clickthrough, and purchase orders. This paper applies cross-sectional data analysis to explore such beliefs and demonstrates weak-to-moderate correlations between daily SMA and EPA volumes. Further correlation analysis, using 30-day rolling windows, shows a high variability in correlation of SMA-EPA pairs and calls into question the predictive potential of SMA in relation to EPA. Considering the moderate correlation of selected SMA and EPA pairs (e.g., Post-Orders), we investigate whether SMA features can predict changes in the EPA levels, instead of precise EPA daily volumes. We define such levels in terms of EPA distribution quantiles (2, 3, and 5 levels) over training data. We formulate the EPA quantile predictions as a multi-class categorization problem. The experiments with Random Forest and Logistic Regression show a varied success, performing better than random for the top quantiles of purchase orders and for the lowest quantile of search and clickthrough activities. Similar results are obtained when predicting multi-day cumulative EPA levels (1, 3, and 7 days). Our results have considerable practical implications but, most importantly, urge the common beliefs to be re-examined, seeking a stronger evidence of SMA effects on EPA.

f6764abb13a150978844f694c4aad08f73542812	on the analysis of users engaged in twitter's trend topics		Online Social Networks (OSN) are virtual environments that allow users to exchange messages, interact, and share content. The amount of information flowing through OSN promotes the competition for attention and influence among users who struggle to co-opt other users to share their message. The influence gained by users can be important to call the attention to target topics so that they eventually become Trend Topics (most popular topics within a time frame). In this work, we illustrate how we can apply concepts of network science to analyze the network structure that represents a Trend Topic. As a consequence, we show how to identify important users that contributed significantly to the topic popularity. In addition, we show how we can detect naive artificial efforts, such as bot activities, to increase the popularity of a user and, consequently, the popularity of the topic.	network science;virtual reality	Leandro Y.

6b5d8cbd31612ce0e8eacc028ec3d2d0c750cda1	determining the relative importance of webpages based on social signals using the social score and the potential role of the social score in an asynchronous social search engine		There are many ways to determine the relative importance of webpages. Specifically, a method that has proven to be very successful in practice is to value a webpage based on its position in the hyperlinked graph of the web. However, there is no generally applicable algorithm to determine the value of webpages based on an arbitrary number social signals such as likes, tweets and shares. By taking such social signals into account a more democratic method arises to determine the value of webpages. In this article we propose an algorithm named the Social Score that takes into account an arbitrary number of social signals to determine the relative importance of a webpage. Also, we present a worldwide top fifty of webpages based on the Social Score. Last, the potential role of the Social Score in an asynchronous Social Search engine is evaluated.	social search	Marco Buijs;Marco R.

In this work, we propose a novel algorithm that learns to conduct the interview process guided by a decision tree with multiple questions at each split. The splits, represented as sparse weight vectors, are learned through an L_1-constrained optimization framework. The users are directed to child nodes according to the inner product of their responses and the corresponding weight vector. More importantly, to account for the variety of responses coming to a node, a linear regressor is learned within each node using all the previously obtained answers as input to predict item ratings. A user study, preliminary but first in its kind in cold-start recommendation, is conducted to explore the efficient number and format of questions being asked in a recommendation survey to minimize user cognitive efforts. Quantitative experimental validations also show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both the prediction accuracy and user cognitive efforts.	algorithm;cold start;decision tree;mathematical optimization;sparse matrix;tree (data structure);usability testing;vector graphics	Mingxuan Sun;Fuxin Li;Joonseok Lee;Ke Zhou;Guy Lebanon;Hongyuan Zha	2013		10.1145/2433396.2433451	simulation;cold start;computer science;collaborative filtering;machine learning;decision tree;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval;recommender system	ML	-19.930318436245805	-48.513645885523474	104169
74c93a566f4ba9065c1c0d089e06d6ae6b7c329b	a correlation-aware ml-knn algorithm for customer value modeling in online shopping		For online retailers, it is necessary to select a relatively small set of valuable customers, so as to guide the marketing efforts and increase the profits. Drawing on prior literatures, the repeat purchase, the price sensitivity and the brand loyalty are always viewed as important labels of profitable customers. And the three labels are highly correlated. However, prior researches mostly investigated the three labels separately. Correlations between each pair of the three labels are not taken into consideration. Therefore, this work proposes a correlation-aware multi-label kNN algorithm (CAML-kNN) to model the customer value based on the three labels, as well as to capture the latent correlations among them by generating a super-set of correlated labels. Besides, we also conduct extensive experiments with the real-world data to validate the algorithm’s effectiveness in segmenting customers and profiling the customer value. With the proposed algorithm, we can help retailers generate customer segments accurately, and pave the way for successful target marketing.

Although modeling and predicting in emotion with social media have been proposed, they often require post-investigation such as sentiment analysis. This often limits users to be aware of negative emotional states while publishing content on social media. In this project, we will propose an emotion detection technique by extracting the physiological responses of social media users from smartphone commodity sensors. We aim to provide design opportunities for social media platforms to raise emotional self-awareness of the users while using social media on the smartphone.	emotion recognition;multimedia framework;self-awareness;sensor;sentiment analysis;smartphone;social media	Mintra Ruensuk	2018		10.1145/3267305.3277825	human–computer interaction;self-awareness;sentiment analysis;commodity;social media;publishing;computer science	HCI	-27.294920406250213	-45.15748836395292	104428

In this paper, we propose a knowledge-gap based literature recommendation method to support researchers to fulfill literature support. Firstly, domain knowledge is modeled with the concept map, based on which background knowledge and target knowledge are analyzed. Then, knowledge gap is defined both graphically and intuitively with the knowledge map. To bridge the knowledge gap, we design a graph-based method to explore some suitable knowledge paths, which can help a researcher to learn the requisite knowledge in accordance with cognition pattern. Finally, experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	cognition;concept map;experiment;information overload;knowledge management;personalization	Weidong Zhao;Ran Wu;Weihui Dai;Yonghui Dai	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshop (ICDMW)	10.1109/ICDMW.2015.40	concept map;filter;knowledge base;computer science;knowledge management;ontology;body of knowledge;knowledge-based systems;open knowledge base connectivity;data mining;semantics;procedural knowledge;knowledge extraction;personal knowledge management;correlation;information retrieval;domain knowledge;collaboration	Robotics	-25.61099691776925	-49.77048405076851	104484

badaf9fd77e240f6f45a6fc2e159997b5c85d468	representing a computer science research organization on the acm computing classification system	computer science and information systems;weighted sums;classification system	We propose a method, Cluster-Lift, for parsimoniously mapping clusters of ontology classes of lower levels onto a subset of high level classes in such a way that the latter can be considered as a generalized description of the former. Specifically, we consider the problem of visualization of activities of a Computer Science Research organization on the ACM Computing Subjects Classification (ACMC), which is a three level taxonomy. It is possible to specify the set of ACMC subjects that are investigated by the organization’s teams and individual members and map them to the ACMC hierarchy. This visualization, however, usually appears overly detailed, confusing, and difficult to interpret. This is why we propose a two-stage Cluster-Lift procedure. On the first stage, the subjects are clustered according to their similarity defined in such a way that the greater the number of researchers working on a pair of subjects, the greater the similarity between the pair. On the second stage, each subject cluster is mapped onto ACMC and lifted within the taxonomy. The lifting involves a formalization of the concept of “head subject”, as well as its “gaps” and “offshoots” and is to be done in a parsimonious way by minimizing a weighted sum of the numbers of head subjects, gaps and offshoots. The Cluster-Lift results are easy to see and interpret. A real-world example of the working of our approach is provided. 1 ACM Computing Classification System Fits for Representing CS Research Activities ACM Computing Classification System (ACMC) is a conceptual three level classification of the Computer Science subject area built to reflect the vast and changing world of computer oriented writing. This classification was first published in 1982 and then thoroughly revised in 1998 and it is being revised since [1]. The ACMC is used, mainly, as a device for annotation and search for publications in collections such as that on the ACM portal [1], that is, for the library and bibliographic applications. Here we propose its use for representing research organizations in such a way that the organization’s research topics are generalized by parsimoniously lifting them, after clustering, along the ACMC topology. Potentially, this kind of ACMC representation can be used for the following purposes: i Overview of scientific subjects being developed in an organization. ii Positioning the organization over ACMC. iii Overview of scientific disciplines being developed in organizations over a country or other territorial unit, with a quantitative assessment of controversial subjects, for example, those in which the level of activity is not sufficient or the level of activities by far excesses the level of results. iv Assessing the scientific issues in which the character of activities in organizations does not fit well onto the classification; these can be potentially the growth points or other breakthrough developments. v Planning research restructuring and investment. 2 Cluster Lift Method We represent a research organization by clusters of ACMC topics emerging according to members or teams simultaneously working on them. Each of the clusters is mapped to the ACMC tree and then lifted in the tree to express its general tendencies. The clusters are found by analyzing similarities between topics as derived from either automatic analysis of documents posted on web by the teams or by explicitly surveying the members of the department. The latter option is especially convenient at situations in which the web contents do not properly reflect the developments. Then we need a survey tool. Accordingly, this work involves developing the following tools. 1) A e-screen based ACMC topic surveying device. 2) A method for deriving similarity between ACMC topics. 3) A robust method for finding possibly overlapping subject clusters. 4) A method for parsimoniously lifting topic clusters on ACMC. In the following subsections, we describe them in turn. 2.1 E-screen survey tool An interactive survey tool has been developed to provide two types of functionalities about the research activities in an organization: i) data collection about the research results of individual members, described according to the ACMC topics; ii) statistical analysis and visualization of the data and results of the survey. The period of research activities comprises the survey year and the previous four years. This is supplied with simultaneous “focus + context” navigation functionalities as well as quick interaction with the taxonomy [2]. The respondent is asked to select up to six topics in the third layer of the ACMC tree and assign each with a percentage expressing the proportion of the topic in the total of the respondent’s research activity. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the interface for a respondent who chose six ACMC topics during his/her survey session. Another, “research results” form allows to make a more detailed assessment in terms of research results of the respondent in categories such as refereed publications, funded projects, and theses supervised. The (third-layer) nodes of the ACMC tree are populated thus by respondents’ weights, which can be interpreted as membership degrees of the respondent’s activity to the ACMC topics. Fig. 1. Screenshot of the interface survey tool to select ACMC topics. 2.2 Deriving similarity between ACMC topics We derive similarity between ACMC topics i and j as the weighted sum of individual similarities. The individual similarity is just the product of weights f i and fj assigned by the respondent to the topics. Clearly, topics that are left outside of the individual’s list, have zero similarities with other topics. The individual’s weight is inversely proportional to the number of subjects they selected in the survey. This smoothes out the differences between topic weights imposed by the selection sizes. It is not difficult to see that the resulting topic-to-topic similarity matrix A = (a ij) is positive semidefinite. 2.3 Finding overlapping clusters The issue of determining of the subject clusters can be explicated as the well-known problem of finding clusters, potentially overlapping, over similarity matrix A = (a ij). We employ for this the data recovery approach described in [3] for the case of crisp clustering and in [4] for the case of fuzzy clustering. Here we consider only the crisp clustering case. Let us denote s = (si) a binary membership vector defining a subset of ACMC topics S = {i : si = 1}. The one-cluster criterion to be optimized by the cluster S to be found is expressed as: g(S) = s As/s s = a(S)|S|. (1) where a(S) is the average similarity aij within S and |S| the number of entities in S. This criterion has a simple intuitive meaning as a compromise between too contradicting criteria: (a) maximizing the within-cluster similarity and (b) maximizing the cluster size. When squared, the criterion expresses the proportion of the data scatter, which is taken into account by cluster S according to the data recovery model described in [3]. It should be pointed out that this criterion not only emerges in the data recovery framework but it also fits into some other frameworks such as (i) maximum density subgraphs [6] and (ii) spectral clustering [7]. ADDI-S algorithm starts from S = {i} where i is any topic i ∈ I , and, in this way, produces a number of potentially overlapping or even coinciding locally optimal clusters Si – these are considered then for selection according to their contribution weights g(Si) and the extent of their overlap with the other clusters. The intuition behind this heuristic is that each of the locally optimal clusters is well separated from the rest; therefore, a small number of them covering a major part of the data set is a good representation of the similarities. The algorithm iteratively finds an entity j ∈ S by maximizing g(S±j) where S±j stands for S + j if j ∈ S or S − j if j ∈ S. It appears, for doing this one just needs to compare the average similarity between j and S with the threshold π = a(S)/2. Obviously, the produced S is rather tight because each i ∈ S has a high degree of similarity with S, greater than half of the average similarity within S, and simultaneously is well separated from the rest, because for each entity j ∈ S, its average similarity with S is less than that. 2.4 Parsimonious lifting method To generalise the main contents of a subject cluster, we translate it to higher layers of the taxonomy by lifting it according to the principle: if all or almost all children of a node belong to the cluster, then the node represents the cluster on a higher level of the ACMC taxonomy. Such a lift can be done differently leading to different portrayals of that on the ACMC tree. A cluster can fit quite well into the classification or not (see Figure 2), depending on how much its topics are dispersed among the tree nodes. The best possible fit would be when all topics in the subject cluster fall within a parental node in such a way that all the siblings are covered and no gap occurs. The parental tree node, in this case, can be considered as the head subject of the cluster. A few gaps, that is, head subject’s children topics that are not included in the cluster, although diminish the fit, still leave the head subject unchanged. A larger misfit occurs when a cluster is dispersed among two or more head subjects. One more type of misfit may emerge when almost all cluster topics fall within the same head subject node but one or two of the topics offshoot to other parts of the classification tree (see Figure 3).

We propose and evaluate a machine learning-based approach for ranking comments on the Social Web based on the community's expressed preferences, which can be used to promote high-quality comments and filter out low-quality comments. We study several factors impacting community preference, including the contributor's reputation and community activity level, as well as the complexity and richness of the comment. Through experiments, we find that the proposed approach results in significant improvement in ranking quality versus alternative approaches.	collective intelligence;experiment;information management;machine learning;online community;reputation system;spamming	Chiao-Fang Hsu;Elham Khabiri;James Caverlee	2009	2009 International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering	10.1109/CSE.2009.109	social web;support vector machine;training set;the internet;content management;computer science;machine learning;data mining;database;metadata;world wide web;information retrieval;information system	DB	-23.129389783889664	-50.74133946029897	105121

This study explores academic social network systems and particularly focuses on the data extraction methods to develop social relations. Several studies have used search engines to extract social networks from the Web and some systems get their data by description of their members' relation to others like Social Network Services or Friend-Of-A-Friend documents. Both types of data gathering have their own limitations such as data unreliability and scalability of queries to search engines. In this paper, a basic understanding of the issues in academic social network systems is provided. Different approaches to various problems of retrieving reliable data (relational information), as the major item of making these systems, are briefly described, and possible future research directions are discussed.	scalability;social network;web search engine;world wide web	Alireza Abbasi	2015	2015 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354596	organizational network analysis;social web;web development;computer science;data science;social semantic web;data mining;world wide web;social computing	DB	-24.72904947482448	-50.65401932216223	105182

With the increasing number of users and the interacting frequency between users, tremendous user-generated contents are bursting out every day. Hence, users may face a overload of information. To address the above problem, in this paper, we present SocialRobot, a humanoid intelligent system that has been deployed in Sina Weibo. For its socialization characteristic, we naturally implement it as a virtual user in Sina Weibo. By following and interacting with SocialRobot, high-quality and user-interested content can be recommended to the users from the big social media data. And the need for searching specific information can be satisfied by chatting with the SocialRobot. A crowdsourcing evaluation shows the effective performance of the SocialRobot on resolving the information overload.	artificial intelligence;big data;crowdsourcing;information overload;interaction;social media;socialization;turing test;user-generated content;verification and validation	Ting Liu;Weinan Zhang;Yu Zhang	2014	Multimedia Systems	10.1007/s00530-014-0374-0	big data;computer science;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-26.998807107090443	-46.39622363020886	105461

The site encourages users to form ties with (follow) other users based on mutual interests, and use these ties to discover and share content. In this work, we examine the efficacy and relevance of the Pinterest follow mechanism in driving content discovery and curation. We collect a sample of user activity and find that the vast majority (88%) of the unique users who interact with an average user's content are non-followers. Conversely, only 12.3% of a user's followers interact with any of their pins. Users who discover and repost content from outside their follow network also do not subsequently follow the contributors of that content. Our results strongly suggest that following is neither heavily utilized nor strongly effective for driving content discovery and sharing on Pinterest.	content discovery platform;digital curation;relevance;social network;unique user	Bluma Gelley;Ajita John	2015		10.1145/2675133.2675209	multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-26.75384695146179	-47.55581325938416	105695

Though general search engines with large databases like YaHoo, AltaVista, MetaCrawler are valid it is important that a user constructs a small, personal database of relevant Web pages to his/her interest like Bookmarks. For such a Web page database, we propose a PWM: a personal database of interesting Web pages to a user which he/she can control its construction. First a user gives keywords indicating his/her interest to a system, and it constructs a PWM concerned with the keywords. For building a useful PWM, it is necessary that a user can interrupt the construction of a PWM anytime and instruct a sub-field in which a PWM should be expanded more. For this function, we develop an anytime-control algorithm for multiple Web robots. A density distribution blackboard is used, and an uniform distributed PWM is built. Whenever a system is interrupted by a user it provides a valid PWM in terms of keeping search space wide, and indicates many alternatives on which he/she wants more information. From Web pages in a database, document vectors are generated and used to construct a 2D-map of a PWM by using self-organization maps. A user easily recognizes a PWM through the 2D-map, and gives instruction by clicking a node about which he/she wants more detail information. We made experiments by users and found out that our method outperformed breadth-first search for constructing a useful PWM. As results, a PWM system is considered as a promising approach to assist a user in gathering relevant information in the WWW.	anytime algorithm;robot	Seiji Yamada;Norikatsu Nagino	1999		10.1109/COOPIS.1999.792165	web service;web mapping;breadth-first search;computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;web page;database;distributed computing;uniform distribution;world wide web;information retrieval;search engine	Robotics	-31.91643846963933	-49.583602447536016	105716

Nevertheless, different users may be interested in the same object for different reasons---for instance, the Star Wars movies may appeal to both adventure as well as to fantasy movie fans. In this situation, a sensible strategy is to provide a user with diverse recommendations of how to tag the object. In this paper, we address the problem of recommending relevant and diverse tags as a ranking problem. In particular, we propose a novel tag recommendation approach that explicitly takes into account the possible topics (e.g., categories) underlying an object in order to promote tags with high coverage and low redundancy with respect to these topics. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed approach using data collected from two popular Web 2.0 applications, namely, LastFM and MovieLens. Our experimental results attest the effectiveness of our approach at promoting more relevant and diverse tags in contrast to state-of-the-art relevance-based methods as well as a recently proposed method that takes both relevance and diversity into account.	last.fm;movielens;relevance;tag (metadata);web 2.0	Fabiano Muniz Belém;Rodrygo L.

For many recommender systems, especially the collaborative filtering based ones, neighbourhood formation is an essential algorithm component. Because in order for collaborative-filtering based re- commender to make a recommendation, it is required to form a set of users sharing similar interests to the target user. Forming neighbourhood by going through all neighbours in the dataset is not desirable for large datasets contain- ing million items and users. In this paper, we presented a novel neighbourhood estimation method which is both memory and computation efficient. Moreover, the proposed technique also leverages the common """"fixed-n-neighbours"""" prob- lem for standard """"best-k-neighbours"""" techniques, therefore allows better rec- ommendation quality for recommenders. We combined the proposed technique with a taxonomy-driven product recommender, and in our experiment, both time efficiency and recommendation quality of the recommender are improved."""	recommender system	Li-Tung Weng;Yue Xu;Yuefeng Li;Richi Nayak	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-00670-8_19	e-commerce;computer science;collaborative filtering;machine learning;data mining;database;world wide web;recommender system	ML	-21.15966359478856	-48.72090014291276	106353

We explore the notion that such future state generation is more widespread and forms an integral part of cognition. We call these generated states expectations, and propose that cognitive systems constantly generate expectations, match them to observed behavior and react when a difference exists between the two. We describe an ACT R model that performs expectation driven cognition on two tasks pedestrian tracking and behavior classification. The model generates expectations of pedestrian movements to track them. The model also uses differences in expectations to identify distinctive features that differentiate these tracks. During learning, the model learns the association between these features and the various behaviors. During testing, it classifies pedestrian tracks by recalling the behavior associated with the features of each track. We tested the model on both single and multiple behavior datasets and compared the results against a k NN classifier. The k NN classifier outperformed the model in correct classifications, but the model had fewer incorrect classifications in the multiple behavior case, and both systems had about equal incorrect classifications in the single behavior case.	act-r;alpha compositing;artificial intelligence;automated planning and scheduling;cognition;consortium;floor and ceiling functions;high-level programming language;learning classifier system;robotics	Unmesh Kurup;Christian Lebiere;Anthony Stentz;Martial Hebert	2012			cognitive architecture;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics	AI	-29.432467498516868	-39.60764414984805	106457

This has been accompanied by increased activity in social media platforms in recent years, enabling the dissemination of extreme right content to a wider audience. In this paper, we present an analysis of the activity of a selection of such groups on Twitter, using network representations based on reciprocal follower and interaction relationships, while also analyzing topics found in their corresponding tweets. International relationships between certain extreme right groups across geopolitical boundaries are initially identified. Furthermore, we also discover stable communities of accounts within local interaction networks, in addition to associated topics, where the underlying extreme right ideology of these communities is often identifiable.	clique graph;cybercrime;emergence;interaction network;presence information;radio broadcasting;sampling (signal processing);social media;topic model	Derek O'Callaghan;Derek Greene;Maura Conway;Joe Carthy;Padraig Cunningham	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-45392-2_5	social science;social media;network analysis;computer science;racism;international relations;social psychology;world wide web	Web+IR	-20.292637239744582	-42.79525954691311	106508

Logically, a user in social networks can assess a large number of other users, even if two users have not been directly connected previously. However, a large percentage of trust propagation efforts fail to find reliable trust paths from a source user to a target user because the web of trust in real-world online social networks is too sparse. The success (both quality and quantity) of a trust propagation algorithm strongly relies on the density of a web of trust. The more trust paths that are able to reach the given target user, the more reliable will be the trust estimates based on the trust path with the highest strength. In this paper, we propose an enriched trust propagation approach by combining a homophily-based trust network with an expertise-based trust network, which enhances the density of the trust network. We then evaluate the prediction accuracy and coverage of trust propagation based on various aggregation methods and highlight the most promising method. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In order to solve such problems, the researcher used context information and user's profile. But service history information in users' prof ties can have the problems of being influenced by change of the user's taste or fashion as time passes by. In addition, context information and user's profile can't be properly inter-locked according to situation, which can cause inaccurate predictability.   In this paper, in case a user's taste or fashion is changed as time passes by, the researcher didn't apply bundled-up value to the user's profile but applied different weight according to change of time. And the researcher could solve the problem that context information and a user's profile can't be properly inter-locked according to situation by applying different weight to the result gained by means of collaborative filtering and then by unifying it. In such ways, the researcher could improve predictability.	real-time transcription;recommender system;user profile	Se-Il Lee;Sang-Yong Lee	2008	Int. J.

In this paper, we analyze over two years of data from CiteULike, a social bookmarking system for tagging academic papers. We propose six tag metrics-tag growth, tag reuse, tag non-obviousness, tag discrimination, tag frequency, and tag patterns-to understand the characteristics of a social bookmarking system. Using these metrics, we suggest possible design heuristics to implement a social bookmarking system for CiteSeer, a popular online scholarly digital library for computer science. We believe that these metrics and design heuristics can be applied to social bookmarking systems in other domains.	citeseerx;computer science;digital library;heuristic (computer science)	Umer Farooq;Thomas George Kannampallil;Yang Song;Craig H.

9943b07823a2ffbbdf3d8b1da288226c7bd9f5c2	lce: a location category embedding model for predicting the category labels of pois		The proliferation of location-based social networks, makes it possible to record human mobility using an array of points-of-interest (POIs). Exploring the semantic meanings of POIs can be of great importance to many urban computing applications, e.g., personalized route recommendation and user trajectory clustering. Nonetheless, such information is not always available in practice. This paper aims at predicting the category labels, which will provide a succinct summarization of POIs. In particular, we first propose a Location Category Embedding (LCE) model, which projects user POIs and their associated category labels into the same vector space, and then identify the POIs’ most related category labels according to their similarities. To capture the influence that might affect users’ moving behavior, LCE considers sequential pattern, personal preference, and temporal influence, and further models the connection between the POIs and the three factors. Experimental results on two real-world datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

7b02ece93bee8506132ac4fb7efeb84243e5b91d	understanding lda in source code analysis	source code topic models;latent dirichlet allocation;hyper parameters	Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has seen increasing use in the understanding of source code and its related artifacts in part because of its impressive modeling power. However, this expressive power comes at a cost: the technique includes several tuning parameters whose impact on the resulting LDA model must be carefully considered. An obvious example is the burn-in period; too short a burn-in period leaves excessive echoes of the initial uniform distribution. The aim of this work is to provide insights into the tuning parameter's impact. Doing so improves the comprehension of both, 1) researchers who look to exploit the power of LDA in their research and 2) those who interpret the output of LDA-using tools. It is important to recognize that the goal of this work is not to establish values for the tuning parameters because there is no universal best setting. Rather, appropriate settings depend on the problem being solved, the input corpus (in this case, typically words from the source code and its supporting artifacts), and the needs of the engineer performing the analysis. This work's primary goal is to aid software engineers in their understanding of the LDA tuning parameters by demonstrating numerically and graphically the relationship between the tuning parameters and the LDA output. A secondary goal is to enable more informed setting of the parameters. Results obtained using both production source code and a synthetic corpus underscore the need for a solid understanding of how to configure LDA's tuning parameters.	best practice;burn-in;expressive power (computer science);ibm notes;latent dirichlet allocation;microsoft customer care framework;numerical analysis;sampling (signal processing);software engineer;static program analysis;synthetic intelligence;text corpus	David W.

In this work, we introduce Sentic Web, a new paradigm for the management of social media affective information, which exploits AI and Semantic Web techniques to extract, encode, and represent opinions and sentiments over the Web. In particular, the computational layer consists in an intelligent engine for the inference of emotions from text, the representation layer is developed on the base of specific domain ontologies, and the application layer is based on the faceted browsing paradigm to make contents available as an interconnected knowledge base.	encode;embedded system;faceted classification;hoc (programming language);information;knowledge base;ontology (information science);programming paradigm;semantic web;social media;time complexity;web page;web search query;web service;world wide web	Marco Grassi;Erik Cambria;Amir Hussain;Francesco Piazza	2011	Cognitive Computation	10.1007/s12559-011-9101-8	web modeling;computer science;ontology;artificial intelligence;machine learning;semantic web;social semantic web;data mining;semantic web stack;multimedia;world wide web	AI	-27.224077666979547	-50.08595338316997	107672

The digital revolution and the Internet has brought an abundance of information to users. Recommender systems are a popular means of finding content that is both relevant and personalized. However, today’s users require better recommender systems, able of producing continuous data feeds keeping up with their instantaneous and mobile needs. The CrowdRec project addresses this demand by providing context-aware, resource-combining, socially-informed, interactive and scalable recommendations. The key insight of CrowdRec is that, in order to achieve the dense, high-quality, timely information required for such systems, it is necessary to move from passive user data collection, to more active techniques fostering user engagement. For this purpose, CrowdRec activates the crowd, soliciting input and feedback from the wider community	digital revolution;internet;personalization;recommender system;scalability	Alan Said;Martha Larson;Domonkos Tikk;Paolo Cremonesi;Alexandros Karatzoglou;Frank Hopfgartner;Roberto Turrin;Joost Geurts	2014		10.14279/depositonce-7158	engineering;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-27.042271957340503	-46.221091266516	107826
f48a230876a30d06dd1860cd2bc4c628857d9cc3	holiday syndrome: a measurement study of mobile social network use during holidays		Businesses are interested in marketing over the mobile social network (MSN) during holiday seasons to expand their holiday sales. Understanding the “holiday syndrome” — how people behave during holidays — over the MSN is important to create a successful marketing campaign that delights customers. In this paper, we conduct an empirical measurement study of WeChat Moments (the most popular social network of the mobile messaging app WeChat in China) during the holiday season of Chinese Spring Festival (with 137 million users involved and 329 thousand applications crawled), and present a comprehensive view of the MSN's impact on the social ties among users, user interests, as well as users' migration patterns before, during, and after the holiday. Our research findings suggest that the MSN is predominantly used during holiday seasons for holiday-atmosphere building and experience sharing. It is revealed that there exist strong correlations between the timing and popular topics, and between holiday migration and regional distribution. Our results hold the promise of helping businesses to promote their marketing information dissemination to targeted groups of customers, at the right region, with appealing words, during the holiday season.	existential quantification;instant messaging;mobile social network	Chengliang Gao;Yuanxing Zhang;Kaigui Bian;Zhuojin Li;Yichong Bai;Xuanzhe Liu	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7997039	computer network;china;interpersonal ties;telecommunications;marketing;mobile telephony;computer science;social network;mobile computing;information dissemination;mobile social network	Metrics	-20.898574731794284	-42.607948472418705	107873

acb839ca6b6a578c0dbabfab86e8db11005d8250	tagtour: a personalized tourist resource recommendation system		The resource recommendation is an important service for tourists when they are traveling in an unfamiliar city. A tourist can request the information of food, entertainment and accommodation for her reference, so a recommendation system providing good user experience is highly desirable, which can effectively stimulate the tourism industry. However, the previous recommendation systems usually face the cold-start problem, and the keyword-based querying approach is too inefficient to guarantee the user experience. Considering the limitations above, this demo will introduce an interactive recommendation system named TagTour, which utilizes the tag transfer technique and the users’ interaction to provide more accurate and personalized recommendation results, so as to improve the user experience. In this demo, we will introduce the important components and the relevant techniques of TagTour system, and then demonstrate the system performance by some actual resource recommendation cases.	recommender system	Tian Han;Yongjian Liu;Qing Xie	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-45817-5_62	collaborative filtering;data mining;recommender system;tourism;computer science;user experience design	AI	-29.446280933769557	-47.85160323493124	108648

Many studies have focused on the prediction of the helpfulness rate of customer reviews to find the helpful reviews which are traditionally determined by the helpful voting results. In our study, we find that the helpfulness voting result of an online review is not constant over time. Therefore, predicting the voting result based on the analysis of text is not enough; the temporal issue must be considered. We propose a system that can rank the reviews based on a set of linguistic features with a linear regression model. To evaluate our system, we collect Chinese custom reviews in eight product categories (books, digital cameras, tablet PC, backpacks, movies, men shoes, toys, and cell phones) from Amazon.cn with the voting result on the helpfulness of the reviews. Since the voting result may be affected by voting time and total voting number, we define a new evaluation index and compare the regression results. The results show that the system has less prediction error when it takes the time information into the prediction model.

The proposed strategies are Most Pleasure, Best of All and Genetic Algorithm Weighting. The evaluation using the HetRec 2011 MovieLens 2k dataset with five different metadata (genres, tags, directors, actors and countries) shows that our proposed ensemble algorithms achieve a considerable 7% improvement in the Mean Average Precision even with state-of-art collaborative filtering algorithms.	collaborative filtering;ensemble learning;genetic algorithm;information retrieval;movielens;recommender system	Bruno Souza Cabral;Renato Dompieri Beltrao;Marcelo G.

A hybrid social network for building social communities for a university community is presented. The system employed the semantic ontology for an offline/online social network site (SNS) using a Mobile Ad Hoc Network. It captures the core features of an SNS including profile creation, friend invite/search, group formation, chatting/messaging, blogging and voting. Three core frameworks – the peer2me framework, SMSN semantic mobile social network framework and Peoplepods framework were considered in the implementation phase. The results show remarkable matching performance for prosumers with similar interests with relevance close to unity. The social network was able to capture the needs of the university students by serving as a handy direction to popular locations within the campus.	blog;bluetooth;handy board;java platform, micro edition;mobile device;mobile social network;online and offline;relevance;spamming;turbulence	O.

It has thus become important to construct personalized user profiles for use in recommending TV programs in order to effectively personalize TV viewing. We have developed a method for automatically constructing a user profile on the basis of the user's viewing history. It creates a hierarchical tree structured graph into which a categorical data set from Wikipedia is transformed using a network clustering algorithm. We also developed a human-device interaction system and carried out evaluation experiments in which ten participants were watched TV programs in their everyday home environment. The results show that the proposed method is more effective than a convebtinal method.	algorithm;categorical variable;cluster analysis;experiment;horner's method;interaction;personalization;potentially unwanted program;real-time transcription;user profile;wikipedia	Masahide Naemura;Masaki Takahashi;Simon Clippingdale;Yuko Yamanouchi;Hiroshi Fujisawa	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB)	10.1109/BMSB.2016.7521929	computer science;multimedia;internet privacy;interactive television;world wide web	SE	-29.55283419886067	-49.833871517984235	110600

We design the visual processing algorithms to track multiple people in the environment and detect dyadic interactions using a discriminative classifier. The locations of the users are associated with semantic tasks based on the functions of the areas. Our learning method then deduces patterns from the trajectories of people and their interactions. We propose an algorithm to compare the patterns of a user in the presence and absence of social interactions. We evaluate our method on a video dataset collected in a real office. By detecting interactions, we gain insights in not only how often people interact, but also in how these interactions affect the usual routines of the users.	algorithm;dyadic transformation;interaction;pattern recognition;sensor	Chih-Wei Chen;Asier Aztiria;Somaya Ben Allouch;Hamid K.

Examples include evaluating responses to a request for quotes (RFQ) for some item and comparison shopping for an item within one or more catalogs. This task is straightforward if the value of the item can be explicitly specified by the evaluator as a function of the attribute values. However, a typical evaluator may not be able to provide the value function in explicit form. In contrast, it is intuitive for them to compare, say, two items and pick the preferable one based on all of the relevant attributes. In this paper we present a method, Q-Eval, that queries the evaluator with selected pairs of items and uses the responses to build a preference model for the evaluator. This model is then used to rank the items in order of the inferred preference. The evaluator can then pick the winning item or items by considering only the top few items in this ranked list. This should result in significant productivity improvement for the evaluator when the number of items to choose from is large. Our algorithm is novel in the way it attempts to derive a stable preference model with only a small number of user queries. This paper describes the algorithm and presents experimental results with real-life data to validate the approach.	algorithm;bellman equation;comparison shopping website;eval;interpreter (computing);real life;request for quotation	Vijay S.

Mining, in real-time, the connection of these distributed data fragments provides a key advantage not only to deliver enriched views, but also to gain insight into interesting sociological aspects. To this aim, we harness the power of Semantic Web technologies as means to easily steer the data integration and analysis. Our overall goal is to build a web-based environment that allows users to discover meaningful, surprising or entertaining connections between events, media and people. In this paper, we present EventMedia, a platform that provides descriptions of events associated with media, and interlinked with the Linked Data cloud. It draws on a live data update and a real-time interlinking to face the natural dynamics of events.

Such context is typically based on the user’s own information. In this paper, we show how social network analysis and the study of the individual in a social network can provide meaningful contextual information. According to the phenomenon of homophily, similar users tend to be connected more frequently than dissimilar. We model homophily in social networks over time. Such models strengthen context inference algorithms, which helps determine future status of the user, resulting in prediction accuracy improvements of up to 118 % with respect to a naive classifier.	social network	Alejandro Rivero Rodriguez;Paolo Pileggi;Ossi Nykänen	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-25591-0_41	socioeconomics;social psychology	Web+IR	-22.251274993336214	-45.011376088595654	111101

In addition to the quality of the content itself, several factors such as the way the content is presented (the title), the community it is posted to, whether it has been seen before, and the time it is posted determine its success. There are also interesting interactions between these factors. For example, the language of the title should be targeted to the community where the content is submitted, yet it should also highlight the distinctive nature of the content. In this paper, we examine how these factors interact to determine the popularity of social media content. We do so by studying resubmissions, i.e., content that has been submitted multiple times, with multiple titles, to multiple different communities. Such data allows us to ‘tease apart’ the extent to which each factor influences the success of that content. The models we develop help us understand how to better target social media content: by using the right title, for the right community, at the right time.	interaction;social media	Himabindu Lakkaraju;Julian J.

The generation of personalized consumer recommendations has become a crucial functionality for many web applications, yet a challenging task, given the scale and nature of the data. One popular solution to creating personalized item suggestions to users is recommender systems. In this work, we propose an approach that integrates community detection with neighborhood-based recommender systems, specifically, the Adsorption algorithm, for recommending items using implicit user preferences. Network communities represent a principled way of organizing real-world networks into densely connected clusters of nodes. We believe that these dense clusters identified by the community detection algorithm will be helpful to construct user neighborhoods for Adsorption algorithm for recommending collaborators and books to users. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations on the DBLP co-author dataset and Book Crossing dataset, the proposed approach of integrating community detection with the Adsorption algorithm is shown to deliver good performance.	algorithm;book;cosine similarity;experiment;organizing (structure);personalization;recommender system;requirement;sparse matrix;user (computing);www;web application;world wide web	Rohit Parimi;Doina Caragea	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshop	10.1109/ICDMW.2014.159	algorithm design;adsorption;computer science;machine learning;data mining;multimedia;world wide web;recommender system	DB	-22.902628496240023	-47.89826766791027	111464

In this paper, we propose a novel CBM model for personalized Web-scale CBM, which addresses the needs of the Web-based CBR systems. The proposed CBM model is constructed based on chunk activation of ACT-R theory and rule-based reasoning. In addition, a basic activation value computation method is given to rank the cases and an algorithm is proposed to select top-N active cases.

ba567a1e8984397676e40f3089940cf460b4dcb2	clda: an effective topic model for mining user interest preference under big data background		In the present big data background, how to effectively excavate useful information is the problem that big data is facing now. The purpose of this study is to construct a more effective method of mining interest preferences of users in a particular field in the context of today’s big data. We mainly use a large number of user text data from microblog to study. LDA is an effective method of text mining, but it will not play a very good role in applying LDA directly to a large number of short texts in microblog. In today’s more effective topic modeling project, short texts need to be aggregated into long texts to avoid data sparsity. However, aggregated short texts are mixed with a lot of noise, reducing the accuracy of mining the user’s interest preferences. In this paper, we propose Combining Latent Dirichlet Allocation (CLDA), a new topic model that can learn the potential topics of microblog short texts and long texts simultaneously. The data sparsity of short texts is avoided by aggregating long texts to assist in learning short texts. Short text filtering long text is reused to improve mining accuracy, making long texts and short texts effectively combined. Experimental results in a real microblog data set show that CLDA outperforms many advanced models in mining user interest, and we also confirm that CLDA also has good performance in recommending systems.

This is particularly an issue when the network is dynamic and is defined by events that occur over time. We present an example of such a scenario in the analysis of edit networks in Wikipedia—the networks of editors interacting on Wikipedia pages. We propose the prediction of article quality as a task that allows us to quantify the informativeness of alternative network views. We present three fundamentally different views on the data that attempt to capture structural and temporal aspects of the edit networks. We demonstrate that each view captures information that is unique to that view and propose a strategy for integrating the different sources of information.	feature selection;information;interaction;random forest;wikipedia	Guangyu Wu;Padraig Cunningham	2014	Knowledge and Information Systems	10.1007/s10115-014-0802-7	organizational network analysis;social network analysis;data quality;biological classification;computer science;dynamic network analysis;artificial intelligence;data science;machine learning;data mining;brand;database;information retrieval;statistics	ML	-19.946560603699016	-44.80867869945268	112767

We frame this challenge as a ranking problem in collaborative filtering (CF). Much of the past work on CF has not focused on evaluation metrics that lead to good top-N recommendation lists in designing recommendation models. In addition, previous work on context-aware recommendation has mainly focused on explicit feedback data, i.e., ratings. We propose TFMAP, a model that directly maximizes Mean Average Precision with the aim of creating an optimally ranked list of items for individual users under a given context. TFMAP uses tensor factorization to model implicit feedback data (e.g., purchases, clicks) with contextual information.  The optimization of MAP in a large data collection is computationally too complex to be tractable in practice. To address this computational bottleneck, we present a fast learning algorithm that exploits several intrinsic properties of average precision to improve the learning efficiency of TFMAP, and to ensure its scalability. We experimentally verify the effectiveness of the proposed fast learning algorithm, and demonstrate that TFMAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation approaches.	algorithm;cobham's thesis;collaborative filtering;experiment;information retrieval;map;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;scalability	Yue Shi;Alexandros Karatzoglou;Linas Baltrunas;Martha Larson;Alan Hanjalic;Nuria Oliver	2012		10.1145/2348283.2348308	computer science;theoretical computer science;collaborative filtering;machine learning;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-19.30616922033485	-48.57755606452586	112974

Nowadays concept maps (CMs) are widely used in many fields and there are many tools assisting users in constructing a CM. Nevertheless, some users may also have difficulties in extracting a CM from a text. To cope with this problem, an intelligent interactive tool for scaffolding concept map construction is proposed to assist users in CM construction. A preliminary experiment has been conducted to evaluate the efficiency of this tool. The experimental results show that the proposed tool has some beneficial effects on helping users construct a CM.

In an effort to gather more reviews, many websites encourage user interactions such as allowing one user to subscribe to another. Do these interactions actually facilitate the generation of product reviews, and more important, what kind of reviews do such interactions induce? We study these questions using data from epinions.com, one of the largest product review websites where users can subscribe to one another. By applying both panel data and flexible matching methods, we find that as users become more popular, they produce more reviews and more objective reviews; however, their numeric ratings systematically change, and become more negative and more varied. Such tradeoff has not been previously documented, and has important implications for not just product review websites, but user-generated content sites as well.	interaction;panel data;review site;user-generated content	Paulo B.

To make good predictions it is not sufficient to judge the performance, because a good recommender should offer useful and diverse items that fit to different interest choices and tastes of users. Unfortunately, the lack of diversity and the stability in recommender systems over the user's profile dynamicity become a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy hybrid diversified recommendation system able to generate multi-taste recommendations depending on the user's profile variation. Due to the fuzziness and uncertainty in user's profile, the system allows users belonging to different clusters using a fuzzy-based collaborative filtering combined with a content-based filtering algorithm. To identify the user's neighbourhood, a novel similarity measure is proposed. To increase diversity in recommended lists, subsets from Top-N recommended lists in similar clusters, are selected according to users membership degrees. Several experiments are conducted on Movilens dataset to prove the proposal's effectiveness.

The model builds on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and the Author-Topic (AT) model, adding the key attribute that distribution over topics is conditioned distinctly on both the sender and recipient—steering the discovery of topics according to the relationships between people.

In this paper, we explore the potentiality of phone call log as a context source to modeling call response behavior of individual mobile users. Towards this, we present our initial work to generating temporal rules that capture the user's dominant call response behavior at various times of the day and days of the week, utilizing phone call log. Our preliminary experimental results on real datasets show that context information in call log can be used to model individual's phone call response behavior with high accuracy.	behavior model;behavioral modeling;interrupt;mobile phone	Iqbal H.

Recent experimental evidence suggests that resonance processes in the observer's motor system are crucially involved in our ability to understand actions of others', to infer their goals and even to comprehend their action-related language. In this paper, we present a control architecture for human-robot collaboration that exploits this close perception-action linkage as a means to achieve more natural and efficient communication grounded in sensorimotor experiences. The architecture is formalized by a coupled system of dynamic neural fields representing a distributed network of neural populations that encode in their activation patterns goals, actions and shared task knowledge. We validate the verbal and nonverbal communication skills of the robot in a joint assembly task in which the human-robot team has to construct toy objects from their components. The experiments focus on the robot's capacity to anticipate the user's needs and to detect and communicate unexpected events that may occur during joint task execution.	behavior;communication skills (observable entity);encode (action);experience;experiment;human–robot interaction;inference;linkage (software);nonverbal communication;physical object;population;resonance;risk management;robot;social communication disorder	Estela Bicho;Luis Louro;Wolfram Erlhagen	2010		10.3389/fnbot.2010.00005	psychology;human–robot interaction;nonverbal communication;neuroscience;simulation;computer science;bioinformatics;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mirror neuron;communication	Robotics	-28.564890986958083	-39.540636536145776	114355

If researchers have a clear picture about their “customers” in mind they can aim at building and evaluating their systems exactly inside the different socio-cultural environments of such music listeners. Since music is in most cases embedded into a socio-cultural process we propose especially to evaluate MIR applications outside the lab during daily activities. For this purpose we designed a mobile music recommendation system relying on a trimodal music similarity metric, which allows for subjective on-the-fly adjustments of recommendations. It offers online access to large-scale metadata repositories as well as an audio database containing 1000 songs. We did first smallscale evaluations of this approach and came to interesting results regarding the perception of song similarity concerning the relations between sound, cultural issues and lyrics. Our paper will also give insights to the three different underlying approaches for song similarity computation (sound, cultural issues, lyrics), focusing in detail on a novel clustering of album reviews as found at online music retailers.	cluster analysis;computation;embedded system;mir (computer);mind;online music store;recommender system	Stephan Baumann;Tim Pohle;Shankar Vembu	2004			ecological validity;computer science;machine learning;multimedia;world wide web;recommender system	Web+IR	-28.084461618283413	-46.19279234124178	114357
196eb92a79b50c682bb85d810c646d9bb0bb415f	social role-aware emotion contagion in image social networks		Psychological theories suggest that emotion represents the state of mind and instinctive responses of one’s cognitive system (Cannon 1927). Emotions are a complex state of feeling that results in physical and psychological changes that influence our behavior. In this paper, we study an interesting problem of emotion contagion in social networks. In particular, by employing an image social network (Flickr) as the basis of our study, we try to unveil how users’ emotional statuses influence each other and how users’ positions in the social network affect their influential strength on emotion. We develop a probabilistic framework to formalize the problem into a role-aware contagion model. The model is able to predict users’ emotional statuses based on their historical emotional statuses and social structures. Experiments on a large Flickr dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms (+31% in terms of F1-score) several alternative methods in predicting users’ emotional status. We also discover several intriguing phenomena. For example, the probability that a user feels happy is roughly linear to the number of friends who are also happy; but taking a closer look, the happiness probability is superlinear to the number of happy friends who act as opinion leaders (Page et al. 1999) in the network and sublinear in the number of happy friends who span structural holes (Burt 2001). This offers a new opportunity to understand the underlying mechanism of emotional contagion in online social networks.	artificial intelligence;f1 score;flickr;mind;social media;social network;social structure;structural holes;theory	Yang Yang;Jia Jia;Boya Wu;Jie Tang	2016			artificial intelligence;emotional contagion;complex contagion	AI	-20.09580264693997	-42.981125830004736	114787
5db5d04bc66f169558ae97bb251265759d13c0c3	extracting topic-sensitive content from textual documents - a hybrid topic model approach		Abstract When exploring information of a topic, users often concern its different aspects. For instance, product designers are interested in seeking information of specific topic aspects such as technical challenge and usability from online consumer opinions, while potential buyers wish to obtain general sentiment of public opinions. In this paper, we study an interesting problem called topic-sensitive content extraction (TSCE). TSCE aims to extract contents that are relevant to the samples of topic aspects highlighted by users from a single document in a given text collection. To tackle TSCE, we have proposed a new hybrid topic model which integrates different structures in both topic space and context space. It focuses on identifying contents associated with a specified topic aspect from each document. By modeling gradient documents via term profiles for context modeling and by leveraging local and global differences between probability distributions over words in both topic modeling and context modeling, it has better captured the features of various language patterns. Hence, sentence relevance ranking according to a specific topic aspect is largely improved. The experimental studies on extracting critical contents of specific aspects, including motivation and design solution, from technical patents for design analysis have shown the merits of the proposed modeling.	topic model	Yan Liang;Ying Liu;Chong Chen;Zhigang Jiang	2018	Eng.

Rather than defining affordance in terms of the geometric compatibility between body poses and 3D objects, we devise algorithms that employ physics-based simulation to infer the relevant forces/pressures acting on body parts. By observing the choices people make in videos (particularly in selecting a chair in which to sit) our system learns the comfort intervals of the forces exerted on body parts (while sitting). We account for people's preferences in terms of human utilities, which transcend comfort intervals to account also for meaningful tasks within scenes and spatiotemporal constraints in motion planning, such as for the purposes of robot task planning.	algorithm;motion planning;simulation	Yixin Zhu;Chenfanfu Jiang;Yibiao Zhao;Demetri Terzopoulos;Song-Chun Zhu	2016		10.1145/2992138.2992148	physical quantity;computer vision;simulation;artificial intelligence;force	AI	-30.654386483807578	-41.22118403285621	114883
06382769ae0389d57e8dafeb6188ce65397e4283	cognitive map self-organization from subjective visuomotor experiences in a hierarchical recurrent neural network		Animals develop and use cognitive maps, which are internal models of the external environment, to understand the spatial characteristics of their natural environment. Previous studies have shown that a hierarchical structure of recurrent neural networks contributes to the extraction of high-level concepts in sequential sensorimotor experiences. However, the previous studies did not focus on the spatial aspects of these experiences and did not acquire cognitive maps. We modified previous models and trained the proposed model with the visuomotor experiences of an agent in a simulated two-dimensional environment. The proposed model was trained to predict future visual and motion inputs even when only one modality was provided (crossmodal prediction). The proposed model correctly predicted visual images, even when the agent experienced unknown paths. Comparisons of the crossmodal predictions of the models under different conditions revealed that the crossmodal predictions related to motion resulted in self-organization of the cognitive map. Further experiments of mental simulation abilities showed that two-way crossmodal predictions (from vision and motion only) were required for consistent generation of vision and motion. These results indicated that predictive learning involving integrated vision and motion was necessary for self-organization of spatial recognition with a cognitive map.	artificial neural network;cognitive map;experience;experiment;high- and low-level;modality (human–computer interaction);predictive learning;recurrent neural network;self-organization;simulation	Wataru Noguchi;Hiroyuki Iizuka;Masahito Yamamoto	2017	Adaptive Behaviour	10.1177/1059712317711487	psychology;cognitive psychology;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Vision	-29.450468938814005	-39.70725301930199	115164

In this paper, a bootstrapped partition of a full dataset has been used to gauge the ability of polytomous logistic regression models in predicting classifications of telecommunication subscribers. Coded coefficients of significant predictors facilitated the calculation of log of odds attributed to each group of users and formulation of logistic regression equations. Converted from the results are executed probabilities used for obtaining distinct group memberships. The classification rate obtained from cross-tabulated counts and percentages confirmed the capability of the model. With accurate predictions, the models could provide decision makers a better understanding of individual interactions and group-level behaviors of subscribers, a tipoff for improvement of Short Message Service (SMS) schemes to positively leverage service usage to generate more profit while extending customer satisfaction.	coefficient;data mining;interaction;multinomial logistic regression;polytomy	Rosmina Joy Cabauatan;Bobby D.

Causal relationships between significant patterns are then extracted using the transfer entropy approach. These relationships are used to construct causal graphs of activities, to generate the user profile. In extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, we empirically demonstrate that these causality-based profiles yield a significant increase in performance on activity prediction.	activity recognition;algorithm;causal graph;causality;cluster analysis;experiment;mutual information;non-maskable interrupt;protein structure prediction;sequence clustering;social network;transfer entropy;user profile	Belkacem Chikhaoui;Shengrui Wang;Hélène Pigot	2013	2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)	10.1109/AINA.2013.109	entropy;transfer entropy;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining;probabilistic logic;cluster analysis;computational model	DB	-21.40535182211981	-44.7366552785252	115681

dc9158faa5bafe6035ba3db8da855cff360c997e	integrating collaborative and reclusive methods for effective recommendations: a fuzzy bayesian approach		Collaborative filtering (CF), the most successful and widely used technique, recommends items based on the preferences of similar users. The main potentials of CF are its cross-genre recommendation ability, and that it is completely independent of representation of the items being recommended. However, CF suffers from sparsity and cold start problems. On the other hand, a highly effective variant of content-based filtering (CBF), reclusive methods (RMs) based on the preference of the single individual for whom recommendations to be made, provides a methodology that considers uncertainty and the multivalued nature of item features as well as user preferences in a content-based framework using fuzzy logic approaches. The adoption of RM paradigm has several advantages when compared to CF such as sparsity and new item problem, but it suffers from overspecialization and limited content analysis. In view of the complementary nature of CF and RM, we develop a hybrid recommender system (RS) that helps in alleviating aforementioned problems in each approach. First, we propose fuzzy naive Bayesian classifier based CF (FNB-CF) and RM (FNB-RM) for handling correlation-based similarity problems. To overcome individual weaknesses of FNB-CF and FNB-RM, we develop a hybrid RS, FNB-CF-RM. Effectiveness of our proposed hybrid RS is demonstrated through experimental results using the MovieLens and IMDb data sets.	fuzzy concept;recommender system	Vibhor Kant;Kamal K. Bharadwaj	2013	Int.

We conducted the comparative analysis of the networks generated from the two channels. The relationship we set for each network is the relatedness on YouTube and the co-links on Twitter. From the results, we revealed that the social media influenced the distinct socio-cultural behaviors of their users. Specifically, Twitter network better showed the actual consumption of contents in the field of the k-pop culture than YouTube. From this study, we contributed to offer a novel approach for exploring the socio-cultural behavior of users on the social media.	qualitative comparative analysis;social media	Yonghwan Kim;Dahee Lee;Jung Eun Hahm;Namgi Han;Min Song	2014		10.1145/2567948.2577324	network analysis;computer science;multimedia;internet privacy	HCI	-20.956515044581703	-42.05092901522154	115855

It is thus difficult to get exactly the information we need. It often happens that while reading, we find a word we do not understand and we would need an explanation or some additional information about this word. For this purpose annotations in the Web environment are created and attached to such words. In this paper we propose a method for an automatic extension of the content available on the Web by adding annotations to selected terms (keywords) in the text. The method is designed to be able to insert annotations into the text written in Slovak with a potential to be language independent. Annotations themselves are obtained through publicly available services providing information retrieval. We adapt created annotations taking into account implicit feedback from users in form of click through data. We evaluate the proposed method in the environment of an educational web-based system.	information overload;information retrieval;web application;web content;world wide web	Jakub Sevcech;Mária Bieliková	2011	2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology	10.1109/WI-IAT.2011.219	service provider;text mining;the internet;shape;computer science;information overload;web page;data mining;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval;encyclopedia	Web+IR	-28.586749383372823	-51.118412863678415	115899

We call this method 'trust by the rating of a persona's active audience.' A 'persona', such as 'Display Name' of Twitter (with additional authentication) or 'Claimed ID' of OpenID, denotes an artificial identity to represent one's social position in the user-centric authorization. We utilize the 'persona' to be an object to accumulate the rating of trust for IT services for our trust estimation method. The most significant difference of our trust model and traditional one like PKI is that the trustworthiness of persona is not stable. Therefore, we focused on the implement methods for the sensitivity of the temporal change of a persona's trustworthiness. The basic idea of our 'trust by the rating of a persona's active audience' is similar to the Google Page Rank method. We also try to show that this kind of social web based trust has a possibility to be a global infrastructure for trust.	authentication;authorization;openid;pagerank;persona (user experience);public key infrastructure;trust (emotion)	Shigeichiro Yamasaki	2010	2010 10th IEEE/IPSJ International Symposium on Applications and the Internet	10.1109/SAINT.2010.51	social web;persona;estimation;the internet;express trust;computer science;authentication;authorization;internet privacy;trustworthy computing;privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-23.784911784028992	-46.370339407784776	116324
923e77ddf2e81475da71265c2757aea7ae293c9a	social fingerprinting: detection of spambot groups through dna-inspired behavioral modeling		Spambot detection in online social networks is a long-lasting challenge involving the study and design of detection techniques capable of efficiently identifying ever-evolving spammers. Recently, a new wave of social spambots  has emerged, with advanced human-like characteristics that allow them to go undetected even by current state-of-the-art algorithms. In this paper, we show that efficient spambots detection can be achieved via an in-depth analysis of their collective behaviors exploiting the digital DNA technique for modeling the behaviors of social network users. Inspired by its biological counterpart, in the digital DNA representation the behavioral lifetime of a digital account is encoded in a sequence of characters. Then, we define a similarity measure for such digital DNA sequences. We build upon digital DNA and the similarity between groups of users to characterize both genuine accounts and spambots. Leveraging such a characterization, we design the Social Fingerprinting  technique, which is able to discriminate among spambots and genuine accounts in both a supervised and an unsupervised fashion. We also evaluate the effectiveness of Social Fingerprinting and we compare it with three state-of-the-art detection showing the superiority of our solution. Finally, among the peculiarities of our approach is the possibility to apply off-the-shelf DNA analysis techniques to study online users behaviors and to efficiently rely on a limited number of lightweight account characteristics.	algorithm;behavioral modeling;bioinformatics;dna profiling;fingerprint;similarity measure;social network	Stefano Cresci;Roberto Di Pietro;Marinella Petrocchi;Angelo Spognardi;Maurizio Tesconi	2018	IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing	10.1109/TDSC.2017.2681672	machine learning;distributed computing;computer science;behavioral modeling;dna;fingerprint recognition;spambot;artificial intelligence;similarity measure;informatics;social network;bioinformatics	Security	-21.92769162692653	-41.007607392359816	116386
5ee92623a32a9cb9b40a208fff3e4f9c945efa21	research on application of collaborative filtering in electronic commerce recommender systems		In electronic commerce era, personalized recommender systems are popularly being employed to help users in selecting suitable items to meet their personal requirements. These systems learn about user interests over time and automatically suggest items that fit the learned model of user interests. It is important for companies to develop web-based marketing strategy such as product bundling to increase revenue. Recommendation system is a platform that can be used to reduce the searching cost of users, increase the effectiveness of promotion strategies and enhance loyalty. The core technology implemented behind this type of recommender systems includes content analysis, collaborative filtering and some hybrid variants. Collaborative filtering is a data analysis task appearing in many challenging applications and it can often be formulated as identifying patterns in a large and mostly empty rating matrix. In this paper, firstly, the principle of collaborative filtering recommendation is introduced. Then, describes the workflow of the collaborative filtering algorithm. Unresolved issues of collaborative filtering technology and research directions are pointed out finally.	collaborative filtering;e-commerce;recommender system	Wangjun Zhang	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23324-1_87	marketing;world wide web;information retrieval	ECom	-22.019303041573316	-48.77855996632154	116421

Recent models consider this behavior as a combination of both social and spatial factors. Yet, establishing accurate traces of human groups is difficult: current techniques capture either positions, or contacts, with a limited accuracy.  In this paper we introduce a new technique to capture such behaviors. The interest of this approach lies in the unprecedented accuracy at which both positions and orientations of humans, even gathered in a crowd, are captured.  From the mobility to the topological connectivity, the open-source framework we developed offers a layered approach that can be tailored, allowing to compare and reason about models and traces.  We introduce a new trace of 50 individuals on which the validity and accuracy of this approach is demonstrated. To showcase the interest of our software pipeline, we compare it against the random waypoint model. Our fine-grained analyses, that take into account social interactions between users, show that the random waypoint model is not a reasonable approximation of any of the phenomena we observed.	approximation;defense in depth (computing);interaction;kinesiology;open-source software;pipeline (software);tracing (software);ubiquitous computing;waypoint	Marc-Olivier Killijian;Matthieu Roy;Gilles Trédan;Christophe Zanon	2013		10.1145/2493432.2494526	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;human factors and ergonomics;human-centered computing;machine learning;computer security;measurement;statistics	HCI	-20.99531919620953	-40.91520609841926	116438

After only 7 years of existence, Twitter for instance claims more than 500 million users with more than 350 billion delivered update each day. As a consequence the user must today manage possibly extremely large feeds, resulting in poor data readability and loss of valuable information and the system must face a huge network load. In this demonstration, we present and illustrate the features of MicroFilter (MF in the the following), an inverted list-based filtering engine that nicely extends existing centralized microblogging systems by adding a real-time filtering feature. The demonstration proposed illustrates how the user experience is improved, the impact on the traffic for the overall system, and how the characteristics of microblogs drove the design of the indexing structures.	centralized computing;inverted index;real-time clock;user experience;world wide web	Ryadh Dahimene;Cédric du Mouza	2013		10.1145/2487788.2488011	filter;computer science;microblogging;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-27.196480335765646	-45.53577376525427	116885
71039de3720ad4ea9670835879f5784b5f60505c	matching physical sites with web sites for semantic localization	textual correlation;semantic localization;crowdsourcing	Locations are often expressed in physical coordinates such as an [X, Y] tuple in some coordinate system. Unfortunately, a vast majority of location-based applications desire the semantic translation of coordinates, i.e., store-names like Starbucks, Macy's, Panera. Past work has mostly focused on achieving localization accuracy, while assuming that the translation of physical to semantic coordinates will be done manually. In this paper, we explore an opportunity for automatic semantic localization -- the presence of a website corresponding to each physical store. We propose to correlate the information seen in a physical store with that found in websites of the stores around that location, to recognize that store. Specifically, we assume a repository of crowdsourced WiFi-tagged pictures from different stores. By correlating words inside the pictures, against words extracted from store websites, our proposed system can automatically label clusters of pictures, and the corresponding WiFi APs, with the store name. Later, when a user enters a store, her smartphone can scan the WiFi APs and consult a lookup table to recognize the store she is in. Our preliminary experiments with 18 stores in a shopping mall show that, our prototype system could correctly match the text from the physical stores with the text extracted from the corresponding web sites and hence label WiFi APs with store names with an accuracy upwards of 90%, which encourages us to pursue this study further. Moreover, we believe the core idea of correlating physical and web sites has broader applications beyond semantic localization, leading to better product placement and shopping experience, yielding benefits for both store owners and shoppers.	crowdsourcing;experiment;feedback;lookup table;macy conferences;prototype;scalability;semantic translation;smartphone	Rufeng Meng;Sheng Shen;Romit Roy Choudhury;Srihari Nelakuditi	2015		10.1145/2753497.2753501	computer science;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-30.555710425646968	-44.273223775018806	116998

Central to our approach is a unified graph model with heterogeneous nodes and edges to capture the interrelationship among various entities (e.g., users, posts, images, and tags) in online social media. With the graph representation, we then cast the summarization problem as a graph-based ranking problem by identifying the most representative images regarding to an event. The intuition behind our work is that not only can we crowdsource social media users as sensors to capture and share data, but we can also use them as filters to identify the most useful information through analyzing their interaction in the microblogging network. In addition, we propose a greedy algorithm to encourage diversity among top ranked results for the generation of temporal highlights of targeted events. Our approach is flexible to support different query tasks and is adaptable to additional graph entities and relationships.	crowdsourcing;entity;graph (abstract data type);greedy algorithm;sensor;social media	Jiejun Xu;Tsai-Ching Lu	2015		10.1145/2678025.2701385	computer science;automatic summarization;machine learning;data mining;world wide web;crowdsourcing;information retrieval	AI	-25.038506384918	-51.136628465319895	117130

Academic recommendation services have been developed to help researchers with their literature search, many of which only provide a text-based search functionality. Such services are suitable for a first-level bibliographic search; however, they lack the benefits of today's recommendation engines. In this paper, we identify three important properties that an academic recommendation service could provide for better literature search: personalization, scalability, and exploratory search. With these objectives in mind, we present a web service called theadvisor which helps the users build a strong bibliography by extending the document set obtained after a first-level search. Along with an efficient and personalized recommendation algorithm, the service also features result diversification, relevance feedback, visualization for exploratory search. We explain the design criteria and rationale we employed to make the theadvisor a useful and scalable web service with a thorough evaluation.	algorithm;design rationale;diversification (finance);exploratory search;floor and ceiling functions;inference engine;personalization;relevance feedback;scalability;text-based (computing);web service	Onur Küçüktunç;Erik Saule;Kamer Kaya;Ümit V.

In this work, we propose a new perspective to this problem: how to evaluate the helpfulness of a review from the business owner's perspective.

Consequently, a large amount of social data is produced. For semantic modeling of such data, several social network ontologies are introduced. The most popular is FoaF (Friend of a Friend) ontology. In our research, we are interested in data generated from Facebook social network. Heretofore, the semantic-temporal modeling of Facebook data is not yet studied. Thus, we propose a semantic modeling approach of social data that allows extending the FoaF ontology with Facebook data and temporal information.	foaf (ontology);friend of a friend;information exchange;ontology (information science);semantically-interlinked online communities;simple knowledge organization system;social network	Rim Chiha;Mounir Ben Ayed	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-53480-0_70	foaf;process ontology;data mining;friend of a friend;ontology (information science);computer science;ontology-based data integration;upper ontology;suggested upper merged ontology;social network	Web+IR	-25.90966925578842	-50.06786262505732	117506

Social influence mining in social networks is therefore of critical importance in real-world applications such as friend suggestion and photo recommendation. Social media is inherently multimodal, including rich types of user contributed content and social link information. Most of the existing research suffers from two limitations: 1) only utilizing the textual information, and/or 2) only analyzing the generic influence but ignoring the more important topic-level influence. To address these limitations, in this paper we develop a novel Topic-Sensitive Influencer Mining (TSIM) framework in interest-based social media networks. Specifically, we take Flickr as the study platform. People in Flickr interact with each other through images. TSIM aims to find topical influential users and images. The influence estimation is determined with a hypergraph learning approach. In the hypergraph, the vertices represent users and images, and the hyperedges are utilized to capture multi-type relations including visual-textual content relations among images, and social links between users and images. Algorithmwise, TSIM first learns the topic distribution by leveraging user-contributed images, and then infers the influence strength under different topics for each node in the hypergraph. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of more than 50 K images and 70 K comment/favorite links from Flickr have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework. In addition, we also report promising results of friend suggestion and photo recommendation via TSIM on the same dataset.	digital media;experiment;flickr;interest graph;multimodal interaction;social media;social network;social search;user-generated content	Quan Fang;Jitao Sang;Changsheng Xu;Yong Rui	2014	IEEE Transactions on Multimedia	10.1109/TMM.2014.2298216	computer science;graph theory;machine learning;data mining;multimedia;topic model;world wide web	ML	-20.248407380185974	-45.92371687645811	117861

This paper proposes a behavior-grounded relational classification model that allows a robot to recognize the categories of household objects. In the proposed approach, the robot initially explores the objects by applying five exploratory behaviors (lift, shake, drop, crush and push) on them while recording the proprioceptive and auditory sensory feedback produced by each interaction. The sensorimotor data is used to estimate multiple measures of similarity between the objects, each corresponding to a specific coupling between an exploratory behavior and a sensory modality. A graph-based recognition model is trained by extracting features from the estimated similarity relations, allowing the robot to recognize the category memberships of a novel object based on the object's similarity to the set of familiar objects. The framework was evaluated on an upper-torso humanoid robot with two large sets of household objects. The results show that the robot's model is able to recognize complex object categories (e.g., metal objects, empty bottles, etc.) significantly better than chance.	feedback;humanoid robot;modality (human–computer interaction);object-based language;piaget's theory of cognitive development;relational data mining;semi-supervised learning;sparse matrix	Jivko Sinapov;Alexander Stoytchev	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980417	support vector machine;computer vision;statistical relational learning;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Robotics	-26.667437750664913	-41.3586445308614	117868

Normally, the information in this process is related to opinions and preferences, which are usually expressed through a qualitative way such as linguistic evaluation terms (LETs). However, the LETs may come from different sources such as experts, users, etc., which makes the linguistic evaluation scales (LESs) used in this process probably be different due to their different backgrounds and levels of knowledge. The diversity and flexibility of these LESs determine the quality of information, and further affect the effectiveness of a RS. In this paper, we focus on improving the accuracy of the multi-granular linguistic recommender system by supporting customers to find out the most eligible items according their own preferences. We first propose the probabilistic linguistic vector-term sets (PLVTSs) to promote the application of multi-granular linguistic information. Based on the PLVTSs, we then develop a novel algorithm to tackle multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems with multiple LESs. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the PLVTSs is validated by an illustration of personalized hospital selection-recommender problem. Finally, we point out some possible research directions regrading to the PLVTSs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.		Yuling Zhai;Zeshui Xu;Huchang Liao	2016	Appl.

Even though many researchers have attempted to recognize a user's activities on a mobile device, it is still difficult to infer human activities from uncertain, incomplete and insufficient mobile sensor data. We present a method to recognize a person's activities from sensors in a mobile phone using mixture-of-experts (ME) model. In order to train the ME model, we have applied global– local co-training (GLCT) algorithm with both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the performance. The GLCT is a variation of co-training that uses a global model and a local model together. To evaluate the usefulness of the proposed method, we have conducted experiments using real datasets collected from Google Android smartphones. This paper is a revised and extended version of a paper that was presented at HAIS 2011. & 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.	activity recognition;algorithm;android;co-training;context-aware network;experiment;mobile device;mobile phone;sensor;smartphone	Youngseol Lee;Sung-Bae Cho	2014	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2013.05.044	computer science;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web;activity recognition	Mobile	-24.930208739112246	-43.14938395025807	118069
1de8f514fae3bb3477880e0d64b9538e814a22b5	techniques for comparing and recommending conferences	simulation and modeling;data structures;computer science general;computer system implementation;operating systems	This article defines, implements, and evaluates techniques to automatically compare and recommend conferences. The techniques for comparing conferences use familiar similarity measures and a new measure based on co-authorship communities, called co-authorship network community similarity index. The experiments reported in the article indicate that the technique based on the new measure performs better than the other techniques for comparing conferences, which is therefore the first contribution of the article. Then, the article focuses on three families of techniques for conference recommendation. The first family adopts collaborative filtering based on the conference similarity measures investigated in the first part of the article. The second family includes two techniques based on the idea of finding, for a given author, the strongest related authors in the co-authorship network and recommending the conferences that his co-authors usually publish in. The first member of this family is based on the Weighted Semantic Connectivity Score—WSCS, which is accurate but quite costly to compute for large co-authorship networks. The second member of this family is based on a new score, called the Modified Weighted Semantic Connectivity Score—MWSCS, which is much faster to compute and as accurate as the WSCS. The third family includes the Cluster-WSCS-based and the Cluster-MWSCS-based conference recommendation techniques, which adopt conference clusters generated using a subgraph of the co-authorship network. The experiments indicate as the best performing conference recommendation technique the Cluster-WSCS-based technique. This is the second contribution of the article. Finally, the article includes experiments that use data extracted from the DBLP repository and a web-based application that enables users to interactively analyze and compare a set of conferences.	collaborative filtering;computer cluster;dbl-browser;experiment;interactivity;solaris cluster;web application	Grettel García;Bernardo Pereira Nunes;Giseli Rabello Lopes;Marco A.

However, they havelimitations, including the inability to: (1) capture when the communicationsor contacts take place and (2) explain where the influencecomes from. These drawbacks have limited the studiesabout how the spreading of influence takes place in social networks.In this paper, we present a new word-of-mouth algorithmthat considers the temporality of the communications and keepstrack of how influence travels over the social network.

Delivering such personalized user experiences is believed to increase the long term engagement of users. While there has been a lot of progress in designing effective personalized recommender systems, by exploiting user interests and historical interaction data through implicit (item click) or explicit (item rating) feedback, directly optimizing for users' satisfaction with the system remains challenging. In this paper, we explore the idea of using item-level dwell time as a proxy to quantify how likely a content item is relevant to a particular user. We describe a novel method to compute accurate dwell time based on client-side and server-side logging and demonstrate how to normalize dwell time across different devices and contexts. In addition, we describe our experiments in incorporating dwell time into state-of-the-art learning to rank techniques and collaborative filtering models that obtain competitive performances in both offline and online settings.	client-side;collaborative filtering;contextual advertising;experience;experiment;learning to rank;online and offline;performance;personalization;proxy server;recommender system;server (computing);server-side	Xing Yi;Liangjie Hong;Erheng Zhong;Nathan Nan Liu;Suju Rajan	2014		10.1145/2645710.2645724	simulation;computer science;collaborative filtering;machine learning;personalization;dwell time;multimedia;world wide web;learning to rank	Web+IR	-24.672089949291127	-47.59816127750387	118823

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for context-aware recommendation in browsing assistants based on the integration of user profiles, navigational patterns and contextual elements. In this approach, user profiles built using an unsupervised Web page clustering algorithm are used to characterize user ongoing activities and behavior patterns. Experimental evidence show that using longer-term interests to explain active browsing goals user assistance is effectively enhanced.	algorithm;association rule learning;autonomous agent;autonomous robot;browsing;cluster analysis;coherence (physics);information retrieval;user profile;web page	Daniela Godoy;Analía Amandi	2008	New Generation Computing	10.1007/s00354-008-0044-x	user modeling;computer science;web page;database;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-32.48802814656315	-50.32813862208744	118849

The recent growth of Massively Multi-player Online Games (MMOGs) has provided unprecedented access to large-scale data which enables us to study such complex human behavior in a more systematic manner. In this paper, we consider three different networks in the EverQuest2 game: chat, trade, and trust. The chat network has the highest level of reciprocation (33%) because there are essentially no barriers to it. The trade network has a lower rate of reciprocation (27%) because it has the obvious barrier of requiring goods or money for exchange; morever, there is no clear benefit to returning a trade link except in terms of social connections. The trust network has the lowest reciprocation (14%) because this equates to sharing certain within-game assets such as weapons, and so there is a high barrier for such connections In general, we observe that reciprocation rate is inversely related to the barrier level in these networks. We also note that reciprocation has connections across the heterogeneous networks. Our experiments indicate that players make use of the medium-barrier reciprocations to strengthen a relationship. We hypothesize that lower-barrier interactions are an important component to predicting higher-barrier ones. We verify our hypothesis using predictive models for trust reciprocations with features from trade interactions. Incorporating the number of trades (both before and after the initial trust link) boosts our ability to predict if the trust will be reciprocated up to 11% with respect to the AUC. More generally, we see strong correlations across the different networks and emphasize that network dynamics, such as reciprocation, cannot be studied in isolation on just a single type of connection.	computational social science;experiment;interaction;predictive modelling	Ayush Singhal;Karthik Subbian;Jaideep Srivastava;Tamara G.

Because incorporating all contextual information can make the data sparser and degrade the prediction accuracy, most context-aware methods focus on detecting and using only the most effective contextual factors. However, in addition to accuracy, the diversity of the recommendation is also a key to improving users' satisfaction with recommendation results. Moreover, most context-aware techniques have not considered directly the relationships among context, users, and items before predicting the ratings. In the real world, different contextual factors tend to affect users and items differently. This paper proposes a latent probabilistic model to incorporate the contextual information. By adopting a binary particle-swarm optimization technique, the relevant contextual factors for user classes and item classes are identified and incorporated into the model. We optimize our model for two cases, namely considering accuracy alone and considering the trade-off between accuracy and diversity. An evaluation shows that our proposed model performs better than 1) a model that considers only the relation of context to users alone or items alone, 2) a model that exploits all contextual factors, and 3) the traditional context-aware recommendation method.	mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;recommender system;sensor;statistical model	Padipat Sitkrongwong;Saranya Maneeroj;Pannawit Samatthiyadikun;Atsuhiro Takasu	2015		10.1145/2837185.2837223	computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-21.285965221045675	-47.08503686973961	118931
ea4d5c08452afbb327d660b26d11b982cdbbc040	predicting smartphone adoption in social networks		The recent advancements in online social networks and mobile devices have provided valuable data sources to track users’ smartphone adoption, i.e., the usage of smartphones over time. An incisive understanding of users’ smartphone adoption can benefit many useful applications, ranging from user behavior understanding to targeted marketing. This paper studies smartphone adoption prediction in social networks by leveraging the wisdom of an online world. A critical challenge along this line is to identify the key factors that underline people’s adoption behaviors and distinguish the relative contribution of each factor. Specifically, we model the final smartphone status of each user as a result of three influencing factors: the social influence factor, the homophily factor, and the personal factor. We further develop a supervised model that takes all three factors for smartphone adoption and at the same time learns the relative contribution of each factor from the data. Experimental results on a large real world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.	incisive;mobile device;smartphone;social network;supervised learning	Le Wu;Yin Zhu;Nicholas Jing Yuan;Enhong Chen;Xing Xie;Yong Rui	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-18038-0_37	internet privacy	Web+IR	-22.81348644735651	-45.35248461798991	119013

Collaborative recommenders leverage the preferences of communities of similar users in order to guide the search for relevant items. The success of collaborative recommendation has always been restrained by the so-called sparsity problem, in which a lack of available user similarity knowledge ultimately limits the formation of high-quality user communities and has a subsequent impact on recommender accuracy. This article presents an approach to addressing the sparsity problem by describing and evaluating how implicit similarity knowledge can be discovered and exploited using data-mining techniques and an approach to recommendation that is inspired by case-based reasoning research.	case-based reasoning;collaborative software;data mining;information filtering system;recommender system;sparse matrix;systems theory;user modeling	David C.

Methods of information ltering and fetching are then required. This paper presents two approaches. The rst concerns the information ltering system ProFile based on an adaptation of the generalized probabilistic model of information retrieval. ProFile lters the netnews and uses a scale of 11 prede ned values of relevance. ProFile allows the user to update on{line the pro le and to check the discrepancy between the assessment and the prediction of relevance of the system. The second concerns ABIS, an intelligent agent for supporting users in ltering data from distributed and heterogeneous archives and repositories. ABIS minimizes user's e ort in selecting the huge amount of available documents. The ltering engine memorizes both user preferences and past situations. ABIS compares documents with the past situations and nds the similarity scores on the basis of a memory-based reasoning approach.	application binary interface;discrepancy function;information retrieval;intelligent agent;internet;online and offline;open road tolling;ranking (information retrieval);relevance;statistical model;usenet;user (computing)	Gianni Amati;Daniela D.

5d683ae64c5b266c168f960313b8b55127ee7df8	understanding the utility of geospatial information in social media		Crisis situations generate tens of millions of social media reports, many of which contain references to geographic features and locations. Contemporary systems are now capable of mining and visualizing these location references in social media reports, but we have yet to develop a deep understanding of what end-users will expect to do with this information when attempting to achieve situational awareness. To explore this problem, we have conducted a utility and usability analysis of SensePlace2, a geovisual analytics tool designed to explore geospatial information found in Tweets. Eight users completed a task analysis and survey study using SensePlace2. Our findings reveal user expectations and key paths for solving usability and utility issues to inform the design of future visual analytics systems that incorporate geographic information from social media.	interaction;refinement (computing);social media;software bug;task analysis;usability;visual analytics	Anthony C.

7ea2f73a1107a1ddc05f1ab3f5b795f2901eb6a7	adova: anomaly detection in online and virtual spaces		Online and virtual spaces comprise a myriad of ad-hoc networks and online communities. Such communities are composed of smart devices, agents, systems and people who seek to interact in one way or another. We argue that the task of detecting anomalies in such settings is non-trivial. The complexity is further compounded since there is no clear cut definition/specification of what normal behaviour is, and how far out an outlier should be before it is detected as an anomaly. This is often the case with online and virtual spaces as there is little or no regulation of the interactions between the various players in online communities. Hence, detecting anomalous behaviour in such settings poses a huge challenge. In this paper, we investigate how evolutionary clustering could be exploited to support decision makers, designers and data scientists in the autonomous detection of anomalies in online and virtual spaces. We present preliminary ideas in tackling this issue using a freeform online social media community (Twitter) and explore how emerging patterns and trends could help identify clusters of players (or normal behaviour) and, conversely, anomalies.	anomaly detection;autonomous robot;cluster analysis;data science;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;hoc (programming language);interaction;online community;prototype;sensor;smart device;social media	Chukwuemeka David Emele;Vitalij Spakov;Wei Pang;Jone Bone;George G.

Instead of clustering patterns by means of a Euclidean distance measure, in this approach users are partitioned into clusters using a non-Euclidean distance measure called the Sequence Alignment Method (SAM). This method partitions navigation patterns according to the order in which web pages are requested and handles the problem of clustering sequences of different lengths. The performance of the algorithm is compared with the results of a method based on Euclidean distance measures. SAM is validated by means of user-traffic data of two different web sites. Empirical results show that SAM identifies sequences with similar behavioral patterns not only with regard to content, but also considering the order of pages visited in a sequence.	algorithm;behavioral pattern;cluster analysis;euclidean distance;sequence alignment;web page	Birgit Hay;Geert Wets;Koen Vanhoof	2003	Knowledge and Information Systems	10.1007/BF02637153	web mining;the internet;computer science;bioinformatics;sequence analysis;sequence alignment;web page;data mining;euclidean distance;database;cluster analysis;world wide web;information system	ML	-30.063151755392994	-51.097718432939736	119871

Our method builds autonomously a latent factor model from the available online data of many users (generic song map per mood) based on the associations extracted between user, song, user mood and song emotion. It uses a combination of the Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework and Page-Hinkley (PH) test to personalize the general song map for each mood according to user implicit reward. We conduct a series of tests using LiveJournal two-million (LJ2M) dataset to show the effect of mood in music recommendation and how the proposed solution can improve the performance of music recommendation over time compared to other conventional solutions in terms of hit rate and Fl score.	autonomous robot;baseline (configuration management);blog;f1 score;personalization;recommender system;reinforcement learning;simulation;social network;user (computing)	Chaima Dhahri;Kazunori Matsumoto;Keiichiro Hoashi	2018	2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)	10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508569	machine learning;recommender system;mood;hit rate;reinforcement learning;embedding;artificial intelligence;computer science	ML	-19.537721901243795	-49.14273228075836	120187

Once consensus rankings are identified for a set of queries, these rankings can serve for both evaluation and training of retrieval and learning systems. We present a novel approach to collecting the individual user preferences over image-search results: we use a collaborative game in which players are rewarded for agreeing on which image result is best for a query. Our approach is distinct from other labeling games because we are able to elicit directly the preferences of interest with respect to image queries extracted from query logs. As a source of relevance judgments, this data provides a useful complement to click data. Furthermore, the data is free of positional biases and is collected by the game without the risk of frustrating users with non-relevant results; this risk is prevalent in standard mechanisms for debiasing clicks. We describe data collected over 34 days from a deployed version of this game that amounts to about 18 million expressed preferences between pairs. Finally, we present several approaches to modeling this data in order to extract the consensus rankings from the preferences and better sort the search results for targeted queries.	clickstream;consensus (computer science);relevance;user (computing)	Paul N.

Many applications motivate the consideration of trust evaluation in online social networks (OSNs). Some work has been proposed based on a trusted graph. However, it is still an open challenge to construct a trusted graph, especially in terms of selecting proper recommenders, which can be used to predict the trustworthiness of an unknown target efficiently and effectively. Based on the intuition that people who are close to and influential to us can make more proper and acceptable recommendations, we present the idea of recommendation-aware trust evaluation (RATE). We further model the recommender selection problem as an optimization problem, with the objectives of higher accuracy, lower risk (uncertainty), and lower cost. Four metrics: trustworthiness, expertise, uncertainty, and cost, are identified to measure and adjust the quality of recommenders. We focus on a 1-hop recommender selection, for which we propose the FluidTrust model to better illustrate the trust--decision making process of a user. We also discuss the extension of multihop scenarios and multitarget scenarios. Experimental results, with the real social network datasets of Epinions and Advogato, validate the effectiveness of RATE: it can predict trust with higher accuracy (it gains about 20% higher accuracy in Epinions), lower risk, and less cost (about a 30% improvement).	advogato;experiment;interaction;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;recommender system;selection algorithm;social network;trust (emotion);usb on-the-go	Wenjun Jiang;Jie Wu;Guojun Wang	2015	ACM Trans.

However, algorithm generated explanations can be overly simplistic and unconvincing. We believe that humans can overcome these limitations. Inspired by how people explain word-of-mouth recommendations, we designed a process, combining crowdsourcing and computation, that generates personalized natural language explanations. We modeled key topical aspects of movies, asked crowdworkers to write explanations based on quotes from online movie reviews, and personalized the explanations presented to users based on their rating history. We evaluated the explanations by surveying 220 MovieLens users, finding that compared to personalized tag-based explanations, natural language explanations: 1) contain a more appropriate amount of information, 2) earn more trust from users, and 3) make users more satisfied.

For example, Twitter search for a topical keyword shows expert twitterers on the side for `whom to follow'. Google+ and Facebook also recommend users to follow or add to friend circle. Popular Internet newspaper-The Huffing ton Post shows Twitter experts on the side of an article for authoritative relevant tweets. The state of the art shows user profile bio as summary for Twitter experts, but it has issues with length constraints imposed by the user interface (UI) design, missing bio and sometimes funny profile bio. Alternatively, applications can use human generated user summary, but it will not scale. Therefore, we study the problem of automatic generation of informative expertise summary or taglines for Twitter experts in space constraint imposed by UI design. We propose three methods for expertise summary generation: Occupation-Pattern based, Link-Triangulation based and User-Classification based, with the use of knowledge-enhanced computing approaches. We also propose methods for final summary selection for users with multiple candidates of generated summaries and evaluate results by user-study for both generation and selection tasks. The results of proposed tagline generation methods show 92.8% good summaries with majority agreement in the best case and 70% in the worst case while outperforming the state of the art up to 88%. This study has implications in the area of expert profiling, user presentation and application design for engaging user experience.	best practice;best, worst and average case;british informatics olympiad;google+;information;internet;relevance;social media;user experience;user interface;user profile;web application	Hemant Purohit;Alex Dow;Omar Alonso;Lei Duan;Kevin Haas	2012	2012 International Conference on Social Informatics	10.1109/SocialInformatics.2012.68	user experience design;the internet;user modeling;computer science;data mining;multimedia;user interface;world wide web	Web+IR	-26.783337892576032	-50.85662329835162	121818
20cdc355177bc201c343a01af89524d6f2acc14b	a data driven approach to predicting rating scores for new restaurants		This paper focuses on predicting rating scores of new restaurants listed in online restaurant review platforms. Most existing works rely on customer reviews to make an prediction. However, in practice, the customer reviews for new restaurants are always missing. In this paper, we mine useful features from the information of restaurants as well as highly available urban data to tackle this problem. We propose a deep-learning based approach called MR-Net to model both endogenous and exogenous factors in a unified manner and capture deep feature interaction for rating score prediction. Extensive experiments on real world data from Dianping show that our approach achieves better performance than various baseline methods. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work that predicts rating scores for new restaurants without the knowledge of customer reviews.	baseline (configuration management);customer relationship management;deep learning;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;experiment;feature interaction problem;genetic heterogeneity;mitral valve insufficiency;restaurants;review [publication type];world online	Xiaochen Wang;Yanyan Shen;Yanmin Zhu;Ichiro Takeuchi	2018			machine learning;artificial intelligence;data-driven;computer science	ML	-19.364323228629345	-50.131016607146286	121860

5c2dd6e359cf8e41b7071bce3662e8ac52f1dfb9	trust-distrust-aware point-of-interest recommendation in location-based social network		Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is an important personalized service in location-based social network (LBSN) which has wide applications. Traditional Collaborative Filtering methods suffer from cold-start and data sparsity problem. They also ignore connections among users and lose the opportunity to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach which incorporates user preference, geographic influence and social trust into POI recommendation system. In contrast to other trust-aware recommendation works, our approach exploits distrust links and investigates their propagation effects. We use a modified normalized Jaccard coefficient to measure the trust and distrust score. Several series of experiments are conducted and the results show that our approach perform better than the traditional Collaborative Filtering in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction.	distrust;point of interest;social network	Jinghua Zhu;Qian Ming;Yong Liu	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-94268-1_58	collaborative filtering;data mining;recommender system;point of interest;jaccard index;computer science;social network;exploit;distributed computing;distrust	ECom	-20.649463021840653	-47.40448000052466	122016

In contrast to traditional social science, which suffers from the problems such as high data collection cost and imported user subjectivity, a new approach is presented to study social behaviors based on mobile phone sensing data. Different from other similar studies on mobile social sensing, three different types of geo-social behaviors, including online interaction, offline interaction, and mobility patterns, are characterized based on a newly released Nokia mobile phone dataset. We further discuss the impact factors to these behaviors as well as the correlation among them. The findings in this paper are crucial for many different fields, ranging from urban planning, location-based services, to social recommendation.	computation;effective method;location-based service;mobile phone;online and offline;recommender system	Bin Guo;Yunji Liang;Zhiwen Yu;Minshu Li;Xingshe Zhou	2016	Computational Intelligence	10.1111/coin.12050	internet privacy;computer security	HCI	-22.66169890722624	-45.06161455329702	122278

Usually, in an SNS system, active users may not represent the major opinions among the whole users, and most of the users' opinions may be multifarious. In this paper, we focus on analyzing and identifying users' dynamical social roles to facilitate the collective decision-making process. After introducing the social choice theory and an improved collective decision-making model, we present a three-layer model to analyze users' social roles in a hierarchical way and develop an integrated mechanism to utilize the identification of social roles to support the collective decision making. Based on a developed NetLogo-based tool, a case study for the course-offering determination with an application scenario is demonstrated to show the process of using users' social roles to support the collective decision making. The comparison experiment conducted between our method and the Delphi method shows the usefulness of our proposed method to help users achieve the decision consensus in a more efficient way.	data mining;delphi method;hierarchical database model;multitier architecture;netlogo;personalization;social network	Bo Wu;Xiaokang Zhou;Qun Jin;Fuhua Lin;Henry Leung	2017	IEEE Systems Journal	10.1109/JSYST.2014.2386611	data modeling;computer science;knowledge management;data mining;management science;computational model;social computing	HCI	-22.36805646373875	-41.655862291105684	122354
81e3725b5b87e2fd87a5a651080bf1ecda6ff1c2	personalized semantic ranking for collaborative recommendation	recommendation;user generated content;learning to rank	Recently a ranking view of collaborative recommendation has received much attention in recommendation systems. Most of existing ranking approaches are based on pairwise assumption, i.e., everything that has not been selected is of less interest for a user. However it is usually not proper in many cases. To alleviate the limitation of this assumption, in this work, we present a unified framework, named Personalized Semantic Ranking (PSR). PSR models the personalized ranking and the user-generated content (UGC) simultaneously, and the semantic information extracted from UGC can make a remedy for the pairwise assumption. Moreover, utilizing the semantic information, PSR can capture the more subtle information of the user-item interaction and alleviate the overfitting problem caused by insufficient ratings. The learned topics in PSR can also serve as proper explanations for recommendation. Experimental results show that the proposed PSR yields significant improvements over the competitive compared methods on two typical datasets.	overfitting;personalization;recommender system;unified framework;user-generated content	Song Xu;Shu Wu;Liang Wang	2015		10.1145/2766462.2767772	computer science;machine learning;data mining;user-generated content;world wide web;information retrieval;learning to rank	AI	-19.346430109017287	-47.907801774163204	122442

Most approaches, however, formulate the CF problem as rating prediction, overlooking the ranking perspective. In this work we present a method for collaborative ranking that leverages the strengths of the two main CF approaches, neighborhoodand model-based. Our novel method is highly efficient, with only seventeen parameters to optimize and a single hyperparameter to tune, and beats the state-of-the-art collaborative ranking methods. We also show that parameters learned on datasets from one item domain yield excellent results on a dataset from very different item domain, without any retraining.	learning to rank;moore neighborhood;ranking (information retrieval)	Maksims Volkovs;Richard S.

They provide suggestions to users to prune unrelated information so that users are guided to those items that best meet their needs. A variety of techniques have been proposed for performing recommendation, including content-based, collaborative, knowledge-based and other techniques. However, hyperlink-structure based recommendation is neglected.

On the way to the successful planning, deployment and operation of the module, computer generated and animated models are being used to optimize performance. Under contract of the German Space Agency DLR, it has become IRF's task to provide a Projective Virtual Reality System to provide a virtual world built after the planned layout of the COLUMBUS module enabling astronauts and scientists to practice operational procedures and the handling of experiments. The possibility for distributed multiuser access to the virtual lab and the visualization of real-world experiment data comprise the key features of the system. Through the ability to share the virtual world, cooperative operations can be practiced easily and trainers and trainees can work together more effectively in the shared virtual environment. The ability to visualize real-world data will be used to introduce measured experimental data into the virtual world online in order to allow realistic interaction with the science reference model hardware: The user's actions in the virtual world are translated into corresponding changes of the inputs of the science reference model hardware; the measured data is then in turn fed back into the virtual world. In order to provide astronauts and scientists with an even more complete insight into various aspects of COLUMBUS and the ISS, the simulation of the COLUMBUS module is currently being extended to include the entire International Space Station. This paper describes the background and the developed features which allow the creation of a virtual world that provides users with the feel of being on board the ISS.	robot;simulation	Eckhard Freund;Jürgen Roßmann;Craig Turner	2003		10.1109/IROS.2003.1249624	simulation;reference model;international space station;human–computer interaction;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;instructional simulation;virtual reality;mechanical engineering	Robotics	-33.35767034104852	-38.697819131082404	122815

So far in such brain-computer interfaces (BCI), an explicit calibration phase was required to build a decoder that translates raw electroencephalography (EEG) signals from the brain of each user into meaningful instructions. This paper proposes a method that removes the calibration phase, and allows a user to control an agent to solve a sequential task. The proposed method assumes a distribution of possible tasks, and infers the interpretation of EEG signals and the task by selecting the hypothesis which best explains the history of interaction. We introduce a measure of uncertainty on the task and on the EEG signal interpretation to act as an exploratory bonus for a planning strategy. This speeds up learning by guiding the system to regions that better disambiguate among task hypotheses. We report experiments where four users use BCI to control an agent on a virtual world to reach a target without any previous calibration process.	brain–computer interface;electroencephalography;experiment;robot;virtual world	Jonathan Grizou;Iñaki Iturrate;Luis Montesano;Pierre-Yves Oudeyer;Manuel Lopes	2014			brain–computer interface;simulation;user modeling;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	AI	-31.51886100000475	-41.538599558350874	122829

In this paper, we draw an analogy between this influence and the mutual reinforcement of hub/authority web pages. Based on this analogy, we present a novel approach to the item ranking problem.We apply this ranking approach to solve two selection problems. In size-constrained selection, the maximum number of items that can be selected is fixed. In cost-constrained selection, there is no maximum number of items to be selected, but there is some cost associated with the selection of each item. In both cases, the question is what items should be selected to maximize the profit.

They are able to perform tasks in an accurate manner, e.g. manipulating objects. However, this manipulation often does not follow the human way to arrange objects. Therefore, robots require semantic knowledge about the environment for executing tasks and satisfying humans’ expectations. In this paper, we will introduce a breakfast table setting scenario where a robot acquires information from human demonstrations to arrange objects in a meaningful way. We will show how robots can obtain the necessary amount of knowledge to autonomously perform daily tasks.	autonomous robot;interaction	Lisset Salinas Pinacho;Alexander Wich;Fereshta Yazdani;Michael Beetz	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-00111-7_12	semantic memory;robot;machine learning;artificial intelligence;computer science	Robotics	-33.129935372420974	-39.35398147816963	122995

The automated discovery or mining of consumer opinions from these sources is of great importance for marketing intelligence and product benchmarking. Techniques are now being developed to effectively and easily mine the consumer opinions from the Web data and to timely deliver them to companies and individual consumers. This study investigates this emerging field named ‘opinion mining’ in terms of what it is, what it can do, and how it could be used effectively for business intelligence (BI). A rigorous review of the research literature on opinion mining is conducted to explore its current state, issues and challenges for its use in developing business applications for competitive advantage. The study aims to assist business managers to better understand the current opportunities and challenges in using opinion mining for deriving BI. Future research directions for further development of the field are also identified. the survey (asking to send a form right after purchase might not be very informative); and the reliance on the goodwill of consumers to take the survey. Additionally, consumers shared their views primarily through spoken word of mouth. Thus, irrespective of how the consumer opinions were collected, they lead to a long period of latency before a brand’s weakness or strengths were known to all – the producers and consumers. With the rapid expansion of e-commerce in recent years, more and more products are being sold on the Web, thus more and more consumers are buying products online. In recent years, the Web has dramatically changed the way consumDOI: 10.4018/jbir.2011100101 2 International Journal of Business Intelligence Research, 2(4), 1-16, October-December 2011 Copyright © 2011, IGI Global.

Opinions and reviews are easily posted on the Web, such as in merchant sites, review portals, blogs, internet forums, and social networking sites (Wang et al., 2009). These data are commonly referred to as user-generated content or user-generated media. Both the product manufacturers as well as the potential customers find this online “word of mouth” very useful (Chen et al., 2008). The product manufacturers receive information on their customers’ likes and dislikes, as well as the positive and negative comments on their products whenever available, giving them better knowledge of their products’ limitations and advantages over their competitors. The potential customers on the other hand receive useful and “first hand” information on the products and/ or services which assist them in their future purchase decision making process. As more and more common users are becoming comfortable with the Web, an increasing number of them are writing reviews. Consequently, the number of reviews that a product receives is growing rapidly. Popular products can get hundreds or even thousands of reviews at some large merchant sites. Many of these reviews are long and have only a few sentences containing opinions on the product. This makes it hard for a potential customer to read them all to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. If the potential customer only reads a few reviews, they may get a biased view. Similarly, the large number of reviews also makes it hard for product manufacturers to keep track of customer opinions of their products. Moreover, the product manufacturer face additional difficulties since many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. The online word-of-mouth behavior that exists today in the Web represents new and measurable sources of information. Mining these consumer opinions is of great importance for marketing intelligence and product benchmarking. Techniques are now being developed to effectively and easily mine the consumer opinions from these sources and to timely deliver them to companies and individual consumers. In the past few years many researchers have been actively involved in developing this nascent and highly potent field of study, which is called opinion mining or sentiment analysis (Pang et al., 2008b; Liu, 2010). Opinion mining is a very new field of study that attempts to develop automatic systems to determine human opinion from text written in natural language. It is a discipline at the crossroads of information retrieval and computational linguistics. The task of opinion mining is technically challenging because it requires natural language processing, which itself is a tedious job (Kao et al., 2007). The research and development that has taken place and is currently taking place in this field have been performed by the computer science and computational linguistics communities. Consequently, the published results are not friendly to or are easily understood by business professionals unless they are technically trained. The purpose and contribution of this research is twofold. First, it summarizes and presents the state of the art in opinion mining in a way that is easily comprehensible by business professionals encompassing a wide range of backgrounds or expertise. Second, it categorizes the existing literature into a classification framework that is intended to help management information systems researchers to study this field in further details for future business benefits. The textual information that is found in the Web is broadly classified into two main categories, facts and opinions. Facts are objective statements about entities and events in the world. Opinions are subjective statements that reflect peoples’ sentiments or perceptions about the entities and events. Much of the existing research on text information processing has been, almost exclusively, focused on mining and retrieval of factual information, e.g., information retrieval, Web search, and many other text mining and natural language processing tasks. Until only recently, work has begun on the processing of opinions.

More and more people are actively sharing information with others and expressing their opinions and feelings on Weibo. Analyzing emotion hidden in this information can benefit online marketing, branding, customer relationship management and monitoring public opinions. Sentiment analysis is to identify the emotional tendencies of the microblog messages, that is to classify users' emotions into positive, negative and neutral. This paper presents a novel model to build a Sentiment Dictionary using Word2vec tool based on our Semantic Orientation Pointwise Similarity Distance (SO-SD) model. Then we use the Emotional Dictionary to obtain the emotional tendencies of Weibo messages. Through the experiment, we validate the effectiveness of our method, by which we have performed a preliminary exploration of the sentiment analysis of Chinese Weibo in this paper.	algorithm;customer relationship management;data dictionary;lexicon;online advertising;semantic interpretation;sentiment analysis;social network;time series;word2vec	Xue Bai;Fu Chen;Shaobin Zhan	2014	2014 IEEE International Congress on Big Data	10.1109/BigData.Congress.2014.59	computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval;sentiment analysis	NLP	-23.066536096993143	-51.97491786537975	123151

94c5b38b6446e7dd8832f65c16bc7fad99031256	learning robot objectives from physical human interaction		When humans and robots work in close proximity, physical interaction is inevitable. Traditionally, robots treat physical interaction as a disturbance, and resume their original behavior after the interaction ends. In contrast, we argue that physical human interaction is informative: it is useful information about how the robot should be doing its task. We formalize learning from such interactions as a dynamical system in which the task objective has parameters that are part of the hidden state, and physical human interactions are observations about these parameters. We derive an online approximation of the robot’s optimal policy in this system, and test it in a user study. The results suggest that learning from physical interaction leads to better robot task performance with less human effort.	approximation;dynamical system;human–computer interaction;information;robot;usability testing	Andrea Bajcsy;Dylan P.

1b284cdc78e1c6c183ce0a8d79fec5468bda7b2b	on unravelling opinions of issue specific-silent users in social media		Social media has become a popular platform for people to share opinions. Among the social media mining research projects that study user opinions and issues, most focus on analyzing posted and shared content. They could run into the danger of non-representative findings as the opinions of users who do not post content are overlooked, which often happens in todayu0027s marketing, recommendation, and social sensing research. For a more complete and representative profiling of user opinions on various topical issues, we need to investigate the opinions of the users even when they stay silent on these issues. We call these users the issue specific-silent users (i-silent users). To study them and their opinions, we conduct an opinion survey on a set of users for two popular social media platforms, Twitter and Facebook. We further analyze their contributed personal social media data. Our main findings are that more than half of our users who are interested in issue i are i-silent users in Twitter. The same has been observed for our Facebook users. i-silent users are likely to have different opinion distribution from the users who post about i. With the ground truth user opinions from the survey, we further develop and apply opinion prediction methods to i-silent users in Twitter and Facebook using their social media data and their opinions on issues other than i.	kripke semantics;social media	Wei Gong;Ee-Peng Lim;Feida Zhu;Pei Hua Cher	2016			internet privacy;ground truth;social media mining;computer science;social media	HCI	-25.451025298115848	-46.32642141721301	123538

The theory comes up with the claim that objects and actions are inseparably intertwined. Categories of objects are not built by visual appearance only, as very common in computer vision, but by the actions an agent can perform and by attributes perceivable. The core of the OAC concept is constituting objects from a set of attributes, which can be manifold in type (e.g. color, shape, mass, material), to actions. This twofold of attributes and actions provides the base for categories. The work presented here is embedded in the development of an extensible system for providing and evolving attributes, beginning with attributes extractable from visual data.	computer vision;embedded system;object action complex	Kai Huebner;Mårten Björkman;Babak Rasolzadeh;Martina Schmidt;Danica Kragic	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-79547-6_2	computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;information and computer science	Vision	-28.409939134934646	-38.13800916672105	123586
3a026a093a63661beb2514aebca0aaf93430f2fd	a visual approach to the empirical analysis of social influence	semantic networks;power law graphs;sentiment analysis;social influence	This paper starts from the observation that social networks follow a power-law degree distribution of nodes, with a few hub nodes and a long tail of peripheral nodes. While there exist consolidated approaches supporting the identification and characterization of hub nodes, research on the analysis of the multi-layered distribution of peripheral nodes is limited. In social media, hub nodes represent social influencers. However, the literature provides evidence of the multi-layered structure of influence networks, emphasizing the distinction between influencers and influence. The latter seems to spread following multi-hop paths across nodes in peripheral network layers. This paper proposes a visual approach to the graphical representation and exploration of peripheral layers and clusters to exploit underlying concept of k-shell decomposition analysis. The core concept of our approach is to partition the node set of a graph into hub and peripheral nodes. Then, a power-law based modified force-directed method is applied to clearly display local multi-layered neighbourhood clusters around hub nodes. Our approach is tested on a large sample of tweets from the tourism domain. Empirical results indicate that peripheral nodes have a greater probability of being retweeted and, thus, play a critical role in determining the influence of content. Our visualization technique helps us highlight peripheral nodes and, thus, seems an interesting tool to the visual analysis of social influence.	degree distribution;entity;existential quantification;force-directed graph drawing;graphical user interface;layer (electronics);long tail;peripheral;sensitivity and specificity;sentiment analysis;social media;social network;usb hub	Chiara Francalanci;Ajaz Hussain	2014		10.5220/0004992803190330	social influence;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;semantic network;world wide web;sentiment analysis	ML	-19.52089110026679	-41.41056795068915	123598

However, this information abundance is exceeding the capability of the public to consume it, especially in unusual situations such as emergency management, intelligence acquisition, and crime analysis. Thus, there calls for a reliable approach to rank meme appropriately according to its influence, which will let the public focus on the most important memes without sinking into the information flood. However, studying meme in any detail on a large scale proves to be challenging. Previous bottom-up approaches are often highly complex, while the more recent top-down network analysis approaches lack detailed modeling for meme dynamics. In this paper, we first present a formal definition for meme ranking task, and then introduce a scheme for meme ranking in the context of online social networks (OSN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that memes have been ranked in a model-free manner. Empirical results on two emergency events indicate that our scheme outperforms several benchmark approaches. This scheme is also robust by insensitive to sample rate. In light of the scheme's fine-grain modeling on meme dynamics, we also reveal two key factors affecting meme influence.	benchmark (computing);bottom-up parsing;meme;norm (social);sampling (signal processing);social network;top-down and bottom-up design;transfer entropy	Saike He;Xiaolong Zheng;Xiuguo Bao;Hongyuan Ma;Daniel Dajun Zeng;Bo Xu;Guanhua Tian;Hongwei Hao	2014	2014 IEEE Joint Intelligence and Security Informatics Conference	10.1109/JISIC.2014.44	transfer entropy;computer science;artificial intelligence;data science;machine learning;data mining;world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-19.27315371374853	-43.13594596254299	123623

In this paper we study voting systems for a particular kind of community: electronically mediated social networks. In particular, we focus on delegative democracy (a.k.a. proxy voting) that has recently received increased interest for its ability to combine the benefits of direct and representative systems, and that seems also perfectly suited for electronically mediated social networks. In such a context, we consider a voting system in which users can only express their preference for one among the people they are explicitly connected with, and this preference can be propagated transitively, using an attenuation factor.  We present this system and we study its properties. We also take into consideration the problem of missing votes, which is particularly relevant in online networks, as some recent case shows. Our experiments on real-world networks provide interesting insight into the significance and stability of the results obtained with the suggested voting system.	emergent democracy;experiment;social network	Paolo Boldi;Francesco Bonchi;Carlos Castillo;Sebastiano Vigna	2009		10.1145/1645953.1646052	artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;world wide web;social network	ECom	-19.622823600120384	-42.648601735702954	124055

However, with this enormous repository of information, it can often be difficult to locate fundamental topics that support lower-level articles. By exploiting the information stored in the links between articles, we propose that related companion articles can be automatically generated to help further the reader's understanding of a given topic. This approach to a recommendation system uses tested link analysis techniques to present users with a clear path to related high-level articles, furthering the understanding of low-level topics.	high- and low-level;link analysis;recommender system;wikipedia	Christopher Markson;Min Song	2012		10.1145/2232817.2232883	link analysis;computer science;data mining;brand;world wide web;information retrieval;recommender system	HCI	-25.297176776699406	-51.166496497215554	124061

Data from our fashion e-commerce portal indicate that the final product a person ends-up purchasing is often very different from the initial product he/she started the session with. We refer to this characteristic as a ‘context change’. This feature of fashion e-commerce makes understanding and predicting user behaviour quite challenging. Our work attempts to model this characteristic so as to both detect and preempt context changes. Our approach employs a deep Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) over clickstream data. We show that this model captures context changes better than other non-sequential baseline models.	e-commerce	Ashay Tamhane;Sagar Arora;Deepak Warrier	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-57529-2_42	product type;data mining;computer science;final product;e-commerce;clickstream;purchasing	Vision	-24.85825430230089	-45.62839963173118	124063

At the same time, social networks have become very popular with over a billion accounts shared across hundreds of networks. Social trust relationships, derived from social networks, are uniquely suited to speak to the quality of online information; recommender systems are designed to personalize, sort, aggregate, and highlight information. Merging social networks, trust, and recommender systems can improve the accuracy of recommendations and improve the user's experience. In this tutorial, we will cover the use of social trust in recommender systems. Topics including the computation of trust in social networks, integration of trust into recommender systems, and a discussion of when trust offers benefits and the challenges it presents.	aggregate data;computation;information;personalization;recommender system;social network;world wide web	Jennifer Golbeck	2009		10.1145/1639714.1639808	computer science;knowledge management;world wide web;computational trust;recommender system;social network	ECom	-26.126660771372666	-46.83898586261384	124137

Traditional faceted search systems often suffer from a lack of usability; furthermore facets are often static and independent from the search result set. In this paper, we present a dynamic semantic topical faceting approach. It uses a pie menu called topic pie that allows visualisation of facets and user interaction. Depending on the search query, the topic pie presents a set of topics and major topics which help the user to drill down the search result set to relevant objects efficiently as well as to browse exploratively through the collection. The underlying algorithm optimises the conflicting goals relevance and diversity while avoiding information overload. It reveals a good performance on large data sets. As our use-case, we chose literature research in scientific libraries. An evaluation shows major advantages of our approach compared to state-of-the-art faceted search techniques in nowadays library portals.	algorithm;browsing;faceted classification;faceting;information overload;library (computing);pie menu;portals;relevance;result set;usability;web search query	Tilman Deuschel;Christian Greppmeier;Bernhard Humm;Wolfgang Stille	2014		10.1145/2660517.2660522	engineering;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-29.43058574833491	-38.30142862343873	124183

Existing business intelligence tools suffer from a lack of analysis and visualization capabilities and traditional result list display by search engines often overwhelms business analysts with irrelevant information. Thus, developing tools that enable better analysis while reduce information overload has been a challenge. The literature show that hierarchical and map displays enable effective access and browsing of information. However, they have not been widely applied to discover business intelligence on the Web. This research proposes Business Intelligence Explorer, a tool implementing the steps in a knowledge map framework for discovering business intelligence on the Web. Two browsing methods, namely, Web community and knowledge map, have been implemented. Web community uses a genetic algorithm to organize different Web sites into a hierarchical format. Knowledge map uses a multidimensional scaling algorithm to place different Web sites as points on a map. Preliminary results of our user study show that Web community helps users locate results quickly and effectively. Users liked the intuitive map display of knowledge map. Our Business Intelligence Explorer contributes to alleviate information overload in business analysis. Future directions on applying document visualization techniques in discovering business intelligence are described.	business analysis;genetic algorithm;image scaling;information overload;knowledge management;multidimensional scaling;relevance;usability testing;web search engine;world wide web	Wingyan Chung;Hsinchun Chen;Jay F.

It is ontology-free and easy to obtain; however, irrelevant tags frequently appear, and users typically will not tag all semantic objects in the image, which is also called semantic loss. To avoid noises and compensate for the semantic loss, tag recommendation is proposed in literature. However, current recommendation simply ranks the related tags based on the single modality of tag co-occurrence on the whole dataset, which ignores other modalities, such as visual correlation. This paper proposes a multi-modality recommendation based on both tag and visual correlation, and formulates the tag recommendation as a learning problem. Each modality is used to generate a ranking feature, and Rankboost algorithm is applied to learn an optimal combination of these ranking features from different modalities. Experiments on Flickr data demonstrate the effectiveness of this learning-based multi-modality recommendation strategy.	algorithm;flickr;folksonomy;image retrieval;modality (human–computer interaction);real-time computing;relevance	Lei Wu;Linjun Yang;Nenghai Yu;Xian-Sheng Hua	2009		10.1145/1526709.1526758	image retrieval;computer science;data mining;world wide web;tag cloud;information retrieval	Web+IR	-19.314997702984694	-48.21875470822148	124909

In this paper the construction and performance of a novel immune-based learning algorithm is explored whose distributed, dynamic and adaptive nature offers many potential advantages over more traditiona l models. Through a process of cooperative coevolution a classifier is generated which consists of a set of detectors whose local dynamics enable the system as a whole to group positive and negative examples of a concept. The immune-based learning algorithm is first validated on a standard dataset. Then, combined with an HTML feature extractor, it is tested on a webbased document classification task and found to outperform traditional classification paradigms. Further applications in document based searching, content filtering, recommendation systems and user profile generation are also directly relevant to the work presented.	algorithm;artificial immune system;complex adaptive system;computer security;concept learning;content-control software;cooperative coevolution;document classification;html;information retrieval;knowledge management;machine learning;problem solving;randomness extractor;recommender system;sensor;user profile	Jamie Twycross;Steve Cayzer	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-36562-4_4	complex adaptive system;immune system;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining	AI	-31.853644992011816	-49.37473557687645	125442
04e3551a0442e5509add859677af4f15f31a3ee8	improving collaborative filtering's rating prediction accuracy by considering users' rating variability		"""When rating predictions are computed in user-user collaborative filtering, each individual rating is typically adjusted by the mean of the ratings entered by the specific user. This practice takes into account the fact that users follow different rating practices, in the sense that some are stricter when rating items, while others are more lenient. However, users' rating practices may also differ in rating variability, in the sense that some user may be entering ratings close to her mean, while another user may be entering more extreme ratings, close to the limits of the rating scale. In this work, we (1) propose an algorithm that considers users' ratings variability in the rating prediction computation process, aiming to improve rating prediction quality and (2) evaluate the proposed algorithm against seven widely used datasets considering three widely used variability measures and two user similarity metrics. The proposed algorithm, using the """"mean absolute deviation around the mean"""" variability measure, has been found to introduce considerable gains in rating prediction accuracy, in every dataset and under both user similarity metrics tested."""	algorithm;coefficient;collaborative filtering;computation;euclidean distance;experiment;heart rate variability;preprocessor;rating scale;recommender system;social network;spatial variability	Dionisis Margaris;Costas Vassilakis	2018	2018 IEEE 16th Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, 16th Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, 4th Intl Conf on Big Data Intelligence and Computing and Cyber Science and Technology Congress(DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTech)	10.1109/DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTec.2018.00145	collaborative filtering;absolute deviation;knowledge-based systems;rating scale;computer science;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition	Web+IR	-19.791579897594286	-48.64228383638059	125582

Traditionally, the data used to support such studies is manually obtained, often through surveys with volunteers. However, due to their inherent high costs because of manual steps, such traditional methods do not quickly scale to large-size studies. We here investigate a particular aspect of gender differences: preferences for venues. To that end, we explore the use of check-in data collected from Foursquare to estimate cultural gender preferences for venues in the physical world. For that, we first demonstrate that by analyzing the check-in data in various regions of the world we can find significant differences in preferences for specific venues between gender groups. Some of these significant differences reflect well-known cultural patterns. Moreover, we also gathered evidence that our methodology offers useful information about gender preference for venues in a given region in the real world. This suggests that gender and venue preferences observed may not be independent. Our results indicate that our proposed methodology could be a promising tool to support studies on gender preferences for venues at different spatial granularities around the world, being faster and cheaper than traditional methods, besides quickly capturing changes in the real world.	data-intensive computing;online and offline;venue (sound system)	Willi Müller;Thiago H.

Such sites might be able to increase their sales and profits while customers can obtain precise and trustworthy predictions if they use appropriate collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms without deeply jeopardizing users’ privacy. We propose a new recommendation algorithm, which is a hybrid-memory and model-based algorithm to generate truthful referrals efficiently. Moreover, we use randomization techniques to preserve users’ privacy while still offering CF services with decent accuracy. We perform real data-based trials and analyse our proposed schemes in terms of privacy, accuracy, and performance.	algorithm;blackwell (series);collaborative filtering;e-commerce;experiment;expert system;imperative programming;privacy	Sahin Renckes;Huseyin Polat;Yusuf Oysal	2012	Expert Systems	10.1111/j.1468-0394.2010.00561.x	e-commerce;privacy software;performance;computer science;collaborative filtering;data mining;accuracy and precision;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web	Security	-21.01594710649466	-50.09440257953348	125781

Since these systems often have explicit knowledge of social network structures, the recommendations may incorporate this information. This paper focuses on networks that represent trust and recommendation systems that incorporate these trust relationships. The goal of a trust-based recommendation system is to generate personalized recommendations by aggregating the opinions of other users in the trust network.  In analogy to prior work on voting and ranking systems, we use the axiomatic approach from the theory of social choice. We develop a set of five natural axioms that a trust-based recommendation system might be expected to satisfy. Then, we show that no system can simultaneously satisfy all the axioms. However, for any subset of four of the five axioms we exhibit a recommendation system that satisfies those axioms. Next we consider various ways of weakening the axioms, one of which leads to a unique recommendation system based on random walks. We consider other recommendation systems, including systems based on personalized PageRank, majority of majorities, and minimum cuts, and search for alternative axiomatizations that uniquely characterize these systems.  Finally, we determine which of these systems are incentive compatible, meaning that groups of agents interested in manipulating recommendations can not induce others to share their opinion by lying about their votes or modifying their trust links. This is an important property for systems deployed in a monetized environment.	axiomatic system;pagerank;personalization;recommender system;social network	Reid Andersen;Christian Borgs;Jennifer T.

In this paper, we study influence from the perspective of structure, and focus on the simplest group structure - triad. We analyze two different genres of behavior: Retweeting on Weibo and Paying on CrossFire. We have several intriguing observations from these two networks. First, different internal structures of one's friends exhibit significant heterogeneity in influence patterns. Second, the strength of social relationship plays an important role in influencing one's behavior, and more interestingly, it is not necessarily positively correlated with the strength of social influence. We incorporate the triadic influence patterns into a predictive model to predict user's behavior. Experiment results show that our method can significantly improved the prediction accuracy.	predictive modelling;reblogging;social network	Chenhui Zhang;Sida Gao;Jie Tang;Tracy Xiao Liu;Zhanpeng Fang;Xu Cheng	2016	2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)	10.1109/ASONAM.2016.7752421	database index;logistics;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;management science;predictive modelling;social psychology;regression analysis	ML	-20.638869555920724	-42.23962413013021	125893

An important question is, to what degree is human behavior predictable? The ability to foresee the mobility of humans is crucial from predicting the spread of human to urban planning. Previous research has focused on predicting individual mobility behavior, such as the next location prediction problem. In this paper we study the human mobility behaviors from the perspective of network science. In the human mobility network, there will be a link between two humans if they are physically proximal to each other. We perform both microscopic and macroscopic explorations on the human mobility patterns. From the microscopic perspective, our objective is to answer whether two humans will be in proximity of each other or not. While from the macroscopic perspective, we are interested in whether we can infer the future topology of the human mobility network. In this paper we explore both problems by using link prediction technology, our methodology is demonstrated to have a greater degree of precision in predicting future mobility topology.	degree (graph theory);individual mobility;network science	Yang Yang;Nitesh V.

However, personalization of search results has led to worries about the Filter Bubble Effect, where the personalization algorithm decides that some useful information is irrelevant to the user, and thus prevents them from locating it. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to explore the impact of location-based personalization on Google Search results. Assessing the relationship between location and personalization is crucial, since users' geolocation can be used as a proxy for other demographic traits, like race, income, educational attainment, and political affiliation. In other words, does location-based personalization trap users in geolocal Filter Bubbles?  Using our methodology, we collected 30 days of search results from Google Search in response to 240 different queries. By comparing search results gathered from 59 GPS coordinates around the US at three different granularities (county, state, and national), we are able to observe that differences in search results due to personalization grow as physical distance increases. However these differences are highly dependent on what a user searches for: queries for local establishments receive 4-5 different results per page, while more general terms exhibit essentially no personalization.	algorithm;geographic coordinate system;geolocation;global positioning system;google search;location-based service;personalization;personalized search;proxy server;relevance;the filter;web search engine	Chloe Kliman-Silver;Aniko Hannak;David Lazer;Christo Wilson;Alan Mislove	2015		10.1145/2815675.2815714	computer science;data mining;personalization;geolocation;internet privacy;world wide web;computer network	Metrics	-27.787084981893088	-44.234827168590506	126025

To better understand the propagation mechanism for information diffusion, it is necessary to model the user retweeting behavior and predict future retweets. Some existing work in retweeting prediction based on matrix factorization focuses on using user-message interaction information, user information and social influence information, etc. The challenge of improving prediction performance is how to jointly perform deep representation of these information to solve the sparsity problem and then learn a more comprehensive retweeting behavior model. Inspired by word2vec and co-factor matrix factorization model, this paper proposes a hybrid model, called HCFMF, for learning users' retweeting behavior, it first computes the message content similarity by considering the message co-occurrence, the author information and word2vec based low-dimensional representation of content, then, jointly decomposes the user-message matrix and message-message similarity matrix based on a co-factorization model. We empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed model on real world weibo datasets. Experimental results show that taking the dense representation of author and content information into consideration could allow us make more accurate analysis of users' retweeting patterns. The mined patterns could serve as a feedback channel for both consumers and management departments.	behavior model;interaction information;mined;reblogging;similarity measure;social media;software propagation;sparse matrix;web 2.0;word2vec	Can Wang;Qiudan Li;Lei Wang;Daniel Dajun Zeng	2017	2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7965998	information sharing;machine learning;artificial intelligence;word2vec;data modeling;data mining;user information;matrix decomposition;matrix (mathematics);computer science;communication channel;interaction information	Web+IR	-19.23995517245222	-46.04540265459129	126265

As an extension of the basic Rocchio algorithm, traditional topic detection and tracking, and single-pass clustering, MTT maintains multiple interest profiles to identify interesting articles for a specific user given user-feedback. Focusing on only interesting topics enables iScore to discard useless profiles to address changes in user interests and to achieve a balance between resource consumption and classification accuracy. Also by relating a topic's interestingness to an article.s interestingness, iScore is able to achieve higher quality results than traditional methods such as the Rocchio algorithm. We identify several operating parameters that work well for MTT. Using the same parameters, we show that MTT alone yields high quality results for recommending interesting articles from several corpora. The inclusion of MTT improves iScore's performance by 9% in recommending news articles from the Yahoo! News RSS feeds and the TREC11 adaptive filter article collection. And through a small user study, we show that iScore can still perform well when only provided with little user feedback.	adaptive filter;cluster analysis;display resolution;meaning–text theory;rss;rocchio algorithm;text corpus;usb hub;usability testing	Raymond K.

Also, gaze ̄xation patterns of humans are highly determined by the task they perform. Our assumption is that meaningful human robot interaction with robots having active vision components (such a humanoids) is highly supported if the robot system is able to create task modulated ̄xation patterns. We present an architecture for a robot active vision system equipped with one manipulator where we demonstrate the generation of task modulated gaze control, meaning that ̄xation patterns are in accordance with a speci ̄c task the robot has to perform. Experiments demonstrate di®erent strategies of multi-modal task modulation for robotic active vision where visual and nonvisual features (tactile feedback) determine gaze ̄xation patterns. The results are discussed in comparison to purely saliency based strategies toward visual attention and gaze control. The major advantages of our approach to multi-modal task modulation is that the active vision system can generate, ̄rst, active avoidance of objects, and second, active engagement with objects. Such behaviors cannot be generated by current approaches of visual attention which are based on saliency models only, but they are important for mimicking human-like gaze ̄xation patterns.	action selection;active vision;human–robot interaction;map;modal logic;modulation;nl (complexity);numerical aperture;prototype;robot;unified model	Martin Hülse;Sebastian McBride;Mark H.

Making friends is an ordinary way of establishing social relationships with others in online social network. Therefore friend recommendation is becoming a very important aspect and attracting extensive attention in visual communities and social network. Among various online social networks, micro-blog has become increasingly popular. The rapid growth of micro-blog data provides a rich resource for social community mining. In this paper, we present a friend recommendation approach based on the similarity of micro-blog user model. The proposed approach constructs the user model by considering four aspects: user profile, the content information that user posted, the link relationship and the interaction relationship between users. The interaction information such as users' comments and forwards are considered while calculate the link strength between users. The micro-blog content is divided into different topics which are obtained from an existing topic hierarchy. After we obtained the micro-blog user model, we calculate the interaction based similarity and content based similarity separately. After that, we mix the two kind of similarity together to calculate the similarity of micro-blog user model. At last, we recommend friend to users by this similarity. Experiments show that the friend recommendation approach based on the similarity of micro-blog user model has a higher precision than traditional approaches.	blog;comment (computer programming);document classification;interaction information;social network;user modeling;user profile	Fan Tang;Bofeng Zhang;Jianxing Zheng;Yajun Gu	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications and IEEE Internet of Things and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing	10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.415	computer science;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web;recommender system	DB	-21.29407370320762	-45.768827303956925	126795

33c5ff0ebf25feebc821de817b2084ac35c64318	time sequence summarization: theory and applications		Domains such as medicine, the WWW, business or nance generate and store on a daily basis massive amounts of data. This data is represented as a collection of time sequences of events where each event is described as a set of descriptors taken from various descriptive domains and associated to a time of occurrence. These archives represent valuable sources of insight for analysts to browse, analyze and discover golden nuggets of knowledge. For instance, biologists could discover disease risk factors by analyzing patient history, web content producers and marketing people are interested in pro ling client behaviors, traders investigate nancial data for understanding global trends or anticipating market moves. However, these applications require mining massive sequences, e.g., nance can generate millions of events daily, where the variability of event descriptors could be very high, since descriptors could be extracted from textual contents. For these reasons, discovering golden nuggets of knowledge for such domains with conventional data mining techniques is a challenging task. Recent studies show that data mining methods might need to operate on derived forms of the data, including aggregate values, previous mining results or summaries. Knowledge extracted in such a way is called Higher Order Knowledge. In this thesis work, we propose to address this challenge and we de ne the concept of Time sequence summarization whose purpose is to support chronology-dependent applications to scale on very large data sources. Time sequence summarization uses the content and temporal information of events to generate a more concise, yet informative enough, time sequence that can seamlessly be substituted for the original time sequence in the desired application. We propose a user-oriented approach called TSaR built on a 3-step process: Generalization, grouping and concept formation. TSaR uses background knowledge in the form of taxonomies to represent event descriptors at a higher level of abstraction. A temporal parameter controls the grouping process and only allows events close on the timeline to be gathered. Also, we propose to make the time sequence summarization process parameter-free. For this purpose, we reformulate the summarization problem into a novel clustering problem. The originality of this clustering problem relies on the speci city of the objective function to optimize. Indeed, the objective function takes into account both the content and the proximity of events on the timeline. We present two greedy approaches calledG-BUSS and GRASS to build a solution to this problem. Finally, we explore and analyze how time sequence summaries contribute to discovering Higher Order Knowledge. We analytically characterize the higher order patterns discovered from summaries and devise a methodology that uses the patterns discovered to uncover even more re ned patterns. We evaluate and validate our summarization algorithms and our methodology by an extensive set of experiments on real world data extracted from Reuters's nancial news archives.

In a perceptual study we investigated how humans perceive characteristics of virtual crowds in static scenes reconstructed from annotated still images where the orientations and positions of the individuals have been modified. We found that by applying rules based on the contextual information of the scene, such as the type of scene being portrayed, the presence of nearby individuals and objects and the constraints of the walking areas in the scene, we improved the perceived realism of the crowd formations. Results from this study can help in the creation of virtual crowds, such as computer graphics pedestrian models or architectural scenes.	computer graphics;plausibility structure	Cathy Ennis;Christopher E.

In this context, micro-blogging has been widely adopted by users as an effective means to capture and disseminate their thoughts and actions to a larger audience on a daily basis. Interestingly, daily chatters of a user obtained from her micro-blogs offer a unique information source to analyze and interpret her context in real-time - i.e. interests, intentions,and activities. In this paper, we gather data from the public timeline of Twitter spanning across ten worldwide cities over a period of four weeks. We use this dataset to (a) explore how users express interests in real-time through micro-blogs, and (b) understand how text mining techniques can be applied to interpret real-time context of a user based on her tweets. Initial findings reported herein suggest that social media sites like Twitter constitute a promising source for extracting user context that can be exploited by novel social networking applications.	blog;emoticon;file spanning;information source;real-time locating system;real-time web;social media;text mining;timeline	Nilanjan Banerjee;Dipanjan Chakraborty;Koustuv Dasgupta;Sumit Mittal;Anupam Joshi;Seema Nagar;Angshu Rai;Sameer Madan	2009		10.1145/1645953.1646240	text mining;computer science;data mining;database;internet privacy;world wide web;information retrieval;social network	HCI	-25.819307771665407	-46.41561355259261	127881
e4692aab8a67fda549ab32653a53af34ef2b4b71	egocentric online social networks: analysis of key features and prediction of tie strength in facebook	ego networks;online social networks;tie strength;prediction	The widespread use of online social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, is generating a growing amount of accessible data concerning social relationships. The aim of this work is twofold. First, we present a detailed analysis of a real Facebook data set aimed at characterising the properties of human social relationships in online environments. We find that certain properties of online social networks appear to be similar to those found “offline” (i.e., on human social networks maintained without the use of social networking sites). Our experimental results indicate that on Facebook there is a limited number of social relationships an individual can actively maintain and this number is close to the well-known Dunbar’s number (150) found in offline social networks. Second, we also present a number of linear models that predict tie strength (the key figure to quantitatively represent the importance of social relationships) from a reduced set of observable Facebook variables. Specifically, we are able to predict with good accuracy (i.e., higher than 80%) the strength of social ties by exploiting only 4 variables describing different aspects of users interaction on Facebook. We find that the recency of contact between individuals used in other studies as the unique estimator of tie strength has the highest relevance in the prediction of tie strength. Nevertheless, using it in combination with other observable quantities, such as indices about the social similarity between people, can lead to more accurate predictions.	linear model;observable;online and offline;relevance;social network;whole earth 'lectronic link	Valerio Arnaboldi;Andrea Guazzini;Andrea Passarella	2013	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2013.03.003	prediction;artificial intelligence	ML	-20.948639325089633	-44.60349970765879	127889

For comfortable assistance, service robots must recognize the surrounding conditions correctly, including humanmotion, the position of objects, and obstacles. However, since the everyday environment is complex and unpredictable, it is almost impossible to sense all of the necessary information using only a robot and sensors attached to it. In order to realize a service robot for daily life assistance, we have been developing an informationally structured environment using distributed sensors embedded in the environment. The present paper introduces a service robot systemwith an informationally structured environment referred to the ROS–TMS. This system enables the integration of various data from distributed sensors, as well as storage of these data in an on-line database and the planning of the service motion of a robot using real-time information about the surroundings. In addition, we discuss experiments such as detection and fetch-and-give tasks using the developed real environment and robot. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, they often have some shortages that rely on users' explicit trust statements. A fine-grained model computing trust from user ratings is more reasonable and gets more nonintrusive for average users. We propose a novel trust-based recommendation model for this purpose. Experiments on a large real dataset show that the proposed model has better performance in terms of MAE, Coverage, and F-metric than the conventional collaborative filtering model.	algorithm;code coverage;cold start;collaborative filtering;computation;computational trust;experiment;interaction;linear function;recommender system;social media;sparse matrix;trust (emotion);trust metric	Su Chen;Tiejian Luo;Wei Liu;Yanxiang Xu	2009	2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining	10.1109/CIDM.2009.4938623	algorithm design;probability density function;computer science;collaborative filtering;mathematical model;data mining;computational model;world wide web;correlation;information retrieval;statistics;collaboration	AI	-20.994740821046467	-46.4413448049589	128704
441447b052dfc72bf0e9286bdf07bce3fd43d610	how to personalize speech applications for web-based information in a car		We present a system for exploring and personalizing internet information in the car using natural language queries. Speech dialog applications are generated automatically from wellstructured internet content, such as tables, and transferred to the car. In order to cope with the large variety of speech applications, we propose a hybrid content-based personalization approach. Speech applications are clustered into various topic areas by mapping them to a domain ontology. Applications are ranked according to explicit preferences of the driver, global profile data and an implicit user profile. This profile adapts itself while the user is interacting with the system and takes into account the selected application and the speech queries. The resulting list of ranked applications is displayed to the user. Global ratings are based on the preferred topics of 20 subjects that were also questioned about the prototype’s usability and accuracy in a first user evaluation.	interaction;natural language;ontology (information science);personalization;prototype;table (database);usability;user profile;web application;dialog	Philipp Fischer;Andreas Österle;André Berton;Peter Regel-Brietzmann	2007			web application;speech recognition;world wide web;multimedia;computer science	Web+IR	-30.398855572858647	-49.99730083632128	128731
1fbcedbad249e652112d998986396ad3e69b05f8	personality based recipe recommendation using recipe network graphs		There is usually a vast amount of information that people have to sift through when searching for recipes online. In addition to looking at the ingredient list, people tend to read the reviews of recipes to decide if it is appealing to them based on the feedback of others who have prepared the recipe, with some recipes having hundreds of reviews. Several researchers have proposed recipe-based recommendation systems using details such as the nutritional information of the recipe, however, such recommendations are not personalized to the characteristics of the user. To contribute to research in this area, we propose a personalized recommendation system that makes suggestions to users based on their personality. People of the same personality tend to have many similarities, and personality is a predictor of behavior, we thus propose that the use of personality types could make recommendations more personalized. In this paper, we present the result of a preliminary investigation into the use of the personality of reviewers of recipes and a recipe-based network graph in recommending recipes to users.

Mobile peer-to-peer communication is a radical change to the traditional (wired) peer-to-peer computation. In this research, we build a system to facilitate information sharing and social interaction among users in a mobile peer-to-peer environment. This system enables users to express their comments and opinions on attractions (or points of interest) in a certain area. Comments given by one user are made available to another when they get close. Opinions are presented in aggregated form, using collaborative filtering algorithms. A user study is then conducted, and the results reveal that, by using the proposed system, users can receive useful travel information. Also, the conduct of sharing information triggers various types of social interactions among mobile users.	algorithm;collaborative filtering;computation;interaction;mobile device;peer-to-peer;point of interest;radio frequency;social network game;usability testing	Wan-Shiou Yang;San-Yih Hwang;Ying-Wei Shih	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops	10.1109/PerComW.2012.6197599	information and communications technology;mobile search;point of interest;mobile commerce;mobile telephony;mobile database;computer science;collaborative filtering;operating system;mobile device;multimedia;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;social network;collaboration	Robotics	-24.298284496954242	-43.688143295742876	129088

We have set up two scenarios in a physics based simulator: creating a pancake, and garnishing a pizza dough. Users where asked to execute these tasks using the provided tools and ingredients. Using a data processing module we then collect the low-level data and the relevant abstract events from the performed episodes. The recorded data is then made available in a format that robots can understand, by using a symbolic layer to interconnect the two data types in a seamless way.	autonomous robot;high- and low-level;knowledge acquisition;seamless3d;simulation;virtual reality	Andrei Haidu;Michael Beetz	2016	2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2016.7759439	robot;computer vision;simulation;cognition;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;knowledge-based systems	Robotics	-33.237384985604244	-39.15801708625442	129285

We use a statistical filtering method to construct dependence networks from weighted friendship networks of individuals. We investigate the 30 distinct motif positions in the 13 directed triadic motifs which represent microscopic dependences among individuals. Based on the structural similarity of motif positions, we further classify individuals into different groups. The node position diversity of individuals is found to be positively correlated with their economic outputs. We also find that the economic outputs of leaf nodes are significantly lower than that of the other nodes in the same motif. Our findings shed light on understanding the influence of network structure on economic activities and outputs in socioeconomic systems.	avt statistical filtering algorithm;big data;massively multiplayer online role-playing game;sequence motif;social network;structural similarity;tree (data structure)	Wen-Jie Xie;Yan-Hong Yang;Ming-Xia Li;Zhi-Qiang Jiang;Wei-Xing Zhou	2017	EPJ Data Science	10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0105-9	computer science;data mining;machine learning;friendship;motif (music);big data;socioeconomic status;structural similarity;network motif;artificial intelligence	ML	-20.77761157248206	-41.795290446696235	129491

Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach in recommender systems, among which Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) has proved very effective. In social networks, users linked together tend to have similar interests and some social-based methods emerged based on this assumption. However these methods treat different friends equally and actually different people may have different influence on a person. Besides social trusts, item relationships also provide rich information especially when trust information is not sufficient. The items liked by the same user may have similar characteristics and whether an item is preferred is influenced by its similar items. But most of these methods ignore the role of item relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation method which incorporates social trusts and item relationships into PMF. We compute user influence degrees and item similarities to weight user-user and item-item relationships when learning user and item latent factors. Experimental results on Epinions dataset demonstrate that our method has shown a significant improvement over existing approaches especially for the users who have made few ratings.	collaborative filtering;information overload;latent variable;recommender system;social network	Di Wang;Jun Ma;Tao Lian;Lei Guo	2014		10.1145/2554850.2554884	computer science;collaborative filtering;machine learning;data mining;database;world wide web;recommender system	AI	-19.85314982126802	-46.89457940628925	129653

One important observation in these online social platforms is that users’ interests and the popularity of topics shift very fast, which poses great challenges on existing recommender systems to provide the right topics at the right time. In this paper, we extend the online ranking technique and propose a temporal recommender system − TeRec. In TeRec, when posting tweets, users can get recommendations of topics (hashtags) according to their real-time interests, they can also generate fast feedbacks according to the recommendations. TeRec provides the browser-based client interface which enables the users to access the real time topic recommendations, and the server side processes and stores the real-time stream data. The experimental study demonstrates the superiority of TeRec in terms of temporal recommendation accuracy.	experiment;hashtag;real-time clock;real-time locating system;real-time operating system;recommender system;server (computing);server-side;social media;web application	Chen Chen;Hongzhi Yin;Junjie Yao;Bin Cui	2013	PVLDB	10.14778/2536274.2536289	computer science;data mining;database;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	DB	-24.644870018626218	-47.619533236785344	129840
80bf83a8b523a387257f76b70bd454d15e1119fc	har-si: a novel hybrid article recommendation approach integrating with social information in scientific social network		Abstract With the rapid development of information technology, scientific social network, i.e. SSN, have become the fastest and most convenient way for researchers to communicate with each other. However, a lot of published articles are shared via SSN every day which make it difficult for researchers to find highly valuable articles. To solve above information overload problem, a novel hybrid approach integrating with social information, i.e., HAR-SI, is proposed for the article recommendation in SSN. Unlike the traditional CBF and CF recommendation approaches, the social tag information and social friend information, which have been proved playing a significant role on recommendation in many domains, are effectively integrated into these two approaches separately to improve the accuracy in SSN. Prediction results made by the improved CBF and CF separately are combined with a hybrid method. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed HAR-SI, a real-life dataset from CiteULike was employed. Experimental results show that the proposed approach provides higher quality recommendations than the baseline methods, thus providing a more effective manner to recommend articles in SSN.	social network	Gang Wang;XiRan He;Carolyne Isigi Ishuga	2018	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2018.02.024	data mining;computer science;information overload;information technology;social network	AI	-22.80050791746647	-49.03051877885466	129998

Previous approaches for mining frequent traversal patterns only consider the forward references, such that the information about backward references will be lost. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to discover the non-simple frequent traversal patterns. The non-simple frequent traversal patterns include forward and backward references, and are used to suggest potentially interesting traversal path to the users, which are useful, especially, in a Web-based training environment. The experimental results show that the discovered patterns can present the complete browsing paths traversed by most of the users and our algorithm outperforms other algorithms in discovered information and execution times.	algorithm;blog;forward chaining;hyperlink;tree traversal	Show-Jane Yen	2003	IJDET	10.4018/jdet.2003100104	web service;web mining;web modeling;data web;web analytics;web mapping;web-based simulation;web design;computer science;web navigation;social semantic web;web page;data mining;database;web intelligence;world wide web;web server	ML	-30.494458733873483	-51.323161841857676	130036
42b303a7b15506fda0e5a74887af4986a76c2ad4	learning multi-touch conversion attribution with dual-attention mechanisms for online advertising		In online advertising, the Internet users may be exposed to a sequence of different ad campaigns, i.e., display ads, search, or referrals from multiple channels, before led up to any final sales conversion and transaction. For both campaigners and publishers, it is fundamentally critical to estimate the contribution from ad campaign touch-points during the customer journey (conversion funnel) and assign the right credit to the right ad exposure accordingly. However, the existing research on the multi-touch attribution problem lacks a principled way of utilizing the users' pre-conversion actions (i.e., clicks), and quite often fails to model the sequential patterns among the touch points from a user's behavior data. To make it worse, the current industry practice is merely employing a set of arbitrary rules as the attribution model, e.g., the popular last-touch model assigns 100% credit to the final touch-point regardless of actual attributions. In this paper, we propose a Dual-attention Recurrent Neural Network (DARNN) for the multi-touch attribution problem. It learns the attribution values through an attention mechanism directly from the conversion estimation objective. To achieve this, we utilize sequence-to-sequence prediction for user clicks, and combine both post-view and post-click attribution patterns together for the final conversion estimation. To quantitatively benchmark attribution models, we also propose a novel yet practical attribution evaluation scheme through the proxy of budget allocation (under the estimated attributions) over ad channels. The experimental results on two real datasets demonstrate the significant performance gains of our attribution model against the state of the art.

A significant part of the needs are constituted by search tasks that are usually addressed by search engines. Thus, daily search needs result in regular user engagement with a search engine. User engagement with web sites and services was studied in various aspects, but there appear to be no studies of its regularity and periodicity. In this paper, we studied periodicity of the user engagement with a popular search engine through applying spectrum analysis to temporal sequences of different engagement metrics. We found periodicity patterns of user engagement and revealed classes of users whose periodicity patterns do not change over a long period of time. In addition, we used the spectrum series as metrics to evaluate search quality.	quasiperiodicity;web search engine;world wide web	Alexey Drutsa;Gleb Gusev;Pavel Serdyukov	2015		10.1145/2684822.2685318	spectrum analyzer;simulation;computer science;discrete fourier transform;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-28.249510585536733	-46.02383381769255	130403

It leverages information collected on an individual's web-browsing behavior, such as page views, search queries and ad clicks, to select the ads most relevant to user to display. With the proliferation of social networks, it is possible to relate the behavior of individuals and their social connections. Although the similarity among connected individuals are well established (i.e., homophily), it is still not clear whether and how we can leverage the activities of one's friends for behavioral targeting; whether forecasts derived from such social information are more accurate than standard behavioral targeting models. In this paper, we strive to answer these questions by evaluating the predictive power of social data across 60 consumer domains on a large online network of over 180 million users in a period of two and a half months. To our best knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of social data in the context of behavioral targeting on such an unprecedented scale. Our analysis offers interesting insights into the value of social data for developing the next generation of targeting services.	next-generation network;online advertising;page view;social network;web navigation;web search query	Kun Liu;Lei Tang	2011		10.1145/2063576.2063838	behavioral targeting;online advertising;social network analysis;computer science;data mining;database;world wide web;social network	HCI	-20.98801901171929	-44.30788803821785	130572

This poses a challenge for researchers who seek to identify events and venues related to their work in order to draw more efficiently and comprehensively from published research and to share their own findings more effectively. Such efforts are hampered also by the fact that no rating system yet exists to assist researchers in culling the venues most relevant to their current readings and interests. This study describes a methodology we developed in response to this need, one that recommends scholarly venues related to researchers' specific interests according to personalized social web indicators. Our experiments applying our proposed rating and recommendation method show that it outperforms the baseline venue recommendations in terms of accuracy and ranking quality.	baseline (configuration management);experiment;personalization;sports rating system;venue (sound system)	Hamed Alhoori	2016	2016 IEEE/ACM Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL)	10.1145/2910896.2925450	social media;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-23.46424229521152	-49.26172487962459	131296

This type of annotation makes users comfortable when taking digital notes, as they do in every day life. This is an advantage over hierarchical authoring, which is a time-consuming task usually employed by content providers. This paper proposes a content-based recommender architecture which explores information that is available at the time users enhance content. This feature enables our architecture to reach a certain level of semantic information from the content and from user's preferences, which is essential for recommender systems applications.	recommender system	Marcelo G.

From the recent events in Arab countries, to natural disaster such as earthquakes or tsunamis, Twitter has proven to be a credible alternative to traditional means of information diffusion. Relatively few works have been done on this question of information diffusion, and in particular on the relative importance of different kind of users on this question. In this paper, we show that all users are not equal on the aspect of information diffusion. By investigating thoroughly the retweet chain lengths of users on a large dataset, we found that the number of followers of users plays an important role in their capacity to propagate information. From our observations we propose a very simple model, which is accurate enough to generate realistic length of retweet chains on the network. We consequently show, by studying a Twitter dataset centered on the Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami in March 2011, that such a crisis impact greatly the propagation of information. Finally, we use our results to discuss on the means of improving information diffusion to reach targeted users.	directed graph;hashtag;markov chain;relevance;social network;software propagation;web 2.0	Rémy Cazabet;Nargis Pervin;Fujio Toriumi;Hideaki Takeda	2013	2013 International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems	10.1109/SITIS.2013.84	disaster;internet privacy;computer security;social network	Web+IR	-20.91185370772567	-42.850422057447844	131931
b45575e103ce17c5c15ff2569e2c4ee6253737ce	distance and friendship: a distance-based model for link prediction in social networks		With the emerging of location-based social networks, study on the relationship between human mobility and social relationships becomes quantitatively achievable. Understanding it correctly could result in appealing applications, such as targeted advertising and friends recommendation. In this paper, we focus on mining users’ relationship based on their mobility information. More specifically, we propose to use distance between two users to predict whether they are friends. We first demonstrate that distance is a useful metric to separate friends and strangers. By considering location popularity together with distance, the difference between friends and strangers gets even larger. Next, we show that distance can be used to perform an effective link prediction. In addition, we discover that certain periods of the day are more social than others. In the end, we use a machine learning classifier to further improve the prediction performance. Extensive experiments on a Twitter dataset collected by ourselves show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art solution by 30%.	experiment;location-based service;machine learning;social network	Yang Zhang;Jun Pang	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-25255-1_5	data mining;world wide web	ML	-22.729673459689096	-45.328246217249294	132036

Towards this direction, a semantically enhanced Web-TV environment providing video-on-demand and simulcast streaming services, is proposed. The system offers content management and analysis automation capabilities by exploiting information derived from the semantic analysis of the user uploaded content and the social interaction of its users through the processes of annotation and tagging. A fusion based approach is employed for the categorization of content, enabling users to combine heterogeneous semantic information, thus enhancing content exploration with rich media experience. The paper focuses on the analysis of the system's architecture, the applied methodologies for incorporating user generated classification schemes and annotations, and the evaluation of machine learning algorithms to provide innovative multimedia content exploration methods.	algorithm;categorization;content management system;interactive media;machine learning;semantic analysis (compilers);simulcast;social media	Nikolaos Tsipas;Panagiotis Zapartas;Lazaros Vrysis;Charalampos Dimoulas	2015		10.1145/2814895.2814907	semantic computing;semantic search;computer science;social semantic web;semantic web stack;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-26.950284406855967	-49.83373516572277	132397

However, when asked to explicitly list the rules upon which such a decision is based, they are unable to do so. This is because our personal interests are examples of tacit knowledge. I have implemented a prototype agent-based retrieval system, capable of finding web documents matching a user's interests and connecting users with similar profiles. Based on empirical findings from this prototype I claim that agent-based retrieval systems may be used to capture our professional interests, thus making otherwise elusive tacit knowledge tangible. By using agent-based retrieval systems two otherwise troublesome obstacles are avoided: interests may be defined by examples instead of specific keywords, and there now exists a natural incentive for creating and maintaining a search profile.	agent-based model;intranet;prototype;web page	Dick Stenmark	1999			engineering;knowledge management;data mining;multimedia	Web+IR	-30.72487487295555	-47.00898557227189	132648

The objective of this work is to enable effective search and discovery of Web content using social bookmarking tags. Tags are metadata generated by users for Web content annotation. Their potential as effective Web search and discovery tool is hindered by challenges such as, the tag space being untidy due to ambiguity, and hidden or implicit semantics. Using a novel analytics approach, we conducted network analyses on tags and discovered that tags are generated for different purposes and that there are inherent relationships among tags. Our approach can be used to extract the purposes of tags and relationships among the tags and this information can be used as facets to add structure and hierarchy to reorganize the flat tag space. The semantics of relationships and hierarchy in our proposed faceted model of tags enable searches on annotated Web content in an effective manner. We describe the implementation of a prototype system called FASTS to demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.	content discovery platform;faceted classification;prototype;tag (metadata);web content;web search engine	Wei Wei;Sudha Ram	2012	ACM Trans.

a3d5c2449455d30fb76955cddab13c59614285ab	integrating social networks for context fusion in mobile service platforms	social network;mobile service	It is important for mobile service providers to be aware of user contexts and to provide contextually relevant mobile services to users. Thereby, in this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for integrating online social networks, which are regarded as an important channel for exchanging and propagating contexts. To efficiently discover personal contexts of certain users, the contexts of their neighbors can be fused to provide mobile recommendation services to mobile subscribers. However, since the social network of each user is distributed across several systems, it has been difficult to integrate contexts from distributed social networks. Thereby, we mobilize all possible onand off-line social networks to build an ego-centric social network. We implemented the proposed system by collecting the social network dataset from online sources (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, CyWorld, and co-authoring patterns in major Korean journals) and offline (e.g., co-participation patterns in a number of Korean domestic conferences). After the system was implemented, we provided mobile services to conference participants by sending text messages about time schedules of relevant presentations.	cyworld;distributed social network;online and offline	Jason J.

0280b28d8399b977ea4ee27384d1c70c71b9a027	videopedia: lecture video recommendation for educational blogs using topic modeling		Two main sources of educational material for online learning are e-learning blogs like Wikipedia, Edublogs, etc., and online videos hosted on various sites like YouTube, Videolectures.net, etc. Students would benefit if both the text and videos are presented to them in an integrated platform. As the two types of systems are separately designed, the major challenge in leveraging both sources is how to obtain video materials, which are relevant to an e-learning blog. We aim to build a system that seamlessly integrates both the text-based blogs and online videos and recommends relevant videos for explaining the concepts given in a blog. Our algorithm uses content extracted from video transcripts generated by closed captions. We use topic modeling to map videos and blogs in the common semantic space of topics. After matching videos and blogs in the space of topics, videos with high similarity values are recommended for the blogs. The initial results are plausible and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	blog;topic model	Subhasree Basu;Yi Yu;Vivek K.

The core of CF is the metric of similarity between two users, which usually uses the Pearson correlation metric. However, traditional similarity metrics have a low accuracy as a result of data sparseness. In this paper, we present a new metric which is based on a weighted network and triadic closure to improve the accuracy of similarity. The weighted network is built on each pair of users and the weight is the number of common rating items. The triadic closure is used to calculate the connection intensity between two users in the weighted network. The experimental results show that the new similarity metric is effective to improve the recommender results.	collaborative filtering;experiment;neural coding;personalization;portable c compiler;recommender system;triadic closure;weighted network	Wangpeng Zhan;Qing Li	2015	2015 IEEE 12th Intl Conf on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2015 IEEE 12th Intl Conf on Autonomic and Trusted Computing and 2015 IEEE 15th Intl Conf on Scalable Computing and Communications and Its Associated Workshops (UIC-ATC-ScalCom)	10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom-CBDCom-IoP.2015.319	filter;weighted network;computer science;collaborative filtering;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining;correlation;triadic closure;measurement;collaboration	Vision	-20.667852808347682	-47.83636800542031	133168

The system was used to test several commercial activities in a shopping centre where the AgComs (AgComs) provided information to an AgUser operating in a wireless device (PDA, mobile phone, etc.) used by a client. The AgUser received messages adapted for conditions of particular offers of interest to the client.

6623b7afbf3f170d6e8ad64832227bd7bb3b8b45	a credibility-based analysis of information diffusion in social networks		Social networks have many advantages and they are very popular. The number of people having at least one account on a certain social network has grown considerably. Social networks allow people to connect and interact more easily with one another, leading to a much easier way to obtain information. However one major disadvantage of social networks is that some information may be untrue. In this paper we propose a protocol in which the network becomes more immune to the diffusion of false information. Our approach is based on evidence theory with Dempster-Shafer and Yager’s rule which plays an important role in an individual’s decision whether to send further the received information or not. We also took into consideration the confidence degree of the neighbours regarding the information which is spread by a specific source node. Furthermore, we propose a simulation algorithm that allows us to observe the diffusion of two contradictory information spread by two different source nodes. The experimental results show that the true information spreads more easily if the ground truth is sometimes revealed, even rarely.	social network	Sabina-Adriana Floria;Florin Leon;Doina Logofatu	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-01424-7_80	machine learning;artificial intelligence;disadvantage;ground truth;credibility;social network;computer science	ML	-19.26875913901063	-42.897129979378725	133407

Previous efforts for making such crowdsourcing more effective have considered aspects as diverse as task and workflow design, spam detection, quality control, and pricing models. Our work expands upon such efforts by examining the potential of adding gamification to microtask interfaces as a means of improving both worker engagement and effectiveness. We run a series of experiments in image labeling, one of the most common use cases for microtask crowdsourcing, and analyse worker behavior in terms of number of images completed, quality of annotations compared against a gold standard, and response to financial and game-specific rewards. Each experiment studies these parameters in two settings: one based on a state-of-the-art, non-gamified task on CrowdFlower and another one using an alternative interface incorporating several game elements. Our findings show that gamification leads to better accuracy and lower costs than conventional approaches that use only monetary incentives. In addition, it seems to make paid microtask work more rewarding and engaging, especially when sociality features are introduced. Following these initial insights, we define a predictive model for estimating the most appropriate incentives for individual workers, based on their previous contributions. This allows us to build a personalised game experience, with gains seen on the volume and quality of work completed.	anti-spam techniques;crowdsourcing;experiment;gamification;predictive modelling	Oluwaseyi Feyisetan;Elena Paslaru Bontas Simperl;Max Van Kleek;Nigel Shadbolt	2015		10.1145/2736277.2741639	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;machine learning;database;multimedia;world wide web;crowdsourcing	Web+IR	-28.155279600958675	-46.97542131899233	133829

Social circles are inferable from those relations and there are already solutions to find the underlying sentiment of social interactions. We present an empirical study that combines existing Graph Clustering and Sentiment Analysis techniques for reasoning about Sentiment dynamics at cluster level and analyzing the role of social influence on sentiment contagion, based on a large dataset extracted from Twitter during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Exploiting WebGraph and LAW frameworks to extract clusters, and SentiStrength to analyze sentiment, we propose a strategy for finding moments of Sentiment Homophily in clusters. We found that clusters tend to be neutral for long ranges of time, but denote volatile bursts of sentiment polarity locally over time. In those moments of polarized sentiment homogeneity there is evidence of an increased, but not strong, chance of one sharing the same overall sentiment that prevails in the cluster to which he belongs.	sentiment analysis	Hugo Lopes;H.

This has given us an unprecedented access to the pulse of a populace and the ability to perform analytics on social data to support a variety of socially intelligent applications -- be it towards targeted online content delivery, crisis management, organizing revolutions or promoting social development in underdeveloped and developing countries.  This tutorial will address challenges and techniques for building applications that support a broad variety of users and types of social media. This tutorial will focus on social intelligence applications for social development, and cover the following research efforts in sufficient depth: 1) understanding and analysis of informal text, esp. microblogs (e.g., issues of cultural entity extraction and role of semantic/background knowledge enhanced techniques), and 2) building social media analytics platforms.

Folksonomies are said to support emergent classification, where the semantic value of the tags and their relation to one another is worked out through a negotiated process of users applying their selected tags and seeing what others have tagged the same way. Few studies exist to show how folksonomic tagging is actually done, and to what extent users share each other's tagging patterns. In this paper, we present the results of a social network analysis of two months worth of tagging Internet video on the social bookmarking system del.icio.us. The analysis reveals that specific videos are tagged in fairly coherent ways by a relatively tight group of users. However, contrary to our expectations, there does not appear to be much re-use of tags across different content, or even very many users tagging more than a few similar items. Overwhelmingly, specific clusters of tags and users are associated with individual video links. This result suggests that tagging bookmarks is highly local, and the overall collection of tags is unlikely to result in a coherent globally navigable classification system"""	coherence (physics);emergence;folksonomy;social network analysis;social structure;tag (metadata);uncontrolled format string;web 2.0	John C.

Abstract In this paper we discuss the relationship between data and DIKW, that the data only evolves to knowledge, which may have some value, but if without the wisdom we still could let the knowledge be really useful to people. Now the big data occupies much attention in some extent for his volume, velocity, and variety. But in practical use the value plays more important role. Finally to judge the value for data not necessary for big, in some cases the small data also may lead to big value. So we appreciate the data science, which may consider more inherent value from data. 1. Data and hierarchy of DIKW In the previous paper presented in ITQM2013 we had mentioned the hierarchy of DIKW that is data, information, knowledge, wisdom: a four layer hierarchy, where each layer adds certain attributes over and above the previous one (see Fig. 1). Data is the most basic level; Information adds context; Knowledge adds how to use it; Wisdom adds when and why to use it [1, 2]. A further elaboration of Ackoff's definitions follows: Data is raw. It can exist in any form, usable or not. It does not have meaning of itself. Information is data that has been given meaning by way of relational connection. This """"meaning"""" can be useful, but does not have to be. Knowledge is the appropriate collection of information, such that its intent is to be useful. Knowledge is a deterministic process. This knowledge has useful meaning to them, but it does not provide for, in and of itself, integration such as would infer further knowledge. Understanding is an interpolative and probabilistic process. It is cognitive and analytical.

We consider an RS which directly communicates with a set of providers in order to access the information of the items (e.g., descriptions), rate them according to the user's preferences, and deliver an Item List (IL). The RS is enhanced with a mechanism, which sequentially observes the rating information (e.g., similarity degree) of the items and decides when to deliver the IL to the user, without exhausting the entire set of providers. Hence, the RS saves time and resources. We propose two mechanisms based on the theory of optimal stopping. Both mechanisms deliver an IL, which sufficiently matches to the user's needs having examined a partial set of items. That is, the number of items in the delivered IL is optimal, producing a high level of user satisfaction, i.e., Quality of Recommendation (QoR). Our simulations reveal the efficiency of the mechanisms and quantify the benefits stemming from their adoption.	optimal stopping;recommender system	Kostas Kolomvatsos;Christos Anagnostopoulos;Stathes Hadjiefthymiades	2014	Expert Syst.

1f525e1fd814b79573b68329fa6be27328d95dc3	an introduction to the special issue on cross-community mining	article	People now live in heterogeneous social communities within cyber-physical spaces—both online communities (e.g., Flickr, Google?, LinkedIn) and social networks where digital content is exchanged, and opportunistic or offline communities that exploit opportunistic relationships between pairs of networked devices to exchange content (built on mobile ad hoc networking techniques) [1]. These communities have different technical features which lead to distinct kinds of interaction—such as patterns of comments and likes in online communities and co-location in offline communities, or issues of friendship, trust and influence in online communities and social popularity, and movement patterns in offline communities. We further envision the rapid development of cross-space communities in recent years, which try to bridge the gap between human interactions in the physical world and virtual world (by merging social elements in online social networks with physical contexts in offline communities). Significant examples include: location-based social networks (LBSNs, e.g., FourSquare, Jiepang) [2], which interlink online human interaction with offline check-ins; event-based social networks (EBSNs, e.g., MeetUp), which try to build the link between physical and online events [3]. Rather than viewing online communities and offline communities as competing, we see them as complementary and suggest cross-community mining (CCM), which aims to connect different forms of communities and study the interaction among them.

19db726213594d3885e0afaf1a236cf18df5a369	spontaneous social network: toward dynamic virtual communities based on context-aware computing		Abstract Recent efforts regarding mobile social networks aim at connecting people in smart environments considering not only their social behavior but also their context. In this perspective, this work presents a model, named SSN, based on the concept of Spontaneous Social Network, which allows the interaction of people anywhere and anytime without the need of any preexisting relation. The main scientific contribution of the SSN model is the possibility of creating social communities based on a combination of multiple contexts, including location, profile and data obtained from external online social networks. In this way, SSN focus on suggesting communities that users are interested in. In the process of developing the model, we propose a methodology for building semantic-based recommendation systems. In terms of evaluation, we performed two experiments using a developed mobile application called Dino. First, we presented hypothetical scenarios based on possible real-world SSN applications to measure users’ perceived sense of community. Second, we asked users to consider their real interests in suggested groups. We computed average values of 0.72 and 0.83 for precision and recall, respectively. The experiments’ results to assess the proposed scenarios ascertain average values of agreement above 80% for sense of community, belonging, social usefulness, member loyalty, and communities’ ephemerality. Therefore, our evaluation depicts that dynamic virtual communities formed by a SSN model based application would beneficially improve a social-aware virtual environment.	context awareness;social network;spontaneous order;virtual community	Natalia De Arruda Botelho Navarro;Cristiano André da Costa;Jorge Luis Vict&#x00F3;ria Barbosa;Rodrigo da Rosa Righi	2018	Expert Syst.

We approach the study of personality impressions in social media from the novel perspective of crowdsourced impressions, social attention, and audiovisual behavioral analysis on slices of conversational vlogs extracted from YouTube. Conversational vlogs are a unique case study to understand users in social media, as vloggers implicitly or explicitly share information about themselves that words, either written or spoken cannot convey. In addition, research in vlogs may become a fertile ground for the study of video interactions, as conversational video expands to innovative applications. In this work, we first investigate the feasibility of crowdsourcing personality impressions from vlogging as a way to obtain judgements from a variate audience that consumes social media video. Then, we explore how these personality impressions mediate the online video watching experience and relate to measures of attention in YouTube. Finally, we investigate on the use of automatic nonverbal cues as a suitable lens through which impressions are made, and we address the task of automatic prediction of vloggers' personality impressions using nonverbal cues and machine learning techniques. Our study, conducted on a dataset of 442 YouTube vlogs and 2210 annotations collected in Amazon's Mechanical Turk, provides new findings regarding the suitability of collecting personality impressions from crowdsourcing, the types of personality impressions that emerge through vlogging, their association with social attention, and the level of utilization of nonverbal cues in this particular setting. In addition, it constitutes a first attempt to address the task of automatic vlogger personality impression prediction using nonverbal cues, with promising results.	amazon mechanical turk;crowdsourcing;information retrieval;interaction;machine learning;openness;scalability;social media;the turk;user profile;video blog;video clip	Joan-Isaac Biel;Daniel Gatica-Perez	2013	IEEE Transactions on Multimedia	10.1109/TMM.2012.2225032	computer science;multimedia;personality;crowdsourcing	HCI	-33.61839493019232	-47.84382188198168	135274
c5f443dd0f7bdbd83702e2362c010f238bc3d090	exploring business ecological information with personal attention		In the era of Web 2.0, the amount of information has been growing exponentially, intensifying the information overload problem. The inconvenience caused by information overload not only lies in casual search by every Internet user, but also in finding business related information. Business analysts now need to explore an overwhelming amount of information in order to understand business ecosystem or technology development. This study designed a mechanism hoping to decrease the information searching cost and improve the effectiveness of information searching as well. Based on the business ecosystem identified by relation extraction technique, we combined semantically networked knowledge base to organize information of diverse sources to facilitate exploratory search. On top of that, we adopted personalization technique to filter irrelevant information, and applied spreading activation model in the business ecological knowledge. Through experimental design and evaluation, we found that users can identify more relevant information facilitated by the built system than searching only via term matching or user profile matching.	business ecosystem;design of experiments;exploratory search;information overload;knowledge base;personalization;relationship extraction;relevance;spreading activation;user profile;web 2.0	Fu-Ren Lin;Angela Lee;Ching-Pin Cheng	2013			personalization;knowledge management;the internet;management science;knowledge base;exploratory search;personal information management;business ecosystem;ecology;computer science;user profile;information overload	Web+IR	-30.663239107758834	-49.169705886354684	135440

Traditionally, rule-based attribution models have been used in practice. The drawback of such rule-based models lies in the fact that the rules are not derived form the data but only based on simple intuition. With the ever enhanced capability to tracking advertisement and users' interaction with the advertisement, data-driven multi-touch attribution models, which attempt to infer the contribution from user interaction data, become an important research direction. We here propose a new data-driven attribution model based on survival theory. By adopting a probabilistic framework, one key advantage of the proposed model is that it is able to remove the presentation biases inherit to most of the other attribution models. In addition to model the attribution, the proposed model is also able to predict user's 'conversion' probability. We validate the proposed method with a real-world data set obtained from a operational commercial advertising monitoring company. Experiment results have shown that the proposed method is quite promising in both conversion prediction and attribution.	algorithm;approximation error;iteration;logic programming;logistic regression;multi-touch;online advertising;rule 90;synthetic data;utility functions on indivisible goods	Ya Zhang;Yi Wei;Jianbiao Ren	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining	10.1109/ICDM.2014.130	gold;data modeling;online advertising;kernel;hazard;computer science;machine learning;data mining;predictive modelling	DB	-19.209707570168977	-51.1110308210507	135770
53ca3817eedf01ce7f8588fae17d85956517c02d	a structural approach to identify the position and role of the litigation relation network of smartphone companies		Many scholars have explored ways to identify the positions and roles of companies in a patent citation network but their analyses lack structure. Accordingly, this study proposes a structured approach to identify these positions and roles in a network by integrating social network and multivariate analysis. First, an adjacency matrix is constructed based on the graph theory to indicate the correlation between collected data. The next step is to conduct the network analysis and compute the statistics of network centrality. Then, the principal component analysis was made to break down these statistics to a few principal components. These selected principal components are then used as cluster variables for a two-step cluster analysis. Hierarchical cluster analysis was first made to determine the proper number of clusters and then K-means clustering was used for dividing actors into k proper positions. In addition, the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is conducted to test the significance between those positions. After that, a new adjacency matrix was built upon the rearrangement of k positions. The frequency within and between these positions is then computed and the cut-off value is determined to distinguish the difference between these frequencies. Finally, each position will be labeled based on its characteristics and the relationship within and between these positions. After the structured approach is constructed, the litigation-related network of smartphone makers will be used as empirical evidence. The results show that this structured approach can effectively distinguish the position and role of a company in a network.	adjacency matrix;centrality;citation network;cluster analysis;computer cluster;graph theory;hierarchical clustering;k-means clustering;principal component analysis;smartphone;social network analysis	Chwen-Li Chang;Kuei-Kuei Lai;Hsueh-Chen Chen;Horng-Jinh Chang	2017	2017 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation (ICE/ITMC)	10.1109/ICE.2017.8279877	multivariate analysis of variance;network analysis;principal component analysis;centrality;multivariate analysis;cluster analysis;hierarchical clustering;social network;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;mathematics	Web+IR	-19.542184845754726	-38.93223284199344	135848

A KOR query is to find a route such that it covers a set of user-specified keywords, a specified budget constraint is satisfied, and an objective score of the route is optimized. Consider a tourist who wants to spend a day exploring a city. The user may issue the following KOR query: “find the most popular route such that it passes by shopping mall, restaurant, and pub, and the travel time to and from her hotel is within 4 hours.” KORS provides browser-based interfaces for desktop and laptop computers and provides a client application for mobile devices as well. The interfaces and the client enable users to formulate queries and view the query results on a map. Queries are then sent to the server for processing by the HTTP post operation. Since answering a KOR query is NP-hard, we devise two approximation algorithms with provable performance bounds and one greedy algorithm to process the KOR queries in our KORS prototype. We use two real-world datasets to demonstrate the functionality and performance of this system.	approximation algorithm;client (computing);desktop computer;greedy algorithm;hypertext transfer protocol;laptop;mobile device;np-hardness;prototype;provable security;server (computing);web application	Xin Cao;Lisi Chen;Gao Cong;Jihong Guan;Nhan-Tue Phan;Xiaokui Xiao	2013	2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)	10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544939	computer science;vehicle routing problem;data mining;database;internet privacy;user interface;world wide web;transport layer	DB	-33.439529058026146	-46.88781820077844	136082

We here investigate how social metaphors can be exploited effectively and efficiently to solve this task. To this end, we define a method for query routing, REMINDIN’, that lets (i) peers observe which queries are successfully answered by other peers, (ii) memorizes this observation, and, (iii) subsequently uses this information in order to select peers to forward requests to.	routing;semantic query	Christoph Tempich;Steffen Staab	2006		10.1007/3-540-28347-1_6	natural language processing;database;information retrieval	HCI	-31.641074725630748	-50.429404182416874	136095

Consequentially, the increasing need for recommender services, from both individual users and groups of users, has arisen. In this paper, we present a new graph-based approach to a recommender system, called Folkommender, that can make recommendations most notably to groups of users. From rating information, we first model a signed graph that contains both positive and negative links between users and items. On this graph we examine two distinct random walks to separately quantify the degree to which a group of users would like or dislike items. We then employ a differential ranking approach for tailoring recommendations to the group. Our empirical evaluations on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed group recommendation method performs better than existing alternatives. We also demonstrate the feasibility of Folkommender for smartphones.	algorithm;recommender system;signed graph;smart device;smartphone	Heung-Nam Kim;Mark Bloess;Abdulmotaleb El-Saddik	2012	Multimedia Systems	10.1007/s00530-012-0298-5	computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-20.5968124235705	-47.363721973046154	136217

The method applies to classes of objects that are recognizable by people with appropriate expertise (e.g., animal species or airplane model), but not (in general) by people without such expertise. It can be seen as a visual version of the 20 questions game, where questions based on simple visual attributes are posed interactively. The goal is to identify the true class while minimizing the number of questions asked, using the visual content of the image. We introduce a general framework for incorporating almost any off-the-shelf multi-class object recognition algorithm into the visual 20 questions game, and provide methodologies to account for imperfect user responses and unreliable computer vision algorithms. We evaluate our methods on Birds-200, a difficult dataset of 200 tightly-related bird species, and on the Animals With Attributes dataset. Our results demonstrate that incorporating user input drives up recognition accuracy to levels that are good enough for practical applications, while at the same time, computer vision reduces the amount of human interaction required.	algorithm;computer vision;humans;instance (computer science);interactivity;outline of object recognition;principle of good enough	Steve Branson;Catherine Wah;Florian Schroff;Boris Babenko;Peter Welinder;Pietro Perona;Serge J.

This connection has been named perceptual anchoring. In complex environments, anchoring is not always easy to establish: the situation may often be ambiguous as to which percept actually corresponds to a given symbol. In this paper, we extend perceptual anchoring to deal robustly with ambiguous situations by providing general methods for detecting them and recovering from them. We consider different kinds of ambiguous situations and present planning-based methods to recover from them.

However, potential connections are often missed because of differences in vocabulary or semantic connections that are """"obvious"""" to people but that might not be explicit.

However, this technique is not capable of handling user error in domains with actions that depend on parameters that accept myriad values. Activities such as image, audio and video editing require user actions that are difficult for users to precisely replicate in different circumstances. Demonstrations that are off by a single pixel or a split-second cause traditional composite Version Spaces to collapse.  We present a method of incorporating error tolerance into Version Space algebra. This approach, termed Error-Tolerant Version Spaces, adapts Version Space Algebra to domains where the tactile capabilities of the user have a much greater chance of prematurely collapsing the hypothesis space that is being learned. The resulting framework is capable of quickly learning in domains where perfectly consistent user input can not be expected. We have successfully applied our technique in the domain of image redaction, allowing our users to quickly specify redactions that can be reliably applied to many images without the entry of explicit parameters.	error-tolerant design;pixel;programming by demonstration;self-replicating machine;spaces;user error;version space learning	Eugene Creswick;Aaron M.

In this paper, combining a modified version of Google's PageRank method with economic analysis of word of mouth, we investigate whether a product's position within a network composed of recommendation links is incrementally informative about its future sales. Based on data from Amazon.com, we document that with consumer word of mouth and other product characteristics controlled, the position of a product within a recommendation network does influence consumers' purchase decisions, and models incorporating link structure have a higher incremental predictive power of future sales than models without. In addition, as time elapses, the relative weights consumers placed on recommendations with price discount and those without are different. Last, we develop a learning mechanism through which we find the optimal damping value of the PageRank IR model in the Amazon context. Our results show that compared to general Internet surfing behavior, consumer consumption on Amazon is less random. We conclude that even though the product position within a recommendation network does influence customers' purchase behaviors, product sales are still mainly driven by their own product characteristics.	e-commerce payment system;information;pagerank;product bundling	Nan Hu;Gaoliang Tian;Ling Liu;Bin Liang;Yunjun Gao	2012	IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management	10.1109/TEM.2010.2064318	e-commerce;pricing;word of mouth;the internet;marketing;collaborative filtering;web page;marketing strategy;advertising;world wide web	Web+IR	-20.84725904783075	-51.18442769130465	137107

This fact has favored the development of personal or social robots, which are expected to behave in a natural way. This implies that these robots could meet certain requirements, for example, to be able to decide their own actions (autonomy), to be able to make deliberative plans (reasoning), or to be able to have an emotional behavior in order to facilitate human-robot interaction. In this paper, the authors present a bioinspired control architecture for an autonomous and social robot, which tries to accomplish some of these features. In order to develop this new architecture, authors have used as a base a prior hybrid control architecture (AD) that is also biologically inspired. Nevertheless, in the later, the task to be accomplished at each moment is determined by a fix sequence processed by the Main Sequencer. Therefore, the main sequencer of the architecture coordinates the previously programmed sequence of skills that must be executed. In the new architecture, the main sequencer is substituted by a decision making system based on drives, motivations, emotions, and self-learning, which decides the proper action at every moment according to robot's state. Consequently, the robot improves its autonomy since the added decision making system will determine the goal and consequently the skills to be executed. A basic version of this new architecture has been implemented on a real robotic platform. Some experiments are shown at the end of the paper.	autonomous robot;autonomy;experiment;humans;human–robot interaction;microsequencer;requirement;social robot	María Malfaz;Álvaro Castro González;Ramón Barber;Miguel Angel Salichs	2011	IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development	10.1109/TAMD.2011.2112766	human–robot interaction;unsupervised learning;simulation;motivation;emotion;computer science;artificial intelligence;social robot;main sequence;machine learning;autonomy;communication;robot kinematics;cognitive robotics	Robotics	-31.196279429087042	-39.6177147626528	137200

Generally, recommender systems are used in commercial applications, where information about the user's habits and interests are of crucial importance in order to plan marketing strategies, or in information retrieval systems in order to suggest similar resources a user is interested in. Commonly, these systems use explicit relevance feedback techniques (e.g. mouse or keyboard) to improve their performance and to recommend products. In contrast, the proposed system permits to capture user's interest by using implicit relevance feedback, based on data acquired by an eye tracker Tobii T60. The purpose of the system is to collect eye gaze data during web navigation and, by employing clustering techniques, to suggest web documents similar to those that the user, implicitly, expressed greater interest. Performance evaluation was carried out on 30 users and the results show that the proposed system enhanced navigation experience in about 73% of the cases.	cluster analysis;eye tracking;information retrieval;performance evaluation;proactive parallel suite;recommender system;relevance feedback;web navigation;web page	Daniela Giordano;Isaak Kavasidis;Carmelo Pino;Concetto Spampinato	2012		10.1145/2168556.2168639	computer science;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-33.40772546816034	-51.885180810402076	137249

0898cfc6b5d86466dd17e6608be5c5320281260b	measuring influence on instagram: a network-oblivious approach		This paper focuses on the problem of scoring and ranking influential users of Instagram, a visual content sharing online social network (OSN). Instagram is the second largest OSN in the world with 700 million active Instagram accounts, 32% of all worldwide Internet users. Among the millions of users, photos shared by more influential users are viewed by more users than posts shared by less influential counterparts. This raises the question of how to identify those influential Instagram users. In our work, we present and discuss the lack of relevant tools and insufficient metrics for influence measurement, focusing on a network oblivious approach and show that the graph-based approach used in other OSNs is a poor fit for Instagram. In our study, we consider user statistics, some of which are more intuitive than others, and several regression models to measure users' influence.	algorithm;instagram;open content;out of the box (feature);social network	Noam Segev;Noam Avigdor;Eytan Avigdor	2018		10.1145/3209978.3210134	computer science;data mining;the internet;social media;ranking;social network;graph	Metrics	-20.158514322829046	-45.94448328157299	137796

However, the same high abilities as human being are required for such intelligent machines since human decides own action using advanced complex recognition ability. Therefore, the present authors proposed a Bayesian intention estimator using Self-Organizing Map (SOM). This estimator utilizes a mapping-relation obtained using SOM to find transition of the intentions. In this paper, an improvement of the Bayesian intention estimator is reported by considering the task context. The scenario of whole task is modeled by Petri net, and prediction of belief in Bayesian computation is modified by other probability estimated from the Petri-Net scenario. Applying the presented method to an estimation problem using a remote operation of the radio controlled construction equipments, improvements of the estimator were confirmed; an undetected intention modes were correctly detected, and inadequate identification was corrected with adequate timing.	acceptance testing;algorithm;applicative programming language;computation;cross-validation (statistics);markov chain;naive bayes classifier;organizing (structure);petri net;radio control;self-organizing map;state transition table;television	Satoshi Suzuki;Fumio Harashima	2011	2011 RO-MAN	10.1109/ROMAN.2011.6005232	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;petri net;ubiquitous computing;invariant estimator	Robotics	-31.249039411646343	-43.233820966920426	137953

In recent years, the population of Blog users keeps growing rapidly. This study uses SVM to be a training method for creating a recommendation module. When the new user's data have been got into the modules, it will produce a suitable CSS template. Users can use the generated template file to change the CSS templates and apply to the Blog page in order to achieve the best results. We gather the users' attributes via simple and intuitive steps of the web page operations from themselves. The logs of web page will be sent back-end to database and record the user's preferences and settings for feedback schema immediately. After training all of the user data, system will provide the best template for user. It can save time for users to the selection and design CSS. Also, we use QUIS to do post-test questionnaire, the result is satisfactory. Finally, the discussion in this paper proposed a new methodology for classification of SVM application.	blog;cascading style sheets;database schema;paging;questionnaire for user interaction satisfaction;recommender system;support vector machine;teaching method;template processor;web page	Fong-Ming Shyu;Hsiang-Yuen Liao	2010	2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation	10.1109/ICNC.2010.5583261	computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	DB	-32.72978633446904	-48.766710389257824	137963

However, in some circumstances the items to be selected are not intended for personal usage but for a group; e.g., a DVD could be watched by a group of friends. In order to generate effective recommendations for a group the system must satisfy, as much as possible, the individual preferences of the group's members.  This paper analyzes the effectiveness of group recommendations obtained aggregating the individual lists of recommendations produced by a collaborative filtering system. We compare the effectiveness of individual and group recommendation lists using normalized discounted cumulative gain. It is observed that the effectiveness of a group recommendation does not necessarily decrease when the group size grows. Moreover, when individual recommendations are not effective a user could obtain better suggestions looking at the group recommendations. Finally, it is shown that the more alike the users in the group are, the more effective the group recommendations are.	collaborative filtering;recommender system	Linas Baltrunas;Tadas Makcinskas;Francesco Ricci	2010		10.1145/1864708.1864733	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;size of groups, organizations, and communities;collaborative filtering;machine learning;data mining;recommender system;cumulant;satisfiability	Web+IR	-28.579649596591935	-48.07460012703795	138599
267937f100414c8262baaa8a01dd5e03d8cbda3f	audio-visual attention: eye-tracking dataset and analysis toolbox		Although many visual attention models have been proposed, very few saliency models investigated the impact of audio information. To develop audio-visual attention models, researchers need to have a ground truth of eye movements recorded while exploring complex natural scenes in different audio conditions. They also need tools to compare eye movements and gaze patterns between these different audio conditions. This paper describes a toolbox that answer these needs by proposing a new eye-tracking dataset and its associated analysis ToolBox that contains common metrics to analysis eye movements. Our eye-tracking dataset contains the eye positions gathered during four eye-tracking experiments. A total of 176 observers were recorded while exploring 148 videos (mean duration = 22 s) split between different audio conditions (with or without sound) and visual categories (moving objects, landscapes and faces). Our ToolBox allows to visualize the temporal evolution of different metrics computed from the recorded eye positions. Both dataset and ToolBox are freely available to help design and assess visual saliency models for audiovisual dynamic stimuli.	experiment;eye tracking;ground truth;video	Pierre Marighetto;Antoine Coutrot;Nicolas Riche;Nathalie Guyader;Matei Mancas;Bernard Gosselin;Robert Laganière	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	10.1109/ICIP.2017.8296592	computer vision;visualization;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;ground truth;computer science;salience (neuroscience);toolbox;eye tracking;eye movement	Vision	-28.12141836041858	-41.421698739126505	138619

In this position paper, we present a framework that automatically assigns an offline reputation score by only relying on the physical presence of a user at a venue. In our approach, we passively capture the list of preferred WiFi networks (PNL) radiating from users smartphone as part of WiFi Probe requests in order to anonymously detect similar and recurrent users and to derive a personalised reputation score for an urban venue. By leveraging these ubiquitous WiFi radio signals, we seek to gather participation from a much broader set of visitors than online contributors. In this position paper, we outline our scoring technique, an early prototype architecture and discuss the potential of the proposed framework.	online and offline;prototype;smartphone;venue (sound system)	Afra J.

In such systems, recommender systems are needed to help people filter vast amount of UGC generated by other users. However, traditional rec-ommendation models do not use user authorship of items. In this paper, we show that with this additional information, we can significantly improve the performance of recommendations. A generative model that combines hierarchical topic modeling and matrix factorization is proposed. Empirical results show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art models, and can provide interpretable topic structures for users and items. Furthermore, since user interests can be inferred from their productions, rec-ommendations can be made for users that do not have any ratings to solve the cold-start problem.	algorithm;blog;cold start;generative model;internet;parallel computing;recommender system;topic model;user-generated content;web service	Wei Zhang;Jiayu Zhuang;Xi Yong;Jiankou Li;Wei Chen;Zhemin Li	2017	Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering	10.1631/FITEE.1500402	data science;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-19.54568103030809	-49.16597082532166	138973

Through these interactions, some property, e.g. information, ideas, etc., is spread through the network. The network may become dynamic as entities in the network interact and information, ideas, etc. flow through the network. This paper presents a general model of diffusion in dynamic networks. We use the model to examine how network structure, seeding strategy, and population inhomogeneity as defined with trust, affects the diffusion process. We simulate an evacuation scenario where the network structure represents a network of households. There are multiple sources that initiate the broadcasts of evacuation warnings and the goals are for the households to propagate the message and perform evacuation. The network dynamics observed are the result of the diffusion, where households may leave the network some time after receiving the warning. The results provide interesting observations on the effects of trust asymmetry and trust differentials. When we introduce population inhomogeneity using trust, the diffusion was more effective. The network structure and the seeding strategy used in delivering the initial broadcast also affect the effectiveness of the diffusion.	entity;information;interaction;simulation;ws-trust	Cindy Hui;Mark K.

d47e5c2dfb5dcd58e8d0f513807e5671e4607a35	link prediction methods and their accuracy for different social networks and network metrics		Currently, we are experiencing a rapid growth of the number of social-based online systems.The availability of the vast amounts of data gathered in those systems brings new challenges that we face when trying to analyse it. One of the intensively researched topics is the prediction of social connections between users. Although a lot of effort has been made to develop new prediction approaches, the existing methods are not comprehensively analysed. In this paper we investigate the correlation between network metrics and accuracy of different prediction methods. We selected six time-stamped real-world social networks and ten most widely used link prediction methods. The results of the experiments show that the performance of some methods has a strong correlation with certain network metrics. We managed to distinguish “prediction friendly” networks, for which most of the prediction methods give good performance, as well as “prediction unfriendly” networks, for which most of the methods result in high prediction error. Correlation analysis between networkmetrics and prediction accuracy of predictionmethodsmay form the basis of a metalearning system where based on network characteristics it will be able to recommend the right prediction method for a given network.

b2a02118ac3e1825847b7a50f71b4919beef0cab	mining usage traces of mobile apps for dynamic preference prediction		Due to a huge amount of mobile applications (abbreviated as Apps), for Apps providers, the usage preferences of Apps are impor- tant in recommending Apps, downloading Apps and promoting Apps. We predict and quantize users' dynamic preferences by exploring their usage traces of Apps. To address the dynamic preference prediction problem, we propose Mode-based Prediction (abbreviated as MBP) and Reference- based Prediction (abbreviated as RBP) algorithms. Both MBP and RBP consist of two phases: the trend detection phase and the change esti- mation phase. In the trend detection phase, both algorithms determine whether the preference of an App is increasing or decreasing. Then, in the change estimation phase, the amount of preference change is calculated. In particular, MBP adopts users' current usage mode (active or inactive), and then estimates the amount of change via our proposed utility model. On the other hand, RBP calculates an expected number of usage as a reference, and then builds a probabilistic model to estimate the change of preference by comparing the real usage and the reference. We conduct comprehensive experiments using two App usage traces and one music listening log, the Last.fm dataset, to validate our proposed algorithms. The experimental results show that both MBP and RBP outperform the usage-based method that is based solely on the number of usages.	digital footprint	Zhung-Xun Liao;Wen-Chih Peng;Philip S.

An experiment was carried out to collect users' three-dimensional social data: real-world mobile trace data, virtual-world online social data, and self-report social data. By analyzing network structure, we find that friendship in online social networks can better describe self-report friendship compared to friendship created by frequent physical encounters. Several supervised classifiers with the combination of features extracted from mobile trace data and online social data are used to predict the self-report social relationship under different social strengths. Results show that the proposed model can correctly predict more than 80% friends under strongest social tie strength. What is more, we define social popularity according to social relationships self-reported by users. By comparing social popularity with online and offline social behaviors, we find diversity in weekend is a good measure to describe social popularity.	experiment;online and offline;predictive modelling;social network;social search;supervised learning;virtual world;world online	Hongyang Zhao;Huan Zhou;Chengjue Yuan;Yinghua Huang;Jiming Chen	2015	IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems	10.1109/TCSS.2016.2517092	data science;machine learning;social computing;social network	Web+IR	-21.217862088351207	-44.592782588187525	139747

However, there are few methods or systems to manage photos simply, and a huge amount of photo data remains unorganized. Although it is possible to add appropriate words explaining the contents of the photo as one of the methods to manage photos, it requires much time and effort to input such indexes manually. It is also difficult to add indexes intended by a user automatically. This paper proposes a semi-automatic photo indexing system that enables users to generate indexes simply and browse a photo library efficiently. Index candidates are acquired from map database retrieval and relevant word extraction using Web retrieval based on shooting position and orientation information.

Cameras often have sensors such as GPS and digital compass. These sensor data are attached to photograph data as metadata. Metadata is helpful to retrieve photographs that show the designated points. For this request, existing systems search the photographs taken in constant distance from the designated points and show them to the users. However, some of them do not cover the designated point when their photographing orientations are largely different from the direction for the point or obstacles hide the point. So, the users often check many photographs to find their desirable photographs showing the designated points. In this paper, we propose a method to calculate the probability that photographs show the designated points. By showing the photographs that have high scores with priority, the users can find their desirable photographs with less checking. Also, we develop a system to retrieve photographs using our proposed scoring method.	exploratory testing;global positioning system;internet;reduction (complexity);sensor;smartphone;tablet computer	Yuki Taniyama;Tomoki Yoshihisa;Takahiro Hara;Shojiro Nishio	2017	2017 IEEE 31st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)	10.1109/AINA.2017.105	computer vision;computer science;sensor;image sensor;mathematical model;data mining;database;metadata;world wide web	Mobile	-30.593814790198667	-44.219092394353815	139993

In contrast to previous research we represent multimedia content by a vector of keywords instead of a vector of low-level features. This vector of keywords can be obtained through user manual annotations or computed by an automatic annotation algorithm. In this setting, we studied the influence of two aspects of the search by semantic similarity process: (1) accuracy of user keywords versus automatic keywords and (2) functions to compute semantic similarity between keyword vectors of two multimedia documents. We consider these two aspects to be crucial in the design of a keyword space that can exploit social-media information and can enrich applications such as Flickr and YouTube. Experiments were performed on an image and a video dataset with a large number of keywords, with different similarity functions and with two annotation methods. Surprisingly, we found that multimedia semantic similarity with automatic keywords performs as good as or better than 95% accurate user keywords.	algorithm;flickr;high- and low-level;semantic similarity	João Magalhães;Fabio Ciravegna;Stefan M.

In this paper we report on an effort to locate and employ existing datasets with information about real users, in order to validate a trust model. We describe how Reddit and Epinions datasets can be put to good use, towards this end. In addition to describing what we did for the validation of our own trust model, we reflect on how other trust modeling researchers may perform a similar process, of benefit for their own empirical studies.	ground truth;simulation	Noel Sardana;Robin Cohen	2014	2014 Twelfth Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust	10.1109/PST.2014.6890960	computer science;data science;data mining;database	AI	-21.621292718943035	-46.32681931227907	140260
c33264c55e9c3b6ff4ca51ae7948f0c064c4ea72	identifying the topology of the k-pop video community on youtube: a combined co-comment analysis approach	co citation analysis	YouTube is a successful social network that people use to upload, watch, and comment on videos. We believe comments left on these videos can provide insight into user interests, but to this point have not been used to map out a specific video community. Our study investigates whether and how user commenting behavior impacts the topology of the K-pop video community through analysis of co-commenting behavior on these videos. We apply a traditional author cocitation analysis to this behavior, in a process we refer to as co-comment analysis, to detect the topology of this community. This involves: a an analysis of user co-comments to elicit the inclination of user homophily within the community; b an analysis of user co-comments, weighted frequency of co-comments, to detect user interests in the community; and c an analysis of user co-comments, weighted sentiment scores, to capture user opinions by polarity. The results indicate that users who comment on specific K-pop videos also tend to comment on topically similar YouTube videos. We also find that the number of comments made by users correlates with the degree of positivity of their comments. Conversely, users who comment negatively on K-pop videos are not inclined to form specific user groups, but rather present only their opinions individually.

ca220910830177703ca8991acd028cff99d52036	epf: an elderly personalization features based collaborative filtering algorithm for pension service		How to recommend appropriate pension services to the elderly is an active research problem in health care fields in recent years. Traditional collaborative filtering(CF) algorithm does not take into account the elderly personalization features, which in turn leads to poor recommendation results. In this paper, an elderly personalization features based CF algorithm was proposed which can makes the recommended services meet the customer's personalized requirements. In the algorithm, personalized requirements form the elderly customers can be obtained by the classification of pension services. Based on classification results, the customer personalization features model can be built, in which customers are divided into several groups. Later, a personalized recommendation set is obtained according to the personalization features model. And, service similarity is calculated on the basis of customer ratings and the service category in the set. Finally the CF algorithm can be employed to detect appropriate pension services to the elderly. The experiments show that the algorithm can improve the accuracy of predicted ratings, as well as the satisfaction of elderly customers.	algorithm;collaborative filtering;eclipse process framework;experiment;feature model;personalization;requirement	Junxiao Cong;Chunshan Li;Feifei Liu;Dianhui Chu	2016	2016 9th International Conference on Service Science (ICSS)	10.1109/ICSS.2016.36	collaborative filtering;personalization;health care;pension;data mining;algorithm;business;statistical classification	Web+IR	-22.48419853620334	-48.60428389534782	140649

The non-simple frequent traversal patterns include forward and backward references, which are used to suggest potentially interesting traversal path to the users.

It can be used to investigate kinship patterns, community structure or the organization of other formal and informal social networks. Recently, email networks have been popular source of data for both analysis and visualization of social network of a person or organization. In this paper, three types of visualization technique to analyze social networks have been considered - Force directed layout, Spherical layout and Clustered layout. Each method was evaluated with various data sets from an organization. Force directed layout is used to view the total network structure (Overview). Spherical layout is a 3D method to reveal communication patterns and relationships between different groups. Clustered graph layout visualizes a large amount of data in an efficient and compact form. It gives a hierarchical view of the network. Among the three methods, Clustered layout is the best to handle large network and group relationship. Finally, the comparative study of these three methods has been given.	email;force-directed graph drawing;interaction;interdependence;social network analysis;social structure	Marufur Rahman;Rezaul Karim	2016	2016 International Conference on Networking Systems and Security (NSysS)	10.1109/NSysS.2016.7400702	layout;simulation;computer science;dynamic network analysis;organization;data mining;world wide web;force;data visualization;statistics	Visualization	-19.12628631949414	-40.564454429657616	141121
5bd26a5251d05a4b8ec5e3759b0b8fa76ebdb573	exploiting heterogeneous information for tag recommendation in api management		As web-enabled software becomes the standard for business processes, the ways organizations, partners and customers interface with it have become a critical differentiator in the market place, i.e., API Economy. With the rapid proliferation of APIs, it is increasingly important for users to effectively manage objective APIs in kinds of API markets, e.g., ProgramableWeb (PW), Mashape, etc. In this paper, to facilitate the process of API management, we propose a graphbased recommendation approach called ATRec to automatically assign tags to unlabeled APIs by exploiting both graph structure information and semantic similarity. Specifically, ATRec first leverages the multi-type relations (i.e., among APIs, mashups, and mashup assigned tags) to construct a heterogeneous network, in which a Random Walk with Restart (RWR) model is applied to alleviate the total cold start problem where no API has ever been tagged. Furthermore, we apply the recommended API tags in two API management scenarios (API search, API recommendation). Comprehensive experiments based on a real dataset crawled from PW demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	application programming interface;business process;cold start;differentiator;experiment;mashup (web application hybrid);running with rifles;semantic similarity;steady state;tag (metadata);tag cloud	Tingting Liang;Liang Chen;Jian Wu;Athman Bouguettaya	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)	10.1109/ICWS.2016.63	computer science;operating system;data mining;database;world wide web	SE	-22.814115041806716	-48.41679160792532	141138

Such processing facilitates featurebased user navigation in recommender system interfaces. Item features, often in the form of tags, categories or meta-data, are becoming important hypertext components of recommender interfaces. Recommending features would help unfamiliar users navigate in such environments. This work explores techniques for improving feature recommendation accuracy. Conversely, it also examines possibilities for processing user ratings of features to improve recommendation of both features and items. This work’s illustrative implementation is a web portal for a museum collection that lets users browse, rate and receive recommendations for both artworks and interrelated topics about them. Accuracy measurements compare proposed techniques for processing feature ratings and recommending features. Resulting techniques recommend features with relative accuracy. Analysis indicates that processing ratings of either features or items does not improve accuracy of recommending the other.	browsing;case-based reasoning;category theory;getty thesaurus of geographic names;hypertext;internet television;open-source software;recommender system;tag (metadata);vocabulary	Lloyd Rutledge;Natalia Stash;Yiwen Wang;Lora Aroyo	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-70987-9_19	computer science;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-30.424003593308022	-49.61292279969734	141170

After tracing the user’s behavior, through actions or rates, computational recommender systems use information- filtering techniques to recommend items. In order to recommend new items, one of the three major approaches is generally adopted: content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, or hybrid filtering. This paper presents three information-filtering methods, each of them based on one of these approaches. In our methods, the user profile is built up through symbolic data structures and the user and item correlations are computed through dissimilarity functions adapted from the symbolic data analysis (SDA) domain. The use of SDA tools has improved the performance of recommender systems, particularly concerning the find good items task measured by the half-life utility metric, when there is not much information about the user.	collaborative filtering;computation;data structure;information filtering system;information overload;information theory;recommender system;symbolic data analysis;user profile	Byron L.

In this work we study an adaptive model of a social network where directed links connect users with similar tastes, and over which information propagates through social recommendation. Agent-based simulations of two different artificial settings for modeling user tastes are compared with patterns seen in real data, suggesting that users differing in their scope of interests is a more realistic assumption than users differing only in their particular interests. We further introduce an extensive set of similarity metrics based on users’ past assessments, and evaluate their use in the given social recommendation model with both artificial simulations and real data. Superior recommendation performance is observed for similarity metrics that give preference to users with small scope—who thus act as selective filters in social recommendation.	affinity analysis;agent-based model;interaction;precision and recall;recommender system;simulation;social media;social network	Giulio Cimini;An Zeng;Matús Medo;Duanbing Chen	2013	Advances in Complex Systems	10.1142/S0219525913500094	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;multimedia;social psychology	Web+IR	-19.57553952672522	-42.5975975928308	141311

But recently, these algorithms have been increasingly receiving data from the general population in the form of labels, annotations, etc. The result is that algorithms are subject to bias that is born from ingesting unchecked information, such as biased samples and biased labels. Furthermore, people and algorithms are increasingly engaged in interactive processes wherein neither the human nor the algorithms receive unbiased data. Algorithms can also make biased predictions, known as algorithmic bias. We investigate three forms of iterated algorithmic bias and how they affect the performance of machine learning algorithms. Using controlled experiments on synthetic data, we found that the three different iterated bias modes do affect the models learned by ML algorithms. We also found that Iterated filter bias, which is prominent in personalized user interfaces, can limit humans’ ability to discover relevant data.	algorithm;experiment;information filtering system;iterated function;iteration;machine learning;personalization;real life;relevance;social inequality;supervised learning;synthetic data;user (computing);user interface	Wenlong Sun;Olfa Nasraoui;Patrick Shafto	2018		10.5220/0006938301080116	iterated function;filter (signal processing);machine learning;artificial intelligence;computer science	ML	-30.26853125855181	-42.4548005588962	141470

Cyber-A(nima) is dedicated to reflect the nature of an individual person (or any individual entity broadly) with inner humanity concepts. The inner humanity terms are constructed semantically to represent the person's humanity concepts in nature. The inner humanity instances are associated with and transformed from outward personal information, which are collected from user inputs, Internet resources, application systems, and portable equipment. Application-oriented and role-based user models are developed from Cyber-A(nima) to be humanized. The humanity-based user models have been used to innovate traditional filtering and reasoning approaches and algorithms to address the existing performance challenges such as cold start, data sparsity, and grey sheep. The approaches and algorithms are further applied in a number of applications to improve their performance. To verify the feasibility of the proposed Cyber-A(nima) concepts and techniques, a cyber-anima-based private cloud browser, a cyber-anima-centric application, an anima-desire-intention(ADI) recommender, a humanity-based search engine, and several cyber-anima-based recommenders for travel services, healthcare services, and educational services are presented as typical application models and examples.	algorithm;cloud computing;cold start;personally identifiable information;recommender system;sparse matrix;web search engine	Yinsheng Li;Bin Wu;Zheyun Zhong;Jianping Shen	2017	2017 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computed, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)	10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397427	distributed computing;computer science;data mining;big data;humanity;search engine;the internet;personally identifiable information;cloud computing;cognition;data modeling	AI	-26.5435372349386	-49.92857897665481	141941

Besides these factors, real estate price time series data are also considered into the model in order to improve the forecasting performance. Furthermore, we make a comparison between the integrated model and the baseline model without search engine query data. Experimental results indicate that the integrated model outperforms the non-integrated model, which suggests that online user searching behavior is of great value in enhancing the prediction performance.

In many domains, the information comes from company’s databases. In other applications, the information is harder to obtain and it is usually partial. In this paper, we will describe an application on travel planning, where the initial state and goals will be obtained by crowdsourcing. Travel planning requires the use of plenty Internet-based resources; some of them are related to human generated opinions on all kinds of matters (e.g. hotels, places to visit, restaurants, . . . ). We present the ONDROAD planner, a system that creates personalized tourist plans using the human generated information gathered from the MINUBE traveling social network. ONDROAD proposes an initial tourist guide according to the recommendation of the users profiles and their contacts. In addition, this guide can be continuously updated with newly generated data.	automated planning and scheduling;crowdsourcing;database;internet;personalization;social network	Isabel Cenamor;Tomás de la Rosa;Daniel Borrajo	2013			simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence	AI	-30.08099370486514	-46.78357320702739	142338

This phenomenon is usually used by the organisms to cope with missing external inputs. Applying such a phenomenon in a real robot recently has taken the attention of many researchers. Although some work has been reported on this issue, none of it has so far considered the potential of the robot's vision at the sensorimotor abstraction level, where extracting data from the environment to build the internal representation takes place. In this study, a novel vision-motor abstraction is presented into a physically robot through a memory-based learning algorithm. Experimental results indicate that our robot with its vision could develop a simple anticipation mechanism in its memory from the interacting with the environment. This mechanism could guide the robot behavior in the absence of external inputs.	cognition;robot	Fady Alnajjar;Abdul Rahman Hafiz;Indra Bin Mohd Zin;Kazuyuki Murase	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-10684-2_8	robot learning;computer vision;cognition;artificial intelligence;social robot;machine learning	Robotics	-27.934926568824952	-39.5474688706288	142356

Personality is an interesting user feature to be incorporated in user models; it may lead to know the user needs or preferences in different situations. In this direction, eliciting user personality is needed. This information should be obtained as unobtrusively as possible, yet without compromising the reliability of the model built. In this paper, we present a method for eliciting user personality by analyzing user interactions within the social network Facebook, with the goal of mining behavioral patterns. We have developed TP2010, a Facebook application based on the ZKPQ-50-cc questionnaire, to get information about both the user personality and his interactions within Facebook. We have built a classifier model starting from the analysis of a set of data from more than 11000 users. The results show that it is feasible to get information about the user personality by analyzing data from social network interactions.	behavioral pattern;information needs;interaction;social network;user experience	Alvaro Ortigosa;José Ignacio Quiroga;Rosa M.

Though many recommendation approaches have been developed to assist users in the selection of their interesting items in the online world, still the personalization problem exists. In this paper, we present a new recommendation approach to address the problems such as scalability, sparsity, and cold-start in a collective way. We have developed a knowledge-based domain specific ontology for the generation of personalized recommendations. We have also introduced two different ontology-based predictive models as minion representation model and prominent representation model for the effective generation of recommendations to all types of users. The prediction models are induced by data mining algorithms by correlating the user preferences and features of items for user modeling. We have proposed a new variant of KNN algorithm as Adaptive KNN for the collaborative filtering based recommender system. The proposed recommendation approach is validated with standard MovieLens dataset and obtained results are evaluated with Precision, Recall, F-Measure, and Accuracy. The experimental results had proved the better performance of our proposed AKNN algorithm over other algorithms with the highly sparse data taken for the recommendation generation.	cold start;collaborative filtering;computer user satisfaction;data mining;experiment;f1 score;genetic algorithm;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;knowledge-based systems;minion (solver);movielens;personalization;precision and recall;predictive modelling;recommender system;scalability;sparse matrix;user (computing);user modeling	Subramaniyaswamy Vairavasundaram;Logesh Ravi	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-017-4605-5	collaborative filtering;user modeling;web mining;recommender system;computer science;personalization;cluster analysis;movielens;data mining;minion	ML	-22.048928263571067	-48.690978545661615	142495

8475f0cba13ca793231f6814700568ba9d38f994	topical analysis of interactions between news and social media	news;data mining;twitter;topic model	The analysis of interactions between social media and traditional news streams is becoming increasingly relevant for a variety of applications, including: understanding the underlying factors that drive the evolution of data sources, tracking the triggers behind events, and discovering emerging trends. Researchers have explored such interactions by examining volume changes or information diffusions, however, most of them ignore the semantical and topical relationships between news and social media data. Our work is the first attempt to study how news influences social media, or inversely, based on topical knowledge. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model that jointly models the news and social media topics and their interactions. We show that our proposed model can capture distinct topics for individual datasets as well as discover the topic influences among multiple datasets. By applying our model to large sets of news and tweets, we demonstrate its significant improvement over baseline methods and explore its power in the discovery of interesting patterns for real world cases.	baseline (configuration management);bayesian network;interaction;social media	Ting Hua;Yue Ning;Feng Chen;Chang-Tien Lu;Naren Ramakrishnan	2016			news;computer science;data science;machine learning;data mining;topic model;world wide web	AI	-20.07935688497691	-45.0874537779433	142688

Since now, little has been done to measure and understand the credibility of this complex Web environment, which itself is a major research challenge. From the challenges related to the task of assigning a credibility value to an online service in Web 2.0 applications, we propose a framework for the design, implementation and evaluation of credibility models. We call a credibility model a function capable of assigning a credibility value to a transaction of a Web application, considering different criteria of this service and its supplier. To validate this framework and models, we perform experiments using an actual dataset, from which we evaluated different credibility models using distinct types of information sources, and it allows to compare and evaluate these credibility models. The obtained results are very good, showing representative gains, when compared to a baseline and also with a known state-of-the-art approach. The results confirm that the credibility framework can be used to enforce trust to users of services on the Web.	baseline (configuration management);experiment;online service provider;web 2.0;web application;world wide web	Sara Guimarães;Adriano M.

By applying LDA to music, we can estimate latent topics of music. However, we have to effectively reduce the size of the target dataset applied to LDA in order to recommend music from a large dataset. Hence, we use CF techniques, which recommend items using evaluation information of users who have similar tastes to a target user. Therefore, the proposed method limits the size of the dataset by using information of similar users and enables the recommendation of music considering latent topics of music. By using the idea of CF, our method can use LDA for music recommendation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.	collaborative filtering;latent dirichlet allocation;recommender system	Shohei Kinoshita;Takahiro Ogawa;Miki Haseyama	2015	2015 IEEE 4th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)	10.1109/GCCE.2015.7398561	speech recognition;computer science;data mining;information retrieval	Web+IR	-20.709434504352867	-48.5557068909934	143158

By modeling the sequential singing behavior, we first embed songs and users into a Euclidean space in which distances between songs and users reflect the strength of their relationships. Then, given each user's last song, we can generate personalized recommendations by ranking the candidate songs according to the embedding. Moreover, PME can be trained without any requirement of content information. Finally, we perform an experimental evaluation on a real world data set provided by ihou.com which is an online karaoke website launched by iFLYTEK, and the results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of PME.	markov chain;personalization	Xiang Wu;Qi Feng Liu;Enhong Chen;Zhe Yang;Jingsong Lv;Can Cao	2013		10.1145/2507157.2507215	computer science;personalization;multimedia;world wide web	ML	-20.407676139380875	-48.67249329447433	143270

Geo-tagged social media data are useful resource for this task; however, the abundance of everyday language in them makes this task still challenging. To address such challenges, we present TopicOnTiles, a visual analytics system that can reveal information relevant to anomalous events in a multi-level tile-based map interface by using social media data. To this end, we adopt and improve a recently proposed topic modeling method that can extract spatio-temporally exclusive topics corresponding to a particular region and a time point. Furthermore, we utilize a tile-based map interface to efficiently handle large-scale data in parallel. Our user interface effectively highlights anomalous tiles using our novel glyph visualization that encodes the degree of anomaly computed by our exclusive topic modeling processes. To show the effectiveness of our system, we present several usage scenarios using real-world datasets as well as comprehensive user study results.	anomaly detection;geotagging;global positioning system;glyph;heat map;hoare logic;marathon;real-time clock;sensor;social media;topic model;usability testing;user interface;visual analytics	Minsuk Choi;Dear Sungbok Shin;Jinho Choi;Scott Langevin;Christopher Bethune;Philippe Horne;Nathan Kronenfeld;Ramakrishnan Kannan;Barry L.

b5379045e6cffd4fe64f02c1a5008cdc8bdbcfd3	a time-aware personalized point-of-interest recommendation via high-order tensor factorization		Recently, location-based services (LBSs) have been increasingly popular for people to experience new possibilities, for example, personalized point-of-interest (POI) recommendations that leverage on the overlapping of user trajectories to recommend POI collaboratively. POI recommendation is yet challenging as it suffers from the problems known for the conventional recommendation tasks such as data sparsity and cold start, and to a much greater extent. In the literature, most of the related works apply collaborate filtering to POI recommendation while overlooking the personalized time-variant human behavioral tendency. In this article, we put forward a fourth-order tensor factorization-based ranking methodology to recommend users their interested locations by considering their time-varying behavioral trends while capturing their long-term preferences and short-term preferences simultaneously. We also propose to categorize the locations to alleviate data sparsity and cold-start issues, and accordingly new POIs that users have not visited can thus be bubbled up during the category ranking process. The tensor factorization is carefully studied to prune the irrelevant factors to the ranking results to achieve efficient POI recommendations. The experimental results validate the efficacy of our proposed mechanism, which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches significantly.	acm transactions on information systems;algorithm;categorial grammar;categorization;cold start;experiment;heuristic;information system;location-based service;personalization;point of interest;relevance;sparse matrix	Xin Li;Mingming Jiang;Huiting Hong;Lejian Liao	2017	ACM Trans.

88c86b0d760edea0a5ca99271053700df6384135	rainbow: preventing mobile-camera-based piracy in the physical world		Since the mobile camera is often small in size and easy to conceal, existing anti-piracy solutions are inefficient in defeating mobile-camera-based piracy, thus it remains a serious threat to copyright of Intellectual property. This paper presents Rainbow, a low-cost lighting system which prevents mobile-camera-based piracy attacks on intellectual property in the physical world, e.g., art paintings. Through embedding invisible illuminance flickers and chromatic changes into the light, our system can significantly degrade the imaging quality of a camera while maintaining a good visual experience for human eyes. Extensive objective evaluations under different scenarios demonstrate that Rainbow is robust to different confounding factors and can effectively defeat piracy attacks on various mobile devices. Subjective tests on volunteers further evidence that our system can not only significantly pollute pirated photos but also be able to provide good lighting conditions.	camera phone;copy protection;distortion;experiment;mobile device	Lin Yang;Wei Wang;Zeyu Wang;Qian Zhang	2018	IEEE INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8485881	computer security;visualization;rainbow;distributed computing;computer science;mobile device;intellectual property	Vision	-29.338246402246504	-42.22275290472611	143968

d7159131e21cb58320bb8d7ebcb719e7bf5e498e	personalized advertisement recommendation: a ranking approach to address the ubiquitous click sparsity problem		We study the problem of personalized advertisement recommendation (PAR), which consist of a user visiting a system (website) and the system displaying one of K ads to the user. The system uses an internal ad recommendation policy to map the user’s profile (context) to one of the ads. The user either clicks or ignores the ad and correspondingly, the system updates its recommendation policy. PAR problem is usually tackled by scalable contextual bandit algorithms, where the policies are generally based on classifiers. A practical problem in PAR is extreme click sparsity, due to very few users actually clicking on ads. We systematically study the drawback of using contextual bandit algorithms based on classifier-based policies, in face of extreme click sparsity. We then suggest an alternate policy, based on rankers, learnt by optimizing the Area Under the Curve (AUC) ranking loss, which can significantly alleviate the problem of click sparsity. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets, as well as three industry proprietary datasets, to illustrate the improvement in click-through-rate (CTR) obtained by using the ranker-based policy over classifier-based policies.	algorithm;experiment;personalized marketing;scalability;sparse matrix	Sougata Chaudhuri;Georgios Theocharous;Mohammad Ghavamzadeh	2016	CoRR		computer science;data science;machine learning;data mining;world wide web	Web+IR	-19.43347355656896	-48.15830746155677	144126

Player's task is to watch a given short video (without any further description) and formulate a search query, which will make that video appear in top results of the search. The player queries are then processed for keywords characterizing the videos. Our experiments show, that these keywords are both correct and from the great part, represent new information atop existing video descriptions.	cold start;crowdsourcing;experiment;human-based computation;information processing;personalization;search game;social media;user-generated content;video clip	Ales Masiar;Jakub Simko	2015	2015 10th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation and Personalization (SMAP)	10.1109/SMAP.2015.7370092	computer science;multimedia;internet privacy;metadata;world wide web;meta data services;metadata repository	AI	-26.837056439179985	-50.86923430934682	144184

Then, we select the geographical terms in each word vector into a corresponding geographical term vector and present a new method to explore the hot tourism locations and, especially, their frequent sequential relations from a set of geographical term vectors. Third, we propose a novel word vector subdividing method to collect the local features for each hot location, and introduce the metric of max-confidence to identify the Things of Interest (ToI) associated to the location from the collected data. We illustrate the benefits of this approach by applying it to a Chinese online tourism blog data set. The experiment results show that the proposed method can be used to explore the hot locations, as well as their sequential relations and corresponding ToI, efficiently.	algorithm;blog;mathematical optimization;relevance;word embedding	Hua Yuan;Hualin Xu;Yu Qian;Kai Ye	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshop	10.1109/ICDMW.2014.29	data mining;mathematics;semantics;internet privacy;world wide web;correlation;measurement	DB	-23.45083636832927	-51.71896640083692	144503

e08ab1cf2814282e6c8998e9fe15343e54c67ed4	a computational framework for influence networks: application to clergy influence in hiv/aids outreach		Strong social networks can encourage healthy behaviors. In this paper, we introduce a sociology-based computational framework for influence networks. The model construct is generic and is applicable to diverse social network analysis. We demonstrate its usage in calibrating the positive influence of church clergy in spreading HIV/AIDs information in a large metropolitan city. Five experiments are designed to contrast influence with respect to the interaction style between clergy and churchgoers. Competitive and non-competitive knowledge dissemination are also analyzed. The results show that when only one set of information exists, the spreading scope is directly proportional to the product of population size and the disease infection rate. When competing information is present, the importance of clergy in spreading the information decreases when the original propagation sources are ample. However, if sufficient interaction and trust are present among the clergy and the participants, the clergy's positive influence remains significant despite pre-existing knowledge. The generalized framework requires minimal regional data to establish the influence network. It provides useful policy insights for decision makers to determine effective avenues for information dissemination through community influencers.	algorithm;computation;experiment;quantum information;scalability;social network analysis;software propagation	Eva K.

However, in the currently prevailing free-flow experiments the intended situation for the application may not occur in sufficient frequency to provide statistically significant results. In this paper, we argue that the existing experimental approach should therefore be complemented with coordinated experiments. This allows to specifically create the desired test situation.  We present a methodology for such controlled experiments. The key to those experiments is the exact coordination of the participating cars' movements as well as a detailed control over all used soft- and hardware. To illustrate this methodology, we have performed an experiment with two cars that simultaneously approach an urban intersection and measured the radio transmission ranges with and without a road side unit. The results show that cars equipped with communication technology can inform their drivers about the approaching other cars up to ten seconds before a possible accident at such an intersection.	experiment;inter-process communication;radio broadcasting	Markus Kerper;Wolfgang Kiess;Martin Mauve	2009		10.1145/1614269.1614287	vehicular ad hoc network;embedded system;information and communications technology;simulation;telecommunications;experience design;intersection;statistical significance;design of experiments;computer security	HCI	-24.855103193182	-38.818150995246874	144904

How do we remove the bias of individual authors or sources? How do we compare reviews obtained from different websites, where ratings may be on different scales (1-5 stars, A/B/C, etc.)? How do we filter out unreliable reviews to use only the ones with “star quality”? Taking into account these considerations, we analyze data sets from a variety of different reviews sites (the first paper, to our knowledge, to do this). These data sets include 8 million product reviews and 1.5 million merchant reviews. We explore statisticand heuristicbased models for estimating the true quality of a product or merchant, and compare the performance of these estimators on the task of ranking pairs of objects. We also apply the same models to the task of using Netflix ratings data to rank pairs of movies, and discover that the performance of the different models is surprisingly similar on this data set.	software quality	Mary McGlohon;Natalie S.

Once selected, objects are tracked in parallel, but serial attention can be directed to an object that is visually crowded and in danger of being lost. An attended object’s future position can be extrapolated from its past motion trajectory, allowing the object to be tracked even when it is briefly occluded. Using the model, we demonstrate that the difficulty of tracking through occlusions increases with the number of objects because they compete for serial attention.	computation;computational model;extrapolation;software deployment	Andrew Lovett;Will Bridewell;Paul Bello	2017			psychology;software deployment;simulation;cognitive psychology;video tracking	HCI	-27.395504084272766	-38.71587738734728	145104

In an automated factory, the controlled system is the factory floor with its robots, assembling stations, and the assembled parts, while the controlling system is the computer and human interfaces that manage and coordinate the activities on the factory floor. Thus, the controlled system can be viewed as the environment with which the computer interacts. The controlling system interacts with its environment based on the data available about the environment, say from various sensors, e.g. temperature and pressure sensors. It is imperative that the state of the environment, as perceived by the controlling system, be consistent with the actual state of the environment. Otherwise, the effects of the controlling systems’ activities may be disastrous. Hence, timely monitoring of the environment as well as timely processing of the sensed information is necessary. The sensed data is processed further to derive new data. For example, the temperature and pressure information pertaining to a reaction may be used to derive the rate at which the reaction appears to be progressing. This derivation typically would depend on past temperature and pressure trends and so some of the needed information may have to be fetched from archival storage. Based on the derived data, where the derivation may involve multiple steps, actuator commands are set. For instance, in our example, the derived reaction rate is used to determine the amount of chemicals or coolant to be added to the reaction. In general, the history of (interactions with) the environment are also logged in archival storage. In addition to the timing constraints that arise from the need to continuously track the environment, timing correctness requirements in a real–time (database) system also arise because of the need to make data available to the controlling system for its decision-making activities. If the computer controlling a robot does not command it to stop or turn on time, the robot might collide with another object on the factory floor. Needless to say, such a mishap can result in a major catastrophe. Besides robotics, applications such as medical patient monitoring, programmed stock trading, and military command and control systems like submarine contact tracking require timely actions as well as the ability to access and store complex data that reflects the state of the application’s environment. That is, data in these applications must be valid, or fresh, when it is accessed in order for the application to perform correctly. In a patient monitoring system, data such as heart rate, temperature, and blood pressure must be collected periodically. Transactions that monitor the danger level of a patient’s status must be performed within a specified time, and the data must be accessed within an interval that defines the validity of the data. If not, the computations made by the transactions do not reflect the current state of the patient’s health. A traditional database provides some of the functionality required by these applications, such as coordination of concurrent actions and consistent access to shared data. But they do not provide for enforcement of the	archive;catastrophe theory;computation;control system;correctness (computer science);database;imperative programming;interaction;login;real-time operating system;real-time transcription;requirement;robot;robotics;sensor	Krithi Ramamritham;Sang Hyuk Son;Lisa Cingiser DiPippo	2004	Real-Time Systems	10.1023/B:TIME.0000045317.37980.a5	real-time computing;computer science;world wide web	Robotics	-32.14374654866212	-38.497728433814	145542

In this paper, we take a microscopic view of the information propagation pattern in blogosphere by investigating blog cascade affinity. A blog cascade is a group of posts linked together discussing about the same topic, and cascade affinity refers to the phenomenon of a blog’s inclination to join a specific cascade. We identify and analyze an array of macroscopic and microscopic content-oblivious features that may affect a blogger’s cascade joining behavior and utilize these features to predict cascade affinity of blogs. Based on these features, we present two non-probabilistic and probabilistic strategies, namely support vector machine (SVM) classification-based approach and Bipartite Markov Random Field-based (BiMRF) approach, respectively, to predict the probability of blogs’ affinity to a cascade and rank them accordingly. Evaluated on a real dataset consisting of 873,496 posts, our experimental results demonstrate that our prediction strategy can generate high quality results ( $$F1$$ -measure of 72.5 % for SVM and 71.1 % for BiMRF) comparing with the approaches using traditional or singular features only such as elapsed time, number of participants which is around 11.2 and 8.9 %, respectively. Our experiments also showed that among all features identified, the number of quasi-friends is the most important factor affecting bloggers’ inclination to join cascades.	affinity analysis;application programming interface;blog;blogger;blogosphere;display resolution;existential quantification;experiment;genesis;markov chain;markov random field;processor affinity;reblogging;scsi initiator and target;server (computing);software propagation;static web page;support vector machine;world wide web	Hui Li;Sourav S.

1c63c5b7ea7b97a1a471ec710ad907e7190df5c1	social networks and information retrieval, how are they converging? a survey, a taxonomy and an analysis of social information retrieval approaches and platforms	social information retrieval;information retrieval;social recommendation;social networks;social search	There is currently a number of research work performed in the area of bridging the gap between Information Retrieval (IR) and Online Social Networks (OSN). This is mainly done by enhancing the IR process with information coming from social networks, a process called Social Information Retrieval (SIR). The main question one might ask is What would be the benefits of using social information (no matter whether it is content or structure) into the information retrieval process and how is this currently done? With the growing number of efforts towards the combination of IR and social networks, it is necessary to build a clearer picture of the domain and synthesize the efforts in a structured andmeaningful way. This paper reviews different efforts in this domain. It intends to provide a clear understanding of the issues as well as a clear structure of the contributions. More precisely, we propose (i) to review some of the most important contributions in this domain to understand the principles of SIR, (ii) a taxonomy to categorize these contributions, and finally, (iii) an analysis of some of these contributions and tools with respect to several criteria, which we believe are crucial to design an effective SIR approach. This paper is expected to serve researchers and practitioners as a reference to help them structuring the domain, position themselves and, ultimately, help them to propose new contributions or improve existing ones. & 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Under the hypothesis that synchronization of the reaction of spectators indicates such highlights, we define a synchronization measure between spectators that is capable of extracting movie highlights. The intuitive idea of our approach is to define (a) a parameterization of one spectator's physiological data on a manifold; (b) the synchronization measure between spectators as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between local shape distributions of the underlying manifolds. We evaluate our approach using data collected in an experiment where the electro-dermal activity of spectators was recorded during the entire projection of a movie in a cinema. We compare our methodology with baseline synchronization measures, such as correlation, Spearman's rank correlation, mutual information, Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance. Results indicate that the proposed approach allows to accurately distinguish highlight from non-highlight scenes.	baseline (configuration management);cinema 4d;emoticon;mutual information	Michal Muszynski;Theodoros Kostoulas;Guillaume Chanel;Patrizia Lombardo;Thierry Pun	2015		10.1145/2818346.2820773	diffusion map;synchronization;computer vision;simulation;speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;affective computing;multimedia;nonlinear dimensionality reduction;dimensionality reduction	ML	-27.695628619384863	-41.79390769752103	146483

The proposed MAS employs Web Use Mining and Web Structure Mining techniques in order to detect the most relevant interactions of the KnowCat users and therefore should have more weight in the Knowledge Crystallization mechanism of KnowCat. More concretely, the MAS extracts the users interaction information and analyses whether they are working in the system in an organised or disorganised way. The obtained results in this study give us evidence that organised users contribute positively in a good performance of the Knowledge Crystallization mechanism of KnowCat.	interaction information;knowledge management;management system;multi-agent system;structure mining	Alexandra Dumitrescu;Ruth Cobos Pérez;Jaime Moreno-Llorena	2009		10.1007/978-1-4419-0522-2_6	interactive systems engineering;knowledge management;data mining;world wide web	HCI	-31.841064243993944	-49.10871438656414	146519

However, this specific domain requires expert algorithms with domain knowledge to recommend jobs conformable to people's expertise and interests. This is the topic of the Recsys Challenge 2016, which aims for an algorithm that predicts the job postings that a user will positively interact with. Our solution is a hybrid algorithm combining a content-based and KNN approach. The content-based algorithm matches features of candidate recommendations and job postings of historical interactions. The KNN approach searches for the job postings that are the most similar to the postings the user interacted with in the past. The resulting combination is a lightweight algorithm that is fast and scalable, generating recommendations with a proper evaluation score.	cold start;computation;expert system;hybrid algorithm;image scaling;interaction;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;mathematical optimization;recommender system;requirement;scalability	Toon De Pessemier;Kris Vanhecke;Luc Martens	2016		10.1145/2987538.2987539	scalability;simulation;computer science;machine learning;data mining;world wide web;k-nearest neighbors algorithm	AI	-28.294776422831237	-49.51220836743305	146609

In particular, we seek to discover the pair-wise probabilistic dependency in topics of documents which associate social actors from a latent social network, where these documents are being shared. By viewing the evolution of topics as a Markov chain, we estimate a Markov transition matrix of topics by leveraging social interactions and topic semantics. Metastable states in a Markov chain are applied to the clustering of topics. Applied to the CiteSeer dataset, a collection of documents in academia, we show the trends of research topics, how research topics are related and which are stable. We also show how certain social actors, authors, impact these topics and propose new ways for evaluating author impact.	citeseerx;cluster analysis;interaction;markov chain;social network;stochastic matrix	Ding Zhou;Xiang Ji;Hongyuan Zha;C.

Unfortunately, many forums have too much activity and information available, resulting in information overload. Moderation systems are implemented in some forums as a way to handle this problem, but due to sparsity issues, they are often not sufficient. In this paper we describe a novel method for learning from past moderations to develop a classifier that can perform automated moderation and thus address the sparsity problem. Additionally, we discuss the possibility of training a moderating classifier on a moderated forum and then applying it to an otherwise unmoderated forum.	comment (computer programming);information overload;internet;naive bayes classifier;sensor;sparse matrix;statistical classification	Andrew Arnt;Shlomo Zilberstein	2003		10.1109/WI.2003.1241285	the internet;biological classification;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;machine learning;information overload;data mining;world wide web	NLP	-22.991550781859072	-50.89434460243195	147104

In order to realize photo-taking point recommendation, we introduce a novel point and photo selection method based on nested clustering. From our experiments, it is shown that better recommendation accuracy with our proposed method can be attained.	cluster analysis;experiment;feature (computer vision);flickr;user interface;vii;web service	Kosuke Kimura;Hung-Hsuan Huang;Kyoji Kawagoe	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia	10.1109/ISM.2012.20	web service;computer science;internet privacy;law;world wide web;information retrieval;recommender system	DB	-23.284798263463117	-49.08591232133584	147127

The presence of both variety and volume in these datasets pose new challenges, and thereby opportunities for the field of social network analysis (SNA). Traditionally, SNA techniques are designed to work only with the link data. Recently, there have been some attempts to analyze link data in conjunction with interaction data. In this paper, we advance this research agenda further by introducing a notion called signature of a social network and propose an efficient approach to compute it. The signature of a social network is essentially a sparse subgraph of the original social network such that it succinctly captures key information contained within the data sources (both linked and interaction data). The signature of a social network need not be unique. The value behind computing such a signature stems from the fact that once computed, any subsequent SNA (e.g. community detection, influence propagation, etc.) becomes much faster while not compromising much with quality. The concept of importance weights of the edges has been the guiding principle for us behind the idea of signature of a social network. In our approach, we start with deriving importance weights of the edges based on the information contained in these data sources. Next, we apply a novel graph sparsification technique to generate signature of the given social network by dropping edges that are not so informative. We demonstrate the efficacy of the signature of social network with an application to community detection on certain well-known social network datasets such as Digg, Youtube, Epinions, DBLP, and Amazon. We obtained effective community detection results on these datasets using our proposed approach while achieving about 40 times speed-up.	dbl-browser;digital signature;information;interaction;social media;social network analysis;software propagation;sparse matrix	Ramasuri Narayanam;Dinesh Garg;Hemank Lamba	2014	2014 Sixth International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)	10.1109/COMSNETS.2014.6734901	digital signature;computer science;graph theory;data mining;internet privacy;data analysis;world wide web;computer security;computer network	DB	-24.11723574573469	-50.89878087581887	147402

Because most of previous approaches for recommender system have to rely on the usage history of customers, collaborative filtering is not directly applicable to solve the new item problem. Therefore they have suggested content-based recommender system using feature values of new items. However it is not sufficient to recommend new items. This research aims to suggest hybrid recommendation procedures based on preference boundary of target customer. We suggest TC, BC, and NC algorithms to determine the preference boundary. TC is an algorithm developed from contents-based filtering, whereas BC and NC are algorithms based on collaborative filtering, which incorporates neighbors, similar customers to a target customer. We evaluate the performances of suggested algorithms with real mobile image transaction data set. Experimental test results that the performances of BC and NC is better than that of TC, which means that the suggested hybrid procedures are more effective than the content-based approach.	algorithm;collaborative filtering;nc (complexity);performance;recommender system;transaction data	Jae Kyeong Kim;Moon Kyoung Jang;Hyea Kyeong Kim;Yoon Ho Cho	2009		10.1145/1593254.1593298	computer science;collaborative filtering;data mining;database;world wide web;recommender system	AI	-21.216944042598126	-49.727451724799415	147773

Since the categorization is learnt from users feedback, it can accurately represent the user sentiment on the videos.

To capture the pair-wise interactions between geo-location and useru0027s topical profile in social-spatial systems, we propose the modeling of fine-grained and multi-dimensional user geo-topic profiles. We then propose a two-layered Bayesian hierarchical user factorization generative framework to overcome user heterogeneity and another enhanced model integrated with useru0027s contextual information to alleviate multi-dimensional sparsity. Through extensive experiments, we find the proposed model leads to a 5textasciitilde13% improvement in precision and recall over the alternative baselines and an additional 6textasciitilde11% improvement with the integration of useru0027s contexts.	experiment;geolocation;interaction;personalization;precision and recall;recommender system;social media;sparse matrix;web search engine	Haokai Lu;Wei Niu;James Caverlee	2018		10.1145/3209978.3210044	recommender system;personalization;data mining;user modeling;computer science;precision and recall;social media;factorization;bayesian probability;user profile	Web+IR	-19.324995121270295	-47.35726182564039	148076

A wide variety of approaches for resizing exist: sophisticated """"content-aware"""" (or retargeting) approaches are built on the assumption that carefully chosen distortions are preferable to the naïve approach of uniformly stretching the image. However, there is little codified understanding of how distortions of the image, including uniform stretching or more complex warps introduced by retargeting, are perceived. In this paper, we describe experiments that explore the perception of image stretching, to establish the baseline for assessing more complex resizing methods, as well as to establish the methodology. In a series of experiments, we show that the perception of stretching is a complex phenomenon depending on a myriad of factors including the amount of distortion, the image content, the viewer's cultural background, and the observation time. We provide a methodology for creating images that avoid unfair cues to stretching and explore issues in using online worker communities for studies. We show that even small stretches can be detected in some cases. These findings have ramifications for the design and evaluation of image retargeting, and suggest that a more thorough study of distortion perception is necessary."""	baseline (configuration management);distortion;experiment;naivety;retargeting;seam carving;warp (information security)	Yuzhen Niu;Feng Liu;Xueqing Li;Huiyun Bao;Michael Gleicher	2010		10.1145/1836248.1836266	computer vision;aspect ratio;computer science;operating system;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-29.66432433045839	-42.10311645308989	148322

Our approach, called Logical Semantics with Perception (LSP), provides a natural and intuitive interface by significantly reducing the amount of supervision that a human is required to provide. This paper demonstrates LSP in an interactive setting. Given speech and gesture input, LSP is able to learn object and relation classifiers for objects like mugs and relations like left and right. We extend LSP to generate complex natural language descriptions of selected objects using adjectives, nouns and relations, such as “the orange mug to the right of the green book.” Furthermore, we extend LSP to incorporate determiners (e.g., “the”) into its training procedure, enabling the model to generate acceptable relational language 20% more often than the unaugmented model.	gesture recognition;green book (cd standard);interaction;interactivity;modal logic;natural language generation;robot;trusted computer system evaluation criteria	Thomas Kollar;Jayant Krishnamurthy;Grant P.

Until now, little research has been done on the usefulness of these commercially available external databases for CRM. This study will present a methodology for such external data vendors based on random forests predictive modeling techniques to create commercial variables that solve the shortcomings of a classic transactional database. Eventually, we predicted spending pleasure variables, a composite measure of purchasing behavior and attitude, in 26 product categories for more than 3 million respondents. Enhancing a company’s transactional database with these variables can significantly improve the predictive performance of existing CRM models. This has been demonstrated in a case study with a magazine publisher for which prospects needed to be identified for new customer acquisition.	customer relationship management;database transaction;predictive modelling;purchasing;random forest;randomness	Philippe Baecke;Dirk Van den Poel	2009	Journal of Intelligent Information Systems	10.1007/s10844-009-0111-x	random forest;customer relationship management;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;database	DB	-19.99136415681708	-52.03369201115394	148502

In this paper, we propose a universal scheme to integrate rich information for personalized video recommendation. Our approach regards video recommendation as a ranking task. First, it generates multiple ranking lists by exploring different information sources. In particular, one novel source user’s relationship strength is inferred through the online social network and applied to recommend videos. Second, based on multiple ranking lists, a multi-task rank aggregation approach is proposed to integrate these ranking lists to generate a final result for video recommendation. It is shown that our scheme is flexible that can easily incorporate other methods by adding their generated ranking lists into our multi-task rank aggregation approach. We conduct experiments on a large dataset with 76 users and more than 11,000 videos. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.	computer multitasking;experiment;information source;learning to rank;multi-task learning;personalization;social network;video	Xiaojian Zhao;Jin Yuan;Meng Wang;Guangda Li;Richang Hong;Zhoujun Li;Tat-Seng Chua	2012	Multimedia Systems	10.1007/s00530-012-0267-z	computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-20.02281280045558	-47.813051633462756	148674

Such playlist should ideally satisfy a very diverse crowd by finding a perfect eclectic mix of songs to keep everyone satisfied. In fact, music playlists for large parties are usually composed by a very heterogeneous set of songs, so everyone can listen to songs of their liking at some point. Such playlists, which we call heterogeneous playlists, are also very appropriate in dynamic contexts, when the mood of the listener changes with time, such as workout sessions or road trips. The challenge of automatically generating heterogeneous playlists is to find the appropriate balance among several conflicting goals. For instance, the generated playlist should have smooth transitions between successive tracks while covering a highly diverse set of songs in the time the user has available to her/him. In this paper, we formulate the problem of automatically generating high quality heterogeneous playlists and propose two methods for solving it, namely ROPE and STRAW. We demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed algorithms by applying them to a large collection of songs. When compared with the state of the art algorithms, ROPE and STRAW are the only ones that can effectively satisfy all of the following quality constraints: heterogeneity, smooth transitions, novelty, scalability and usability.	algorithm;display resolution;scalability;usability	Marcos A. de Almeida;Carolina C.

Not only has it democratized the funding of startups, it has also bridged the gap between the venture capitalists and the entrepreneurs by providing a plethora of opportunities for people seeking to invest in new business ventures. Nonetheless, despite the huge success of the crowdfunding platforms, not every project reaches its funding goal. One of the main reasons for a project's failure is the difficulty in establishing a linkage between it's founders and those investors who are interested in funding such projects. A potential solution to this problem is to develop recommendation systems that suggest suitable projects to crowdfunding investors by capturing their interests. In this paper, we explore Kickstarter, a popular reward-based crowdfunding platform. Being a highly heterogeneous platform, Kickstarter is fuelled by a dynamic community of people who constantly interact with each other before investing in projects. Therefore, the decision to invest in a project depends not only on the preference of individuals, but also on the influence of groups that a person belongs and the on-going status of the projects. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic recommendation model, called CrowdRec, that recommends Kickstarter projects to a group of investors by incorporating the on-going status of projects, the personal preference of individual members, and the collective preference of the group . Using a comprehensive dataset of over 40K crowdfunding groups and 5K projects, we show that our model is effective in recommending projects to groups of Kickstarter users.	5k resolution;crowdfunding;linkage (software);recommender system	Vineeth Rakesh;Wang-Chien Lee;Chandan K.

Our attacks leverage seemingly innocent user information that is publicly available in online social networks to infer missing attributes of targeted users. Given the increasing availability of (seemingly innocent) user information online, our results have serious implications for Internet privacy – private attributes can be inferred from users’ publicly available data unless we take steps to protect users from such inference attacks. To infer attributes of a targeted user, existing inference attacks leverage either the user’s publicly available social friends or the user’s behavioral records (e.g., the webpages that the user has liked on Facebook, the apps that the user has reviewed on Google Play), but not both. As we will show, such inference attacks achieve limited success rates. However, the problem becomes qualitatively different if we consider both social friends and behavioral records. To address this challenge, we develop a novel model to integrate social friends and behavioral records and design new attacks based on our model. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks. For instance, we observe that, in a real-world large-scale dataset with 1.1 million users, our attack can correctly infer the cities a user lived in for 57% of the users; via confidence estimation, we are able to increase the attack success rate to over 90% if the attacker selectively attacks a half of the users. Moreover, we show that our attack can correctly infer attributes for significantly more users than previous attacks.	experiment;inference attack;interaction;internet privacy;network model;play store;social network;social structure	Neil Zhenqiang Gong;Bin Liu	2016			internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-22.648654297019927	-44.39439824613743	149526

To this end, we introduce a novel function to measure the likelihood of a topic hierarchy, by which the users' information need can be incorporated into the process of topic hierarchy construction. Using the structure information within the generated topic hierarchy, we then develop a probability based model to identify the representative contents for topics to assist users in document retrieval on the hierarchy.

With the rapid growth of the WWW and the intensified competition among the businesses, effective web presence is critical to attract potential customers and retain current customer thus the success of the business. This poses a significant challenge because the web is inherently dynamic and web data is more sophisticated, diverse, and dynamic than traditional well-structured data. Web mining is one method to gain insights into how to evolve the web presence and to ultimately produce a pre-dictive model such that the evolution of a given web site can be categorized under its particular context for strategic planning. In particular, web logs contain potentially useful information and the analysis of web log data have opened new avenues to assist the web administrators and designers to establish adaptive web presence and evolution to fit user requirements.	blog;categorization;e-commerce;electronic business;evolution;internet;requirement;user requirements document;www;web log analysis software;web mining;web presence;world wide web	Xueping Li	2009			e-commerce;web service;web application security;web mining;web development;web modeling;the internet;data web;web analytics;web mapping;web design;web accessibility initiative;web standards;computer science;web navigation;social semantic web;web page;multimedia;internet privacy;web intelligence;correspondence analysis;web 2.0;world wide web	Web+IR	-30.878892187911305	-48.913049664294775	149915
0fbe2328cb1d2242cfea18b802e705e1743788b7	a novel confidence estimation method for heterogeneous implicit feedback		Implicit feedback, which indirectly reflects opinion through user behaviors, has gained increasing attention in recommender system communities due to its accessibility and richness in real-world applications. A major way of exploiting implicit feedback is to treat the data as an indication of positive and negative preferences associated with vastly varying confidence levels. Such algorithms assume that the numerical value of implicit feedback, such as time of watching, indicates confidence, rather than degree of preference, and a larger value indicates a higher confidence, although this works only when just one type of implicit feedback is available. However, in real-world applications, there are usually various types of implicit feedback, which can be referred to as heterogeneous implicit feedback. Existing methods cannot efficiently infer confidence levels from heterogeneous implicit feedback. In this paper, we propose a novel confidence estimation approach to infer the confidence level of user preference based on heterogeneous implicit feedback. Then we apply the inferred confidence to both point-wise and pair-wise matrix factorization models, and propose a more generic strategy to select effective training samples for pair-wise methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets from Tmall.com show that our methods outperform the state-of-the-art approaches, considering several commonly used ranking-oriented evaluation criteria.	accessibility;algorithm;baseline (configuration management);collaborative filtering;e-commerce;feedback;numerical analysis;recommender system;tmall	Jing Wang;Lanfen Lin;Heng Zhang;Jiaqi Tu;Penghua Yu	2017	Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering	10.1631/FITEE.1601468	mathematical optimization;recommender system;collaborative filtering;computer science;machine learning;confidence interval;matrix decomposition;artificial intelligence	AI	-19.66257772526783	-47.696559475933284	150098

The conventional calculations of similarities are inefficient, which suffers from data sparsity and poor prediction quality problems. In order to overcome the limitations, a new collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on item clustering and global similarity is proposed. Firstly, K-MEANS clustering algorithm is applied to cluster items into several classes based on users' ratings on items, and the local user similarity is calculated in each cluster. In addition, the factor of overlap is introduced to optimize the accuracy of the local similarity between users. Finally, a newly global similarity between users is presented to optimize the selection of target user's neighbors and achieve better prediction accuracy. The experimental results show that this method can improve the accuracy of the prediction and enhance the recommendation quality.	algorithm;cluster analysis;collaborative filtering;e-commerce;k-means clustering;recommender system;sparse matrix	Suyun Wei;Ning Ye;Shuo Zhang;Xia Huang;Jian Zhu	2012	2012 Fifth International Conference on Business Intelligence and Financial Engineering	10.1109/BIFE.2012.23	fuzzy clustering;computer science;collaborative filtering;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	DB	-21.249850822726977	-48.634495912019794	150402

One way to build a Recommendation System is content-based filtering, which recommends items to the user based on a profile that contains information about the content, such as genre, keywords, etc. For this to happen effectively, the system must take into account the preferences and needs of users in order to generate useful recommendations. This work proposes the modeling of user profiles with integration of multiple domains and automatically. Then, through a transfer of knowledge of a domain to another, increase the performance of the recomendation. The results of the evaluation showed that information sharing between the domains increased the performance of the recommendation, as in the test with the metric prec@5, where obtained an improvement of more than 90\%.	recommender system;user profile	Marivaldo Bispo Rodrigues;Gabriela O.

Besides its low cost of computational time, the experimental results on two real-world data sets, Del.icio.us and MovieLens, show that it can enhance the algorithmic accuracy and diversity. Especially, it provides more personalized recommendation when the assigned tags belong to diverse topics. The proposed algorithm is particularly effective for small-degree objects, which reminds us of the well-known cold-start problem in recommender systems. Further empirical study shows that the proposed algorithm can significantly solve this problem in social tagging systems with heterogeneous object degree distributions. Introduction. – Many complex systems can be well described by networks where nodes represent individuals, and edges denote the relations among them [1–5]. Recently, the personalized recommendation in complex networks has attracted increasing attention from physicists [6–10]. Personalized recommendation aims at finding objects (e.g. books, webpages, music, etc.) that are most likely to be collected by users. For example, classical information retrieval can be viewed as recommending documents with given words [11], and the process of link prediction can be considered as a recommendation problem in unipartite networks [12–14]. The central problem of personalized recommendation can be divided into two parts: one is the estimation of similarity based on the historical records of user activities [15, 16]; the other is the usage of accessorial information (e.g., object attributes) to efficiently filter out irrelevant objects. For the formal task, since computing and storing the similarities of all user pairs is costly, we usually consider only the top-k most similar users [17]. For the latter task, very accurate descriptions of objects may be helpful in filtering irrelevant (a)E-mail:yi-cheng.zhang@unifr.ch objects, however, it is limited to the attribute vocabulary, and, on the other hand, attributes describe global properties of objects which are less helpful to generate personalized recommendations. Recently, the advent of Web2.0 and its affiliated applications bring a new form of paradigm, social tagging systems (or called collaborative tagging systems), which introduces a novel platform for users’ participation. A social tagging system allows users to freely assign tags to annotate their collections, requires no specific skills for users to participate in, broadens the semantic relations among users and objects, and thus has attracted much attention from the scientific community. Golder et al. studied its usage patterns and classified seven kinds of tag functions [18]. Similar to the tagging functions, the keywords and PACS numbers are analyzed to better characterize the structure of co-authorship and citation networks [19, 20]. Furthermore, many efforts have been done to explain the emergent properties of social tagging systems. Cattuto et al. [21] proposed a memory-based Yule-Simon model to describe the aging effects and occurrence frequencies of tags. Zhang and Liu [22] proposed an evolutionary hypergraph model, where users not only assign tags to objects but also	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);book;cluster analysis;cold start;complex network;complex systems;document;emergence;folksonomy;information filtering system;information retrieval;knowledge-based recommender system;movielens;personalization;physical information;physics and astronomy classification scheme;programming paradigm;relevance;tag (metadata);tag cloud;time complexity;user (computing);vocabulary;web 2.0;whole earth 'lectronic link	Walter Carrer-Neto;Maria Luisa Hernández-Alcaraz;Rafael Valencia-García;Francisco García-Sánchez	2012	Expert Syst.

They hope the system designers can help them exploring new friends with common interest. However, the large amount of online users and their diverse and dynamic interests possess great challenges to support such a novel feature in online social networks. In this paper, by leveraging interest-based features, we design a general friend recommendation framework, which can characterize user interest in two dimensions: context (location, time) and content, as well as combining domain knowledge to improve recommending quality. We also design a potential friend recommender system in a real online social network of biology field to show the effectiveness of our proposed framework.	internet relationship;list of code lyoko episodes;real life;recommender system;social network	Xing Xie	2010	2010 IEEE/ACM Int'l Conference on Green Computing and Communications & Int'l Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing	10.1109/GreenCom-CPSCom.2010.28	computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web;online participation	Metrics	-23.057446453192316	-47.879092745370436	151003
0e7fe818127d8dff02c7e25305ce1162573acd69	a hybrid recommendation algorithm based on social networks		In the light of the problem of collaborative recommendation and content-based cold start, this paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system based on social network. The method is based on the user social relations network. According to the social behavior of user, by establishing the model of social network users, it puts forward the user similarity measure. Then it takes random walk algorithm as a basis and selects out N users who have the highest similarity with the users' interest. The test results show that this method can obtain better recommendation effect and customer satisfaction.	algorithm;cold start;recommender system;similarity measure;social network	Jing Gong;MeiLing Gao;Bixiao Xu;Wenjun Wang;Zhixin Sun	2015	2015 11th International Conference on Heterogeneous Networking for Quality, Reliability, Security and Robustness (QSHINE)		computer science;collaborative filtering;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval;recommender system	DB	-21.68952033490299	-48.08890463349731	151223

These are all components of emotion. In the past, they have been measured through selfreport or panel discussions. While informative, these approaches are difficult to scale to large numbers of consumers, fail to capture moment-to-moment changes in appraisals that may be predictive of sales, and depend on verbal mediation. We used web-cam technology to sample non-verbal responses to television commercials from four product categories in six different countries. For each participant, head pose, head motion, and more frequent facial expressions like smiling, surprise and disgust were automatically measured at each video frame and aggregated across subjects. Dynamic features from the aggregated series were input to simple linear ensemble classifier with 10-fold cross-validation to predict product sales. Sales were predicted with ROC AUC = 0.75, 95% CI [0.727,0.773] and predictions for unseen categories were consistent for all, but one product groups (ROC AUC varies between 0.74 and 0.83, except for Confections with 0.61). Predictions for unseen countries showed similar pattern: ROC AUC varied between 0.71 and 0.89, with the exception of Russia with ROC AUC 0.53. In comparison with previous attempts, our approach yielded higher overall performance and greater generalization over not modeled factors like country or category. These findings support the feasibility, efficiency, and predictive validity of sales predictions from large-scale sampling of viewers’ moment-to-moment responses to commercial media. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Web recommender systems help users make decisions in this complex information space where the volume of information available to them is huge. Recently, a number of web page recommender systems have been developed to anticipate the information needs of on-line users and provide them with recommendations to facilitate and personalize their navigation. Recent studies show that a web usage recommender system which focuses solely on access history has some problems because sometimes this information is incomplete or incorrect. One common solution to this problem is to incorporate some semantic knowledge about pages being recommended into system. In this paper we exploit this idea to improve the dynamic web recommender system which primarily devised for web recommendation based on web usage and structure data. We propose a hybrid web page recommender system based on asynchronous cellular learning automata with multiple learning automata in each cell which try to identify user's multiple information needs and then assist them to recommend pages to users. The proposed system use web usage data, content and structure of the web site to learn user information needs and predicting user's future requests. Our experiments show that incorporating conceptual relationship of pages with usage data can significantly enhance the quality of recommendations.	automata theory;automaton;experiment;information needs;internet;learning automata;online and offline;personalization;recommender system;usage data;www;web page;world wide web	Mojdeh Talabeigi;Rana Forsati;Mohammad Reza Meybodi	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing	10.1109/GrC.2010.153	web service;web application security;information needs;web development;web modeling;data web;web analytics;web mapping;web design;web accessibility initiative;web standards;computer science;web navigation;social semantic web;multimedia;web intelligence;web 2.0;world wide web;information retrieval;web server;mashup;recommender system	Web+IR	-30.773267566364044	-51.56004551157685	151962
47d5e1e60a5b8df9c08e4c06dd3840f77b5ea95f	definition of gazing point for picture analysis and its applications		Abstract#R##N##R##N#The authors have been analyzing images by eye movement. For this purpose, it is necessary to decompose the eye movement into a component to accept information from a gazed object and a component to shift the gazing point. The point considered in the foregoing is called the gazing point, which is defined in this paper based on the property of the pursuit eye movement. Eye movement velocity of 5 deg/s is used as the threshold to separate the two components. As a result, it is made possible to separate clearly the eye movement into the gazing point component and the shift between the gazing point. A vision analyzer based on this definition of the gazing point was developed, which can analyze comprehensively the eye movement in real-time. As an example of the application of the vision analyzer, the difference of the eye movement in watching the VDT image and the usual dynamic picture is analyzed. Furthermore, as an application to the analysis of art, an experiment was made as a reference material for the analysis of Sharaku's ukiyo-e painting. The results of experiments are described, indicating that the definition of the gazing point is adequate.

The proposed method is based on a combination of link prediction and machine learning techniques. First, a weighted co-authorship network is constructed. We calculate scores for each node pair according to different measures called predictors. The resulting scores can be interpreted as indicative of the likelihood of future linkage for the given node pair. To determine the relative merit of each predictor, we train a random forest classifier on older data. The same classifier can then generate predictions for newer data. The top predictions are treated as recommendations for future collaboration. We apply the technique to research collaborations between cities in Africa, the Middle East and South-Asia, focusing on the topics of malaria and tuberculosis. Results show that the method yields accurate recommendations. Moreover, the method can be used to determine the relative strengths of each predictor.	citation graph;kerrison predictor;linkage (software);location-based service;machine learning;random forest;scientometrics	Raf Guns;Ronald Rousseau	2013	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-013-1228-9	computer science;data science;machine learning;data mining;management;world wide web;statistics;collaboration	ML	-20.2500922343635	-38.53244428081828	152150

There are two major types of recommendation techniques—collaborative filtering and content-based. Although the content-based approach alleviates the “cold-start” problem faced by collaborative filtering, this approach generally produces lower accuracy. Thus, a hybrid strategy is often adopted. However, we identified that existing approaches are hampered by insufficient analysis of the unstructured content features of recommended products and a problematic assumption that ignores individual differences in the perception of similarity. Therefore, we propose a new recommendation framework that applies Latent Semantic Analysis to extract semantic features from unstructured text and uses Multiple Regression to identify a unique similarity weighting strategy for each user. By using a combined dataset from MovieLens and Microsoft Xbox, we developed a movie recommender as a proof-of-concept. The initial results represented a promising opportunity to combine behavioral studies and computer algorithms.	algorithm;americas conference on information systems;cold start;collaborative filtering;information overload;latent semantic analysis;movielens;recommender system;regular expression;text mining;usability testing;user experience	Jingjing Li	2013			computer science;collaborative filtering;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval;recommender system	Web+IR	-21.847611810791435	-48.733405350793575	152236

Classification of the places based on data collected by laser range finder (LRF) is achieved through a machine learning approach, which implements logistic regression as a multi-class classifier. The classifier output is probabilistically fused using independent opinion pool strategy.

But, eCommerce has the advantage that the sellers can see the customers' feedback easily because many of them post reviews on most of the products' website like amazon.com or ebay.com making the whole process faster. The purpose of the article is to analyze several technologies which can be implemented for indoor shopping and for improving customers' experience. Therefore, we aim to explore several methods which can help reduce the time that customers spend to pay for the products and to customize their shopping experience by analyzing their feelings towards shops and products. We propose an online platform which identifies the customer's opinion. The retail organizations must correctly understand their customers' wishes and expectations through NLP (Natural Language Processing), a form of Artificial Intelligence (AI), namely analyzing an encoded sentiment data based on feedbacks considering the context and the environment. One of the methods approached to obtain the customer's related to the Speech-to-Text technologies so that the client will not spend so much time writing full sentences, products reviews, etc. This Speech-to-Text application is developed based on a vocabulary composed of words which express and highlight strong emotions such as """"good"""", """"bad"""", """"horrible"""" but also analyze if the sentence is affirmative or negative, and if the sentence is negative to notice if the customer said """"not good"""", """"not bad"""" and so on.

The large collection of tags and their relationships form a tag space. In this kind of tag space, the popularity and correlation amongst tags capture the current social interests. Tags are freely chosen keywords and difficult to organize. As a hierarchical concept structure to represent the subsumption relationships, automatically extracted taxonomies become a viable method to manage collaborative tags. However, tags change over time, and it is also imperative to incorporate the temporal tag evolution into the extracted taxonomies. In this paper, we formalize the problem of evolutionary taxonomy generation over a large collection of tags. A line of taxonomies are generated to reflect the temporal changes of underlying tag space. The proposed evolutionary taxonomy framework consists of two novel contributions. First, we develop a context-aware edge selection algorithm for taxonomy extraction. This method is built on seminal association-rule mining algorithm. Second, we propose several strategies for evolutionary taxonomy fusion, which smooths the newly generated taxonomy with prior ones. We conduct an extensive performance study using a large real-life web page tagging dataset (i.e., Del.ici.ous). The empirical results clearly verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.	association rule learning;automatic summarization;automatic taxonomy construction;evolutionary taxonomy;folksonomy;imperative programming;real life;selection algorithm;subsumption architecture;tag cloud;taxonomy (general);web analytics;web page	Junjie Yao;Bin Cui;Gao Cong;Yuxin Huang	2011	World Wide Web	10.1007/s11280-011-0150-4	social media;computer science;bioinformatics;data mining;world wide web	ML	-25.348099635129767	-51.45453404195392	152565

As a professional community, Quora is quite different from other traditional CQA websites, such as Baidu Zhidao and Yahoo! Answers. As users' social statuses play a more important role, besides just raising questions and finding a proper answer which the asker is satisfied with, people are inclined to have more discussions about the question, corresponding answers and related topics. Due to the spirit of wiki, people, especially some leading users work hard together to make the community a knowledge base of high quality, which in turn attracts more people to take part in this job. Thus, in this study, we focus on detecting leading users within a specific topic area of professional CQA services. A leading capacity model is utilized and three major criteria, which are authority, activity and influence, are taken into consideration. Then, an improved Borda count model is proposed to make a collective decision. Experimental results show effectiveness of the proposed method for finding leading users.	display resolution;interaction;knowledge base;mathematical optimization;question answering;sensor;wiki	Siqi Song;Ye Tian;Wenwen Han;Xirong Que;Wendong Wang	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications and IEEE Internet of Things and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing	10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.226	knowledge management;data mining;world wide web	DB	-23.29320332522162	-50.548347715888056	152737
66faa06509956416539dfb71f16651b10631c035	topic diffusion and emergence of virality in social networks		We propose a stochastic model for the diffusion of topics entering a social network modeled by a Watts-Strogatz graph. Our model sets into play an implicit competition between these topics as they vie for the attention of users in the network. The dynamics of our model are based on notions taken from real-world OSNs like Twitter where users either adopt an exogenous topic or copy topics from their neighbors leading to endogenous propagation. When instantiated correctly, the model achieves a viral regime where a few topics garner unusually good response from the network, closely mimicking the behavior of real-world OSNs. Our main contribution is our description of how clusters of proximate users that have spoken on the topic merge to form a large giant component making a topic go viral. This demonstrates that it is not weak ties but actually strong ties that play a major part in virality. We further validate our model and our hypotheses about its behavior by comparing our simulation results with the results of a measurement study conducted on real data taken from Twitter.	emergence;giant component;simulation;social network;software propagation;watts humphrey	S.

9c5e2ff29ac5683fe51eb5be84b939b02eb25265	mining customer preference in physical stores from interaction behavior		An improved understanding of customer preference is crucial for successful business in physical stores. Online stores are capable learning customer preference from the click logs and transaction records, while retailers with physical store still lack effective methods to in-depth understand customer preference. Fortunately, user-generated data from mobile devices and social media are providing rich information to uncover customer preference. In this paper, we present a novel approach to mine customer preference in physical stores from their interaction behaviors. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed model, we conduct a store-type recommendation model for physical stores by jointly considering the learned customer preference and temporal influence. We have performed a comprehensive experiment evaluation on two real-world data sets, which are collected by more than 120 000 customers during 12 months from two urban shopping malls. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed model not only in recommending interesting stores for customer, but also help retailers better understand customer preference.	customer relationship management;mobile device;social media;user-generated content	Yuanyi Chen;Zengwei Zheng;Sinong Chen;Lin Sun;Dan Chen	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2744263	computer network;marketing;customer intelligence;voice of the customer;mobile device;internet privacy;computer science;social media;context model;customer to customer;database transaction	AI	-24.073304312785123	-45.40304369316808	152895

Several environments, such as the Web, take advantage of personalization techniques because of the large amount of available information. For this reason, there is a growing interest in providing automated personalization processes during the human-computer interaction. In this paper we introduce a new approach for user modeling, which grounds in the Search of Associative Memory (SAM) theory. By means of implicit feedback techniques, the approach is able to unobtrusively recognize user needs and monitor the user working context in order to provide important information useful to personalize traditional search tools and implement recommender systems. Experimental results based on precision and recall measures indicate improvements in comparison with traditional user models.	alessandro vespignani;artificial intelligence;automation;categorization;computer science;fabio paternò;focused crawler;human–computer interaction;information needs;naive bayes classifier;natural language processing;personalization;personalized search;precision and recall;query expansion;recommender system;representation oligonucleotide microarray analysis;self-information;sketch;user modeling;viable system model;web search engine;world wide web	Fabio Gasparetti;Alessandro Micarelli	2007	IJPRAI	10.1142/S0218001407005429	user modeling;computer science;concept search;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	AI	-31.954112062187395	-51.64458251926462	153218

In this paper, we propose a novel, effective and efficient model, SoRank, by integrating social information among users into listwise ranking model to improve quality of ranked list of items. In addition, with linear complexity to the number of observed ratings, SoRank is able to scale to very large dataset. Experimental results on publicly available dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SoRank.	learning to rank	Weilong Yao;Jing He;Guangyan Huang;Yanchun Zhang	2014		10.1145/2567948.2577333	social relation;computer science;data science;machine learning;data mining;matrix decomposition;learning to rank	AI	-19.686679100580157	-47.44573054516225	153231

This effect is reached by providing an opportunity to search information on the basis of generalized concepts, or in other words, linguistic descriptions. These concepts are formulated by the user in natural language, and modelled by fuzzy sets, defined on the universe of the significances of the characteristics of the data base objects. After adjustment of user’s concepts based on search results, we have “personalized semantics” for all terms which particular person uses for communications with data base or social networks (for example, “young person” will be different for teenager and for old person; “good restaurant” will be different for people with different income, age, etc.).	personalization;social network	Alexander Ryjov	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-02993-1_2	semantic computing;knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web	AI	-22.37714350556947	-47.17116427431194	153244
eccea26d9183fac3ce184a92ef1be96755f385c5	tender-sims - similarity retrieval system for public tenders		TendeR-Sims (Tender Retrieval by Similarity) is a system that helps to search for satisfiable request for tender’s lots in a database by filtering irrelevant lots, so companies can easily discover the contracts they can win. The system implements the Similarity-aware Relational Division Operator in a commercial Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), and compares products by combining a path distance in a preprocessed ontology with a textual distance. Tender-Sims focuses on answering the following query: select the lots where a company has a similar enough item for each of all required items. We evaluated our proposed system employing a dataset composed of product catologs of Brazilian companies in the food market and real requests for tenders with known results. In the presented experiments, TendeR Sims achieved up to 66% cost reduction at 90% recall when compared to the ground truth.	experiment;ground truth;information retrieval;international computer music conference;relational algebra;relational database management system;relevance;request for tender;similarity measure;universal storage platform	Guilherme Q.

It abstracts multi-modal sensory information and integrates it with conceptual common-sense knowledge in a fully probabilistic fashion. It relies on the concept of spatial properties which make the semantic map more descriptive, and the system more scalable and better adapted for human interaction. A probabilistic graphical model, a chaingraph, is used to represent the conceptual information and perform spatial reasoning. Experimental results from online system tests in a large unstructured office environment highlight the system's ability to infer semantic room categories, predict existence of objects and values of other spatial properties as well as reason about unexplored space.	cluster analysis;discretization;graphical model;knowledge representation and reasoning;modal logic;scalability;semantic mapper;spatial–temporal reasoning;on-line system	Andrzej Pronobis;Patric Jensfelt	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2012.6224637	natural language processing;mobile robot;computer vision;interpersonal relationship;semantic computing;shape;computer science;artificial intelligence;graph theory;machine learning;semantics;spatial intelligence;probabilistic logic;probabilistic latent semantic analysis;computational model	Robotics	-29.802780811563288	-41.09334521002365	153330

Throughout his or her career, any researcher will build up a social academic network consisting of people with similar scientific interests. A recommendation system could facilitate the process of identifying and finding the right colleagues, as well as pointing out possible new collaborators. As a researcher's reputation is of great importance, the social information gleaned from citations and reference data can be used to cluster similar researchers. Web services, such as social bookmarking systems, provide new functionalities and a greater variety of social information - if exploited correctly, these could lead to better recommendations. The following chapter describes, by way of example, one approach to recommendation for social networking in academia.	recommender system;web service	Tamara Heck	2013		10.1145/2441776.2441932	computer science;knowledge management;collaborative filtering;world wide web	ML	-24.84680253542808	-49.64746261815572	153404
24cc2c1029e9ef2a3e8e015ba1abb3d2cc990748	a joint web resource recommendation method based on category tree and associate graph	e commerce;collaborative filtering;private information	Personalized recommendation is valuable in various web applications, such as ecommerce, music sharing, and news releasing, etc. Most existing recommendation methods require users to register and provide their private information before gaining access to any services, whereas a majority of users are reluctant to do so, which greatly limits the range of application of such recommendation methods. In the non-register environments, the only available information is the content or attributes of resources and the click-through chains of user sessions, so that many recommendation methods fail to work effectively due to the rating sparsity [Adomavicius and Tuzhilin, 2005] and illegibility of user identity, collaborative filtering [Goldberg et al. 1992] is an example of this case. In this paper we propose a joint recommendation method combining together two approaches, namely the domain category tree and the associate graph, to make full use of all available information. Further, an associate graph propagation method is designed to improve the traditional associate filtering method by integrating additional graphical considerations into them. Experiment results show that our method outperforms either the single category tree approach or the single associate graph approach, and it can provide acceptable recommendation services even in the non-register environment.	book;collaborative filtering;e-commerce;file sharing;human body weight;matching (graph theory);personalization;personally identifiable information;processor register;software propagation;sparse matrix;web application;web resource	Linkai Weng;Yaoxue Zhang;Yue-Zhi Zhou;Laurence Tianruo Yang;Pengwei Tian;Ming Zhong	2009	J.

Non-invasive profiling methods monitor users’ behavior and infer interest profiles from their past actions. Most existing profiling methods, which relate the users’ interests to a given ontology, consider only the user’s past actions when calculating his/her profile. The profiling algorithms use a time-decay function for users’ past actions to adapt the profile to shifts in the user’s interests over time. In our work, we propose a hybrid method that combines time-decay and profile correction using prototype profiles. The additional profile correction step considers the interests of similar users and expands the interest scores beyond the concepts detected in the user’s past actions, which facilitates faster profile adaptation to the user’s new interests. In our experimental work, we experimented extensively with two real data sets: data of an online advertising network and student data in an online e-learning environment. We measured the quality of the computed user profiles by correlating them to users’ future actions. Experiments revealed that it is crucial to build the user’s profile using a large number of events from his/her past and to update the profile regularly. When we are unable to do so, the profile correction can be used to keep the quality of the profile from dropping too low. The results show that our method significantly outperforms existing ontological profiling methods.	algorithm;gene expression profiling;online advertising;profiling (computer programming);prototype;recommender system;user profile;web service	Domen Kosir;Igor Kononenko;Zoran Bosnic	2014	Applied Intelligence	10.1007/s10489-014-0570-9	data mining;database;world wide web	Web+IR	-24.566543694100304	-48.11288955096484	153748

Indeed, RSS feeds are considered as a powerful realtime means for real-world events sharing within the social Web. By identifying these events and their associated social media resources, we can greatly improve event browsing and searching. However, a thriving challenge of events identification from such releases is owed to an efficient as well as a timely identification of events. In this paper, we are mainly dealing with event identification from heterogenous social media RSS feeds. In this respect, we introduce a new approach in order to get out these events. The main thrust of the introduced approach stands in achieving a better tradeoff between event identification accuracy and swiftness. Specifically, we adopted the probabilistic Naive Bayes model within the exploitation of stemming and feature selection techniques. Carried out experiments over two real-world datasets emphasize the relevance of our proposal and open many issues.	rss;social media	Chiraz Trabelsi;Sadok Ben Yahia	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40270-8_12	social media;computer science;data mining;rss;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-23.56959898776045	-49.84027080274822	153924

It is also observed that users have distinct behaviors, i.e., the topics of conversations shared among users, based on which social media platforms they use. However, many previous approaches for predicting information spreading in social networks do not consider this versatility. In this paper, we examine Independent Cascade (IC) information diffusion model which assumes that each node independently influences its neighboring nodes. We show the results of applying IC model to the biggest Russian social network Vkontakte (VK). We first apply the model to synthetic networks and compare the results with the real networks extracted for different topics. The results supports our hypothesis that the behavior of information diffusion in social media is different based on the topics shared. Our results also show that IC model does not properly describe the diffusion processes in VK.	logical volume management;post's theorem;social media;social network;software propagation;synthetic intelligence;threshold model	Aisylu Khairullina;Joo-Young Lee;Gwan Jang;Sung-Hyon Myaeng	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshop (ICDMW)	10.1109/ICDMW.2015.25	simulation;media;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;information cascade;social network	DB	-19.23047602432357	-42.767472571861106	154024

Social behaviors such as tags, comments and likes are becoming more and more popular among the recommender system users, and are attracting the attentions of the researchers in this domain. The behavior characteristics can be integrated with traditional interest community and some content features. In this paper, we put forward a hybrid recommendation approach that combines social behaviors, the genres of movies and existing collaborative filtering algorithms to perform movie recommendation. The experiments with MovieLens dataset show the advantage of our proposed method comparing to the benchmark method in terms of recommendation accuracy.

The information on each site is often partial. When sources of complementary information are integrated, a better profile of a user can be built. This profile can help improve online services such as advertising across sites. To integrate these sources of information, it is necessary to identify individuals across social media sites. This paper aims to address the cross-media user identification problem. We provide evidence on the existence of a mapping among identities of individuals across social media sites, study the feasibility of finding this mapping, and illustrate and develop means for finding this mapping. Our studies show that effective approaches that exploit information redundancies due to users’ unique behavioral patterns can be utilized to find such a mapping. This study paves the way for analysis and mining across social networking sites, and facilitates the creation of novel online services across sites. In particular, recommending friends and advertising across networks, analyzing information diffusion across sites, and studying specific user behavior such as user migration across sites in social media are one of the many areas that can benefit from the results of this study.	behavioral pattern;e-services;social media	Reza Zafarani;Lei Tang;Huan Liu	2015	TKDD	10.1145/2747880	behavioral modeling;social network analysis;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	ML	-26.27606079921501	-48.584597712773615	154255

In this paper, we provide an allaround evaluation of 12 state-of-the-art POI recommendation models. From the evaluation, we obtain several important findings, based on which we can better understand and utilize POI recommendation models in various scenarios.

Most of traditional methods only make use of partial information for either supervised or unsupervised modeling, which cannot well integrate overall available knowledge. In this paper, we propose a method titled GRNMF for jointly modeling both implicit correlations hidden inside customer volumes and explicit geographical knowledge via an integrated probabilistic framework. The effectiveness of GR-NMF in coupling all-round knowledge is verified over a real-life outpatient dataset under different scenarios. GR-NMF shows particularly evident advantages to all baselines in location selection with the cold-start challenge.	cold start;display resolution;non-negative matrix factorization;real life;supervised learning	Jingyuan Wang;Yating Lin;Junjie Wu;Zhong Wang;Zhang Xiong	2017			explicit knowledge;machine learning;artificial intelligence;computer science;coupling	AI	-19.321736211447128	-49.975650562871586	154481
d88e5f40ef2ba3b0034531e13272982875211672	morpheus: generating structured music with constrained patterns and tension		Automatic music generation systems have gained in popularity and sophistication as advances in cloud computing have enabled large-scale complex computations such as deep models and optimization algorithms on personal devices. Yet, they still face an important challenge, that of long-term structure, which is key to conveying a sense of musical coherence. We present the MorpheuS music generation system designed to tackle this problem. MorpheuS’ novel framework has the ability to generate polyphonic pieces with a given tension profile and longand short-term repeated pattern structures. A mathematical model for tonal tension quantifies the tension profile and state-of-the-art pattern detection algorithms extract repeated patterns in a template piece. An efficient optimization metaheuristic, variable neighborhood search, generates music by assigning pitches that best fit the prescribed tension profile to the template rhythm while hard constraining long-term structure through the detected patterns. This ability to generate affective music with specific tension profile and long-term structure is particularly useful in a game or film music context. Music generated by the MorpheuS system has been performed live in concerts.

90c3a783271e61adc2e140976d3a3e6a0f23f193	mapping moods: geo-mapped sentiment analysis during hurricane sandy		Sentiment analysis has been widely researched in the domain of online review sites with the aim of generating summarized opinions of product users about different aspects of the products. However, there has been little work focusing on identifying the polarity of sentiments expressed by users during disaster events. Identifying sentiments expressed by users in an online social networking site can help understand the dynamics of the network, e.g., the main users’ concerns, panics, and the emotional impacts of interactions among members. Data produced through social networking sites is seen as ubiquitous, rapid and accessible, and it is believed to empower average citizens to become more situationally aware during disasters and coordinate to help themselves. In this work, we perform sentiment classification of user posts in Twitter during the Hurricane Sandy and visualize these sentiments on a geographical map centered around the hurricane. We show how users' sentiments change according not only to users’ locations, but also based on the distance from the disaster.	cartography;interaction;sentiment analysis	Cornelia Caragea;Anna Cinzia Squicciarini;Sam Stehle;Kishore Neppalli;Andrea H.

9c73cd268e9d5f59ccdffa68305fcb992324cac7	using artificial intelligence techniques in collaborative filtering recommender systems: survey		The internet currently contains a huge data which is exponentially growing. This leads to the problem of information overload that makes the task of searching for information difficult and time consuming. Recommendation system is a filtering technique that recommends items to the users in order to reduce the list of choices and hence saves their times. The collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm is one of the most commonly used recommendation algorithms. There are many types of algorithm used to build the recommender systems, which include data mining techniques, information retrieval techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms. Although a number of studies have developed recommendation models using collaborative filtering, a few of them have tried to adopt both collaborative filtering and other artificial intelligence techniques, such as genetic algorithm, as a tool to improve recommendation results. This survey presents the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques used to build...	artificial intelligence;collaborative filtering;recommender system	Yousef Kilani;Bushra Alhijawi;Ayoub Alsarhan	2018	IJAIP	10.1504/IJAIP.2018.10010168	collaborative filtering;machine learning;the internet;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithm;recommender system;computer science;filter (signal processing);artificial neural network;information overload;artificial intelligence	AI	-21.73976756978385	-49.72502084855373	154979

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provided by OSN service providers for retrieving data impose several unavoidable restrictions which make it difficult to get a desirable dataset. In this paper, we present an iMacros technology-based data crawler called IMcrawler,capable of collecting every piece of information which is accessible through a browser from the Facebook website within the legal framework authorized by Facebook.The proposed crawler addresses most of the challenges allied with web data extraction approaches and most of the APIs provided by OSN service providers. Two broad sections have been extracted from Facebook user profiles, namely, 'Personal Information'and 'Wall Activities'. The collected data is preprocessed into two datasets and each data set is statistically analyzed to draw semantic knowledge and understand the several behavioral aspects of Facebook users such as kind of information mostly disclosed by users, gender differences in the pattern of revealed information, highly posted content on the network, highly performed activities on the network, the relationships among personal and post attributes, etc. To the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first attempt towards providing the detailed description of crawler design and gender-based information revealing behaviour of Facebook users.	angular defect;application programming interface;authorization;data pre-processing;email;ground truth;image scaling;information source;personally identifiable information;point of view (computer hardware company);requirement;social network;tag (metadata);timeline;upload;user profile;web crawler;imacros for firefox	Mudasir Ahmad Wani;Nancy Agarwal;Suraiya Jabin;Syed Zeeshan Hussain	2018	CoRR		computer science;data mining;application programming interface;service provider;semantic memory;web crawler;social network;personally identifiable information;data extraction	Web+IR	-24.891187486949867	-51.99295203698385	155267

These environments are the products of human preferences, activity and thought; they are imbued with semantic meaning. In this paper we investigate qualitative spatial relations with the aim of both perceiving those semantics, and of using semantics to perceive. More specifically, in this paper we introduce general perceptual measures for two common topological spatial relations, “on” and “in”, that allow a robot to analyze a scene in terms of these relations using real sensory data. We also show how these spatial relations can be used as a way of guiding visual object search. We do this by providing a principled approach for indirect search in which the robot can make use of known or assumed spatial relations between objects, significantly increasing the efficiency of search by first looking for an intermediate object that is easier to find. We explain our design, implementation and experimental setup and provide extensive experimental results to back up our thesis.	backup;robot	Kristoffer Sjöö;Alper Aydemir;Patric Jensfelt	2012	Robotics and Autonomous Systems	10.1016/j.robot.2012.06.001	spatial relation;computer vision;active vision;visual search;computer science;artificial intelligence;spatial intelligence	AI	-32.36386395171184	-41.4859163243906	155794

The Human/Robot Interface subsystem consists of tree modules: Natural Language Understanding, Speech Generation and Robot's Facial Expressions. To demonstrate the utility of this Human-Robot interaction subsystem it is presented a set of applications that allows a user to command a mobile robot through spoken commands. The mobile robot accomplish the required commands using an actions planner and reactive behaviors. In the ViRbot architecture the actions planner module uses Conceptual Dependency (CD) primitives as the base for representing the problem domain. After a command is spoken a CD representation of it is generated, a rule base system takes this CD representation, and using the state of the environment generates other subtasks represented by CDs to accomplish the command. In this paper is also presented how to represent context through scripts. Using scripts it is easy to make inferences about events for which there are incomplete information or are ambiguous. Scripts serve to encode common sense knowledge. Scripts are also used to fill the gaps between seemingly unrelated events.	mobile robot	Jesús Savage;Alfredo Weitzenfeld;Francisco Ayala;Sergio Cuellar	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-02921-9_25	human–robot interaction;mobile robot;computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;social robot;facial expression	Robotics	-33.497308465129	-40.88361448442447	156041

For media product, online collaborative movie recommendations make attempts to assist users to access their preferred movies by capturing precisely similar neighbors among users or movies from their historical common ratings. However, due to the data sparsely, neighbor selecting is getting more difficult with the fast increasing of movies and users. In this paper, a hybrid model-based movie recommendation system which utilizes the improved K-means clustering coupled with genetic algorithms (GA) to partition transformed user space is proposed. It employs principal component analysis (PCA) data reduction technique to dense the movie population space which could reduce the computation complexity in intelligent movie recommendation as well. The experiment results on Movielens dataset indicate that the proposed approach can provide high performance in terms of accuracy, and generate more reliable and personalized movie recommendations when compared with the existing methods.

This paper proposes a model for micro-managing the tracking activities by fine-tuning the mining from the page level to the segment level. The proposed model enables the web-master to identify the segments which receives more focus from users comparing with others. The segment level analytics of user actions provides an important metric to analyse the factors which facilitate the increase in traffic for the page. The empirical validation of the model is performed through prototype implementation.

It is constructed by mining socially enhanced online traces of the user and aggregating the partially obtained profiles. Those traces include actions performed and relationships established in the social web accounts in addition to the local machine traces such as bookmarks and web history. Moreover, we claim that mining the content in a context-aware approach and computing fuzziness values during the process results in a more reliable user profile.	digital footprint;history of the world wide web;interoperability;social media;tracing (software);user modeling;user profile	Hilal Tarakçi;Nihan Kesim Cicekli	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-31454-4_42	user modeling;computer user satisfaction;user journey;engineering;data mining;multimedia;user interface;world wide web	Web+IR	-26.79093324305509	-48.703081528715686	156156

09f6150ec2e794495512c2a0cd6b79ea9357168a	sharing online cultural experiences: an argument-based approach	conference proceeding	This paper proposes a system that allows a group of human users to share their cultural experiences online, like buying together a gift from a museum or browsing simultaneously the collection of this museum. We show that such application involves two multiple criteria decision problems for choosing between different alternatives (e.g. possible gifts): one at the level of each user, and one at the level of the group for making joint decisions. The former is made manually by the users via the WeShare interface. This interface displays an image with tags reflecting some features (criteria) of the image. Each user expresses then his opinion by rating the image and each tag. A user may change his choices in light of a report provided by his WeShare agent on the opinion of the group. Joint decisions are made in an automatic way. We provide a negotiation protocol which shows how they are reached. Both types of decisions are based on the notion of argument which has a particular form. Indeed, a tag which is liked by a user constitutes an argument pro the corresponding image whereas a tag which is disliked gives birth to a cons argument. These arguments may have different strengths since a user may express to what extent he likes/dislikes a given tag. Finally, the opinion analysis performed by a WeShare agent consists of aggregating the arguments of the users.	decision problem;experience	Leila Amgoud;Roberto Confalonieri;Dave De Jonge;Mark d'Inverno;Katina Hazelden;Nardine Osman;Henri Prade;Carles Sierra;Matthew Yee-King	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-34620-0_26	computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-28.81207978228587	-47.9438090042001	156200
4ded199ee01910afb613dabbfd87791c8e04f491	live-marker: a personalized web page content marking tool		The tremendous amount of increase in the quantity of information resources available on the web has made the total time that the user spends on a single page very minimal. Users revisiting the same page would be able to fetch the required information much faster if the information that they consumed during the previous visit(s) gets presented to them with a special style. This paper proposes a model which empowers the users to mark the content interesting to them, so that it can be identified easily during successive visits. In addition to the explicit marking by the users, the model facilitates implicit marking based on the user preferences. The prototype implementation based on proposed model validates the model’s efficiency.	item unique identification;personalization;prototype;user (computing);web page	K. S. Kuppusamy;G.

These robots can operate either entirely on their own or under partial human control. They learn, plan their actions and co-exist with each other at different levels. The learning processes range from simple rote learning to associative and procedural learning. The cognitive structure proposed for the robots seems sufficient for a self-dependent device to be sent to a potentially hostile environment in which it has to survive and accomplish various tasks.  The system consists of two programs running simultaneously, one on a graphics computer, the other on a large-scale central machine connected to the former via a voice-grade telephone line.	robot	Nicholas V.

918b1c9eabfdf290547530991832164ae3361261	minimizing required user effort for cold-start recommendation by identifying the most important latent factors		Recommender systems have the effect of guiding users to interesting objects in a large space of possible options based on their preferences. However, providing accurate recommendations for new users, who do not have any records, is one of the most challenging problems in recommender systems. To retrieve sufficient information of the new users, existing solutions often require significant user effort to answer numerous questions. In this paper, we aim to propose a novel method that can build initial user profiles by requiring minimum user effort. In particular, non-negative matrix factorization is first adopted to extract only a few representative latent factors of the available items, which effectively reduces the problem dimensionality. A hybrid of personalized and non-personalized approach has then been proposed to iteratively collect users’ feedback on the most important latent factors. In comparison with two state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method requires less user effort while significantly improving the accuracy of the initial user profile.

They provide both a context to the users, and facilitate the use of prediction algorithms for forecasting future prices. To produce a representative price history, one needs to consider all offers for the product. However, matching offers to a product is a challenging problem, and mismatches could lead to glaring errors in price history. We propose a principled approach to filter out erroneous matches based on a probabilistic model of prices. We give an efficient algorithm for performing inference that takes advantage of the structure of the problem. We evaluate our results empirically using merchant offers collected from a search engine, and measure the proximity of the price history generated by our approach to the true price history. Our method outperforms alternatives based on robust statistics both in tracking the true price levels and the true price trends.	algorithm;statistical model;web search engine	Rakesh Agrawal;Samuel Ieong	2012		10.1145/2339530.2339602	data aggregator;statistical model;robust statistics;time series;data mining;price level;search engine;statistics	Web+IR	-21.3399372379284	-50.62140023322808	158041

In this paper, we seek to understand YA's knowledge sharing and activity. We analyze the forum categories and cluster them according to content characteristics and patterns of interaction among the users. While interactions in some categories resemble expertise sharing forums, others incorporate discussion, everyday advice, and support. With such a diversity of categories in which one can participate, we find that some users focus narrowly on specific topics, while others participate across categories. This not only allows us to map related categories, but to characterize the entropy of the users' interests. We find that lower entropy correlates with receiving higher answer ratings, but only for categories where factual expertise is primarily sought after. We combine both user attributes and answer characteristics to predict, within a given category, whether a particular answer will be chosen as the best answer by the asker.	entropy (information theory);interaction;yahoo! answers;yet another	Lada A.

c9b61906f429d6c83a3fb3ec0dbccdc34dbd986a	a multilevel information mining approach for expert recommendation in online scientific communities		Expert recommendation plays a vital role in the expansion of researchers’ academic communities and in the creation of potential collaboration opportunities. Current approaches for academic expert recommendation are mainly based on keywords-based research relevance and social network proximity between researchers. However, most proximity measures only focus on the individual level in the network. Therefore, we develop a new measure for the proximity at the institutional level that measures the link strength between researchers’ affiliated institutions. Moreover, a multilevel profile-based approach is proposed to identify the most suitable expert for research collaboration by integrating research relevance information, individual social network information and institutional connectivity information. The proposed approach has been implemented in ScholarMate, which is a research 2.0 innovation, promoting knowledge-sharing activities in the virtual scientific community. According to the results of the experiments conducted on the real-world dataset, institutional connectivity is proved to be an important factor for expert recommendation and the proposed hybrid method outperforms all the other benchmark algorithms significantly.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);digital library;experiment;expert system;interaction;ontology (information science);personalization;recommender system;relevance;requirement;science 2.0;social network;topic model	Chen Yang;J.

However, in reality many tags are irrelevant to image content. To refine the tags, previous solutions usually mine tag relevance relying on the tag similarity estimated right from the corpus to be refined. The calculation of tag similarity is affected by the noisy tags in the corpus, which is not conducive to estimate accurate tag relevance. In this paper, we propose to do tag refinement from the angle of topic modeling. In the proposed scheme, tag similarity and tag relevance are jointly estimated in an iterative manner, so that they can benefit from each other. Specifically, a novel graphical model, regularized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (rLDA), is presented. It facilitates the topic modeling by exploiting both the statistics of tags and visual affinities of images in the corpus. The experiments on tag ranking and image retrieval demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.	experiment;graphical model;image retrieval;iterative method;latent dirichlet allocation;refinement (computing);relevance;tag cloud;topic model	Hao Xu;Jingdong Wang;Xian-Sheng Hua;Shipeng Li	2009		10.1145/1631272.1631359	latent dirichlet allocation;image retrieval;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining;graphical model;information retrieval	Web+IR	-19.24585045275905	-47.34789592565608	158809

Trust can be used effectively on the Semantic Web as annotations to social relationships. In this paper, we present a two level approach to integrating trust, provenance, and annotations in Semantic Web systems. We describe an algorithm for inferring trust relationships using provenance information and trust annotations in Semantic Web-based social networks. Then, we present two applications that combine the computed trust values with the provenance of other annotations to personalize websites. The FilmTrust system uses trust to compute personalized recommended movie ratings and to order reviews. An open source intelligence portal, Profiles In Terror, also has a beta system that integrates social networks with trust annotations. We believe that these two systems illustrate a unique way of using trust annotations and provenance to process information on the Semantic Web.	algorithm;content-control software;open-source intelligence;open-source software;personalization;semantic web;social network;ws-trust	Jennifer Golbeck;Aaron Mannes	2006			data web;computer science;social semantic web;semantic web stack;internet privacy;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-26.94597339625924	-49.45098419785986	158919
a9ced3faf8ed6857a54fc532476b9fa179e5f602	demo: detecting group formations using ibeacon technology		Researchers from different disciplines have examined crowd behavior in the past by employing a variety of methods including ethnographic studies, computer vision techniques and manual annotation based data analysis. However, because of the inherent difficulties in collecting, processing and analyzing the data, it is difficult to obtain large data sets for study. In this work we present a system for detecting stationary interactions inside crowds, depending entirely on the sensors available in a modern smartphone device such as Bluetooth Smart (BLE) and Accelerometer. By utilizing Apple's iBeaconTM implementation of Bluetooth Smart using SensingKit1, our open-source multi-platform mobile sensing framework [1], we are able to detect the proximity of users carrying a smartphone in their pocket. We then use an algorithm based on graph theory to predict group interactions inside the crowd. Previous work in this area has been limited to the detection of interactions between only two people and therefore our approach goes beyond current state of the art in its ability to detect group formations with more than two people involved. Our approach is particularly beneficial to the design and implementation of crowd behavior analytics, design of influence strategies, and algorithms for crowd reconfiguration.	algorithm;bluetooth;computer vision;graph theory;ibeacon;interaction;open-source software;sensor;smartphone;stationary process	Kleomenis Katevas;Laurissa N.

Moreover, this model is used as the basis for the conceptual tag refinement, which searches for terms which are conceptually related to the tags that are assigned to an information source. In that way the meaning of the tags can be disambiguated, which supports a better usage of tags for further management of tagged documents. We have developed a software tool, an annotation framework, which realizes this approach.

fc8ce4a1fec95bf9041b28682ba448f4586f173f	characterizing the feel of the piano action	piano action	The array of keys that the piano presents to a musician seems at first glance quite innocent: a oneto-one mapping from 88 neatly laid-out locations to 88 discretely pitched tones. While the pianist’s first challenge in playing a note is to navigate a finger into position within this field of black and white levers, the second challenge is to depress that key in a manner that produces the particular loudness and timing the pianist has in mind. Thus, in addition to the mapping from spatial location to pitch, the pianist must negotiate a second mapping: that from keypress (a trajectory over a brief time period) to hammer strike velocity and strike time (two scalars describing an event). Each key is not, after all, a trigger for the release of stored sound energy. Rather, each key is a means for converting mechanical work performed by a finger into acoustic energy radiating from the soundboard, as incited by a hammer strike on strings. The mapping from keypress to hammer strike event is realized by the piano action, the system of levers linking key to hammer. Three levers known as the whippen bottom, jack, and repetition lever intervene between the key and hammer (see Figure 1). Within this system, various contacts are made and broken in the course of a keypress, and the kinematic chain linking key to hammer undergoes significant changes in character. These changes support the various functions performed by the piano action, including escapement, check, and repetition. For example, escapement begins when a key is depressed and the jack tender contacts the let-off button. This causes the jack fly to pivot out from under the hammer shank knuckle, as the keypress continues	acoustic cryptanalysis;event (computing);kinematic chain;pitch (music);shutdown (computing);velocity (software development)	R.

The proposed model utilizes wearable sensors to digitize tacit activities such as location, motion, and social interaction of people. To derive practical knowledge, the obtained data is statistically analyzed and associated with performance outcome. An empirical test at a retail store demonstrated that the SDD-KC model was able to derive a rule that leads to customers’ behavioral change, which contributed to a sales increase. In contrast, the traditional knowledge-creation model, applied in the same setting, failed to identify effective ideas. The proposed SDD-KC model was thus shown to be effective for knowledge creation by overcoming cognitive limitations of people.

In this paper, we present a recommendation system with the goal of helping knowledge workers in discovering useful new content. In particular, our system builds personalized user models based on file activities on enterprise network file servers. Our models use novel features that are derived from file metadata and user collaboration. Through extensive evaluation on real-world enterprise data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system with high precision and recall values. Unfortunately, our experiments reveal that per-user models are unable to handle heavy workloads. To address this limitation, we propose a novel optimization technique, active feature-based model selection, that predicts the user models that should be applied on each test file. Such a technique can reduce the classification time per file by as much as 23 times without sacrificing accuracy. We also show how this technique can be extended to improve the scalability exponentially at marginal cost of prediction accuracy, e.g., we can gain 169 times faster performance on an average across all shares by sacrificing 4% of F-score.	enterprise modelling;enterprise resource planning;experiment;f1 score;marginal model;mathematical optimization;model selection;personalization;precision and recall;recommender system;scalability	Chetan Kumar Verma;Michael Hart;Sandeep Bhatkar;Aleatha Parker-Wood;Sujit Dey	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2513000	feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;data mining;database;predictive modelling;computational model;metadata;world wide web	Web+IR	-19.290163125795488	-48.95520794805665	159294

The lack of historical ratings results in the user and the item cold-start problems. The latter is the main focus of this work. Most of the current literature addresses this problem by integrating content-based recommendation techniques to model the new item. However, in many cases such content is not available, and the question arises is whether this problem can be mitigated using CF techniques only. We formalize this problem as an optimization problem: given a new item, a pool of available users, and a budget constraint, select which users to assign with the task of rating the new item in order to minimize the prediction error of our model. We show that the objective function is monotone-supermodular, and propose efficient optimal design based algorithms that attain an approximation to its optimum. Our findings are verified by an empirical study using the Netflix dataset, where the proposed algorithms outperform several baselines for the problem at hand.	algorithm;approximation;baseline (configuration management);cold start;collaborative filtering;mathematical optimization;optimal design;optimization problem;recommender system;supermodular function;monotone	Oren Anava;Shahar Golan;Nadav Golbandi;Zohar S.

Recent research has identified that communities in social networks may hinder cascades. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method for injecting social links in a social network, aiming at boosting the spread of information cascades. Unlike the proposed approach, existing link prediction methods do not consider the optimization of information cascades as an explicit objective. In our proposed method, the injected links are being predicted in a collaborative-filtering fashion, based on factorizing the adjacency matrix that represents the structure of the social network. Our method controls the number of injected links to avoid an “aggressive” injection scheme that may compromise the experience of users. We evaluate ocial networks atrix factorization the performance of the proposed method by examining real data sets from social networks and several additional factors. Our results indicate that the proposed scheme can boost information cascades in social networks and can operate as a “people recommendations” strategy complementary to currently applied methods that are based on the number of common neighbors (e.g., “friend of friend”) or on the similarity of user profiles. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

969e6f3cef77c7962f89aea25e4542929c24a3d1	@i to @me: an anatomy of username changing behavior on twitter		An identity of a user on an online social network (OSN) is defined by her profile, content and network attributes. OSNs allow users to change their online attributes with time, to reflect changes in their real-life. Temporal changes in users’ content and network attributes have been well studied in literature, however little research has explored temporal changes in profile attributes of online users. This work makes the first attempt to study changes to a unique profile attribute of a user – username and on a popular OSN which allows users to change usernames multiple times – Twitter. We collect, monitor and analyze 8.7 million Twitter users at macroscopic level and 10,000 users at microscopic level to understand username changing behavior. We find that around 10% of monitored Twitter users opt to change usernames for possible reasons such as space gain, followers gain, and username promotion. Few users switch back to any of their past usernames, however prefer recently dropped usernames to switch back to. Users who change usernames are more active and popular than users who don’t. In-degree, activity and account creation year of users are weakly correlated with their frequency of username change. We believe that past usernames of a user and their associated benefits inferred from the past, can help Twitter to suggest its users a set of suitable usernames to change to. Past usernames may also help in other applications such as searching and linking multiple OSN accounts of a user and correlating multiple Twitter profiles to a single user.	real life;social network;user (computing)	Paridhi Jain;Ponnurangam Kumaraguru	2014	CoRR		multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-21.202855577136653	-43.86272791999096	159957
81a2f32b853cc73af896a3e94c8d4a88a96438d7	beyond pixels: image provenance analysis leveraging metadata		Creative works, whether paintings or memes, follow unique journeys that result in their final form. Understanding these journeys, a process known as “provenance analysis,” provides rich insights into the use, motivation, and authenticity underlying any given work. The application of this type of study to the expanse of unregulated content on the Internet is what we consider in this paper. Provenance analysis provides a snapshot of the chronology and validity of content as it is uploaded, re-uploaded, and modified over time. Although still in its infancy, automated provenance analysis for online multimedia is already being applied to different types of content. Most current works seek to build provenance graphs based on the shared content between images or videos. This can be a computationally expensive task, especially when considering the vast influx of content that the Internet sees every day. Utilizing non-contentbased information, such as timestamps, geotags, and camera IDs can help provide important insights into the path a particular image or video has traveled during its time on the Internet without large computational overhead. This paper tests the scope and applicability of metadata-based inferences for provenance graph construction in two different scenarios: digital image forensics and cultural analytics.	analysis of algorithms;cultural analytics;digital image;geotagging;internet;meme;overhead (computing);pixel;snapshot (computer storage);trusted timestamping	Aparna Bharati;Daniel M Moreira;Joel Brogan;Patricia Hale;Kevin W.

Science fiction books, movies, and TV shows have long described humanoid robots interacting with—even passing for— real humans. But how close are we today to that sort of seamlessness between robots and humans? In exploring that question, we have developed a methodology to provide the basic mechanisms that support humanoid robot cognition. Involved are mechanisms for attention control and pattern categorization (see the """" Attention """" sidebar), and constructing attentional maps of the environmental context that underlies behavior. Our system architecture supports several types of sensors , and we have experimented with many facets of the eventual integrated platform for learning control, acquired representations, and visual behavior. 1–4 Our goal is to develop a robotic system capable of interacting with its environment and eventually with humans. We're also interested in the relationships between visual, haptic (touch-based), proprioceptive (simuli arising from within), and motor systems in humans. To this end, we constructed a robot, Magilla, consisting of a stereo head and two robotic arms (with attached graspers). To explore the potential for rich and varied interactions with the world, we connect our robot's cognitive organization and development to that of a human's—a methodology missing in the approaches the AI community usually employs. Moreover, by grounding our systems in the natural world (that humans share) and by providing flexible and redundant means of interacting within this domain, we postulate that our robot will develop cog-nitive structures more like those of humans and, as a consequence, will interact with humans more constructively. Again, one of our main objectives in constructing an anthropomorphic torso is to study the relationship between visual and haptic sensory systems and their development in humans. The development of robot programs is an incremental search for strategies that exploit the intrinsic dynamics of the robot–world interaction. We interpret intrinsic dynamics fairly broadly as any kinematic, dynamic, perceptual , or motor synergy that produces characteristic and invariant temporal sequences of observable state variables. Humanoid robots are simply too complex to use traditional approaches from robotics and computer vision. The range of interaction possible and the required kinds of perceptual distinction necessary challenge commonly used methodologies for control and programming. Consequently, we have adopted an incremen-tal and automatic approach to programming, modeled after the sensorimotor development of human children in the first two years of life.

Most of current spatial crowdsourcing frameworks assume independent and atomic tasks. However, there could be some cases that one needs to crowdsource a spatial complex task which consists of some spatial sub-tasks (i.e., tasks related to a specific location). The spatial complex task's assignment requires assignments of all of its sub-tasks. The currently available frameworks are inapplicable to such kind of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to crowdsource spatial complex tasks. We first formally define the Maximum Complex Task Assignment (MCTA) problem and propose alternative solutions. Subsequently, we perform various experiments using both real and synthetic datasets to investigate and verify the usability of our proposed approach.	crowdsourcing;experiment;synthetic intelligence;usability	Hung Dang;Tuan Anh Nguyen;Hien To	2013		10.1145/2539150.2539243	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining	DB	-22.305810340349083	-38.7079124135617	160670

Most existing CF methods rely on the overall ratings an item has received. However, these ratings alone sometimes cannot provide sufficient information to understand users' behaviors. For example, a user giving a high rating may indicate that he loves the item as a whole; however, it is still likely that he dislikes some particular aspects at the same time. In addition, users tend to place different emphases on different aspects when reaching an overall rating. This emphasis on aspects may even vary from users to items, and has a significant impact on a user's final decision. To make a better understanding of a user' behavior and generate a more accurate recommendation, we propose a framework that incorporates both user opinions and preferences on different aspects. This framework is composed of three components, namely, an opinion mining component, an aspect weighting computing component, and a rating inference component. The first component exploits opinion mining techniques to extract and summarize opinions on multiple aspects from reviews, and generates ratings on various aspects. The second component applies a tensor factorization strategy to automatically infer weights of different aspects in reaching an overall rating. The last one infers the overall rating of an item based on both aspect ratings and weights. Experiments on two real datasets prove that our model performs better compared with the baseline methods. & 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The vast majority of traditional recommender systems consider the recommendation procedure as a static process and make recommendations following a fixed strategy. In this paper, we propose a novel recommender system with the capability of continuously improving its strategies during the interactions with users. We model the sequential interactions between users and a recommender system as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to automatically learn the optimal strategies via recommending trial-and-error items and receiving reinforcements of these items from users’ feedbacks. In particular, we introduce an online user-agent interacting environment simulator, which can pre-train and evaluate model parameters offline before applying the model online. Moreover, we validate the importance of list-wise recommendations during the interactions between users and agent, and develop a novel approach to incorporate them into the proposed framework LIRD for list-wide recommendations. The experimental results based on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Using several important properties from the field of Formal Concept Analysis, we build user-specific biclusters that are “more personalized” to the users of interest. We create an innovative rank scoring of candidate items that combines local similarity of biclusters with global similarity. Our method is parameter-free, thus removing the need for tuning parameters. It is easily scalable and can efficiently make recommendations. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm using several standard benchmark datasets and two paypal (in-house) datasets. Our experiments show that our method generates better recommendations compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms, especially in the presence of sparse data. Furthermore, we also demonstrated the robustness of our approach to increasing data sparsity and the number of users.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);biclustering;cold start;collaborative filtering;experiment;formal concept analysis;interaction;personalization;recommender system;scalability;similarity learning;similarity measure;social media;sparse matrix	Faris Alqadah;Chandan K.

As such, current robots are far away from the robot butlers, assistants, and housekeepers that are depicted in science fiction movies. Part of this gap can be explained by the fact that human environments are hugely varied, complex and unstructured. For example, the homes that a domestic robot might end up in are hugely varied. Since every home has a different layout with different objects and furniture, it is impossible for a human designer to anticipate all challenges a robot might face, and equip the robot a priori with all the necessary perceptual and manipulation skills. Instead, robots could be programmed in a way that allows them to adapt to any environment that they are in. In that case, the robot designer would not need to precisely anticipate such environments. The ability to adapt can be provided by robot learning techniques, which can be applied to learn skills for perception and manipulation. Many of the current robot learning techniques, however, rely on human supervisors to provide annotations or demonstrations, and to fine-tuning the methods parameters and heuristics. As such, it can require a significant amount of human time investment to make a robot perform a task in a novel environment, even if statistical learning techniques are used. In this thesis, I focus on another way of obtaining the data a robot needs to learn about the environment and how to successfully perform skills in it. By exploring the environment using its own sensors and actuators, rather than passively waiting for annotations or demonstrations, a robot can obtain this data by itself. I investigate multiple approaches that allow a robot to explore its environment autonomously, while trying to minimize the design effort required to deploy such algorithms in different situations. First, I consider an unsupervised robot with minimal prior knowledge about its environment. It can only learn through observed sensory feedback obtained though interactive exploration of its environment. In a bottom-up, probabilistic approach, the robot tries to segment the objects in its environment through clustering with minimal prior knowledge. This clustering is based on static visual scene features and observed movement. Information theoretic principles are used to autonomously select actions that maximize the expected information gain, and thus learning speed. Our evaluations on a real robot system equipped with an on-board camera show that the proposed method handles noisy inputs better than previous methods, and that	as-interface;algorithm;bottom-up parsing;cluster analysis;domestic robot;feedback;heuristic (computer science);information gain in decision trees;kullback–leibler divergence;machine learning;on-board data handling;plasma cleaning;robot learning;robotics;sensor;theory;top-down and bottom-up design;vacuum cleaner	Herke van Hoof	2016				Robotics	-30.472916719861725	-40.85695556150607	161678

This adoption will be accelerated by new soft- ware applications that increase pathologists' productivity and quality of work. Increasingly specific stains are available to better diagnose dis- eases such as cancer. Pathologists are confronted with growing complex- ity when correlating images from differently stained tissue sections. Here traditional microscopy, which generally allows local viewing of only one image at a time, reaches its limits. Digital pathology can offer tools to facilitate such tasks when assessing complex cases. In this contribution we present a visualization and navigation platform prototype. The basic viewing functions are implemented in a style analogous to Google Maps. The principles of meaningful navigation, however, are based on two so- phisticated image analysis types. Firstly, the user interface is designed to intuitively handle panels of automatically co-registered whole-slide im- ages; secondly, heat maps - the result of quantitative image analysis - help the user to quickly navigate to the relevant regions. Under the as- sumption that the general image analysis challenges can be met robustly, this prototype was used to collect feedback from more than ten pathol- ogists and to analyze how they operated the system. These results are the basis for product development requirements for clinical pathology applications.

Therefore, approaches that leverage users' preferences in applications of messages filtering, recommendation and searching were proposed by scholars in recent years. In general, features extraction is critical process in applying these approaches to applications. However, current researches have been focused on finding better models on varied features, but ignored why these features were used. To answer this question, we make an intuitive assumption that directly applying the result of data analysis, especially using the result of data analysis as features in our proposal, might lead to better performance than general raw features. In this paper, we propose to use these new features in a naive approach and a learning to rank approach for application of messages recommendation in micro-blog service. The experiments by the two approaches over a large real-world data set, which compare performance of proposed new features and raw features, support our assumption.	blog;experiment;feature extraction;information explosion;learning to rank	Bo Li;Xiang Wu;Biao Xiang;Hui Zhang	2013	2013 6th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/BMEI.2013.6747026	feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;data mining;data analysis;world wide web;information retrieval;statistics	DB	-22.879869536565515	-50.02139170404448	161835

In this respect, the time dimension has been extensively exploited as a highly important relevance criterion to improve the retrieval effectiveness of document ranking models. Thus, a compelling research interest is going on the temporal information retrieval realm, which gives rise to several temporal search applications. In this article, we intend to provide a scrutinizing overview of time-aware information retrieval models. We specifically put the focus on the use of timeliness and its impact on the global value of relevance as well as on the retrieval effectiveness. First, we attempt to motivate the importance of temporal signals, whenever combined with other relevance features, in accounting for document relevance. Then, we review the relevant studies standing at the crossroads of both information retrieval and time according to three common information retrieval aspects: the query level, the document content level and the document ranking model level. We organize the related temporalbased approaches around specific information retrieval tasks and regarding the task at hand, we emphasize the importance of results presentation and particularly timelines to the end user. We also report a set of relevant research trends and avenues that can be explored in the future.	categorization;evaluation function;ibm websphere;information access;information retrieval;information science;ranking (information retrieval);relevance;temporal expressions;temporal logic;timeml;timeline;web search engine;world wide web	Bilel Moulahi;Lynda Tamine;Sadok Ben Yahia	2016	J.

Posting short messages (i.e., a maximum of 140 characters) to the Web at any time and at any place lowers the usage barrier, accelerates the information diffusion process, and makes it possible for instant publication. Among those daily userpublished posts, many are related to recent or real-time events occurring in our daily life. While microblog sites usually display a list of words representing the trend topics during a time period (e.g., 24 hours, a week or even longer) on their homepages, the topical words do not make any sense to let the users have a comprehensive view of the topic, especially for those without any background knowledge. Additionally, users can only open each post in the relevant list to learn the topic details. In this paper, we propose a unified workflow of event detection, tracking and summarization on microblog data. Particularly, we introduce novel features considering the characteristics of microblog data for topical words selection, and thus for event detection. In the tracking phase, a bipartite graph is constructed to capture the relationship between two events occurring at adjacent time. The matched event pair is grouped into an event chain. Furthermore, inspired by diversity theory in Web search, we are the first to summarize event chains by considering the content coverage and evolution over time. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach on microblog data.

d7a73e2ce0865a504e243be9c23d466ed3ef1c77	an ensemble-based approach to click-through rate prediction for promoted listings at etsy		Etsy1 is a global marketplace where people across the world connect to make, buy and sell unique goods. Sellers at Etsy can promote their product listings via advertising campaigns similar to traditional sponsored search ads. Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is an integral part of online search advertising systems where it is utilized as an input to auctions which determine the final ranking of promoted listings to a particular user for each query. In this paper, we provide a holistic view of Etsy's promoted listings' CTR prediction system and propose an ensemble learning approach which is based on historical or behavioral signals for older listings as well as content-based features for new listings. We obtain representations from texts and images by utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and employ multimodal learning to combine these different signals. We compare the system to non-trivial baselines on a large-scale real world dataset from Etsy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model and strong correlations between offline experiments and online performance.

Illustration images acquired from origami books are motley and not sequenced. Moreover, the information obtained from 2D illustrations is so superficial and incomplete that the folding operations cannot be determined uniquely. To solve these problems, a highly flexible and reliable recognition mechanism is proposed in this paper. This paper additionally includes the content as follows. Firstly, an algorithm for revising the positions of folding operations extracted from illustrations is proposed so as to make our recognition approach more reliable. Secondly, the outline of the methods which enable feasible folding operations to be generated based only on superficial and incomplete information extracted from illustrations is described. Finally, some updating procedures are proposed to maintain consistency of data (called internal model) which record the transformation of origami models in 3D virtual space during a folding process. Several examples that prove the validness of proposed algorithms/methods are also given in this paper.	algorithm;book;experiment;peano axioms;the superficial;virtual reality	Hiroshi Shimanuki;Jien Kato;Toyohide Watanabe	2003		10.1109/ICDAR.2003.1227725	computer vision;internal model;speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;complete information;algorithm	Robotics	-32.069850888488034	-43.76916344094428	162446

In a microblog service, it is a simple and effective way to annotate tags for users to represent their interests and attributes. The attributes and interests of a microblog user usually hide behind the text and network information of the user. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model, Network-Regularized Tag Dispatch Model (NTDM), for microblog user tag suggestion. NTDM models the semantic relations between words in user descriptions and tags, and takes the social network structure as regularization. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of NTDM compared to other baseline methods.

Search, recommendation, and online advertising are the three most important information-providing mechanisms on the web. These information seeking techniques, satisfying usersu0027 information needs by suggesting users personalized objects (information or services) at the appropriate time and place, play a crucial role in mitigating the information overload problem. With recent great advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), there have been increasing interests in developing DRL based information seeking techniques. These DRL based techniques have two key advantages -- (1) they are able to continuously update information seeking strategies according to usersu0027 real-time feedback, and (2) they can maximize the expected cumulative long-term reward from users where reward has different definitions according to information seeking applications such as click-through rate, revenue, user satisfaction and engagement. In this paper, we give an overview of deep reinforcement learning for search, recommendation, and online advertising from methodologies to applications, review representative algorithms, and discuss some appealing research directions.

We therefore consider that an affinity to robots is one of the important components of a stable relationship. In this paper, we propose an action selection system for robots. We expect the system to select an appropriate action that matches human's individual preference. We used an emotion estimation system to achieve this. This is an approach to create an affinity to robots. As a human's preference will be affected by their emotions, we used emotion estimation to learn these preferences. In this paper, we outline the proposed system, experiments, and evaluation of its efficacy. We performed two types of experiments using a simulated robot over one week and four weeks. In each of the experiments, the robot was varying its behaviors, based on learning of individual's preferences.	action selection;estimation theory;experiment;processor affinity;robot	Kazumi Kumagai;Jeonghun Baek;Ikuo Mizuuchi	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO 2014)	10.1109/ROBIO.2014.7090356	robot;face;computer vision;estimation;artificial intelligence;mathematical model;histogram;statistics	Robotics	-28.18702472276103	-41.36314418725364	163170

This includes the description of events, requests for action, and their organization in time. A crucial component of language acquisition is learning the grammatical structures that allow the expression of such complex meaning related to physical events. The current research investigates the learning of grammatical constructions and their temporal organization in the context of human-robot physical interaction with the embodied sensorimotor humanoid platform, the iCub. We demonstrate three noteworthy phenomena. First, a recurrent network model is used in conjunction with this robotic platform to learn the mappings between grammatical forms and predicate-argument representations of meanings related to events, and the robot's execution of these events in time. Second, this learning mechanism functions in the inverse sense, i.e., in a language production mode, where rather than executing commanded actions, the robot will describe the results of human generated actions. Finally, we collect data from naïve subjects who interact with the robot via spoken language, and demonstrate significant learning and generalization results. This allows us to conclude that such a neural language learning system not only helps to characterize and understand some aspects of human language acquisition, but also that it can be useful in adaptive human-robot interaction.	echo state network;generalization (psychology);humanoid robot;human–computer interaction;human–robot interaction;icub;language development;language disorders;naivety;network model;programming languages;recurrent neural network;executing - querystatuscode	Xavier Hinaut;Maxime Petit;Grégoire Pointeau;Peter Ford Dominey	2014		10.3389/fnbot.2014.00016	psychology;language acquisition;natural language processing;text mining;computer science;bioinformatics;artificial intelligence;recurrent neural network;machine learning;reservoir computing;communication;language model	ML	-28.52902673289882	-39.57085337937386	163750
3131fc6e3760d2edfaeff3a6bfff962cdc02c3b5	a distributed sensor management for large-scale iot indoor acoustic surveillance		Abstract The recent world events have underscored the need for large area surveillance systems. Such systems require effective sensing and collaborative decision-making to operate in highly dynamic environments with demanding time constraints. The Pervasive Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm that enables detailed characterization of the real physical applications. To this end, a pervasive IoT surveillance applications can offer an effective framework to collect situation-aware knowledge that is vital for planning effective security measures. Nevertheless, most state-of-the-art focus only on visual abnormal event recognition using centralized systems, thus, ignoring the need for distributed operation to enable large-scale IoT surveillance systems. This paper presents a novel Sensor Management (SM) framework for pervasive IoT acoustic surveillance, IntelliSurv, that automatically detects and localizes abnormal acoustic events in a distributed collaborative manner. The proposed framework coordinates the sensing resources using a novel team-theoretic SM, based on the Belief–Desire–Intention (BDI) model, for autonomous decision-making and resource allocation. The proposed abnormal event recognition module, using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) classifiers, relies on audio information to recognize human screams or high-stress speech signals. The simulation scenario in this work is the surveillance of the Waterloo International Airport implemented using Jadex platform and Speech Under Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) database. The simulation results show the merits of the proposed IntelliSurv framework, compared to the popular centralized systems, over varying network size, number of threats, Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR), tracking quality, and energy consumption.	acoustic cryptanalysis	Allaa R.

At last we proposed an algorithm as case study and discussed further research's possibility.	algorithm;digital watermarking;enlightenment;pixel;self-similarity	Xiaowei Liu;Jin Zhang;Haozhou Wang;Xiaoli Gong;Yuanyuan Cheng	2014	2014 Ninth International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications	10.1109/BWCCA.2014.49	algorithm design;digital watermarking alliance;digital watermarking;computer science;graphics;theoretical computer science;multimedia;computer security;encryption;information retrieval;encoding	Robotics	-24.67439745682801	-39.87271767438924	163833

How can we detect a high-value answer which clears the doubts of many users? Can we tell the user if the question s/he is posting would attract a good answer? In this paper, we aim to answer these questions from the perspective of the voting outcome by the site users. Our key observation is that the voting score of an answer is strongly positively correlated with that of its question, and such correlation could be in turn used to boost the prediction performance. Armed with this observation, we propose a family of algorithms to jointly predict the voting scores of questions and answers soon after they are posted in the CQA sites. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.	algorithm;google questions and answers;question answering	Yuan Yao;Hanghang Tong;Tao Xie;Leman Akoglu;Feng Xu;Jian Lu	2014	2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2014)	10.1109/ASONAM.2014.6921607	logistics;prediction;computer science;artificial intelligence;data science;machine learning;data mining;mathematics;knowledge extraction;world wide web;correlation;statistics	AI	-23.253888678314873	-50.74986533525887	163995

They are extensively shown before movies in cinemas, as well as on television and increasingly, over the Internet. Making a trailer is a creative process, in which a number of shots from a movie are selected in order to entice a viewer in to paying to see the full movie. Thus, the creation of these trailers is an integral part in the promotion of a movie. Action movies in particular rely on trailers as a form of advertising as it is possible to show short, exciting portions of an action movie, which are likely to appeal to the target audience. This paper presents an approach which automatically selects shots from action movies in order to assist in the creation of trailers. A set of audiovisual features are extracted that aim to model the characteristics of shots typically present in trailers, and a support vector machine is utilised in order to select the relevant shots. The approach taken is not particularly novel but the results show that the process may be used in order to ease the trailer creation process or to facilitate the creation of variable length, or personalised trailers.	floor and ceiling functions;internet;support vector machine	Alan F.

Peer-prediction method is one of the known efforts in this direction but is limited to a single level of participating nodes. We non-trivially generalize the peer-prediction mechanism to the setting of a tree network of participating nodes that would get formed when the query about the object originates at a root node and propagates to nodes in a social network through forwarding. The feedback provided by the participating nodes must be aggregated hierarchically to generate a high quality answer at the root level. In the proposed tree-based peer-prediction mechanism, we use proper scoring rules for continuous distributions and prove that honest reporting is a Nash Equilibrium when prior probabilities are common knowledge in the tree and the observations made by the sibling nodes are stochastically relevant. To compute payments, we explore the logarithmic, quadratic, and spherical scoring rules using techniques from complex analysis. Through detailed simulations, we obtain several insights including the relationship between the budget of the mechanism designer and the quality of answer generated at the root node.	crowdsourcing;display resolution;nash equilibrium;quadratic function;simulation;social network;tree (data structure);tree network;web application	Ratul Ray;Rohith Dwarakanath Vallam;Y.

The recommendation problem is, however, still focused on recommending a set of items to a target user. In this paper, we consider the problem of recommending to a user the appropriate contexts in which an item should be selected. We believe that context recommenders can be used as another set of tools to assist users' decision making. We formulate the context recommendation problem and discuss the motivation behind and possible applications of the concept. We identify two general classes of algorithms to solve this problem: direct context prediction and indirect context recommendation. Furthermore, we present and evaluate several direct context prediction algorithms based on multi-label classification (MLC). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches outperform the baseline methods, and also that personalization is required to enhance the effectiveness of context recommenders.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);experiment;multi-label classification;multi-level cell;personalization;recommender system	Yong Zheng;Bamshad Mobasher;Robin D.

Our personalized recommendation application SERUM exploits the fact that semantically linked and structured information becomes more and more available driven by a strong research community. Our solution combines these semantic, encyclopedic knowledge sources with a large news article dataset and collected implicit user feedback using an RDFa based Web application. In a first step, we compute semantically related entities of interest, such as similar artists or genres, based on a user behavior model using graph-based algorithms. In a second step, we utilize these interest entities for computing news article recommendations. An RDFa schema has been designed that enables standard annotations in any XHTML Web-page, thus making structured data available for the adaptation process, but also for any service or tool that supports the RDFa standard.	algorithm;behavior model;entity;personalization;rdfa;recommender system;web application;xhtml	Till Plumbaum;Andreas Lommatzsch;Ernesto William De Luca;Sahin Albayrak	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-28509-7_37	semantic computing;semantic grid;computer science;data mining;semantic web stack;semantic technology;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-26.891070432658505	-49.684104613732664	165698

There are groups of users who watch such related Web pages, and discovering such groups (user communities) is important for clarifying the behaviors of the users of similar tastes. Moreover, it is expected that the characteristics of user communities in the Web correspond to that in real human societies. A method for discovering user communities is described in this paper. Client-level log data (Web audience measurement data) is used as the data of users' Web watching behaviors. Maximal complete bipartite graphs are searched from the graph obtained from the log data without analyzing the contents of Web pages. Experimental results show that our method succeeds in discovering many interesting user communities with labels that characterize the communities.	flake (software);maximal set;structure mining;web audience measurement;web page;world wide web	Tsuyoshi Murata	2004	IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI'04)	10.1109/WI.2004.56	web service;complete bipartite graph;web mining;web development;data web;web analytics;web mapping;bipartite graph;web design;web standards;computer science;web navigation;social semantic web;web page;data mining;database;web intelligence;data analysis;informatics;web 2.0;world wide web;intelligent agent;time	DB	-24.163491212520302	-50.585939792716346	166416

To simplify this process for both parties, we would like to have users draw isolated shapes instead of complete sketches that must be hand-labeled and grouped, and then use this data to train our free-sketch symbol recognizer. However, it is an open question whether shapes drawn in isolation accurately reflect the way users draw shapes in a complete diagram. To answer this question, we present a systematic exploration of the effect of task on recognition accuracy using three different recognizers. Our study examines how task affects accuracy in the context of user-independent, user semi-dependent and user-dependent training data. We find that as the amount of user-specific training data increases, the effect of task on recognition accuracy also increases. We also show that the best overall recognition results are obtained by using user semi-dependent, task-specific training data. These results hold across three different domains: circuit diagrams, entity relationship diagrams and process diagrams. Finally, we introduce a variant of a popular and simple gesture recognition algorithm that recognizes freely drawn shapes as well as a highly accurate but more complex recognizer designed explicitly for free-sketch recognition.	gesture recognition;sketch recognition	Martin Field;Sam Gordon;Eric Jeffrey Peterson;Raquel Robinson;Thomas F.

579b3ddd45855a29c9909ed3cef6e94f064e1a79	content-based recommendations with poisson factorization		We develop collaborative topic Poisson factorization (CTPF), a generative model of articles and reader preferences. CTPF can be used to build recommender systems by learning from reader histories and content to recommend personalized articles of interest. In detail, CTPF models both reader behavior and article texts with Poisson distributions, connecting the latent topics that represent the texts with the latent preferences that represent the readers. This provides better recommendations than competing methods and gives an interpretable latent space for understanding patterns of readership. Further, we exploit stochastic variational inference to model massive real-world datasets. For example, we can fit CPTF to the full arXiv usage dataset, which contains over 43 million ratings and 42 million word counts, within a day. We demonstrate empirically that our model outperforms several baselines, including the previous state-of-the art approach.	baseline (configuration management);generative model;personalization;poisson wavelet;recommender system;variational principle	Prem Gopalan;Laurent Charlin;David M.

deb485f702b4d5a80fab4637aebfcd0436919925	exploiting rating abstention intervals for addressing concept drift in social network recommender systems		One of the major problems that social networks face is the continuous production of successful, user-targeted information in the form of recommendations, which are produced exploiting technology from the field of recommender systems. Recommender systems are based on information about users’ past behavior to formulate recommendations about their future actions. However, as time goes by, social network users may change preferences and likings: they may like different types of clothes, listen to different singers or even different genres of music and so on. This phenomenon has been termed as concept drift. In this paper: (1) we establish that when a social network user abstains from rating submission for a long time, it is a strong indication that concept drift has occurred and (2) we present a technique that exploits the abstention interval concept, to drop from the database ratings that do not reflect the current social network user’s interests, thus improving prediction quality.	acid;algorithm;computer user satisfaction;concept drift;experiment;optimization problem;preprocessor;recommender system;social network;user (computing)	Dionisis Margaris;Costas Vassilakis	2018	Informatics	10.3390/informatics5020021	collaborative filtering;recommender system;data mining;concept drift;social network;exploit;computer science;phenomenon	AI	-24.773647545680735	-47.55302691082414	166687
73799ead6497e7420ff62acc0e93c209fd73d00d	activity-partner recommendation	conference_paper	In many activities, such as watching movies or having dinner, people prefer to find partners before participation. Therefore, when recommending activity items (e.g., movie tickets) to users, it makes sense to also recommend suitable activity partners. This way, (i) the users save time for finding activity partners, (ii) the effectiveness of the item recommendation is increased (users may prefer activity items more if they can find suitable activity partners), (iii) recommender systems become more interesting and enkindle users’ social enthusiasm. In this paper, we identify the usefulness of suggesting activity partners together with items in recommender systems. In addition, we propose and compare several methods for activity-partner recommendation. Our study includes experiments that test the practical value of activity-partner recommendation and evaluate the effectiveness of all suggested methods as well as some alternative strategies.	experiment;recommender system	Wenting Tu;David Wai-Lok Cheung;Nikos Mamoulis;Min Yang;Ziyu Lu	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-18038-0_46	computer science;information retrieval	Web+IR	-28.591430359924125	-48.04686217138818	166854

Further, to ease the user's decision making, the amount of supplementary information, such as right time to visit, weather conditions, traffic condition, right mode of transport, crowdedness, security alerts, etc., may be annotated with the list of recommended locations. This paper explores the possibility of enriching tourist locations using crowd sourcing approach, which can be used by Tourist Spot Recommender System (TSRS) for mobile users. Proposed crowd sourcing system focuses on getting work done from the crowd currently available at the location under consideration. In proposed system, the contributed information is not limited to ones available on blogs, web pages and sensor-readings from the device etc., but includes proactively-generated user's opinions and perspectives, that are processed to offer immediate knowledge. Our system works in collaboration with a TSRS, takes the list of locations to be recommended to the current user and performs just-in-time information enrichment for those selected set of locations.

As a result, nowadays it has become extremely popular for consumers to share their experience, point out their preferences and concerns with respect to a specific product on Web. These online customer reviews possess vital information that product designers can gain insights of their customers and products, and make improvements accordingly. However, the sheer amount of data, their distributed locations and the inherent ambiguity of human language have challenged designers greatly. In this paper, we aim to outline an intelligent system that is able to first automatically gather global online reviews with respect to certain products interested, identify the product features and customer requirements, and most importantly relates them to the product’s engineering characteristics through quality function deployment (QFD), a tool that is widely used by product designers in the customer-driven design paradigm. Meanwhile, we also highlight the challenges and relevant research issues in order to fulfil such an ambition. As a pioneer study, we believe that this research will greatly help designers in the era of global competition and e-commerce.	artificial intelligence;blog;e-commerce;natural language;portals;programming paradigm;quality function deployment;requirement;software deployment;user-generated content;web;www	Ying Liu	2010			computer science;data science;data mining	Web+IR	-25.144454891695528	-50.28887538994329	167647

The results show that our approach can improve the prediction accuracy of the item-based collaborative filtering not only on different neighbors, but also on different training ratio data set.	collaborative filtering	Weijie Wang;Jing Yang;Zhe Yang	2012		10.1109/CW.2012.40	computer science;collaborative filtering;machine learning;group method of data handling;data mining;accuracy and precision;world wide web;correlation;information retrieval;recommender system;collaboration	HCI	-20.943149397479942	-48.389174615056	167886

Together, the multi-layer social interactions form a “integrated social network.” How can we extend well developed knowledge about single-layer networks, including vertex centrality and community structure, to such heterogeneous structures? In this paper, we approach these challenges by proposing a principled framework of network composition based on a unified dynamical process. Mathematically, we consider the following abstract problem: Given multilayer network data, (G, . . . , G) over a vertex set V and additional parameters for intra and inter-layer dynamics, construct a (single) weighted network G that best integrates the joint process. We use transformations of dynamics to unify heterogeneous layers under a common dynamics. For inter-layer compositions, we will consider several cases as the interlayer dynamics plays different roles in various social or technological networks. Empirically, we provide examples to highlight the usefulness of this framework for network analysis and network design.	approximation algorithm;centrality;email;interaction;layer (electronics);mathematical optimization;mined;network planning and design;optimization problem;social media;social network analysis;weighted network	Kristina Lerman;Shang-Hua Teng;Xiaoran Yan	2016	CoRR		organizational network analysis;network science;network formation;computer science;dynamic network analysis;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;network dynamics;machine learning;data mining;mathematics;network simulation;world wide web	ML	-19.327350202339993	-41.72026863363934	168008

Prediction by partial match (PPM) is one of the context models used in the Web prefetching area. The high space complexity and low efficiency of the PPM model affect its application. In this paper, we make use of pruning technique and propose a new adaptive PPM model based on Zipf's law and Web access characteristics. The experiments have shown that this model not only can be used to make predictions dynamically, but also has relative lower space complexity and higher prediction accuracy.	cpu cache;dspace;experiment;world wide web;zipf's law	Lei Shi;Yangjie Cao;Xiaoguang Ding;Lin Wei;Zhimin Gu	2005	2005 First International Conference on Semantics, Knowledge and Grid	10.1109/SKG.2005.32	the internet;computer science;machine learning;web accessibility;data mining;database;predictive modelling;context model;dspace;prediction by partial matching;world wide web	DB	-31.15206633122576	-51.7975305183928	168077

Our walker is instrumented to provide guidance to elderly people when navigating their environments; however, such guidance is difficult to provide without knowing what activity a person is engaged in (e.g., where a person wants to go). The main contribution of this paper is an algorithm for learning models of users of the walker. These models are defined at multiple levels of abstractions, and learned from actual usage data using statistical techniques. We demonstrate that our approach succeeds in determining the specific activity in which a user engages when using the walker. One of our proto-type walkers was tested in an assisted living facility near Pittsburgh, PA; a more recent model was extensively evaluated in a university environment.	algorithm;amiga walker;robot;usage data	Jared Glover;Sebastian Thrun;Judith T.

3c9da01412047a84eaabc0ef36ec6a1c0c10ac24	experiences using bds: a crawler for social internetworking scenarios		In new generation social networks, we expect that the paradigm of Social Internetworking Scenarios (SISs) will be more and more important. In this new scenario, the role of Social Network Analysis is of course still crucial but the preliminary step to do is designing a good way to crawl the underlying graph. While this aspect has been deeply investigated in the field of social networks, it is an open issue when moving towards SISs. Indeed, we cannot expect that a crawling strategy, good for social networks, is still valid in a Social Internetworking scenario, due to the specific topological features of this scenario. In this paper, we first confirm the above claim and then, define a new crawling strategy specifically conceived for SISs, which overcomes the drawbacks of the state-of-the-art crawling strategies. After this, we exploit this crawling strategy to investigate SISs to understand their main properties and features of their main actors (i.e., bridges).	internetworking;web crawler	Francesco Buccafurri;Gianluca Lax;Antonino Nocera;Domenico Ursino	2014		10.1007/978-3-7091-1797-2_8	internet privacy;computer security;computer network	HCI	-21.94588805591225	-41.251694183814315	168583

On this basis, we present a group formation technique which exploits measures of both similarity and trust, in order to improve the compactness of groups in Online Social Networks. Similarity and trust have been jointly exploited to design two algorithms designed to match groups and users, in order to capture the gain of a user who desires to join with a group and the benefit of the group itself. Experimental results show that trust is more valuable than similarity in forming groups and that the two proposed algorithms are capable to deal with large networks.

In this paper, we present the first measurement study of the characteristics and evolution of location-based communities which are based on a social discovery network and geographic proximity. We measure and analyse more than 176K location-based communities with over 1.4 million distinct members of a popular social discovery network and more than 46 million locations. We characterise the evolution of the communities and study the user behaviour in LBSD by analysing the mobility features of users belonging to communities in comparison to non-community members. Using observed spatio-temporal similarity features, we build and evaluate a classifier to predict location-based community membership solely based on user mobility information.

A virtual community was built on this website to study its performance under the influence of two treatments. The first treatment was an administrative modification – a change of membership policy that restricted nonmembers’ access to a popular area of the website. The second treatment was the addition of an advanced feature that helped cultivate a virtual community, using combined push and pull capabilities. Data of four traffic performance metrics were recorded: pageview, visitor count, daily registration, and average duration. The data points preceding the treatment were analyzed using time-series ARIMA model to predict the data points subsequent to the treatment. In order to illustrate the effect of the treatment, the actual data prior to the treatment, the actual data following the treatment, and the predicted data are plotted on the same graph. This allows a clear visual inspection of how the treatment affects the data trend. The results show that for the first treatment, pageview, visitor count, and daily registration, all increased considerably. However, the levels of pageview and visitor count dropped back down very fast, while daily registration stayed high. Conversely, the seemingly positive treatment did not result in an increase of average duration. Unlike other performance metrics, average duration decreased. For the second treatment, the levels of pageview, visitor count, and average duration not only increased, but also stayed high. However, the treatment did not tend to change daily registration, as the level did not change much.	autoregressive integrated moving average;data point;page view;plot (graphics);time series;virtual community;visual inspection	Eugenia Y.

In order to analyze and mining the structure and characteristics of online network communities with their large number of multimedia data automatically, we look into community photos as an basic data source for community social network construction and community organization structure analysis. By constructing the social network with community photo collection through face recognition algorithms, social network analysis method is used to analysis the community properties and individual characteristics. The effectiveness of different face recognition algorithms on community network construction is also calculated by three defined variables. Experimental analysis results of a real community album demonstrate the community social network characteristics and the influence brought by face recognition algorithms. The analysis method will provide new approach for using the online multimedia information to understanding the community organization structure and characteristics.	algorithm;facial recognition system;internet;social network analysis	Bo Li;Duoyong Sun;Julei Fu;Zi-Han Lin	2013	2013 Sixth International Conference on Business Intelligence and Financial Engineering	10.1109/BIFE.2013.98	organizational network analysis;computer science;data mining;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-21.67070527269069	-44.20976130514541	170034

They will be required to act in a vast information landscape, asserting the relevance of data spread in the cyber world, in order to let their human users become aware of the content they really need. This is a remarkably similar situation to what the human brain has to do all the time when deciding what information coming from the surrounding environment is interesting and what can simply be ignored. The brain performs this task using so called cognitive heuristics, i.e. simple, rapid, yet very effective schemes. In this article, we propose a new approach that exploits one of these heuristics, the recognition heuristic, for developing a self-adaptive system that deals with effective data dissemination in opportunistic networks. We show how to implement it and provide an extensive analysis via simulation. Specifically, results show that the proposed solution is as effective as state-of-the-art solutions for data dissemination in opportunistic networks, while requiring far less resources. Finally, our sensitiveness analysis shows how various parameters depend on the context where nodes are situated, and suggest corresponding optimal configurations for the algorithm.	adaptive system;algorithm;cognitive tutor;heuristic (computer science);performance evaluation;relevance;simulation;situated	Marco Conti;Matteo Mordacchini;Andrea Passarella	2013	TAAS	10.1145/2518017.2518018	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;heuristics;data mining;recognition heuristic;distributed computing;dissemination;computer network	AI	-22.85085955239068	-39.45273219085374	170243
804c5003816db3a35fe2a2fdc7dfbf453c26d0d8	dynamic agglomerative-divisive clustering of clickthrough data for collaborative web search	clustering method;web search;clickthrough data	In this paper, we model clickthroughs as a tripartite graph involving users, queries and concepts embodied in the clicked pages. We develop the Dynamic Agglomerative-Divisive Clustering (DADC) algorithm for clustering the tripartite clickthrough graph to identify groups of similar users, queries and concepts to support collaborative web search. Since the clickthrough graph is updated frequently, DADC clusters the graph incrementally, whereas most of the traditional agglomerative methods cluster the whole graph all over again. Moreover, clickthroughs are usually noisy and reflect diverse interests of the users. Thus, traditional agglomerative clustering methods tend to generate large clusters when the clickthrough graph is large. DADC avoids generating large clusters using two interleaving phases: the agglomerative and divisive phases. The agglomerative phase iteratively merges similar clusters together to avoid generating sparse clusters. On the other hand, the divisive phase iteratively splits large clusters into smaller clusters to maintain the coherence of the clusters and restructures the existing clusters to allow DADC to incrementally update the affected clusters as new clickthrough data arrives.	web search engine	Kenneth Wai-Ting Leung;Dik Lun Lee	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-12026-8_48	computer science;machine learning;data mining;database	Web+IR	-29.66780614184273	-50.58955317826879	170379

Specifically, employing a real-world medical dataset as the source in our study, we first mine doctor-patient ties/relationships via Time-constraint Probability Factor Graph model (TPFG), and then define the transition probability matrix between neighbor nodes. Finally, we propose a doctor recommendation model via Random Walk with Restart (RWR), namely RWR-Model. Our real experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that we obtain the good accuracies of mining doctor-patient relationships from the network, the performance of doctor recommendation is also better than the baseline algorithms: traditional Reduced SVM (RSVM) method and IDR- Model.	social network	Jibing Gong;Ce Pang;Lili Wang;Lin Zhang;Wenbo Huang;Shengtao Sun	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-45558-6_18	simulation;engineering;data mining;world wide web	ECom	-22.154695732321287	-48.476700152130135	170487

The classification tree of products is used to find the users with similar shopping intention. The sparsity of user ratings, major problem for collaborative filtering, is overcome. A two-granularity user profile is built to reflect the customer's shopping interests. User profile is firstly described as a set of leaf nodes of the classification tree. Then, each category of the user profile is refined by the theory of fuzzy set. Fuzzy sets make user profile and item representation more accurate. At the same time, tags instead of key words extracted from item content, are used for the building of user profiles and representation of items. It overcomes the analysis difficulty and large calculation problems for content-based filtering.	classification chart;collaborative filtering;decision tree learning;e-commerce payment system;fuzzy set;recommender system;sparse matrix;tree (data structure);user profile	Lianhong Ding;Yanhong Zheng	2016	2016 International Conference on Identification, Information and Knowledge in the Internet of Things (IIKI)	10.1109/IIKI.2016.73	filter (signal processing);computer network;data mining;e-commerce;collaborative filtering;fuzzy set;sparse matrix;computer science;decision tree learning;user profile	AI	-21.930723594515964	-48.87051848849564	170587

Building the recommendation system for Facebook Marketplace is challenging for two reasons: 1) Scalability: the number of products in Facebook Marketplace is huge.

Resource recommenders that exploit these tags to model users and resources have proven to be effective in assisting users navigate complex information spaces, particularly when combined with other approaches. In previous work, we demonstrated the power of a linear weighted hybrid that combines the weighted results of simple component recommenders. While this hybrid was able to learn how to weigh each of the components, it treated all users the same. In this work, we present a framework to automatically discover partitions of users and learn optimal weights for each partition. The experimental results on three real world data sets not only demonstrates an improvement in the accuracy of the algorithm, but also offers unique insights into how social annotation systems are used by various groups of users.

The dynamic nature of discussion threads poses interesting and challenging problems for computer scientists. Although techniques such as semantic models or structural models have been shown to be useful in a number of areas, they are inefficient in understanding discussion threads due to the temporal dependence among posts in a discussion thread.

Existing prefetching methods are based mostly on URL graphs. They use the graphical nature of HTTP links to determine the possible paths through a hypertext system. Although the URL graph-based approaches are effective in prefetching of frequently accessed documents, few of them can prefetch those URLs that are rarely visited. The paper presents a keyword-based semantic prefetching approach to overcome the limitation. It predicts future requests based on semantic preferences of past retrieved Web documents. We apply this technique to Internet news services and implement a client-side personalized prefetching system: NewsAgent. The system exploits semantic preferences by analyzing keywords in URL anchor text of previously accessed documents in different news categories. It employs a neural network model over the keyword set to predict future requests. The system features a self-learning capability and good adaptability to the change of client surfing interest. NewsAgent does not exploit keyword synonymy for conservativeness in prefetching. However, it alleviates the impact of keyword polysemy by taking into account server-provided categorical information in decision-making and, hence, captures more semantic knowledge than term-document literal matching methods. Experimental results from daily browsing of ABC News, CNN, and MSNBC news sites for a period of three months show an achievement of up to 60 percent hit ratio due to prefetching.	anchor text;artificial neural network;cpu cache;client-side;digital journalism;graphical user interface;hit (internet);hypertext transfer protocol;link prefetching;literal (mathematical logic);network model;personalization;server (computing);web page	Cheng-Zhong Xu;Tamer I.

8b9e536206232d318dbe1c8511c90dc1303c5839	selective presentation of peer commentary on web objects through a modeling of user similarity and reputability: reducing information overload in social networks		In this paper, we present an approach aimed at enabling users to enrich their experience with web-based objects (texts or videos). In particular, we consider a social network of users offering commentary on the web objects they have experienced together with opinions on the value of this commentary being registered by peers. Within this framework, we integrate a reasoner that personalizes the presentation of these annotations to each new user, selectively limiting what is displayed to promote the commentary that will lead to the most effective knowledge gains, based on a modeling of the reputability of the annotator and the similarity of peers who have found this commentary to be useful. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for selective presentation of these web document annotations by constructing a simulation of knowledge gains achieved by users. Our method is shown to approach the ideal knowledge gains achieved by an optimal algorithm, far outpacing a system where a random selection of commentary is offered (as might match what users would experience if employing self-directed limiting of browsing behaviour). As a result, we offer an effective method for enhancing the experiences of users in contexts with potentially massive amounts of peer commentary. Indeed, when a social network of peers is involved, a user does eventually need to make decisions about which peers to listen to. In our framework, we allow those peers who have not been helpful in the past to be redeemed and embraced anew within the social network (through a provision of exploring as well as exploiting the collection of peer commentary); in addition, we do not blindly accept the advice that is offered by each respected peer, separately evaluating its worth towards the learning gains to be achieved. As such, we are advocating the use of user models of peers as part of the reasoning of the user who is processing web content.

In contrast with peer-based intelligent tutoring researchers, we are able to leverage past experiences rather than requiring peers to be assisting in realtime with the learning that is achieved. As such, our users are free to browse and view the accompanying annotations on their web documents and videos, at their leisure. This is accomplished by attaching an interaction history (knowledge benefit acquired) from each user to each learning object and continuously selecting those web objects that are poised to deliver the most value the current user (based on modeling similarity to other peers). From here, the commentary that is selected are the most beneficial ones attached to this particular web object. We are also careful to avoid possibly harmful content offered by peers, thus continuing to allow free expression within the social network, but achieving a valuable limiting of what is directed to each new user.	advice (programming);algorithm;browsing;chi;effective method;information overload;semantic reasoner;simulation;social network;user experience;web application;web content;web page	John Champaign;Robin Cohen	2012			world wide web;learning object;citation;multimedia;web content;permission;effective method;server;social network;semantic reasoner;computer science	Web+IR	-32.709486589780596	-47.695089625045746	172207

We study the evolution of language usage behavior of individuals, across topics, on microblogs. We propose Man-O-Meter, a framework to model such evolution. We model the evolution using a combination of three dimensions: (a) time, (b) content (topics) and (c) influence flow over social relationships. We assert the goodness of our approach, by predicting ranks of experts, with respect to their influence in their respective expertise category, using the change in language used in time. We apply our framework on 2, 273 influential microbloggers on Twitter, across 62 categories, spanning over 10 domains. Our work is applicable in predicting activity and influence, interest evolution, job change and community change expected to happen to a user, in future.

An autonomous robot that has to move among different buildings needs to manage huge amount of data, as a consequence it is clear that the configuration of the navigation system becomes hard to manage. This paper presents a system, based on a cloud robotics paradigm, conceived to allow autonomous robots to navigate in indoor environment, which are not known a priori. The environment is divided into sub-maps and all the necessary information and the topological representation of the world, are stored into a remote cloud infrastructure. By means of specific environmental tags, composed of a set of ARTags and QR codes, the robot gets the access to the cloud service and it is able to update its navigation configuration in a dynamic and automatic way. Experiments have been conducted in order to choose an appropriate marker dimension and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed procedure.	cloud robotics;robotic mapping	Raffaele Limosani;Alessandro Manzi;Laura Fiorini;Filippo Cavallo;Paolo Dario	2016	I.

Identifying subject movements and behaviors based upon those movements is a critical, time-consuming step in behavioral research. To successfully perform behavior analysis, three goals must be met. First, the agents of interest are observed, and their movements recorded. Second, each individual must be uniquely identified. Finally, behaviors must be identified and recognized. I explore a system that can uniquely identify and track agents, then use these tracks to automatically build behavioral models and recognize similar behaviors in the future.#R##N#I address the tracking and identification problems using a combination of laser range finders, active RFID sensors, and probabilistic models for real-time tracking. The laser range component adds environmental flexibility over vision based systems, while the RFID tags help disambiguate individual agents. The probabilistic models are important to target identification during the complex interactions with other agents of similar appearance. In addition to tracking, I present work on automatic methods for generating behavioral models based on supervised learning techniques using the agents’ tracked data. These models can be used to classify new tracked data and identify the behavior exhibited by the agent, which can then be used to help automate behavior analysis.	interaction;multi-agent system	Adam Feldman	2008			simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;communication	AI	-27.2674825669771	-40.24401575112434	172988
56127cec79416b60fc3a167218851d413ef0e986	a study of whatsapp usage patterns and prediction models without message content		Internet social networks have become a ubiquitous application allowing people to easily share text, pictures, and audio and video files. Popular networks include WhatsApp, Facebook, Reddit and LinkedIn. We present an extensive study of the usage of the WhatsApp social network, an Internet messaging application that is quickly replacing SMS messaging. In order to better understand people’s use of the network, we provide an analysis of over 6 million messages from over 100 users, with the objective of building demographic prediction models using activity data. We performed extensive statistical and numerical analysis of the data and found significant differences in WhatsApp usage across people of different genders and ages. We also inputted the data into the Weka data mining package and studied models created from decision tree and Bayesian network algorithms. We found that different genders and age demographics had significantly different usage habits in almost all message and group attributes. We also noted differences in users’ group behavior and created prediction models, including the likelihood a given group would have relatively more file attachments, if a group would contain a larger number of participants, a higher frequency of activity, quicker response times and shorter messages. We were successful in quantifying and predicting a user’s gender and age demographic. Similarly, we were able to predict different types of group usage. All models were built without analyzing message content. We present a detailed discussion about the specific attributes that were contained in all predictive models and suggest possible applications based on these results. ∗This research is based on work supported in part by MAFAT and the ISRAEL SCIENCE FOUNDATION grant #1488/14. 1 ar X iv :1 80 2. 03 39 3v 1 [ cs .C Y ] 9 F eb 2 01 8	algorithm;attachments;bayesian network;data mining;decision tree;interaction;mind;numerical analysis;one-to-one (data model);predictive modelling;privacy;social network;statistical model;user interface;video file format;weka;whatsapp messenger	Avi Rosenfeld;Sigalit Sina;David Sarne;Or Avidov;Sarit Kraus	2018	CoRR		data mining;predictive modelling;the internet;short message service;decision tree;bayesian network;demographics;social network;computer science	ML	-25.74378924566203	-44.769427233746526	173035

In this paper, we proposed a unified model for collaborative filtering based on graph regularized weighted nonnegative matrix factorization. In our model, two graphs are constructed on users and items, which exploit the internal information (e.g. neighborhood information in the user-item rating matrix) and external information (e.g. content information such as user’s occupation and item’s genre, or other kind of knowledge such as social trust network). The proposed method not only inherits the advantages of model-based method, but also owns the merits of memory-based method which considers the neighborhood information. Moreover, it has the ability to make use of content information and any additional information regarding user-user such as social trust network. Due to the use of these internal and external information, the proposed method is able to find more interpretable lowdimensional representations for users and items, which is helpful for improving the recommendation accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark collaborative filtering data sets demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the state of the art collaborative filtering methods a lot.	benchmark (computing);collaborative filtering;data mining;matrix regularization;mixed graph;non-negative matrix factorization;recommender system;unified model	Quanquan Gu;Jie Zhou;Chris H.

Then, this paper proposes an information visualization model for credit domain, and describes a visualization system for web retrieved credit information. The system can crawl credit related web pages, and after analyzing the characteristics of credit information, SOM-based clustering method is applied to well organize the web pages, and visualization technology is used to present the documents information globally and locally. In this way, user can understand credit information better.

78406a6b5b48e885b33f75e62d23a38b8de5b245	addressing the sparsity of location information on twitter		Micro-blogging services such as Twitter have gained enormous popularity over the last few years leading to massive volumes of user generated content. In combination with the proliferation of smart-phones, this information is generated live from a multitude of content contributors. Interestingly, the content and timestamp of tweets is not the only information that can produce useful knowledge. The location information of users is of great significance since it can be utilized in a variety of applications such as emergency identification, tracking the spread of a disease and advertising. Unfortunately, information regarding location is very rare since many users do not accurately specify their location, and fewer posts have geographic coordinates. In this work, we aim to confront this data sparsity issue. Utilizing Twitter’s social graph and content, we are able to obtain users from a specific location. We optimize our method to work with minimum amount of queries considering the large volume of data in such settings. We also provide a mechanism for geo-locating a tweet within a city and present the qualitative enrichment in our data, achieved by our method.	blog;gene ontology term enrichment;geographic coordinate system;smart tv;smartphone;social graph;sparse matrix;user-generated content	Dimitrios Kotzias;Theodoros Lappas;Dimitrios Gunopulos	2014			user-generated content;timestamp;data mining;social graph;multitude;popularity;computer science	HCI	-25.42721235128197	-46.448336964939784	173828

In the literature, a common experimental setup in the modeling phase is to minimize, either explicitly or implicitly, the (expected) error between the predicted ratings and the true user ratings, while in the evaluation phase, the resulting model is again assessed by that error. In this paper, we argue that defining an error function that is fixed across rating scales is however limited, and different applications may have different recommendation goals thus error functions. For example, in some cases, we might be more concerned about the highly predicted items than the ones with low ratings (precision minded), while in other cases, we want to make sure not to miss any highly rated items (recall minded). Additionally, some applications might require to produce a top-N recommendation list, where the rank-based performance measure becomes valid. To address this issue, we propose a flexible optimization framework that can adapt to individual recommendation goals. We introduce a Directional Error Function to capture the cost (risk) of each individual predictions, and it can be learned from the specified performance measures at hand. Our preliminary experiments on a real data set demonstrate that significant performance gains have been achieved.	algorithm;collaborative filtering;contextual advertising;eisenstein's criterion;experiment;mathematical optimization;personalization;rating scale;recommender system	Tamas Jambor;Jun Wang	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-12275-0_36	rating scale;computer science;data science;collaborative filtering;machine learning;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval;statistics	ML	-19.67584336591259	-48.71558652681039	173884

However, the miscellaneous information often brings the users at a loss. Web personalization provides a solution to improvement of information overloading on websites. The objective of web personalization is to give users a website they want or need, and thus knowing the needs of users is an important task for content recommendation in web personalization. In this article, we propose a hybrid approach for this task. The proposed approach trains the artificial neural networks to group users into different clusters, and applies the well-established Kano’s method to extracting the implicit needs from users in different clusters. Finally, a real case of tour and travel websites applying the approach is presented to demonstrate the improvement of information overloading. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Policy network analysis is an approach to study policy making structures, processes, and outcomes, thereby concentrating on relations between policy actors. An important operational concept for the analysis of policy networks is the notion of centrality, i.e., the distinction of actors according to their importance in a relational structure. We integrate this measure in a layout model for networks by mapping structural to geometric centrality. Thus, centrality values and network data can be presented simultaneously and explored interactively.	centrality;graph drawing;interactivity;social network analysis	Ulrik Brandes;Patrick Kenis;Dorothea Wagner	2003	IEEE Trans.

Recent work has generalized recommendations to suggest packages of items to single users, or single items to groups of users. However, to the best of our knowledge, the interesting problem of recommending a package to a group of users (P2G) has not been studied to date. This is a problem with several practical applications, such as recommending vacation packages to tourist groups, entertainment packages to groups of friends or sets of courses to groups of students. In this paper, we formulate the P2G problem, and we propose probabilistic models that capture the preference of a group toward a package, incorporating factors such as user impact and package viability. We also investigate the issue of recommendation fairness. This is a novel consideration that arises in our setting, where we require that no user is consistently slighted by the item selection in the package. In addition, we study a special case of the P2G problem, where the recommended items are places and the recommendation should consider the current locations of the users in the group. We present aggregation algorithms for finding the best packages and compare our suggested models with baseline approaches stemming from previous work. The results show that our models find packages of high quality which consider all special requirements of P2G recommendation.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);display resolution;fairness measure;multi-user;recommender system;requirement;stemming	Shuyao Qi;Nikos Mamoulis;Evaggelia Pitoura;Panayiotis Tsaparas	2017	Knowledge and Information Systems	10.1007/s10115-017-1082-9	recommender system;data mining;probabilistic logic;computer science;special case	ML	-19.831823111561604	-48.95645680214408	174420

Especially, the WWW is widely used for various purposes such as sharing personal information, academic research, business work, and electronic commerce, and the amount of available information is increasing rapidly. We usually utilize information sources on the Internet as individual standalone sources, but, if we can integrate them, we can add more value to each of them. Hence, information mediators, which integrate information distributed on the Internet, draw attention. In this paper, under an assumption that information sources to be integrated are updated frequently and asynchronously, we propose an information gathering method that constructs an answer to a query from a user, accessing information sources to be integrated properly within an allowable time period. The proposed method considers the reliability of data in the cache and the quality of answer to do efficient access to information sources and to provide appropriate answers to the user. As evaluation, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method by using an artificial information integration problem, in which some parameters can be modified, and a real-world flight information service comparing with a conventional FIFO information gathering method.	cpu cache;e-commerce;fifo (computing and electronics);freedom of information laws by country;information retrieval;internet;personally identifiable information;www	Yasuhiko Kitamura;Tomoya Noda;Shoji Tatsumi	2002	Systems and Computers in Japan	10.1002/scj.10119	cognitive models of information retrieval;cache;computer science;electrical engineering;information mapping;artificial intelligence;information integration;operating system;information filtering system;machine learning;mediator;personal information management;management information systems;data mining;group information management;information processor;information quality;automated information system;world wide web;information retrieval;information system;algorithm	DB	-30.92966090173796	-51.382818728699064	174430

Presentation bias is one of the key challenges when learning from implicit feedback in search engines, as it confounds the relevance signal. While it was recently shown how counterfactual learning-to-rank (LTR) approaches citeJoachims/etal/17a can provably overcome presentation bias when observation propensities are known, it remains to show how to effectively estimate these propensities. In this paper, we propose the first method for producing consistent propensity estimates without manual relevance judgments, disruptive interventions, or restrictive relevance modeling assumptions. First, we show how to harvest a specific type of intervention data from historic feedback logs of multiple different ranking functions, and show that this data is sufficient for consistent propensity estimation in the position-based model. Second, we propose a new extremum estimator that makes effective use of this data. In an empirical evaluation, we find that the new estimator provides superior propensity estimates in two real-world systems -- Arxiv Full-text Search and Google Drive Search. Beyond these two points, we find that the method is robust to a wide range of settings in simulation studies.

However, the data generated by a group of people is duplicated. As to learn the crowd intention based on the crowd data, we need to do some entity resolution works. Previous works focus on data matching and merging, but remain far from perfect in crowdsourcing area. In our study, we propose a generic way in measuring and representing the crowd intention based on the crowd data. The main contribution of our study is twofold: 1. We propose a graph structure that represents the crowd intention. 2. We propose an entropy-based measurement that evaluates the diversity of the crowd intention.	crowdsourcing;entropy (information theory);online community	Yi Jiang;Wei Zhang;Haiyan Zhao	2015		10.1145/2875913.2875936	computer science;data science;data mining;internet privacy	AI	-20.428265308325923	-45.852853605022226	174586
61d345da5a81c7abd9e17e348ff97ca7e6fac073	understanding user requirements for music information services		User studies in the music information retrieval and music digital library fields have been gradually increasing in recent years, but large-scale studies that can help detect common user behaviors are still lacking. We have conducted a large-scale user survey in which we asked numerous questions related to users’ music needs, uses, seeking, and management behaviors. In this paper, we present our preliminary findings, specifically focusing on the responses to questions of users’ favorite music related websites/applications and the reasons why they like them. We provide a list of popular music services, as well as an analysis of how these services are used, and what qualities are valued. Our findings suggest several trends in the types of music services people like: an increase in the popularity of music streaming and mobile music consumption, the emergence of new functionality, such as music identification and cloud music services, an appreciation of music videos, serendipitous discovery of music, and customizability, as well as users’ changing expectations of particular types of music information.	acoustic fingerprint;bespoke;comparison of online music lockers;digital library;emergence;information retrieval;recommender system;requirement;streaming media;usability testing	Jin Ha Lee;Nichole Maiman Waterman	2012			multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-28.334868073704545	-46.31758462309268	174613

User analytics may be performed to mine a person's activities on different social systems and extract patterns, be it interest patterns, social patterns, or work patterns. Such patterns may benefit both the individuals and the organizations the users associated with, as the information is valuable in numerous tasks, including recommendation, evaluation, management, and so on. In this article, we present an actionable solution of user analytics, namely collaboration analytics, by focusing on mining a person's work patterns from her collaboration activities. Our solution effectively makes use of a user's heterogeneous data collected from various collaboration tools to derive an integrated description of the user's collaborative work. A number of ``work areas'', each of which contains its work topics and people involved, are generated for every user. The challenges we face include the clustering of items with short texts and prioritizing/weighting data items based on importance/relevance. Our solutions to those issues will be described in this article. In particular, we mine users' background information from various types of data and use such information to enrich the semantics of the short texts contained in the activity instances on collaboration tools before clustering those instances into work areas. Finally, we have developed a prototype of our collaboration analytics solution and evaluated it with real-world data and people.	cluster analysis;prototype;relevance;social system	Qihua Wang;Hongxia Jin;Yan Liu	2010		10.1145/1871437.1871748	closed-form expression;analytics;computer science;data science;machine learning;data mining;social system;database;cluster analysis;world wide web;information retrieval	HCI	-24.83576237362401	-50.9266375512052	174867

An alternative is to allow users to create folksonomies, collective social classifications. However, folksonomies lack structure and their use for searching and browsing is limited. Current approaches for acquiring latent hierarchical structures from folksonomies have had limited success. We explore whether asking users for tag pairs, rather than individual tags, can increase the quality of derived tag hierarchies. We measure the usability cost, and in particular cognitive effort required to create tag pairs rather than individual tags. Our results show that when applied to tag pairs a hierarchy creation algorithm (Heymann-Benz) has superior performance than when applied to individual tags, and with little impact on usability. However, the resulting hierarchies lack richness, and could be seen as less expressive than those derived from individual tags. This indicates that expressivity, not usability, is the limiting factor for collective tagging approaches aimed at crowdsourcing taxonomies.	algorithm;crowdsourcing;folksonomy;tag (metadata);tag cloud;taxonomy (general);usability;web content	Fahad Almoqhim;David E.

At the core of our research is a comparison between recommendations that are based on the user's familiarity network and his/her similarity network. We also examine the effect of adding explanations to each recommended item that show related people and their relationship to the user and to the item. Evaluation, based on an extensive user survey with 290 participants and a field study including 90 users, indicates superiority of the familiarity network as a basis for recommendations. In addition, an important instant effect of explanations is found - interest rate in recommended items increases when explanations are provided.	blog;bookmark (world wide web);field research;personalization;social network	Ido Guy;Naama Zwerdling;David Carmel;Inbal Ronen;Erel Uziel;Sivan Yogev;Shila Ofek-Koifman	2009		10.1145/1639714.1639725	computer science;multimedia;world wide web;social computing;recommender system;social network	HCI	-25.82610934663105	-48.47135158709769	175073
21dbe9bf89f5f8b93af7265f3860f79afb54d2e4	recommender systems and social networks: an application in cultural heritage		In the last decade Recommender Systems have become useful tools helping users to find “what they need” from considerable amount of data. One of the more obvious applications of such systems in the Cultural Heritage domain is to assist users when visiting cultural environments (such as museums, archaeological sites, old town centers and so on), providing a multimedia guide that is able to dynamically suggest relevant information available in multiple web repositories (e.g. multimedia sharing systems and on-line social networks). In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation approach that combines several aspects of users i.e. their preferences (usually in the shape of items’ metadata) and interactions within a social community modeled using hypergraphs together with items’ multimedia features and context information within a general framework that can support di↵erent applications (touristic guiding services for museums, visiting paths recommendation for old town centers and archeological sites, etc.). Preliminary experiments on user satisfaction show how our approach provides very promising and interesting results.	computer user satisfaction;experiment;interaction;online and offline;recommender system;social network	Vincenzo Moscato;Antonio Picariello;Giancarlo Sperlì;Flora Amato	2016		10.18293/DMS2016-001	computer science;recommender system;multimedia;social network;cultural heritage	ML	-29.963821705838505	-47.27371964017958	175135

So too do the ways people share ideas and opinions. In this paper we examine one such emerging form: the amateur critic. In particular, we examine genius.com, a website which allows its users to annotate and explain the meaning of segments of lyrics in music and other written works. We describe a novel dataset of approximately 700,000 users’ activity on genius.com, their social connections, and song annotation activity. The dataset encompasses over 120,000 songs, with more than 3 million unique annotations. Using this dataset, we model overlap in interest or expertise through the proxy of co-annotation. This is the basis for a complex network model of the activity on genius.com, which is then used for community detection. We introduce a new measure of network community activity: community skew. Through this analysis we draw a comparison of between co-annotation and notions of genre and categorisation in music. We show a new view on the social constructs of genre in music.	categorization;complex network;network model;proxy server;world wide web	Benjamin Fields;Christophe Rhodes	2016			speech recognition;multimedia;computer science	Web+IR	-21.00283200178053	-42.92129473679514	176768
52f570563b87b2ea7740209fe662ac512f5c5cd5	activity correlation spectroscopy: a novel method for inferring social relationships from activity data		Inferring social relationships among individuals is a difficult problem, typically requiring either intrusive measurements (e.g., surveys) or convenience samples (e.g., ties captured by online social networking systems). Automatically collected activity data from mobile devices or similar sources provide a promising alternative for inexpensive and unobtrusive detection of interpersonal relationships. Here, we introduce a new method—activity correlation spectroscopy—for inferring relationships by exploiting the spectral and distributional structure of activity correlation within dyads. Unlike existing techniques, our approach can be employed with minimal, individual-level (i.e., non-relational), and non-identifying data that are easily collected using commodity hardware. We demonstrate our methodology via an application to detection of friendship and group co-membership using mobile device and survey data from the MIT Reality Mining study (Eagle et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci 106:15274–15278, 2009).	activity recognition;adversary (cryptography);antivirus software;baseline (configuration management);bluetooth;commodity computing;dyadic transformation;electronic signature;fingerprint;mobile device;mobile phone;noise (electronics);personal digital assistant;social network;time series;traffic shaping;velocity (software development)	Xuhong Zhang;Carter T.

Even though the approach of using a web-of-trust scheme for assisting the recommendation production is well adopted, issues like the sparsity problem have not been explored adequately so far with regard to this. In this work we are proposing and testing a scheme that uses the existing ratings of users to calculate the hypothetical trust that might exist between them. The purpose is to demonstrate how some basic social networking when applied to an existing system can help in alleviating problems of traditional recommender system schemes. Interestingly, such schemes are also alleviating the cold start problem from which mainly new users are suffering. In order to show how good the system is in that respect, we measure the performance at various times as the system evolves and we also contrast the solution with existing approaches. Finally, we present the results which justify that such schemes undoubtedly work better than a system that makes no use of trust at all.	cold start;computer performance;recommender system;sparse matrix;web of trust	Georgios Pitsilis;Svein J.

75708e51d5d335c8e1fefae3475e9d82f0b8acc0	information flow reveals prediction limits in online social activity		Modern society depends on the flow of information over online social networks, and users of popular platforms generate substantial behavioural data about themselves and their social ties1–5. However, it remains unclear what fundamental limits exist when using these data to predict the activities and interests of individuals, and to what accuracy such predictions can be made using an individual’s social ties. Here, we show that 95% of the potential predictive accuracy for an individual is achievable using their social ties only, without requiring that individual’s data. We used information theoretic tools to estimate the predictive information in the writings of Twitter users, providing an upper bound on the available predictive information that holds for any predictive or machine learning methods. As few as 8–9 of an individual’s contacts are sufficient to obtain predictability compared with that of the individual alone. Distinct temporal and social effects are visible by measuring information flow along social ties, allowing us to better study the dynamics of online activity. Our results have distinct privacy implications: information is so strongly embedded in a social network that, in principle, one can profile an individual from their available social ties even when the individual forgoes the platform completely. An individual’s social ties contain up to 95% of the potential predictive accuracy achievable about that individual. In principle, a social platform may therefore profile an individual from their ties only, without access to their data.		James P.

Recommender systems, which use personalised information filtering techniques to generate a set of items suitable to a given user, have received considerable attention. Userand item-based algorithms are two popular techniques for the design of recommender systems. These two algorithms are known to have Cold-Start problems, i.e., they are unable to effectively handle Cold-Start users who have an extremely limited number of purchase records. In this paper, we develop TrustRank, a novel recommender system which handles the Cold-Start problem by leveraging the user-trust networks which are commonly available for e-commerce applications. A user-trust network is formed by friendships or trust relationships that users specify among them. While it is straightforward to conjecture that a user-trust network is helpful for improving the accuracy of recommendations, a key challenge for using user-trust network to facilitate Cold-Start users is that these users also tend to have a very limited number of trust relationships. To address this challenge, we propose a pre-processing propagation of the Cold-Start users’ trust network. In particular, by applying the personalised PageRank algorithm, we expand the friends of a given user to include others with similar purchase records to his/her original friends. To make this propagation algorithm scalable to a large amount of users, as required by real-world recommender systems, we devise an iterative computation algorithm of the original personalised TrustRank which can incrementally compute trust vectors for Cold-Start users. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the consistently improvement provided by our proposed algorithm over the existing recommender algorithms on the accuracy of recommendations for Cold-Start users.	algorithm;computation;e-commerce;experiment;information filtering system;iterative method;nl-complete;pagerank;preprocessor;recommender system;scalability;software propagation;trustrank;world wide web	Haitao Zou;Zhiguo Gong;Nan Zhang;Wei Zhao;Jingzhi Guo	2015	Enterprise IS	10.1080/17517575.2013.804587	cold start;computer science;marketing;data mining;database;internet privacy;trustworthy computing;world wide web;recommender system	Web+IR	-21.07100088799224	-48.309131327777806	178666

Most works consider influence from overall friends simultaneously when recommending, and to each item the same friend always has equal influence. However, existing models fail to be consistent with real life recommendations, because in real life only a part of friends can affect our decisions, and we couldn't be influenced by the same friends on everything. So in this paper, we use machine learning way to infer truly influential friends in a mixed friends circle. And to different items we use relevance to differentiate the same friend's influence. A model, Topic-based Friends Refining Probabilistic Matrix Factorization TFR-PMF, is proposed to check the performance of our theory. Through experiments on public data set, we domenstrate that our method can increase the accuracy of recommendation by 6.5i¾?%, comparing with models that do not filter unrelated friends' influence.	recommender system	Haitao Zhai;Jing Li	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-26832-3_47	psychology;data mining;advertising;world wide web	AI	-19.943735788084602	-46.505568070456114	178750

It also has a smaller computational cost. Experimental results with public data sets are provided to show that the proposed adapted factorization approach gives better predicted ratings than a widely used sVD-based approach. KEy worDs AnD phrAsEs: Factorization technique, recommender systems, singular value decomposition. Since the amount of information available on the World Wide Web increases constantly, sometimes it becomes difficult to focus on interesting information and discard redundant content. For this reason, there is a high demand for methods that select interesting information with respect to users’ preferences. Recommender systems target this demand by helping users to find items, using previous knowledge about the user’s preferences. Users give ratings only to some of the items and therefore the system is able to predict their preferences on the rest of items (this is known as prediction task). The system can also recommend products according to the user’s preferences (recommen‐ dation task). These two powerful tools are widely used on e-commerce sites. Since their introduction in the 1990s, recommender systems have been used to filter information on the Web and to provide recommendations for books, CDs, movies, news, electronics, financial services, travel, and other products. One of the most popular recommender systems is the one at www.amazon. com. The customer rates some books and the system suggests other books, considering information from other customers. A different recommender system is used at www.everyonesacritic.net, where users give their opinion about movies and the system makes recommendations for people who share similar tastes. Another example (www.gnomoradio.org) consists of a music recommender system, where the user rates the music, and the system builds a This work was supported by the government of Spain under projects TRA200762526/AUT and DPI2007-66556-C03-03, and research program Consolider-Ingenio 2010: MIPRCV (CSD2007-00018).

Thus, in most cases, the main goal of a recommender system is to discover the customer’s preferred products in order to increase sales. This also helps customer, because they will only receive information filtered according to their individual taste. Recommender systems store data in a large table of users (also denoted as customers) and items (or products). Hence, the information is stored into a matrix of data, whose rows and columns correspond to each user and item respectively, and whose entries correspond to the ratings customers give to items. In real problems, the number of customers and items is huge, so it is necessary to deal with large data matrices. Since each user only rates a subset of the items, most entries in the matrix of ratings are empty, which means that the matrix tends to be very sparse.	algorithmic efficiency;book;coefficient;collaborative filtering;column (database);computation;e-commerce;information privacy;low-rank approximation;missing data;movielens;recommender system;singular value decomposition;sparse matrix;test data;the matrix;verification and validation;world wide web	Carme Julià;Angel Domingo Sappa;Felipe Lumbreras;Joan Serrat;Antonio M.

021cfa339b5abc2d8c8802602f35be780eba50d0	leveraging user intuition to predict item popularity in social networks		We investigate the problem of early prediction of item popularity in online social networks. Prior work claims that the time taken by each item to reach i adopters (i being a small number around 5) has a higher predictive power than other non-temporal features, such as those related to the characteristics of the adopters. Here, we challenge this claim by proposing a new feature, based on the users’ intuitions, which is shown to provide significantly better predictive power for the most popular items than the above-mentioned temporal feature. A GoodReads dataset is used to illustrate the merits of the proposed method.	social network	Nada Sbihi;Ihsane Gryech;Mounir Ghogho	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-68179-5_5	data mining;social network;small number;popularity;web content;predictive power;knowledge management;psychology;intuition	ECom	-19.789397247619842	-47.009885625598514	178977

Nowadays, there have been many literatures on the category of reviews category or ranking for public. However, they only satisfy common preferences, and ignore personalised preferences of individual users. In view of this phenomenon, this paper is trying to put forward a ranking method for individual preferences. It begins with collecting the rules of user preferences by showing reviews to them to let them mark the reviews they like. Then it combines the common rules with user personalised rules to get the range of features. Finally, after calculating the optimal solution of features, the paper strives to structure a ranking model to rank reviews with the set of optimal solution.

A user’s next choice heavily depends on the user’s long-term preference and recent actions. However, existing methods either (1) ignore the long-term personalized preference or the recent sequential actions of users, or (2) can’t update the model in time when receiving users’ new action information. To solve these problems, we propose an online personalized next-item recommendation method via long short term preference learning. The proposed method integrates the information of users’ long-term personalized preference and short-term sequential actions to predict the next choices. The trained model could be updated online via an extra preference transition matrix. Experimental results on our real-world datasets show that the proposed method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.	long short-term memory;preference learning	Yingpeng Du;Hongzhi Liu;Yuanhang Qu;Zhonghai Wu	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-97304-3_70	machine learning;collaborative filtering;computer science;next choice;artificial intelligence;preference learning	NLP	-19.319607436516442	-48.32036483921072	179925
9ce3d7e84ad4def3354487294b3030e474f185cc	active tweet recommendation based on user interest profiles		The rapid growth of Twitter has made it one of the most popular information sources of current affairs. Twitter users gather information about their topics of interest through their followees’ posts or by searching for relevant posts. However, users are often overwhelmed by the large number of tweets which makes it difficult for them to find relevant and non-redundant information about their interests. Information filtering and recommender systems can help users by suggesting informative tweets based on their interests. Considering the wide variety of topics in users’ interest profiles and the sheer volume of tweets being published daily, it is difficult to have adequate and proper labeled data to train these systems on. We aim to tackle this problem by integrating active learning techniques into tweet recommendation, more specifically for finding relevant tweets and ranking them. Using active learning methods in the context of Twitter recommenders has not been well explored before. Our objective is to exploit these methods for improving the accuracy of tweet recommenders the most, while keeping the cost of labeling to a minimum.	active learning (machine learning);information filtering system;recommender system	Raheleh Makki	2016			information retrieval;multimedia;computer science	Web+IR	-23.634904830412644	-50.172425957096046	180033

In light of frequent access patterns, we develop a solution procedure to automatically extract user interests. Furthermore, in accordance with user interests mined and feedbacks of users, we propose a new algorithm with the idea of dynamically adjusting the ranking scores of Web pages. Specifically, algorithm PPR (standing for personalized PageRank), is divided into four phases. The first phase assigns the initial weights based on user interests. In the second phase, the virtual links and hubs are created according to user interests. By observing user click streams, our proposed algorithm will incrementally reflect user favors for the personalized ranking in the third phase. To improve the accuracy of ranking, collaborative filtering is taken into consideration when the new query is submitted. By conducting simulation experiments, we have shown that algorithm PPR is not only very effective but also very adaptive in providing personalized ranking to users	algorithm;client-side;collaborative filtering;data mining;e-commerce;e-services;experiment;feedback;mined;pagerank;personalization;portland pattern repository;simulation;user (computing);web page;web search engine	Wen-Chih Peng;Yu-Chin Lin	2006	The 8th IEEE International Conference on E-Commerce Technology and The 3rd IEEE International Conference on Enterprise Computing, E-Commerce, and E-Services (CEC/EEE'06)	10.1109/CEC-EEE.2006.72	filter;web mining;computer science;collaborative filtering;machine learning;web page;data mining;personalization;feedback;cluster analysis;world wide web;information retrieval;collaboration	DB	-29.56556506363896	-50.72262394888285	180102

In the scientific community, the microblogging site is known for openness in sharing its data. It provides a glance into its millions of users and billions of tweets through a “Streaming API” which provides a sample of all tweets matching some parameters preset by the API user. The API service has been used by many researchers, companies, and governmental institutions that want to extract knowledge in accordance with a diverse array of questions pertaining to social media. The essential drawback of the Twitter API is the lack of documentation concerning what and how much data users get. This leads researchers to question whether the sampled data is a valid representation of the overall activity on Twitter. In this work we embark on answering this question by comparing data collected using Twitter’s sampled API service with data collected using the full, albeit costly, Firehose stream that includes every single published tweet. We compare both datasets using common statistical metrics as well as metrics that allow us to compare topics, networks, and locations of tweets. The results of our work will help researchers and practitioners understand the implications of using the Streaming API.	application programming interface;documentation;openness;social media;streaming algorithm;streaming media;web api	Fred Morstatter;Jürgen Pfeffer;Huan Liu;Kathleen M.

Due to the popularity of intelligent mobile devices, a large number of photos and videos are recorded during a trip. Therefore, the ability to vividly and interestingly display these media data is a useful technique. In this paper, we propose SnapVideo, a new method that intelligently converts a personal album describing of a trip into a comprehensive, aesthetically pleasing, and coherent video clip. The proposed framework contains three main components. The scenic spot identification model first personalizes the video clips based on multiple prespecified audience classes. We then search for some auxiliary related videos from YouTube1 according to the selected photos. To comprehensively describe a scenery, the view generation module clusters the crawled video frames into a number of views. Finally, a probabilistic model is developed to fit the frames from multiple views into an aesthetically pleasing and coherent video clip, which optimally captures the semantics of a sightseeing trip. Extensive user studies demonstrated the competitiveness of our method from an aesthetic point of view. Moreover, quantitative analysis reflects that semantically important spots are well preserved in the final video clip.1https://www.youtube.com/	biologic preservation;class;cluster analysis;coherence (physics);computer vision;exanthema;experience;experiment;frame (physical object);key frame;mobile device;multimedia;numerical analysis;statistical model;usability testing;video clip;statistical cluster;videocassette	Luming Zhang;Peiguang Jing;Yuting Su;Chao Zhang;Ling Shaoz	2017	IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics	10.1109/TCYB.2016.2585764	clips;video tracking;feature extraction;tourism;probabilistic logic;mobile device;popularity;multimedia;computer science	Vision	-29.7025325487257	-45.19625625111219	180193

Rather than downloading all accessible Web pages, a topical crawler analyzes the frontier of the crawled region to visit only the portion of the Web that contains relevant Web pages, and at the same time, try to skip irrelevant regions. This leads to significant savings in both computation and communication resources. In this paper, we present an integrated topical crawler: AuToCrawler. The main features of AuToCrawler consist of a user interest specification module that mediates between users and search engines to identify target examples and keywords that together specify the topic of their interest, and a URL ordering strategy that combines features of several previous approaches and achieves significant improvement. It also provides a graphic user interface such that users can evaluate and visualize the crawling results that can be used as feedback to reconfigure the crawler.	adobe animate;adobe flash;breadth-first search;computation;database;download;embedded system;focused crawler;graph bandwidth;graphical user interface;html;information retrieval;java applet;javascript;relevance;vbscript;web crawler;web page;web search engine;world wide web	Jyh-Jong Tsay;Chen-Yang Shih;Bo-Liang Wu	2005	Fourth Annual ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS'05)	10.1109/ICIS.2005.33	computer science;web crawler;database;focused crawler;world wide web;information retrieval;web server;page hijacking	DB	-31.500309973117982	-52.04619758734694	180675

In this paper we provide an in-depth analysis of the question labelling practices by contrasting the use of community generated tags in the Live QnA service with the use of topic categories from a fixed taxonomy in the Yahoo! Answers service. We found that community tagging is related to higher levels of social interactions amongst users. Analysis of the most frequently used community tags reveals that active users may establish strong social ties around specific tags. Furthermore, the discriminative value of individual community tags can be low since the corresponding questions may cover a variety of topics. Thus, appropriate care needs to be taken when designing search, browsing, and recommender features for question discovery.	folksonomy;interaction;msn qna;question answering;recommender system;value (computer science)	Eduarda Mendes Rodrigues;Natasa Milic-Frayling;Blaz Fortuna	2008	2008 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology	10.1109/WIIAT.2008.138	question;labeling theory;interpersonal ties;social network analysis;question answering;computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval;taxonomy;collaboration	HCI	-27.10706412888681	-48.438661563663594	180711

However, the question of defining the appropriate scope of a crowd to tackle each scenario is still open. In this work we compare two approaches to define the scope of a crowd in a classification problem, casted as a recommendation system. We propose a similarity measure to determine the closeness of a specific user to each crowd contributor and hence to define the appropriate crowd scope. We compare different levels of customization using crowd-based information, allowing non-experts classification by crowds to be tuned to substitute the user profile definition. Results on a real recommendation data set show the potential of making crowds more personal, i.e. of tuning the crowd to the crowd target.	centrality;crowdsourcing;recommender system;relevance;similarity measure;user profile	Joana Cósta;Catarina Cruz Silva;Bernardete Ribeiro;Mário Antunes	2013	2013 8th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation and Personalization	10.1109/SMAP.2013.20	computer science;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web	AI	-24.284317446162657	-49.28515771831489	180887

With their powerful built-in cameras and sensors, they are intensively used as devices for capturing multimedia content. However, at the same time, the support of these mobile devices for searching within multimedia collections is still quite limited. These limitations are particularly obvious in the search paradigm(s) that are usually supported on mobile devices which mainly consist of traditional keyword search, if, at all, they might at most also support query-by-example content-based queries. In this paper, we present City-Stories, a powerful application that helps users to capture multimedia content and that in particular provides a rich set of different search paradigms. The search paradigms of City-Stories include temporal search (when a photo was taken), spatial search (where a photo was taken), and content-based similarity. For the latter, query-by-example (QbE) and query-by-sketch (QbS) are available. All these search paradigms can be freely mixed, either simultaneously (e.g., search for spatial and content similarity), or sequentially (e.g., to refine the query results obtained from one query mode with another one). In this paper, we introduce the City-Stories system and present the results of an evaluation which shows the gain in effectiveness when combining different search paradigms on a mobile device in comparison to using these paradigms individually.	auto-tune;canonical account;crowdsourcing;mobile device;query by example;seamless3d;search algorithm;sensor;usability testing;user interface	Lukas Beck;Heiko Schuldt	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM)	10.1109/ISM.2016.0046	mobile search;computer science;database;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval	Mobile	-30.051697258565333	-45.87896205440421	181023

As making friends with other members is a common way to establish social relationships and people need to decide whom they should trust when making friends, friend recommendation has received considerable attention in virtual communities. Towards this goal, we first formulate hypotheses on factors that influence trust and the probability of establishing friendships from various interaction attributes in virtual communities. Through experiments on real interaction and friendship data, we validate the proposed hypotheses and propose a novel interaction ranking-based trustworthy friend recommendation model called IntRank for recommending trustworthy friends to community members. Different from traditional friend recommendation mechanisms, IntRank is built on the foundation of carefully verified interaction attributes that influence trust and friendship probability in virtual communities. It is able to effectively recommend trustworthy friends as confirmed by the performance evaluation results.	blog;experiment;f1 score;foremost;interaction;list of code lyoko episodes;logistic regression;performance evaluation;slashdot;social network;trust (emotion);trustworthy computing;virtual community	Lizi Zhang;Hui Fang;Wee Keong Ng;Jie Zhang	2011	2011IEEE 10th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2011.36	public relations;political science;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-20.84235528403991	-45.73345914441366	181218

Such limitation comes from factors related to the difficulty of extensively experimenting with games with real robots, such as their inevitable wear and tear and their usual limited number. RoboCup real robot teams have therefore developed simulation environments to enable experimentation. However, in order to run complete games in such simulation environments, an automated referee is needed. In this paper, we present AutoRef, as a contribution towards a complete automated referee for the RoboCup Small-Size League (SSL). We have developed and used AutoRef in an SSL simulation to run full games to evaluate different strategies, as we illustrate and show results. AutoRef is designed as a finite-state machine that transitions between the states of the game being either on or required to stop. AutoRef purposefully only uses the same visual and game information provided in SSL games with physical robots, which it uses to compute the features needed by the rules and to make decisions to transition between its states. Due to this real input to AutoRef, we have partially applied it to games of the physical robots. As AutoRef does not include all the rules of the real SSL games, we currently view it as an aid to human referees of SSL games, and discuss the challenges in automating several specific SSL game rules. AutoRef could be extended to other RoboCup real soccer leagues if a combined view of the game field, ball, and players is available.	autonomous robot;categorization;experiment;finite-state machine;high- and low-level;simulation	Danny Z.

65f81d42bd3ff69443a4049f62b2579ba8512fd3	similarity-based matrix factorization for item cold-start in recommender systems		In recommender systems (RS) one of the most used approaches is collaborative filtering (CF), which recommends items according to the behavior of similar users. Among CF approaches, those based on matrix factorization are generally more effective because they allow the system to discover the underlying characteristics of interactions between users and items. However, this approach presents the cold-start problem, which occurs because of the systemu0027s inability to recommend new items and/or accurately predict new usersu0027 preferences. This paper proposes a novel matrix factorization approach, which incorporates similarity of items using their metadata, in order to improve the rating prediction task in an item cold-start scenario. For this purpose, we explore semantic descriptions of items which are gathered from knowledge bases available online. Our approach is evaluated in two different and publicly available datasets and compared against content-based and collaborative algorithms. The experiments show the effectiveness of our approach in the item cold-start scenario.		Eduardo Pereira Fressato;Arthur Fortes da Costa;Marcelo G.

An important application of sequential mining techniques is web usage mining, for mining web log accesses, where the sequences of web page accesses made by different web users over a period of time, through a server, are recorded. Web access pattern tree (WAP-tree) mining is a sequential pattern mining technique for web log access sequences, which first stores the original web access sequence database on a prefix tree, similar to the frequent pattern tree (FP-tree) for storing non-sequential data. WAP-tree algorithm then, mines the frequent sequences from the WAP-tree by recursively re-constructing intermediate trees, starting with suffix sequences and ending with prefix sequences. This paper proposes a more efficient approach for using the WAP-tree to mine frequent sequences, which totally eliminates the need to engage in numerous re-construction of intermediate WAP-trees during mining. The proposed algorithm builds the frequent header node links of the original WAP-tree in a pre-order fashion and uses the position code of each node to identify the ancestor/descendant relationships between nodes of the tree. It then, finds each frequent sequential pattern, through progressive prefix sequence search, starting with its first prefix subsequence event. Experiments show huge performance gain over the WAP-tree technique.	algorithm;blog;code;concurrency (computer science);data mining;experiment;internet access;linkage (software);list of algorithms;message queue;mined;recursion;sequence database;sequential pattern mining;server (computing);structure mining;suffix tree;synthetic intelligence;traverse;tree structure;trie;web mining;web page;world wide web	Christie I.

However, the current operation rules of the search engine make it very difficult for those inexperienced advertisers to make sound bids without the support of powerful tools. Therefore, many studies have been conducted to help advertisers understand such dynamic, infinite, and opaque auction situation, and obtain as good as possible bidding result. This paper, focusing on predicting the return on investment (ROI) of a keyword portfolio, develops a hierarchical Bayesian network (BN) model to forecast keyword auctions' performance. Few papers directly predict the ROI of a keyword portfolio. This approach effectively echoes advertisers' expectation for a keyword auction by choosing the right keywords and bids to achieve the desired outcome. The building blocks of the prediction model, such as bid and rank, are organized in a tree-shaped structure with a set of joint conditional probabilities. To infer the posterior probabilities of the predictors, a Bayesian parameter-learning algorithm is conducted after validating the network's structural relationships. The empirical study demonstrates that the prediction model is appropriate and effective for keyword auctions. Moreover, the proposed hierarchical BN model shows a higher accuracy than the popular prediction approach-the back-propagation artificial neural network.	algorithm;artificial neural network;backpropagation;bayesian network;experience;region of interest;search engine marketing;software propagation;web search engine	Liwen Hou	2015	IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management	10.1109/TEM.2015.2390772	prediction;computer science;data science;marketing;machine learning;data mining;predictive modelling;search engine;statistics	Web+IR	-19.76285944919704	-50.70004369391051	181615

We describe a method for plan recognition in a real-world domain involving large numbers of agents performing spatial maneuvers in concert under conditions of limited observability. These assumptions diier radically from those traditionally made in plan recognition and produce a problem which combines aspects of the elds of plan recognition, pattern recognition, and object tracking. We describe our initial solution which borrows and builds upon research from each of these areas, employing a pattern-directed approach to recognize individual movements and generalizing these to produce inferences of large-scale behavior.	pattern recognition	Mark Devaney;Ashwin Ram	1998			simulation;computer science;data mining	AI	-26.604965228223037	-39.83149779587524	181621
a22ae112556f32b06a4df743889fd9a66b14a39a	semantics-aware recommender systems exploiting linked open data and graph-based features		In this contribution we propose a hybrid recommendation framework based on classification algorithms such as Random Forests and Naive Bayes, which are fed with several heterogeneous groups of features. We split our features into two classes: classic features, as popularity-based, collaborative and content-based ones, and extended features gathered from the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud, as basic ones (i.e. genre of a movie or the writer of a book) and graph-based features calculated on the ground of the different topological characteristics of the tripartite representation connecting users, items and properties in the LOD cloud. In the experimental session we evaluate the effectiveness of our framework on varying of different groups of features, and results show that both LOD-based and graph-based features positively affect the overall performance of the algorithm, especially in highly sparse recommendation scenarios. Our approach also outperforms several state-of-the-art recommendation techniques, thus confirming the insights behind this research.

Many agents that share either the same culture or same language or same health profile could share valuable information found through their semantic search. Their interests in a common viewpoint have some similarities which could be used to shorten the learning curve and give good search results effectively. Each agent is representing a user with a specific culture, language and personal health profile. What an agent likes as culture is likely similar to a different agent with the same culture. The same thing applies with language and health profiles. For example, an agent with a diabetes profile could help another agent that has a similar health profile with its valuable findings. We introduce how multi-agents could team up to contribute to each other, learn from each other, and share valuable information with each other using collaborative profile ontology. We propose a cross-cultural, cross-language, health- and nutrition-based ontology profile that could be used as the basis for collaboration between different agents.	agent-based model;multi-agent system;personalization;semantic search	Ahmed Al-Nazer;Tarek Helmy	2012	2012 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology	10.1109/WI-IAT.2012.263	computer science;knowledge management;semantic web;ontology;data mining;multimedia;world wide web;cross-cultural	AI	-27.521475542336905	-48.735336536183425	181944

One of the most important approaches to support users in searching and navigating media collections is collaborative filtering. Recently, systems as flickr or last.fm have become popular. They allow users to not only rate but also tag items with arbitrary labels. Such systems replace the concept of a global common ontology, as envisioned by the Semantic Web, with a paradigm of heterogeneous, local ”folksonomies”. The problem of such tagging systems is, however, that resulting taggings carry only little semantics. In this paper, we present an extension to the tagging approach. We allow tags to be grouped into aspects. We show that introducing aspects does not only help the user to manage large numbers of tags, but also facilitates data mining in various ways. We exemplify our approach on Nemoz , a distributed media organizer based on tagging and distributed data mining.	collaborative filtering;data mining;exemplification;flickr;folksonomy;image organizer;last.fm;programming paradigm;semantic web	Oliver Flasch;Andreas Kaspari;Katharina Morik;Michael Wurst	2006		10.1007/978-3-540-74951-6_7	project;computer science;collaborative filtering;semantic web;data mining;database;world wide web;information retrieval;social network	Web+IR	-27.451329603576628	-50.332073475669354	182153

Using the business review data from Yelp, in this paper, we study business rating prediction. A business here can be a restaurant, a shopping mall or other kind of businesses. Different from most other types of items that have been studied in various recommender systems (e.g., movie, song, book), a business physically exists at a geographical location, and most businesses have geographical neighbors within walking distance. When a user visits a business, there is a good chance that she walks by its neighbors. Through data analysis, we observe that there exists weak positive correlation between a business's ratings and its neighbors' ratings, regardless of the categories of businesses. Based on this observation, we assume that a user's rating to a business is determined by both the intrinsic characteristics of the business and the extrinsic characteristics of its geographical neighbors. Using the widely adopted latent factor model for rating prediction, in our proposed solution, we use two kinds of latent factors to model a business: one for its intrinsic characteristics and the other for its extrinsic characteristics. The latter encodes the neighborhood influence of this business to its geographical neighbors. In our experiments, we show that by incorporating geographical neighborhood influences, much lower prediction error is achieved than the state-of-the-art models including Biased MF, SVD++, and Social MF. The prediction error is further reduced by incorporating influences from business category and review content.	experiment;latent variable;location (geography);moore neighborhood;recommender system	Longke Hu;Aixin Sun;Yong Liu	2014		10.1145/2600428.2609593	data mining;matrix decomposition;world wide web	Web+IR	-19.801127639801024	-46.03763127098991	182172

This relevant information could include a wide range of heterogeneous content. Many existing context-aware systems determine this information based on pre-defined ontologies or rules. In addition, they rely on users’ context history to filter it. Moreover, they often provide domain-specific information. Such systems are not applicable to a large and varied set of user situations and information needs, and may suffer from cold start for new users. In this paper, we address these limitations and propose a novel, general and flexible approach for bootstrapped discovery and ranking of heterogeneous relevant services and information in context-aware systems. We design and implement four variations of a base algorithm that ranks candidate relevant services, and the information to be retrieved from them, based on the semantic relatedness between the information provided by the services and the user’s situation description. We conduct a live deployment with 14 subjects to evaluate the efficacy of our algorithms. We demonstrate that they have strong positive correlation with human supplied relevance rankings and can be used as an effective means to discover and rank relevant services and information. We also show that our approach is applicable to a wide set of users’ situations and to new users without requiring any user interaction history.	algorithm;cold start;context-aware pervasive systems;domain-specific language;information needs;knowledge discovery metamodel;ontology (information science);relevance;semantic similarity;software deployment	Preeti Bhargava;James Lampton;Ashok K.

Inspired by this point, we fuse verbal language and pointing gesture information to enable a robot to execute a vague task, such as “bring me the book”. In this paper, we propose a system integrating human-robot dialogue, mapping and action execution planning in unknown 3D environments. We consider grounding natural language commands to a sequence of low-level instructions that can be executed by the robot. To express the targets location which is pointed to by the user in a global fixed frame, we use a SLAM approach to build the environment map. Experimental results demonstrate that a humanoid robot NAO can acquire the skill based on our proposed approach in unknown environment.	comefrom;color;experiment;gesture recognition;high- and low-level;high-level programming language;humanoid robot;language model;nao (robot);natural language user interface;parsing;reflection mapping;simultaneous localization and mapping;task analysis;vagueness	Peiqing Yan;Bingwei He;Liwei Zhang;Jianwei Zhang	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2016.7866609	computer vision;simulation;visualization;computer science;artificial intelligence;social robot;natural language;robot kinematics	Robotics	-33.66190418423085	-41.1932884374525	182299

Furthermore, it presents the complete method for the construction of such directories by using web usage data. User community models take the form of thematic hierarchies and are constructed by employing clustering approach. We applied our methodology to the ODP directory and also to an artificial Web directory, which was generated by clustering Web pages that appear in the access log of an Internet Service Provider. For the discovery of the community models, we introduced a new criterion that combines a priori thematic informativeness of the Web directory categories with the level of interest observed in the usage data. In this context, we introduced and evaluated new clustering method. We have tested the methodology using access log files which are collected from the proxy servers of an Internet Service Provider and provided results that indicates the usability of the community Web directories. The proposed clustering methodology is evaluated both on a specialized artificial and a community Web directory, indicating its value to the user of the web.	cluster analysis;data logger;directory (computing);proxy server;rm-odp;usability;usage data;web page;world wide web	Ramancha Sandhyarani;Bodakuntla Rajkumar;Jayadev Gyani	2012	CoRR	10.5121/acij.2012.3205	web service;web application security;lightweight directory access protocol;static web page;web development;web modeling;directory service;data web;web analytics;web mapping;web design;web standards;computer science;web navigation;social semantic web;web page;data mining;database;web 2.0;world wide web;organizational unit;webserver directory index	Web+IR	-29.609360569113168	-50.78448667424609	182713

Conventional wisdom holds that data gloves need calibration in order to obtain accurate results. However, calibration is a time-consuming process, inherently user-specific, and its results are often not perfect. In contrast, the present study aims at evaluating recognition methods that do not require prior calibration of the data glove, by using raw sensor readings as input features and mapping them directly to different categories of hand shapes. An experiment was carried out, where test persons wearing a data glove had to grasp physical objects of different shapes corresponding to the various grasp types of the Schlesinger taxonomy. The collected data was analyzed with 28 classifiers including different types of neural networks, decision trees, Bayes nets, and lazy learners. Each classifier was analyzed in six different settings, representing various application scenarios with differing generalization demands. The results of this work are twofold: (1) We show that a reasonably well to highly reliable recognition of grasp types can be achieved - depending on whether or not the glove user is among those training the classifier - even with uncalibrated data gloves. (2) We identify the best performing classification methods for recognition of various grasp types. To conclude, cumbersome calibration processes before productive usage of data gloves can be spared in many situations.	algorithm;artificial neural network;bayesian network;comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;confusion matrix;data mining;decision tree;experiment;lazy evaluation;lazy learning;linnaean taxonomy;mathematical optimization;memory-level parallelism;multilayer perceptron;out of the box (feature);statistical classification;wired glove	Guido Heumer;Heni Ben Amor;Matthias Weber;Bernhard Jung	2007	2007 IEEE Virtual Reality Conference	10.1109/VR.2007.352459	computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;decision tree;artificial neural network;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-30.306184361690693	-38.47597961993431	182761

However, when huge article streams are delivered from the SNS, it is not easy to browse them efficiently because users would sometimes skip valuable articles. In this paper, we propose a method to recommend an unread article in order to achieve efficient browsing. Our method estimates the preference of a user on a delivered article based on the browsing behavior of the user, and predicts the preference of each unread article based on the collaborative filtering approach. Our system estimates the value of each unread article for the target user based on the behaviors of users who might be highly similar to the target user's behavior of reading articles, and utilizes the estimation results for composing unread articles into a stream in an appropriate order to realize efficient browsing.	browsing;collaborative filtering	Hong Yan;Taketoshi Ushiama	2014		10.1016/j.procs.2014.08.263	computer science;data mining;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-24.287165954622456	-47.84561935207275	182876

Moreover, the concept of gameplay itself is difficult to define and quantify. In this paper, we show that analyzing players' controller inputs using probabilistic topic models allows game developers to describe the types of gameplay -- or action -- in games in a quantitative way. More specifically, developers can discover the types of action that a game fosters and the extent that each game level fosters each type of action, all in an unsupervised manner. They can use this information to verify that their levels feature the appropriate style of gameplay and to recommend levels with gameplay that is similar to levels that players like. We begin with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), the simplest topic model, then develop the player-gameplay action (PGA) model to make the same types of discoveries about gameplay in a way that is independent of each player's play style. We train a player recognition system on the PGA model's output to verify that its discoveries about gameplay are in fact independent of each player's play style. The system recognizes players with over 90% accuracy in about 20 seconds of playtime.	latent dirichlet allocation;point and click;super mario rpg;topic model;unsupervised learning;video game developer	Brian A.

The structure of such networks impacts the information fusion within the organisation. Taking into account the influence of such network structures in predictive modeling will be beneficial for the quality of organisational strategic planning. Network mining methods (the social network analysis of large heterogeneous data sets) can extract information about the structure of such networks and the strategic positioning of each individual from various interaction data. We propose to integrate the output of network mining into the predictive modeling cycle in order to depict these influences. This paper demonstrates such approach by incorporating network centrality measures of actor closeness and actor betweeness in CART predictive modeling cycle. It presents a proof-of-concept application of this integrated approach to the case study of a contemporary university, which resembles some similarity with corporate organisations. The study utilises a data set about academic research activities collected over five years. The results of the study support the hypothesis that information about the network structures in a data set (whose impact is included through the centrality measures) can improve the accuracy of predictive analysis.	actor model;blog;centrality;data pre-processing;folksonomy;google analytics;interaction;online and offline;predictive modelling;preprocessor;social network analysis;test data;wiki	Ekta Nankani;Simeon J.

One aspect of user behavior that provides especially strong signals for delivering better relevance is an individual's history of queries and clicked documents. Previous studies have explored how short-term behavior or long-term behavior can be predictive of relevance. Ours is the first study to assess how short-term (session) behavior and long-term (historic) behavior interact, and how each may be used in isolation or in combination to optimally contribute to gains in relevance through search personalization. Our key findings include: historic behavior provides substantial benefits at the start of a search session; short-term session behavior contributes the majority of gains in an extended search session; and the combination of session and historic behavior out-performs using either alone. We also characterize how the relative contribution of each model changes throughout the duration of a session. Our findings have implications for the design of search systems that leverage user behavior to personalize the search experience.	document;personalization;relevance;session (web analytics)	Paul N.

a4e93a5cc29bd29737c0746e3312e7596e210444	hicaps: hierarchical contextual poi sequence recommender		The Point-of-Interest (POI) preference of a user varies by locality, item type, and the co-visitors, e.g., user1 and user2 can have closest preference on food items but not on historic sites, etc. A locality can have different preference trends (e.g., popular for food, recreation, etc.) and a user's preference can span across multiple such trends. A good recommender should also exploit the aggregated locality preference trends. Most of the existing studies group items by category or global user preferences which might not be relevant for locality-based aggregated preferences. We propose HiCaPS (<u>Hi</u>erarchical <u>C</u>ontextual <u>P</u>OI <u>S</u>equence Recommender) that formulates user preferences as hierarchical structure and presents a hierarchy aggregation technique for POI recommendation. The top level of locality hierarchy contains preferred k items from a set of users and the subsequent levels contain preference wise subsets. The core contributions of this paper are: (i) it formulates user preferences as a preference hierarchy, presents a technique to aggregate preference hierarchies of a similar users, and models the target users' preference in terms of aggregated trend in a locality, (ii) it contextually exploits the aggregated trend to generate personalized POI sequences, and (iii) it extensively evaluates the proposed model with two real-world datasets and demonstrates performance gain (0.03 - 0.28 on pair F-score, 0.006 - 5.91 on diversity, 0.0349 - 17.51 on displacement, and 0.114 - 0.289 on NDCG) over baseline models.	aggregate data;baseline (configuration management);displacement mapping;locality of reference;personalization;point of interest;recommender system;user (computing)	Ramesh Baral;S.

Since different users have different patterns of preference, there is a problem when one user's preference is used to recommend another user's preference. A way of converting one user's preference pattern into another user's pattern is proposed. However, there are several problems with current methods: some methods take many users' patterns as a similar one, some rely on co-rated items data between user pairs which is hardly obtained, and some methods can't exactly convert a rating to a suitable one. This work proposes a new transpose function that can be utilized on any pair of users regardless of using co-rated items by applying latent model. The new transpose function is composed of an original value term and an adjustment term which transposes an original rating to an average of the target user's rating on the corresponding items. Moreover, for more accuracy, a distribution term and a confidence term are combined to the adjustment term. This new function provides better results than the current transpose function in terms of three evaluation metrics (MAE, F-measure, and coverage).	collaborative filtering;pattern formation;recommender system	Warat Chalermpornpong;Saranya Maneeroj;Atsuhiro Takasu	2013	2013 24th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications	10.1109/DEXA.2013.23	preference learning;computer science;collaborative filtering;machine learning;data mining;database;world wide web;recommender system	Web+IR	-21.643683936049857	-47.97324753361792	183441

In this paper, we study 20 Questions, an online interactive game where each question-response pair corresponds to a fact of the target entity, to acquire highly accurate knowledge effectively with nearly zero labor cost. Knowledge acquisition via 20 Questions predominantly presents two challenges to the intelligent agent playing games with human players. The first one is to seek enough information and identify the target entity with as few questions as possible, while the second one is to leverage the remaining questioning opportunities to acquire valuable knowledge effectively, both of which count on good questioning strategies. To address these challenges, we propose the Learning-to-Ask (LA) framework, within which the agent learns smart questioning strategies for information seeking and knowledge acquisition by means of deep reinforcement learning and generalized matrix factorization respectively. In addition, a Bayesian approach to represent knowledge is adopted to ensure robustness to noisy user responses. Simulating experiments on real data show that LA is able to equip the agent with effective questioning strategies, which result in high winning rates and rapid knowledge acquisition. Moreover, the questioning strategies for information seeking and knowledge acquisition boost the performance of each other, allowing the agent to start with a relatively small knowledge set and quickly improve its knowledge base in the absence of constant human supervision.	chinese room;deep learning;experiment;gramática de la lengua castellana;graphical modeling framework;information seeking;intelligent agent;knowledge acquisition;knowledge base;recommender system;reinforcement learning	Yihong Chen;Bei Chen;Xuguang Duan;Jian-Guang Lou;Yue Wang;Wenwu Zhu;Yong Cao	2018		10.1145/3219819.3220047	artificial intelligence;computer science;intelligent agent;leverage (finance);machine learning;data mining;robustness (computer science);reinforcement learning;knowledge acquisition;knowledge base;bayesian probability;information seeking	ML	-25.716275090960053	-40.928283492201125	183836
e73cf4592bd9f37208451266bc01eea971c46702	additional multi-touch attribution for online advertising		Multi-Touch Attribution studies the effects of various types of online advertisements on purchase conversions. It is a very important problem in computational advertising, as it allows marketers to assign credits for conversions to different advertising channels and optimize advertising campaigns. In this paper, we propose an additional multi-touch attribution model (AMTA) based on two obvious assumptions: (1) the effect of an ad exposure is fading with time and (2) the effects of ad exposures on the browsing path of a user are additive. AMTA borrows the techniques from survival analysis and uses the hazard rate to measure the influence of an ad exposure. In addition, we both take the conversion time and the intrinsic conversion rate of users into consideration to generate the probability of a conversion. Experimental results on a large real-world advertising dataset illustrate that the our proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art techniques in conversion rate prediction and the credit allocation based on AMTA is reasonable.	conversion marketing;lambda calculus;multi-touch;online advertising;type conversion;utility functions on indivisible goods	Wendi Ji;Xiaoling Wang	2017			computer science;online advertising;multimedia;artificial intelligence;machine learning;multi-touch;attribution	Security	-24.78684144861896	-44.46902797175635	183839
110b6fa7839fde784ad5f4bd2a15502dffb1c4ab	pub: product recommendation with users' buying intents on microblogs		Recommendation systems mostly rely on users’ purchase records. However, they may suffer problems like “cold-start” because of the lack of users’ profiles and products’ demographic information. In this paper, we develop a method called PUB, which detects users’ buying intents from their own tweets, considers their needs, and extracts their demographic information from their public profiles. We then recommend products for users by constructing a heterogeneous information network including users, products, and attributes of both. In particular, we consider users’ shopping psychology, and recommend products that better meet their needs. We conduct extensive experiments on both direct intent recommendation and additional product recommendation. We also figure out users’ potential preference which can help to recommend a great varied types of products.	association rule learning	Xiaoxuan Ren;Tianshu Lyu;Yan Zhang	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-02922-7_21	recommender system;data mining;computer science;microblogging;product (business);social media	ML	-22.320635604448846	-50.78397877621366	183859

In this paper, we explore a computational method of inferring user interest in Facebook by combining the degree of familiarity and topic similarity with social neighbors based on social correlation phenomenon. By conducting a question-naire survey, we demonstrate that our proposed method increases the accuracy of inference by 12.4% compared to existing methods which do not consider the latent topic structure implied in social contents.	personalization;social network;ubiquitous computing;world wide web	Dabi Ahn;Taehun Kim;Soon J.

a106fcf8e2373985aca79add6e349935afc7a565	personalized recommendation algorithm for social networks based on comprehensive trust	personalized recommendation;collaborative filtering;trust relation;social network;preference prediction	Recommendation algorithms are an important aspect of social networks. In this paper, a model called Comprehensive Evaluation Trust (CETrust) is proposed for use in a recommendation algorithm that provides personalized recommendations based on trust in social networks. The model comprehensively considers factors such as direct and indirect trust among users, a mechanism for trust propagation and user similarity. CETrust integrates trust relationships and user similarities into the factorization of a probability matrix. This model also analyzes latent factors between the preferences of the selected trust users and those of the target user. The results of the experiments demonstrate the clear advantages of CETrust. These advantages indicate that CETrust has stronger potential to improve user satisfaction than other matrix factorization algorithms and trust-based personalized recommendation methods. CETrusts’s feasibility and effectiveness were empirically verified on two actual datasets. Its prediction accuracy was also shown to be higher than that of existing recommendation algorithms.	algorithm;collaborative filtering;distrust;experiment;latent variable;personalization;privacy;recommender system;social network;software propagation;stochastic matrix	Zhijun Zhang;Gongwen Xu;Pengfei Zhang;Yongkang Wang	2017	Applied Intelligence	10.1007/s10489-017-0928-x	collaborative filtering;computer science;data mining;social network	Web+IR	-20.256288085055825	-46.79316094562503	184128

We exploit social graphs to enrich the tags associated to the concerned persons in the photo by following the different links between people (i.e. viewer and captured people in the photos). The main contributions of our work are: (i) addition of a more meaningful tagging layer for photos, making tags dynamic and auto-adaptable thanks to the automatic identification of the social context of the visualization. (ii) Due to this dynamics, the search in the social graphs is optimized using a data mining technique. (iii) We propose a new visualization metaphor for the tagging layer to manage users' feedback. We also describe a system architecture and an experimental study that shows significant improvements of the tagging process and execution times on a dataset containing triples in a FOAF graph.	automatic identification and data capture;data mining;experiment;foaf (ontology);interaction;interface metaphor;java annotation;mathematical optimization;natural deduction;performance;search algorithm;search engine optimization;situated cognition;social media;social network;systems architecture;vocabulary	Sonia Lajmi;Johann Stan;Hakim Hacid;Elöd Egyed-Zsigmond;Pierre Maret	2009	2009 International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering	10.1109/CSE.2009.106	computer science;graph theory;data mining;database;world wide web;information retrieval;social network	AI	-26.447238241612222	-51.5015751899374	184176

In this paper, to detect whether a suspicious Unicode character in a word is visual spoofing or not, the context of the suspicious character is utilized by employing a Bayesian framework. Specifically, two contexts are taken into consideration: simple context and general context. Simple context of a suspicious character is the word where the character exists while general context consists of all homoglyphs of the character within Universal Character Set (UCS). Three decision rules are designed and used jointly for convicting a suspicious character. Preliminary evaluations and user study show that the proposed approach can detect Unicode-based visual spoofing with high effectiveness and efficiency.	internet security;maximal set;plug-in (computing);programmer;prototype;spoofing attack;unicode;usability testing;web page	Bite Qiu;Ning Fang;Wenyin Liu	2010	2010 20th International Conference on Pattern Recognition	10.1109/ICPR.2010.480	computer science;data mining;decision rule;semantics;internet privacy;world wide web;statistics	Vision	-32.5830887398993	-45.31084516283292	184294

Since no single method may work in every situation, several methods need to be combined. However, there are several cases when autonomous recognition methods fail. We propose an interactive recognition method in these cases. To develop a natural human robot interaction (HRI), it is necessary that the robot should unambiguously perceive the description of an object given by human. This paper reports on our experiment in which we examined the expressions humans use in describing ordinary objects. The results show that humans typically describe objects using one of multiple colors. The color is usually either that of the object background or that of the largest object portion. Based on these results, we describe our development of a robot vision system that can recognize objects when a user adopts simple expressions to describe the objects. This research suggests the importance of connecting dasiasymbolic expressionspsila with the dasiareal worldpsila in human-robot interaction.	autonomous robot;color;experiment;human–robot interaction;outline of object recognition;service robot	Al Mansur;Katsutoshi Sakata;Tajin Rukhsana;Yoshinori Kobayashi;Yoshinori Kuno	2008	RO-MAN 2008 - The 17th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication	10.1109/ROMAN.2008.4600740	human–robot interaction;robot;mobile robot;computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;social robot;cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition;robot control;3d single-object recognition;mobile robot navigation;s-expression;personal robot	Robotics	-33.29766986336055	-41.83301225514498	184345

1897e4ffc0773559f3f0f2885ea0438c96f9acbd	improving the quality of recommendations for users and items in the tail of distribution		Short-head and long-tail distributed data are widely observed in the real world. The same is true of recommender systems (RSs), where a small number of popular items dominate the choices and feedback data while the rest only account for a small amount of feedback. As a result, most RS methods tend to learn user preferences from popular items since they account for most data. However, recent research in e-commerce and marketing has shown that future businesses will obtain greater profit from long-tail selling. Yet, although the number of long-tail items and users is much larger than that of short-head items and users, in reality, the amount of data associated with long-tail items and users is much less. As a result, user preferences tend to be popularity-biased. Furthermore, insufficient data makes long-tail items and users more vulnerable to shilling attack. To improve the quality of recommendations for items and users in the tail of distribution, we propose a coupled regularization approach that consists of two latent factor models: C-HMF, for enhancing credibility, and S-HMF, for emphasizing specialty on user choices. Specifically, the estimates learned from C-HMF and S-HMF recurrently serve as the empirical priors to regularize one another. Such coupled regularization leads to the comprehensive effects of final estimates, which produce more qualitative predictions for both tail users and tail items. To assess the effectiveness of our model, we conduct empirical evaluations on large real-world datasets with various metrics. The results prove that our approach significantly outperforms the compared methods.		Liang Hu;Longbing Cao;Jian Cao;Zhiping Gu;Guandong Xu;Jie Wang	2017	ACM Trans. Inf.

The effects of these innovations are seen not only in major Web services such as wikis and social networking services but also in accessibility services. Collaborative accessibility improvement has great potential to make the Web more adaptive. Screen reader users, developers, site owners, and any Web volunteers who want to help the users are invited into the activities to improve accessibility in a timely manner. The Social Accessibility Project is an experimental service for a new needs-driven improvement model based on collaborative metadata authoring technologies. In 20 months, about 19,000 pieces of metadata were created for more than 3,000 Web pages through collaboration based on 355 requests submitted from users. We encountered many challenges as we sought to create a new mainstream approach and created distinctive features in new user interfaces to address some of these challenges. Although the new features increased user participation, serious issues remain. The productivity of the volunteers exceeded our expectations, but we found large and important problems in the users’ lack of awareness of their own accessibility problems. This is a critical problem for sustaining the active use of the service, because about 70% of the improvement starts with a request from a user. Helping users with visual impairments understand the actual issues is a crucial and challenging topic, and will lead to improved accessibility. We first introduce examples of collaboration, analyze several kinds of statistics on the activities of the users and volunteers of the pilot service, and then discuss our findings and challenges. Five future foci are considered: site-wide metadata authoring, encouraging active participation by users, quality management for the created metadata, metadata for dynamic HTML applications, and collaborations with site owners.	dynamic html;exploratory testing;user interface;web accessibility;web page;web service;wiki;world wide web	Daisuke Sato;Hironobu Takagi;Masatomo Kobayashi;Shinya Kawanaka;Chieko Asakawa	2010	TACCESS	10.1145/1857920.1857922	web service;quality management;web development;web modeling;web design;human–computer interaction;web accessibility initiative;web standards;computer science;accessibility;web accessibility;web page;multimedia;user interface;web 2.0;metadata;world wide web;social computing;collaboration	HCI	-28.576834346029557	-46.20841629638015	184703

Community detection algorithms are then useful to reveal the sub-structures of a network and in particular interest groups. Identifying these users’ communities and the interests that bind them can help us assist their life-cycle. Certain kinds of online communities such as question-and-answer (Q&A) sites, have no explicit social network structure. Therefore, many traditional community detection techniques do not apply directly. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for extracting topic from Q&A to detect communities of interest. Then we compare three detection methods we applied on a dataset extracted from the popular Q&A site StackOverflow. Our method based on topic modeling and user membership assignment is shown to be much simpler and faster while preserving the quality of the detection.	algorithm;linear discriminant analysis;off topic;online community;sensor;social network;stack overflow;tag (metadata);topic model	Zide Meng;Fabien L.

Even today, sketching is possibly the only rendering technique readily available to all humans. This paper is the first large scale exploration of human sketches. We analyze the distribution of non-expert sketches of everyday objects such as 'teapot' or 'car'. We ask humans to sketch objects of a given category and gather 20,000 unique sketches evenly distributed over 250 object categories. With this dataset we perform a perceptual study and find that humans can correctly identify the object category of a sketch 73% of the time. We compare human performance against computational recognition methods. We develop a bag-of-features sketch representation and use multi-class support vector machines, trained on our sketch dataset, to classify sketches. The resulting recognition method is able to identify unknown sketches with 56% accuracy (chance is 0.4%). Based on the computational model, we demonstrate an interactive sketch recognition system. We release the complete crowd-sourced dataset of sketches to the community.	computation;computational model;crowdsourcing;human reliability;humans;rendering (computer graphics);sketch recognition;support vector machine	Mathias Eitz;James Hays;Marc Alexa	2012	ACM Trans.

675932329bb06f73c5e3894ed18f40c71283411e	personalized video recommendation through tripartite graph propagation	personalized video recommendation;tripartite graph	The rapid growth of the number of videos on the Internet provides enormous potential for users to find content of interest to them. Video search, such as Google, Youtube, Bing, is a popular way to help users to find desired videos. However, it is still very challenging to discover new video contents for users. In this paper, we address the problem of providing personalized video suggestions for users. Rather than only exploring the user-video graph that is formulated using the click-through information, we also investigate other two useful graphs, the user-query graph indicating if a user ever issues a query, and the query-video graph indicating if a video appears in the search result of a query. The two graphs act as a bridge to connect users and videos, and have a large potential to improve the recommendation as the queries issued by a user essentially imply his interest. As a result, we reach a tripartite graph over (user, video, query). We develop an iterative propagation scheme over the tripartite graph to compute the preference information of each user. Experimental results on a dataset of 2,893 users, 23,630 queries and 55,114 videos collected during Feb. 1-28, 2011 demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, co-views and random walks on the user-video bipartite graph.	3-dimensional matching;internet;iterative method;online advertising;personalization;scheme;software propagation	Bisheng Chen;Jingdong Wang;Qinghua Huang;Tao Mei	2012		10.1145/2393347.2396401	computer science;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;graph database	Web+IR	-23.820749234491213	-49.43502225878624	185757

Web usage mining technique is able to capture such informative knowledge about user task pattern from usage data. With the discovered usage pattern information, it is possible to recommend Web user more preferred content or customized presentation according to the derived task preference. In this paper, we propose a Web recommendation framework based on discovering task-oriented usage pattern with Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) model. The user intended tasks are characterized by the latent factors through probabilistic inference, to represent the user navigational interests. Moreover, the active user’s intuitive task-oriented preference is quantized by the probabilities, by which pages visited in current user session are associated with various tasks as well. Combining the identified task preference of current user with the discovered usage-based Web page categories, we can present user more potentially interested or preferred Web content. The preliminary experiments performed on real world data sets demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.	data mining;experiment;information;probabilistic latent semantic analysis;quantization (signal processing);transaction data;usability;usage data;web content;web mining;web page	Guandong Xu;Yanchun Zhang;Xiaofang Zhou	2006		10.1145/1151736.1151754	web service;web mining;web modeling;data web;web analytics;web mapping;web design;web standards;computer science;transaction data;web navigation;social semantic web;web page;data mining;semantic web stack;database;web intelligence;probabilistic latent semantic analysis;world wide web;information retrieval;web server	Web+IR	-32.150106733271116	-50.451630973954416	185906

This paper proposes an approach for automatizing robot learning through the detection of causalities in the set of variables recorded during demonstration. This allows us to infer a notion of coherence and coordination between multiple systems that apparently work independently. We test the approach on a bimanual scooping task, consisting of multiple phases. We detect the coordination between the two arms, between the arms and the hands and between the fingers of each hand and observe how these coordination patterns change throughout the task.	coat of arms;programming by demonstration;robot learning	Ana Lucia Pais;Aude Billard	2015		10.1145/2701973.2702007	computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence	Robotics	-32.66691454428222	-40.24640103469589	185961

In this work we present an analysis of the mobility and interactions among characters in World of Warcraft (WoW) and Second Life based on the contact opportunities extracted from actual user data in each of those domains. We analyze character contacts in terms of their spatial and temporal characteristics, as well as the social network derived from such contacts. Our results show that the contacts observed may be more influenced by the nature of the interactions and goals of the users in each situation than by the intrinsic structure of such worlds. In particular, observations from a city in WoW are closer to those of Second Life than to other areas in WoW itself.	computer science;interaction;second life;social network;virtual world;world of warcraft	Felipe Machado;Matheus Santos;Virgílio A.

The user’s news preference rate is calculated automatically based on the time the user spends reading news items and their length. While existing systems also infer the user’s preferred fields, our system adjusts the volume and ratio of news stories using these categories. We collect web pages accessed by the user on a smart device and classify them using a naive Bayes classifier to determine the user’s preferred news categories. Collaborative filtering is then used to search for related news items read by others and to recommend news in a ratio consistent with the user’s preferred fields. Using a main memory DB, recommendations are computed 2.1 times faster than with a traditional DB when recommending from among 100,000 items; further, the more data used for recommendations, the bigger the speed difference between the proposed and traditional systems becomes.	adaboost;apache hadoop;apache mahout;artificial neural network;collaborative filtering;computer data storage;data center;decision tree;experiment;f1 score;in-memory database;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;naive bayes classifier;recommender system;sensor;smart device;support vector machine;systems architecture;user (computing);web page	Zhegao Piao;Seong Joon Yoo;Yeong Hyeon Gu;Jaechun No;Zhiyan Jiang;Helin Yin	2017	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-017-2111-x	smart device;recommender system;naive bayes classifier;collaborative filtering;web page;computer science;architecture;information retrieval;data mining;database	Web+IR	-22.109643621258627	-50.76810150384803	186270

We study the mechanisms which enable these services to persistently and accurately follow users web activity, and evaluate to which extent this phenomena is spread across the web. Through a study of the top 10K websites, our findings indicate that OSN tracking is diffused among almost all website categories, independently from the content and from the audience. We also evaluate the tracking capabilities in practice and demonstrate by analyzing a real traffic traces that OSNs can reconstruct a significant portion of users web profile and browsing history. We finally provide insights into the relation between the browsing history characteristics and the OSN tracking potential, highlighting the high risk properties.	blog;information privacy;social network;tracing (software);user profile	Chaabane Abdelberi;Mohamed Ali Kâafar;Roksana Boreli	2012		10.1145/2342549.2342552	computer science;tracking;multimedia;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-26.34720747027441	-46.81409338281524	186370

In this paper a new theoretical framework for retrieval in these scenarios is proposed. We derive a general dynamic utility function for optimizing over these types of tasks, that takes into account the utility of each stage and the probability of observing user feedback. We apply our framework to experiments over TREC data in the dynamic multi page search scenario as a practical demonstration of its effectiveness and to frame the discussion of its use, its limitations and to compare it against the existing frameworks.	algorithm;experiment;information retrieval;observable;utility	Marc Sloan;Jun Wang	2015		10.1145/2808194.2809457	relevance;cognitive models of information retrieval;computer science;machine learning;data mining;adversarial information retrieval;world wide web;information retrieval;human–computer information retrieval;divergence-from-randomness model	Web+IR	-32.712559987897556	-51.72860944313378	186403

We have built a Chrome browser plugin that collects each web page visited by a user and submits it to our query suggestion server for indexing, thus building a personal history profile for each user. The contribution of this paper is a method of using this personal history profile for reordering the query suggestions offered by Google when the user searches information on Google, moving query suggestions more relevant to the user’s information need to the front positions in the Google provided query suggestions list. We have collected browsing history log data for over 4 months from several users who installed our Chrome plugin on their local computers and then we performed an offline evaluation test that shows that our personalized query suggestion system improves the MRR (i.e. Mean Reciprocal Rank) score of Google query suggestions by approximately 0.04 (i.e. improves Google’s MRR score by 12 percents).

However, they suffer from two major problems, which degrade the accuracy of suggestions: data sparsity and cold start. The popularity of social networks shed light on a new generation of such systems, which is called social recommender system. These systems act promisingly in solving data sparsity and cold start issues. Given that social relationships are not available to every system, the implicit relationship between the items can be an adequate option to replace the constraints. In this paper, we explored the effect of combining the implicit relationships of the items and user-item matrix on the accuracy of recommendations. The new Item Asymmetric Correlation (IAC) method detects the implicit relationship between each pair of items by considering an asymmetric correlation among them. Two dataset types, the output of IAC and user-item matrix, are fused into a collaborative filtering recommender via Matrix Factorization (MF) technique. We apply the two mostly used mapping models in MF, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Alternating Least Square, to investigate their performances in the presence of sparse data. The experimental results of real datasets at four levels of sparsity demonstrate the better performance of our method comparing to the other commonly used approaches, especially in handling the sparse data.	algorithm;cold start;collaborative filtering;e-commerce;experiment;information filtering system;iteration;performance;recommender system;run time (program lifecycle phase);social network;sparse matrix;stochastic gradient descent;time complexity	Arghavan Moradi Dakhel;Hadi Tabatabaee Malazi;Mehregan Mahdavi	2017	Applied Intelligence	10.1007/s10489-017-0973-5	recommender system;machine learning;artificial intelligence;filter (signal processing);pattern recognition;collaborative filtering;computer science;sparse matrix;social network;stochastic gradient descent;matrix (mathematics);matrix decomposition	AI	-19.361311785173516	-47.4231839294216	186517
8743b9ce070406d8e44e778af93a564bfb68b330	identify online store review spammers via social review graph	spammer detection;review graph	Online shopping reviews provide valuable information for customers to compare the quality of products, store services, and many other aspects of future purchases. However, spammers are joining this community trying to mislead consumers by writing fake or unfair reviews to confuse the consumers. Previous attempts have used reviewers’ behaviors such as text similarity and rating patterns, to detect spammers. These studies are able to identify certain types of spammers, for instance, those who post many similar reviews about one target. However, in reality, there are other kinds of spammers who can manipulate their behaviors to act just like normal reviewers, and thus cannot be detected by the available techniques.  In this article, we propose a novel concept of review graph to capture the relationships among all reviewers, reviews and stores that the reviewers have reviewed as a heterogeneous graph. We explore how interactions between nodes in this graph could reveal the cause of spam and propose an iterative computation model to identify suspicious reviewers. In the review graph, we have three kinds of nodes, namely, reviewer, review, and store. We capture their relationships by introducing three fundamental concepts, the trustiness of reviewers, the honesty of reviews, and the reliability of stores, and identifying their interrelationships: a reviewer is more trustworthy if the person has written more honesty reviews; a store is more reliable if it has more positive reviews from trustworthy reviewers; and a review is more honest if many other honest reviews support it. This is the first time such intricate relationships have been identified for spam detection and captured in a graph model. We further develop an effective computation method based on the proposed graph model. Different from any existing approaches, we do not use an review text information. Our model is thus complementary to existing approaches and able to find more difficult and subtle spamming activities, which are agreed upon by human judges after they evaluate our results.	algorithm;ensemble learning;interaction;interpreter (computing);iterative method;model of computation;online shopping;out of the box (feature);purchasing;spamming;thinking outside the box;trust (emotion);trustworthy computing;user (computing);veracity	Guan Wang;Sihong Xie;Bing Liu;Philip S.

Most previous methods employ a line oriented approach. Real documents are copied repeatedly and overlaid with printed data, resulting in characters which touch cells and lines which are broken. BDR deals with regions directly, in contrast with other previous methods. Experimental tests show that BDR reliably recognizes cells and strings in document images with touching characters and broken lines.		Osamu Hori;David S.

ca12be505841db34c18c86b68619f43caae525d8	auto accessory segmentation and interactive try-on system		The convenience and diversity of online shopping makes many consumers willing to buy apparel or accessories on the web. In order to make products more attractive to users, many virtual try-on systems are developed for e-commerce applications. This paper proposes an interactive virtual try-on system combined with automatic accessory segmentation. Our system automatically retrieves the hat from images and store them in the try-on system to provide users with subsequent selection. When a user selects the hat that he or she wants to try on, the hat is placed on the proper position of the user in the image. In the stage of accessories segmentation, we perform background elimination and super-pixel segmentation. According to the color information on the hat image, the feature vector generated by the color histogram is used to select super-pixels that belong to the accessories. In the stage of try-on system, we use Kinect, which provides skeleton information, to track the user’s face and gestures. When a user selects the hat, the proposed system reads the corresponding hat information and places the hat in the appropriate location based on the results of the face tracking. The proposed try-on system can reach 30 fps real-time speed in a personal computer.

This forms a quaternary relationship among users, items, tags and ratings. Existing systems have utilized only ternary relationships such as users-items-ratings, or users-items-tags to derive their recommendations. In this paper, we show that ternary relationships are insufficient to provide accurate recommendations. Instead, we model the quaternary relationship among users, items, tags and ratings as a 4-order tensor and cast the recommendation problem as a multi-way latent semantic analysis problem. A unified framework for user recommendation, item recommendation, tag recommendation and item rating prediction is proposed. The results of extensive experiments performed on a real world dataset demonstrate that our unified framework outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in all the four recommendation tasks.	experiment;latent semantic analysis;social network;ternary numeral system;unified framework;user (computing)	Wei Chen;Wynne Hsu;Mong-Li Lee	2011		10.1145/2009916.2010052	latent semantic analysis;computer science;data mining;personalization;world wide web;information retrieval;social network	Web+IR	-19.665576710094754	-47.39167365873115	186876
a94d6256209a16269f3cc017244c08fba2123bf2	fewer flops at the top: accuracy, diversity, and regularization in two-class collaborative filtering		In most existing recommender systems, implicit or explicit interactions are treated as positive links and all unknown interactions are treated as negative links. The goal is to suggest new links that will be perceived as positive by users. However, as signed social networks and newer content services become common, it is important to distinguish between positive and negative preferences. Even in existing applications, the cost of a negative recommendation could be high when people are looking for new jobs, friends, or places to live.  In this work, we develop novel probabilistic latent factor models to recommend positive links and compare them with existing methods on five different openly available datasets. Our models are able to produce better ranking lists and are effective in the task of ranking positive links at the top, with fewer negative links (flops). Moreover, we find that modeling signed social networks and user preferences this way has the advantage of increasing the diversity of recommendations. We also investigate the effect of regularization on the quality of recommendations, a matter that has not received enough attention in the literature. We find that regularization parameter heavily affects the quality of recommendations in terms of both accuracy and diversity.	collaborative filtering;flops;interaction;matrix regularization;negative feedback;orthogonal polarization spectral imaging;recommender system;social network;user (computing)	Bibek Paudel;Thilo Haas;Abraham Bernstein	2017		10.1145/3109859.3109916	flops;data mining;recommender system;machine learning;collaborative filtering;artificial intelligence;probabilistic logic;computer science;regularization (mathematics);factor analysis;social network;ranking	Web+IR	-19.691404680635912	-47.11638059632209	186887
a4866fa3b0aa7fd84aa426ae771a0b9cd732aaa7	community aliveness: discovering interaction decay patterns in online social communities		Online Social Communities (OSCs) provide a medium for connecting people, sharing news, eliciting information, and finding jobs, among others. The dynamics of the interaction among the members of OSCs is not always growth dynamics. Instead, a decay or inactivity dynamics often happens, which makes an OSC obsolete. Understanding the behavior and the characteristics of the members of an inactive community help to sustain the growth dynamics of these communities and, possibly, prevents them from being out of service. In this work, we provide two prediction models for predicting the interaction decay of community members, namely: a Simple Threshold Model (STM) and a supervised machine learning classification framework. We conducted evaluation experiments for our prediction models supported by a ground truth of decayed communities extracted from the StackExchange platform. The results of the experiments revealed that it is possible, with satisfactory prediction performance in terms of the F1-score and the accuracy, to predict the decay of the activity of the members of these communities using network-based attributes and network-exogenous attributes of the members. The upper bound of the prediction performance of the methods we used is 0.91 and 0.83 for the F1-score and the accuracy, respectively. These results indicate that network-based attributes are correlated with the activity of the members and that we can find decay patterns in terms of these attributes. The results also showed that the structure of the decayed communities can be used to support the alive communities by discovering inactive members.	analysis of algorithms;apollonian network;computational complexity theory;experiment;f1 score;ground truth;machine learning;mathematical optimization;online community;software transactional memory;sorting algorithm;sparse matrix;stack exchange;supervised learning;threshold model	Mohammed Abufouda	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-90312-5_7	threshold model;predictive modelling;computer science;machine learning;data mining;artificial intelligence;ground truth;statistical classification;upper and lower bounds	Web+IR	-20.190973539805757	-44.35519340105471	186995

Word embedding has become a popular way to represent and extract information from such messages. In this paper, we propose a preliminary work aiming at assessing the benefits of taking temporal information into account when modeling messages in the context of a cultural event. We perform statistical and visual analyses on two word different representations: one including temporal information (Temporal Embedding), the second ignoring it (Word2Vec approach). Our preliminary results show that the obtained models exhibit some similarities, but also differ significantly in the way they represent certain specific words. More interestingly, the temporal information conveyed by the Temporal Embedding model allows to identify more relevant word associations related to the domain at hand (cultural festivals).	dendrogram;lexicon;out of the box (feature);principal component analysis;real-time transcription;text corpus;word embedding;word2vec	Mathias Quillot;Cassandre Ollivier;Richard Dufour;Vincent Labatut	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-68456-7_7	word embedding;word2vec;natural language processing;publishing;social network;embedding;multimedia;computer science;artificial intelligence	ML	-25.842147726880434	-47.78918833698457	187686

79e2a702e4003ee84e43d64d1f61a8fb80b70d56	a probabilistic author-centered model for twitter discussions		In a recent work some of the authors have developed an argumentative approach for discovering relevant opinions in Twitter discussions with probabilistic valued relationships. Given a Twitter discussion, the system builds an argument graph where each node denotes a tweet and each edge denotes a criticism relationship between a pair of tweets of the discussion. Relationships between tweets are associated with a probability value, indicating the uncertainty on whether they actually hold. In this work we introduce and investigate a natural extension of the representation model, referred as probabilistic author-centered model. In this model, tweets by a same author are grouped, describing his/her opinion in the discussion, and are represented with a single node in the graph, while edges stand for criticism relationships or controversies between opinions of Twitter users in the discussion. In this new model, interactions between authors can give rise to circular criticism relationships, and the probability of one opinion criticizing another are evaluated from the probabilities of criticism among the individual tweets that compose both opinions.	degree of polarization;graph (discrete mathematics);interaction;polarization (waves)	Teresa Alsinet;Josep Argelich;Ramón Béjar;Francesc Esteva;Lluis Godo	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-91476-3_56	natural language processing;argumentation theory;argumentative;probabilistic logic;criticism;artificial intelligence;graph;mathematics	AI	-20.89894173280127	-39.78324654933046	188188

Although hot topic detection techniques have a great improvement, it is more significant o find what determines the life span of a blog topic, because the online consensus brought by the topic unavoidably experiences the real life. The W2T (Wisdom Web of Things) methodology considers the information organization and management from the perspective of Web services, which contributes to a deep understanding of online phenomena such as users’ behaviors and comments in e-commerce platforms and online social networks. This chapter first applies the W2T methodology to analyze the formation and evolution of a blog hot topic, and some influential factors which determine the development of the topic are identified to recognize hot topics. And then, the construction of a blog topic model considers information granularity in order to detect and track the evolution of the topic. Experimental results show that the proposed method for detecting the blog hot topic is feasible and effective.	blog	Erzhong Zhou;Ning Zhong;Yuefeng Li;Jiajin Huang	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-44198-6_10	internet privacy;world wide web;information retrieval	NLP	-23.904341787581235	-51.20796560785449	188505

Many databases like that of intrusion detection systems, web-click records, player statistics, texts, proteins etc., store strings or sequences. Searching for an unusual pattern within such long strings of data has emerged as a requirement for diverse applications. Given a string, the problem then is to identify the substrings that differs the most from the expected or normal behavior, i.e., the substrings that are statistically significant. In other words, these substrings are less likely to occur due to chance alone and may point to some interesting information or phenomenon that warrants further exploration. To this end, we use the chi-square measure. We propose two heuristics for retrieving the top-k sub-strings with the largest chi-square measure. We show that the algorithms outperform other competing algorithms in the runtime, while maintaining a high approximation ratio of more than 0.96. A recent attractive area of research has been the detection of statistically relevant sequences or mining interesting patterns from within a given string [4, 11]. Given an input string composed of symbols from a defined alphabet set with a probability distribution defining the chance of occurrence of the symbols, and thereby defining its expected composition, we would like to find the portions of the string which deviate from the expected behavior and can thus be potent sources of study for hidden pattern and information. An automated monitoring system like a cluster of sensors sensing the temperature of the surrounding environment for fire alert, or a connection server sniffing the network for possible intrusion detection provides a few of the applications where such pattern detection is essential. Other applications involve text analysis of e-mails and blogs to predict terrorist activities or judging prevalent public sentiments, studying trends of the stock market, and identifying sudden changes in the mutation characteristics of protein sequence of an organism. Similarly , information extracted from a series of Internet web-sites visited, the advertisements clicked on them or from the nature of transactions on a database, can capture the interests of the end user, prospective clients and also the periods of heavy traffic in the system. An interesting field of application can be the identification of good and bad career patches of a sports icon.

The notable feature of micro-blog articles is prone to be a burst of popularity during a short period. In addition, diverse interests make users bored in redundant items in most recommender systems. Therefore, providing users with diverse popular micro-blogs that suit their interesting topics is an important issue. In this paper, depending on forwarding number and comment number of micro-blogs, an effective model for popularity prediction is proposed to discover popular topics. Then, a MaxMin diversity algorithm based on content distance and popularity density is proposed to discover top k micro-blogs. Finally, we design a diverse personalized popularity attention (DPPA) recommendation approach for target user. We conduct extensive experiments on large scale micro-blog datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed approach can satisfy user's requirements with a higher recall than personal attention methods.	algorithm;blog;diversification (finance);experiment;information overload;layer (electronics);minimax;personalization;recommender system;requirement;web service	Jianxing Zheng;Bofeng Zhang;Guobing Zou;Xiaodong Yue	2014	2014 International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)	10.1109/DSAA.2014.7058112	computer science;data mining;multimedia;world wide web	DB	-23.634307377131172	-49.867297622096636	188921

These services have accumulated a large amount of such geo-tagged review data, which allows deep analysis of user preferences in POIs. This paper studies two types of user preferences to POIs: topical-region preference and category aware topical-aspect preference. We propose a unified probabilistic model to capture these two preferences simultaneously. In addition, our model is capable of capturing the interaction of different factors, including topical aspect, sentiment, and spatial information. The model can be used in a number of applications, such as POI recommendation and user recommendation, among others. In addition, the model enables us to investigate whether people like an aspect of a POI or whether people like a topical aspect of some type of POIs (e.g., bars) in a region, which offer explanation for recommendations. Experiments on real world datasets show that the model achieves significant improvement in POI recommendation and user recommendation in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods. We also propose an efficient online recommendation algorithm based on our model, which saves up to 90% computation time.	apache poi;computation;experiment;generative model;geographic coordinate system;location-based service;moe;microsoft research;multitier architecture;online algorithm;point of interest;statistical model;tier 2 network;time complexity;unified model;user (computing)	Kaiqi Zhao;Gao Cong;Quan Yuan;Kenny Q.

Furthermore, search engines are expected to be equipped with recommendation and dialogue capabilities, making the interaction with users more natural and smoother.

Currently, their interests mostly focus on global event. However, because user-defined topics, denoted by local events, are closer, more useful and helpful to personal life, they should be paid more attention to from a practical point of view. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to detect user-defined hot topics from microblogging posts, which includes user-defined keywords expansion, relevant microblogging filter and hot topic detection. We also propose an effective algorithm for user-defined keywords expansion by fusing importance, relevance and penalty factors.

User profiling is a crucial step in providing accurate product recommendations to the end users. Once groups of people with similar preferences are identified, information, products, or services tailored to group’s needs, can be delivered. The aim of this paper is to clarify the role of utility functions in the formation of user profiles. Thus, the clustering behaviour of customers’ preferences is investigated by means of clustering algorithms and preference modelling. It is shown in this work that the incorporation of a Multi-criteria methodology prior to the application of a clustering algorithm constitutes a fundamental step for the formation of more accurate user profiles in terms of compactness and separation of the groups.

In particular, we focus on the problem of extracting place semantics for tags that are assigned to photos on Flickr, a popular-photo sharing Web site that supports location (latitude/longitude) metadata for photos. We propose the adaptation of two baseline methods, inspired by well-known burst-analysis techniques, for the task; we also describe two novel methods, TagMaps and scale-structure identification. We evaluate the methods on a subset of Flickr data. We show that our scale-structure identification method outperforms existing techniques and that a hybrid approach generates further improvements (achieving 85% precision at 81% recall). The approach and methods described in this work can be used in other domains such as geo-annotated Web pages, where text terms can be extracted and associated with usage patterns.	baseline (configuration management);flickr;protein structure prediction;web page;world wide web	Tye Rattenbury;Mor Naaman	2009	TWEB	10.1145/1462148.1462149	computer science;web page;data mining;semantics;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-26.500443494681733	-51.71950324659476	189584

To provide robust recommendation services to users, it is critical to understand how users describe their needs when they seek audio- visual materials. We conducted a content analysis of 396 recommendation threads from Anime News Network online forums to identify 19 common information features used in these requests. Work, Theme, and Genre were the most frequently mentioned features when users described anime they were seeking. Findings also show Audience as an important anime information need. Together, these form a distinct set of interests, vital to understanding the information needs of anime users.	information needs;information retrieval	Hyerim Cho;Marc L. Schmalz;Stephen A.

e71cdfbd128f1ed9e459f2ea0b6dd5f3bef0ed57	exploiting category-specific information for image popularity prediction in social media		Social media has become an important part of each individual’s life and an invaluable tool for companies to know their customers better in the market. The problem of popularity prediction in social media has been studied extensively over the past few years. Yet, it is still a challenging task due to various factors, including the difficulty to measure the preference of viewers towards specific post contents, the influence of user popularity, and the properties of social media itself. Accordingly, this paper focuses on image popularity prediction by analyzing early popularity patterns of posts in the same content category, fused with user information data. We conduct extensive experiments on a dataset crawled from Instagram. The experimental results show that our proposed model achieves considerable performance in predicting the number of likes of an Instagram input photo. Moreover, we also provide in-depth analysis of the importance of category-specific information in popularity prediction.	clinical prediction rule;experiment;instagram;silo (dataset);social media;contents - htmllinktype	Eric Massip;Shintami Chusnul Hidayati;Wen-Huang Cheng;K.

Few of them deal with the nature of the reputation in these large social networks. In this work, we extract a sample of MySpace Music by parsing the artists’ pages and following the “best friend” links. The study of the network shows that the online fame is composed by two independent features: the audience, dominated by the major companies’ artists, and the influence, more associated with independent labels. We observe that most of the audience is focused on a few stars: the tail of MySpace Music is long, but flat. The network structure shows that artists tend to link to artists of similar reputation.	emergence;fits;flickr;map;online and offline;parsing;recommender system;reputation;snowball (programming language);social network;user-generated content	Jean-Samuel Beuscart;Thomas Couronné	2009			internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-20.189261435303788	-43.260779893817954	190133

To date, most of state-of-the-art methods make emotion prediction for the masses which are invalid for individuals. In this paper, we propose a novel emotion prediction method for individuals based on user interest and social influence. To balance user interest and social influence, we further propose a simple yet efficient weight learning method in which the weights are obtained from users' behaviors. We perform experiments in real social media network, with 4,257 users and 2,152,037 microblogs.

The conventional approach to compute page importance is to exploit the link graph of the web and to build a model based on that graph. For instance, PageRank is such an algorithm, which employs a discrete-time Markov process as the model. Unfortunately, the link graph might be incomplete and inaccurate with respect to data for determining page importance, because links can be easily added and deleted by web content creators. In this paper, we propose computing page importance by using a 'user browsing graph' created from user behavior data. In this graph, vertices represent pages and directed edges represent transitions between pages in the users' web browsing history. Furthermore, the lengths of staying time spent on the pages by users are also included. The user browsing graph is more reliable than the link graph for inferring page importance. This paper further proposes using the continuous-time Markov process on the user browsing graph as a model and computing the stationary probability distribution of the process as page importance. An efficient algorithm for this computation has also been devised. In this way, we can leverage hundreds of millions of users' implicit voting on page importance. Experimental results show that BrowseRank indeed outperforms the baseline methods such as PageRank and TrustRank in several tasks.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);bigraph;computation;pagerank;stationary process;trustrank;web content	Yuting Liu;Bin Gao;Tie-Yan Liu;Ying Zhang;Zhiming Ma;Shuyuan He;Hang Li	2008		10.1145/1390334.1390412	probability distribution;computer science;machine learning;data mining;database;markov process;world wide web;graph database;information retrieval;statistics	Web+IR	-23.66092883558884	-49.011806217349154	190412

In this paper, we present our approach to personalizing search engines using ontology based contextual profiles. In contrast to long-term user profiles, we construct contextual user profiles that capture what the user is working on at the time they conduct a search. These profiles are used to personalize the search results to suit the information needs of the user at a particular instant of time. We present the results of experiments evaluating the effect of the original versus conceptual ranking and the use of multiple sources of information to build the contextual profile. We were able to achieve a 15% improvement over Google in the average rank of the result clicked by a user when contextual information extracted from open Word documents and Web pages was used to re-rank the results.	experiment;information needs;personalization;user profile;web page;web search engine	Vishnu Challam;Susan Gauch;Aravind Chandramouli	2007			semantic search;computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval;search engine	Web+IR	-28.239523465279795	-51.0728600153502	190509

For this purpose, we develop a new Bayesian probabilistic generative model of social media, according to which the observation of social links and textual contents is governed by novel and intuitive relationships among latent content topics, communities and roles. Variational inference under the devised model allows for exploratory, descriptive and predictive tasks, including the detection and interpretation of overlapping communities, roles and topics as well as the prediction of missing links. Extensive tests on real-world social media reveal a superior accuracy of the proposed model in comparison to state-of-the-art competitors, which substantiates the rationality of the motivating intuition. The experimental results are also insightfully inspected from a qualitative viewpoint.	social media;topic model	Gianni Costa;Riccardo Ortale	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-93037-4_7	competitor analysis;topic model;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;generative model;probabilistic logic;inference;rationality;social media;bayesian probability	NLP	-19.77402956435077	-45.062424415777855	190616

a8b70af314990fd7b483506459c05b25c2c8274d	adaptive fog-based output security for augmented reality		Augmented reality (AR) technologies are rapidly being adopted across multiple sectors, but little work has been done to ensure the security of such systems against potentially harmful or distracting visual output produced by malicious or bug-ridden applications. Past research has proposed to incorporate manually specified policies into AR devices to constrain their visual output. However, these policies can be cumbersome to specify and implement, and may not generalize well to complex and unpredictable environmental conditions. We propose a method for generating adaptive policies to secure visual output in AR systems using deep reinforcement learning. This approach utilizes a local fog computing node, which runs training simulations to automatically learn an appropriate policy for filtering potentially malicious or distracting content produced by an application. Through empirical evaluations, we show that these policies are able to intelligently displace AR content to reduce obstruction of real-world objects, while maintaining a favorable user experience.	augmented reality;fog computing;malware;reinforcement learning;robertson–seymour theorem;simulation;user experience	Surin Ahn;Maria Gorlatova;Parinaz Naghizadeh Ardabili;Mung Chiang;Prateek Mittal	2018		10.1145/3229625.3229626	distributed computing;filter (signal processing);user experience design;reinforcement learning;computer science;augmented reality;edge computing	Web+IR	-29.397383593244175	-42.21026787655619	191128

To address these issues, we develop a multiview clustering method through which users are iteratively clustered from the views of both rating patterns and social trust relationships. To accommodate users who appear in two different clusters simultaneously, we employ a support vector regression model to determine a prediction for a given item, based on user-, itemand prediction-related features. To accommodate (cold) users who cannot be clustered due to insufficient data, we propose a probabilistic method to derive a prediction from the views of both ratings and trust relationships. Experimental results on three real-world data sets demonstrate that our approach can effectively improve both the accuracy and coverage of recommendations as well as in the cold start situation, moving clustering-based recommender systems closer towards practical use.	cluster analysis;cold start;recommender system;scalability;support vector machine	Guibing Guo;Jie Zhang;Neil Yorke-Smith	2015	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2014.10.016	cold start;similarity;fuzzy clustering;computer science;collaborative filtering;machine learning;data mining;trustworthy computing;world wide web;information retrieval;recommender system	AI	-20.785354273421444	-47.78545463600987	191164

The discussion forum content are modeled as concepts based on an innovative Topic Facet Modeling algorithm (a probabilistic topic model that assumes all words in single sentence are generated from one topic facet), and aimed to provide better understanding and solicitation of the increasing large volume of discussion content. We hypothesize that by navigating and interacting (browsing, sorting, searching etc.) with the Facets, will enhance learning. A comprehensive system design rationales and preliminary qualitative study are reported in this paper.	algorithm;bubble chart;interaction;programming language;sensitivity and specificity;sorting;stack exchange;systems design;topic model;visual analytics;web application	Piyush Awasthi;I-Han Hsiao	2015			semantic analytics;web application;topic model;data mining;multimedia;probabilistic logic;visual analytics;bubble chart;cultural analytics;analytics;computer science	Web+IR	-31.48715030086917	-47.658465991326096	191247

Facebook provides Facebook Pages (Pages in short) for public figures and businesses (we call entities) to communicate with their fans through a Like button. Because Like counts sometimes reflect the popularity of entities, techniques to increase the Like count can be a matter of interest, and might be known as social media marketing. From an academic perspective, Like counts of Pages depend not only on the popularity of the entity, but also on the popularity of semantically related entities. For example, Lady Gaga's Page has many Likes; her song """"Poker Face"""" does too. We can infer that her next song will acquire many Likes immediately. Important questions are these: How does the Like count of Lady Gaga affect the Like count of her song? Alternatively, how does the Like count of her song constitute some fraction of the Like count of Lady Gaga herself?  As described in this paper, we strive to reveal the mutual influences of Like counts among semantically related entities. To measure the influence of related entities, we propose a problem called the Like prediction problem (LPP). It models Like counts of a given entity using information of related entities. The semantic relations among entities, expressed as RDF predicates, are obtained by linking each Page with the most similar DBpedia entity. Using the model learned by support vector regression (SVR) on LPP, we can estimate the Like count of a new entity e.g., Lady Gaga's new song. More importantly, we can analyze which RDF predicates are important to infer Like counts, providing a mutual influence network among entities. Our study comprises three parts: (1) crawling the Pages and their Like counts, (2) linking Pages to DBpedia, and (3) constructing features to solve the LPP. Our study, based on 20 million Pages with 30 billion Likes, is the largest-scale study of Facebook Likes ever reported. This research constitutes a new attempt to integrate unstructured emotional data such as Likes, with Linked data, and to provide new insights for branding with social media."""	active directory rights management services;algorithm;application programming interface;bridging (networking);dbpedia;entity linking;focused crawler;hyperlink;like button;linked data;resource description framework;semantic network;social media marketing;support vector machine;syntactic predicate;user (computing);web crawler	Shohei Ohsawa;Yutaka Matsuo	2013		10.1145/2487788.2487992	computer science;artificial intelligence;linked data;data mining;entity linking;world wide web	Web+IR	-23.062958630797628	-51.32187986516891	191311
d0884a8a819ebc82ac0ad9bf0265cc7c4dec3dd0	exploring content virality in facebook: a semantic based approach		In the current era of digitization specifically with the advent of Web 2.0, social media has become an imposing force in shaping up the way people perceive and react to the information around them. Social media platforms have empowered people to share almost instant feedback on the content posted by individuals and organizations facilitating two way interaction and better engagement among them. This continuous interaction among individuals and organizations creates huge amount of user-generated content (UGC) and associated tokens. This study attempts to understand various semantics that might affect the virality of Facebook posts. Several pages have been identified and shortlisted from domains including e-commerce, manufacturing, services and media. A total of 53,340 Facebook posts comprising of 37, 38, 168 words have been extracted using Facebook Graph API from each of the mentioned domains and subsequently analyzed using NOSQL databases. Further, the derived tokens are semantically grouped and used to gather insights by mapping to existing virality frameworks for identifying and ranking the ones that might be affecting the virality of a post. Findings indicate the virality of content shared has positive correlation with direct brand engagement, promotional offers, freebies and direct user mentions.

However, the previous link prediction algorithms need to be modified to suit the recommendation cases since they do not consider the separation of these two fundamental relations: similar or dissimilar and like or dislike. In this paper, we propose a novel and unified way to solve this problem, which models the relation duality using complex number. Under this representation, the previous works can directly reuse. In experiments with the Movie Lens dataset and the Android software website AppChina.com, the presented approach achieves significant performance improvement comparing with other popular recommendation algorithms both in accuracy and coverage. Besides, our results revealed some new findings. First, it is observed that the performance is improved when the user and item popularities are taken into account. Second, the item popularity plays a more important role than the user popularity does in final recommendation. Since its notable performance, we are working to apply it in a commercial setting, AppChina.com website, for application recommendation.	algorithm;experiment;interaction	Feng Xie;Zhen Chen;Jiaxing Shang;Xiaoping Feng;Wen-Liang Huang;Jun Li	2014	2014 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT)	10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.35	computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	AI	-19.716515976261686	-47.07711025321249	191741

b7fc2c67d811f44cc94da8ab1478531aec24ba6b	learning generalizable surface cleaning actions from demonstration		When surveyed, potential users often report cleaning as a desired robot capability. Cleaning tasks, such as dusting, wiping, or scrubbing, involve applying a tool on a surface. A general-purpose robotic solution to household cleaning needs to address manipulation of the numerous cleaning tools made for different purposes. Finding a universal solution to this manipulation problem is extremely challenging and it is not feasible for developers to pre-program the robot to use every possible tool. Instead, our work seeks to allow end users to program robots by demonstration using their own specific tools. We propose a method to extract a compact representation of a cleaning action from a single demonstration, such that the tool can be applied on different surfaces. The method exploits key insights about tool directionality and constraints placed on the provided demonstration. We demonstrate that our method is able to reliably learn cleaning actions for six different tools and apply those actions on different testing surfaces, even ones smaller than the training surface. Our method reproduces the cleaning performance of the demonstrated trajectory when applied on the training surface and it captures different user preferences.	data scrubbing;general-purpose modeling;plasma cleaning;robot;user (computing)	Sarah Elliott;Zhe Xu;Maya Cakmak	2017	2017 26th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)	10.1109/ROMAN.2017.8172424	computer vision;simulation;data scrubbing;end user;artificial intelligence;computer science;robot;exploit	Robotics	-30.4163732361086	-40.846412434649906	192510

Moreover, changes in visual attention from different viewing conditions challenge visual attention models. In this paper, we present a new HD and UHD video eye tracking dataset composed of 37 high quality videos observed by more than 35 naive observers.

Compared with traditional recommendation systems such as collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation, LARS exploits the spatial aspect of ratings for recommendations [1]. However, these rating data contain privacy information such as users’ locations and preferences, which enable recommender servers (RS) to easily infer the points of interest of users. Thus, RS can track users or provide users’ preferences to advertisers, which would seriously threaten their personal safety.	collaborative filtering;location awareness;point of interest;programming paradigm;recommender system	Sheng Gao;XinDi Ma;Jianming Zhu;Jianfeng Ma	2017	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-017-9222-7	recommender system;mathematics;data mining;histogram;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence	Web+IR	-22.53293097793316	-46.42331640762113	192811

We use a methodology to automatically construct fuzzy rules in a Fuzzy Rule-Based System that detects contextual emotions from an actor's performance during a show. We collect video data from a lot of performances of the same show from which it should be possible to visualize all the emotions and intents or more precisely “intent graphs”. To perform this, the collected data defining low-level descriptors are aggregated and converted into high-level characterizations. Then, depending on the retrieved data and on their distribution on the axis, we partition the universes into classes. The last step is the building of the fuzzy rules that are obtained from the classes and that permit to give conclusions to label the detected emotions.	apache axis;fuzzy rule;high- and low-level;performance;rule-based system	Alain Bonardi;Isis Truck;Herman Akdag	2006			visual arts;computer vision;real-time computing;simulation;performance;artificial intelligence;operating system;machine learning;multimedia	Web+IR	-31.951118820865158	-42.61321835789795	192942
002211e45ca99fa25199ffb13fb411a64f708324	one size does not fit all: profiling personalized time-evolving user behaviors		"""Given the set of social interactions of a user, how can we detect changes in interaction patterns over time? While most previous work has focused on studying network-wide properties and spotting outlier users, the dynamics of individual user interactions remain largely unexplored. This work sets out to explore those dynamics in a way that is minimally invasive to privacy, thus, avoids to rely on the textual content of user posts---except for validation. Our contributions are two-fold. First, in contrast to previous studies, we challenge the use of a fixed interval of observation. We introduce and empirically validate the """"Temporal Asymmetry Hypothesis"""", which states that appropriate observation intervals should vary both among users and over time for the same user. We validate this hypothesis using eight different datasets, including email, messaging, and social networks data. Second, we propose iNET, a comprehensive analytic and visualization framework which provides personalized insights into user behavior and operates in a streaming fashion. iNET learns personalized baseline behaviors of users and uses them to identify events that signify changes in user behavior. We evaluate the effectiveness of iNET by analyzing more than half a million interactions from Facebook users. Labeling of the identified changes in user behavior showed that iNET is able to capture a wide spectrum of exogenous and endogenous events, while the baselines are less diverse in nature and capture only 66% of that spectrum. Furthermore, iNET exhibited the highest precision (95%) compared to all competing approaches."""	anomaly detection;baseline (configuration management);email;interaction;personalization;privacy;real life;social network;stepping level;structure mining	Pravallika Devineni;Evangelos E.

Unlike traditional news filtering approaches, we postulate that a user's preference for particular articles depends not only on the topic and on propositional contents, but also on the user's current context and on more subtle attributes. Our assumption is motivated by the observation that many people read newspapers because they actually enjoy the process. Such sentiments depend on a complex variety of factors. The present study is part of an ongoing effort to bring more advanced personalization to online media. Towards this end, we present a systematic evaluation of the merit of contextual and non-propositional features based on real-life clickstream and postings data.

Understanding how users navigate the site is important so we can improve their Web experience. In this study, we collect Web server logs of an online Malaysian newspaper for 28 days in April 2012. We apply Markov model which is one the techniques in Web usage mining used to model a collection of user sessions. The content pages are categorized to three types; main page, article page and section page. We analyzed the navigation flow between different pages in a session. From the Markov state model, we discovered that users are inclined to continue reading the articles from the main page. Interestingly, majority of users that start navigation with the main page will also end their session with the main page as well. As for the section page, we investigate what section pages are read together in a session. Our findings also found that users tend are likely to read section pages together and we observed that National sections are always the favorite section, while Education is the least section to start their session. The findings from this study can be a basis for recommending pages to the user so they can navigate more pages in a session and in turn to increase traffic to the online newspaper site.	categorization;data mining;hidden markov model;internet;markov chain;server (computing);web mining;web server	Husna Sarirah Husin;Norsuhaili Seid	2017		10.1145/3022227.3022236	web mining;static web page;page view;computer science;web page;printer-friendly;database;multimedia;markov model;world wide web	Web+IR	-26.016477189099085	-48.87827051155868	194106

Consider the command “go to the front of the classroom”. The spatial region mentioned (the front of the classroom) is not perceivable using geometry alone. Instead it is defined by its functional use, implied by nearby objects and their configuration. In this paper, we define such areas as context-dependent spatial regions and present a cognitive system able to learn them by combining qualitative spatial representations, semantic labels, and analogy. The system is capable of generating a collection of qualitative spatial representations describing the configuration of the entities it perceives in the world. It can then be taught context-dependent spatial regions using anchor points defined on these representations. From this we then demonstrate how an existing computational model of analogy can be used to detect context-dependent spatial regions in previously unseen rooms. To evaluate this process we compare detected regions to annotations made on maps of real rooms by human	artificial intelligence;computation;computational model;context-sensitive language;entity;fly-by-wire;goto;map;simultaneous localization and mapping;spatial–temporal reasoning;video post-processing	Nick Hawes;Matthew Klenk;Kate Lockwood;Graham S.

With the development of social networks, it is possible to selectively fill the missing value in the user-item matrix by using the friendship or trust relationship information of social networks. According to the memory-based collaborative filtering algorithm, in the paper, the two steps which are similarity calculation and user rating prediction are taken into account. Besides, this paper has filled appropriately the missing value and improved memory-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms to integrate the social relations. The experiment on the Epinions dataset shows that the improved algorithm can effectively alleviate the sparsity problem of user rating data and perform better than other classic algorithms in RMSE and MAP evaluation metrics.	algorithm;collaborative filtering;map;missing data;norm (social);social network;sparse matrix	Jinglong Zhang;Mengxing Huang;Yu Zhang	2017	2017 14th Web Information Systems and Applications Conference (WISA)	10.1109/WISA.2017.26	friendship;collaborative filtering;filter (signal processing);social relation;sparse matrix;social network;statistical classification;algorithm;computer science;data modeling	Web+IR	-19.679749315410795	-47.228575775867014	194726

a79f539c27d148d0c3415f8cc55b70cfa59cf348	an item orientated recommendation algorithm from the multi-view perspective		In the traditional recommendation algorithms, items are recommended to users on the basis of users’ preferences to improve selling efficiency, which however cannot always raise revenues for manufacturers of particular items. Assume that, a manufacturer has a limited budget for an item’s advertisement, with this budget, it is only possible for him to market this item to limited users. How to select the most suitable users that will increase advertisement revenue? It seems to be an insurmountable problem to the existing recommendation algorithms. To address this issue, a new item orientated recommendation algorithm from the multi-view perspective is proposed in this paper. Different from the existing recommendation algorithms, this model provides the target items with the users that are the most possible to purchase them. The basic idea is to simultaneously calculate the relationships between items and the rating differences between users from a multi-view model in which the purchasing records of each user are regarded as a view and each record is seen as a node in a view. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the scenario of item orientated	algorithm;online advertising;purchasing;recommender system;view model	Qi-Ying Hu;Zhi-Lin Zhao;Chang-Dong Wang;Jianhuang Lai	2017	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2016.12.102	data mining	AI	-20.659953013468385	-49.654376668668036	195090

Traditional approaches recover all-pair latencies in a network from sampled measurements using either Euclidean embedding or matrix factorization. However, these approaches targeting static or mean network latency prediction are insufficient to predict personal device latencies, due to unstable and time-varying network conditions, triangle inequality violation and unknown rank of latency matrices. In this paper, by analyzing latency measurements from the Seattle platform, we propose new methods for both static latency estimation as well as the dynamic estimation problem given 3D latency matrices sampled over time. We propose a distance-feature decomposition algorithm that can decompose latency matrices into a distance component and a network feature component, and further leverage the structured pattern inherent in the 3D sampled data to increase estimation accuracy. Extensive evaluations driven by real-world traces show that our proposed approaches significantly outperform various state-of-the-art latency prediction techniques.	algorithm;control theory;mobile device;real-time clock;sampling (signal processing);social inequality;time-varying network;tracing (software)	Bang Liu;Di Niu;Zongpeng Li;H.

Nevertheless, at present, they have been evaluated in many, often incompatible, ways. We affirm this problem is mainly due to the lack of a common framework for recommender systems, a framework general enough so that we may include the whole range of recommender systems to date, but specific enough so that we can obtain solid results. In this paper, we propose such a framework, attempting to extract the essential features of recommender systems. In this framework, the most essential feature is the objective of the recommender system. What is more, in this paper, recommender systems are viewed as applications with the following essential objective. Recommender systems must: (i) choose which (of the items) should be shown to the user, (ii) decide when and how the recommendations must be shown. Next, we will show that a new metric emerges naturally from this framework. Finally, we will conclude by comparing the properties of this new metric with the traditional ones. Among other things, we will show that we may evaluate the whole range of recommender systems with this single metric. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we develop new techniques to find roles in Wikipedia based on editors’ low-level edit types and investigate how work contributed by people from different roles affect the article quality. To do this, we first built machinelearning models to automatically identify the edit categories associated with edits. We then applied a graphical model analogous to Latent Dirichlet Allocation to uncover the latent roles in editors’ edit histories. Applying this technique revealed eight different roles editors play. Finally, we validated how our identified roles collaborate to improve the quality of articles. The results demonstrate that editors carrying on different roles contribute differently in terms of edit categories and articles in different quality stages need different types of editors. Implications for editor role identification and the validation of role contribution are discussed.	graphical model;high- and low-level;latent dirichlet allocation;online community;routing;wikipedia	Diyi Yang;Aaron Halfaker;Robert E.

Traditionally, research about online trust assumes static trust relations between users. However, trust, as a social concept, evolves as people interact. Most existing studies about trust evolution are from sociologists in the physical world while little work exists in an online world. Studying online trust evolution faces unique challenges because more often than not, available data is from passive observation. In this work, we leverage social science theories to develop a methodology that enables the study of online trust evolution. In particular, we identify the differences of trust evolution study in physical and online worlds and propose a framework, eTrust, to study trust evolution using online data from passive observation in the context of product review sites by exploiting the dynamics of user preferences. We present technical details about modeling trust evolution, and perform experiments to show how the exploitation of trust evolution can help improve the performance of online applications such as trust prediction, rating prediction and ranking evolution.	computer science;contextual advertising;evolution;experiment;gene prediction;user (computing);web of trust	Jiliang Tang;Huiji Gao;Atish Das Sarma;Yingzhou Bi;Huan Liu	2015	IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering	10.1109/TKDE.2014.2382576	computer science;knowledge management;machine learning;data mining;reliability;predictive modelling;world wide web;computational trust;statistics	Web+IR	-21.19846751794389	-45.256007243724596	195543

This work, based on a sample of over a third of a million users, examines how users’ behaviour in the online environment, captured by their website choices and Facebook profile features, relates to their personality, as measured by the standard Five Factor Model personality questionnaire. Results show that there are psychologically meaningful links between users’ personalities, their website preferences and Facebook profile features. We show how website audiences differ in terms of their personality, present the relationships between personality and Facebook profile features, and show how an individual’s personality can be predicted from Facebook profile features. We conclude that predicting a user’s personality profile can be applied to personalize content, optimize search results, and improve online advertising.	aggregate data;cynthia dwork;differential privacy;internet;machine learning;nonlinear system;observable;online advertising;online and offline;personalization;polynomial;radial basis function;recommender system;sampling (signal processing);social network;sparse matrix;support vector machine;tree (data structure);web content	Michal Kosinski;Yoram Bachrach;Pushmeet Kohli;David Stillwell;Thore Graepel	2013	Machine Learning	10.1007/s10994-013-5415-y	online advertising;computer science;personalization;multimedia;personality;cyberpsychology;social network;online participation	Web+IR	-21.34931306105697	-44.71121373945476	195674

No matter how well travelers plan, circumstances at their destination invariably force them to modify their plans, especially towards the end of a tour. However, it is difficult for travelers to get useful information or support. Accordingly, we propose a service model whereby on-site travelers can instantly access planning suggestions from locals. Travelers send a personalized plan request with conditions such as desired end point (destination and time), preferences (e.g. dining, historical spots, etc.), and group information. The service delivers this to participating locals, who create appropriate plans and register them with the service. We conducted a preliminary survey of the model in March, 2014 in Matsuyama, Japan. Despite an insufficient volume of data the questionnaire results support our approach. Locals provided useful information that was perceived as more credible than online search results.	experiment;online search;personalization;web search engine	Kenro Aihara;Susumu Kono;Shizuhiro Sugino	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20804-6_51	simulation;engineering;marketing;advertising	AI	-30.166335868783026	-46.69112151920998	196064

The current research implements and tests an autobiographical memory system by which a humanoid robot, the iCub, can accumulate its experience in interacting with humans, and extract regularities that characterize this experience. This knowledge is then used in order to form composite representations of common experiences. We first apply this to the development of knowledge of spatial locations, and relations between objects in space. We then demonstrate how this can be extended to temporal relations between events, including “before” and “after,” which structure the occurrence of events in time. In the system, after extended sessions of interaction with a human, the resulting accumulated experience is processed in an offline manner, in a form of consolidation, during which common elements of different experiences are generalized in order to generate new meanings. These learned meanings then form the basis for simple behaviors that, when encoded in the autobiographical memory, can form the basis for memories of shared experiences with the human, and which can then be reused as a form of game playing or shared plan execution.	artificial intelligence;experience;humanoid robot;icub;interaction;online and offline;semiconductor consolidation	Grégoire Pointeau;Maxime Petit;Peter Ford Dominey	2014	IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development	10.1109/TAMD.2014.2307342	psychology;simulation;artificial intelligence;machine learning;communication	AI	-32.696266190630595	-39.37803873534239	196275

In this paper, we propose countering the spread of fake news on social networks by leveraging these crowds to instead help verify alternative facts. We present a prototype social argumentation framework to verify the validity of proposed alternative facts to help curb the propagation of fake news.

The study of information diffusion focusses on analysing how the spread of information enables us to understand the ways that users behave and interact online. Information diffusion manifests itself on social networks in the form of cascades of information, which are structural representations of diffusion events. The characteristics of information diffusion differ between online social networks partly depending on the capabilities of each. Tumblr is an online social network platform; it allows users to reblog more than once, to add a comment with a reblog, and to delete reblogs which presents certain challenges in the study of diffusion on this network. In this paper, we will identify and address those challenges, and we will examine the effects of these functionalities on users' behaviour and consequently on the structural characteristics of cascades on Tumblr.	reblogging;social network	Nora Alrajebah	2015	2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)	10.1145/2808797.2808814	social network analysis;social science;simulation;time–frequency analysis;computer science;mathematics;world wide web;correlation	Metrics	-20.53114387051573	-43.07600868979608	196434

Modern handheld devices provided with localization capabilities could automatically create a diary of user’s whereabouts and use that information as a surrogate (or a complement) of the user profile. The places we go, in fact, reveal also something about us, for example, two persons can be matched as compatible given the fact they visit the same places. Web-retrieved information, and the temporal patterns with which different places are visited, can be used to automatically define meaningful semantic labels to the visited places. In our work we used geocoding and white-pages Web-services to extract information about a place, and Bayesian networks to classify places on the basis of the time in which they have been visited. In this paper we describe the general idea at the basis of the whereabouts diary, discuss our implementation, and present experimental results.

When user social graphs are only accessible to exclusive parties, these user-shared images are proved to be an easier and effective alternative to discover user connections. This work investigated over 360 000 user shared images from two social networks, Skyrock and 163 Weibo, in which 3 million follower/ followee relationships are involved. It is observed that the shared images from users with a follower / followee relationship show relatively higher similarities . A multimedia big data system that utilizes this observed phenomenon is proposed as an alternative to user- generated tags and social graphs for follower/followee recommendation and gender identification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in this field to prove and formulate such a phenomenon for mass user-shared images along with more practical prediction methods. These findings are useful for information or services recommendations in any social network with intensive image sharing, as well as for other interesting personalization applications, particularly when there is no access to those exclusive user social graphs.	big data;centrality;data system;ground truth;identification friend or foe;personalization;recommender system;social graph;social media;social network analysis;time complexity	Ming Cheung;James She;Zhanming Jie	2015	IEEE Transactions on Multimedia	10.1109/TMM.2015.2460192	detector;visualization;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;computer network	ML	-25.44543424688803	-46.984650852679195	196578

Page ranking is an essential component of search engines because it determines the presentation sequence of the tens of millions of returned pages associated with a single query. It therefore plays a significant role in regulating the search quality and user experience for information retrieval. When measuring the authority of a web page, most methods focus on the quantity and the quality of the neighborhood pages that direct to it using inbound hyperlinks. However, these methods ignore the diversity of such neighborhood pages, which we believe is an important metric for objectively evaluating web page authority. In comparison with true authority pages that usually contain a large number of inbound hyperlinks from a wide variety of sources, it is difficult for fake authorities, which boost their page rank using techniques such as link farms, to occupy the high diversity of inbound hyperlinks due to prohibitively high costs. We propose a probabilistic counting-based method to quantitatively and efficiently compute the diversity of inbound hyperlinks. We then propose a novel link-based ranking algorithm, named Drank, to rank pages by simultaneously analyzing the quantity, quality and diversity of their inbound hyperlinks. The validations on both synthetic and real-world data show that Drank outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both finding high-quality pages and suppressing web spams. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Based on shoppers' previous purchasing behavior and the customer's previous choices the strategy is capable of suggesting relevant and desirable products to each customer accurately. The strategy is based on training a back-propagation neural network with association rules that are mined from a transactional database. Unlike most strategies that only consider the relationship between the purchased items, the proposed strategy also incorporates additional influential attributes such as the price of items and their merchandise category. A powerful confidence estimate is used to rank the suggestions.

b7bdfe153705fbab750e07b53fdeb7d7a7ecd43f	multi-objective perception model for diffusion of information in social networks		Social networks have recently become important tools for sharing and exchanging data. They facilitate the rapid propagation and dissemination of information. Therefore, it is essential to provide means for analysing the phenomenon of diffusion in such networks. One of the most important components of a diffusion model is information perception which determines who each node receives its information from. Previous researches assumed the information perception to be based on a single objective, whereas in reality, there exist other objectives that affects the peopleu0027s decision for selecting the neighbour who would supply information, which might conflict with each other, and modelling diffusion process with respect to a single objective can give rise to unacceptable results with respect to the other objectives. This paper presents a novel multi-objective perception model for diffusion of information, which is abbreviated as MOPDI. Considering different objectives simultaneously significantly enhances the proposed information diffusion model.	social network	Niloofar Mozafari;Ali Hamzeh;Sattar Hashemi	2017	IJDMMM	10.1504/IJDMMM.2017.10007658	computer science;data mining;artificial intelligence;machine learning;management science;perception;diffusion (business);social network;diffusion process;knowledge management;phenomenon;dissemination	ML	-20.0455571290213	-40.65517970288889	196942

In our earlier study, temperament-based filtering method has been proposed in seek of combining concept learning and content-based filtering techniques to incorporate human temperament concept into the recommendation process of an information system. In this paper, we explain the design of a prototype multiagent system, which is developed, implemented, and experimentally tested by using a group of simulated users generated from the sample users to demonstrate the effectiveness of the temperament-based filtering method for selection and customization. The notion of human factors, particularly human temperaments, is explored and learned for the representation and segmentation of an information space. Furthermore, the learned temperament concept is employed for the interpretation and measurement of the relevance extent for the classification and recommendation of the information units. The results of our preliminary experiment indicate that the accuracy of recommendation using the temperament-based filtering method exceeds that in the content-based filtering method.	agent-based model;algorithm;concept learning;experiment;group cohesiveness;human factors and ergonomics;information filtering system;information retrieval;information system;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;prototype;recommender system;relevance;statistical model;web search engine	Cha-Hwa Lin;Dennis McLeod	2002			user modeling;information system;information space;information retrieval;data mining;information filtering system;temperament;concept learning;computer science	AI	-32.193386190558066	-50.41109208940138	197145

We propose a framework that 1) extracts both object features and the social context and 2) uses them to learn recommendation rules. The social context is described by different types of information, such as a user's personal objects, the objects of a user's social contacts, the importance of the user in the social network, etc. Both object features and the social context are first used to guide the k-nearest neighbour method for the tag recommendation. We then enhance the method by the local topology adjustment on how the nearest neighbours are selected. We learn a local transformation of the feature space surrounding a given object which pushes together objects with the same tags and puts apart objects with different tags. We show how to learn the Mahalanobis distance metric on multi-tag objects and adopt it to the tag recommendation problem.	experiment;feature vector;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;social media;social network;support vector machine	Boris Chidlovskii;Aymen Benzarti	2011		10.1145/2034691.2034734	social environment;feature vector;social media;computer science;mahalanobis distance;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining;world wide web;social network	Web+IR	-20.987640236056436	-47.528608484508396	197261
094b2362fc16a575eb41916ac17301afb12e4a7f	travel route recommendation based on geotagged photo metadata		Travellers usually look for two kinds of information when they are planning a trip to a new destination: the points of interest (POI) and the interesting travel sequences given the POI in the destination. In recent years, due to the spread of the photo-taking gadgets with the global positioning system (GPS) functionality and the act of the travellers sharing and contributing photos on websites, such as Flickr and Panoramio, there are plenty of geotagged photos available on the Web. Through assembling diverse sets of geotagged photos shared by the travellers from the Web, the POI and the travel sequences given the POI in a destination can be mined if the travellers visit several POI in a day and take photos at each of the visited POI. In this paper, a web-based travel route recommendation system, namely Travel Route Recommendation System (TRRS), is presented. The purpose of this system is to generate and recommend travel route to the travellers who are visiting a destination for the first time and only for one day based on geotagged photo metadata.	geotagged photograph;geotagging	Ching May Lee;J.

Many of these social networks now exceed millions of users or actors, each of which may be associated with rich attribute data such as user profiles in social websites and caller networks, or subject classifications in document collections and citation networks. Such attribute data is often incomplete for a number of reasons - for example, users may be unwilling to spend the effort to complete their profiles, while in the case of document collections, there may be insufficient human labor to accurately classify all documents. At the same time, the tie or link information in these networks may also be incomplete - in social websites, users may simply be unaware of potential acquaintances, while in citation networks, authors may be unaware of appropriate literature that should be referenced. Completing and predicting these missing attributes and ties is important to a spectrum of applications, such as recommendation, personalized search, and targeted advertising, yet large social networks can pose a scalability challenge to existing algorithms designed for this task. Towards this end, we propose an integrative probabilistic model, SLR, that captures both attribute and tie information simultaneously, and can be used for attribute completion and tie prediction, in order to enable the above mentioned applications. A key innovation in our model is the use of triangle motifs to represent ties in the network, in order to scale to networks with millions of nodes and beyond. Experiments on real world datasets show that SLR significantly improves the accuracy of attribute prediction and tie prediction compared to well-known methods, and our distributed, multi-machine implementation easily scales up to millions of users. In addition to fast and accurate attribute and tie prediction, we also demonstrate how SLR can identify the attributes most responsible for homophily within the network, thus revealing which attributes drive network tie formation.	algorithm;citation graph;computational complexity theory;digital single-lens reflex camera;experiment;generative model;google+;hyperlink;internet;network homophily;personalization;personalized search;scalability;social network;statistical model;user profile;web page;wikipedia	Lizi Liao;Qirong Ho;Jing Jiang;Ee-Peng Lim	2016	2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)	10.1109/ICDE.2016.7498313	computer science;data science;probability;data mining;database;world wide web;statistics;social network	DB	-19.435571664754974	-44.474792357091694	197606

In other words, robots have to work and share environments with human. However, there exist many invisible social rules or social protocols in human society. For example, people usually stand in a line to access certain services. It seems that there is a social force or a “spatial effect” which forces people to perform the behavior of standing in a line. Unfortunately, these spatial effects are usually invisible and immeasurable. It makes social behavior understanding to be a difficult problem. The robot that does not comprehend these spatial effects might harm people or itself. Previous methods of behavior understanding mainly only targeted certain scenarios or environments. This paper follows the framework of SBCM (Spatial Behavior Cognition Model)[3] and extends to feature-based spatial effects. By utilizing feature to represent the spatial effect, it is easier to apply known spatial effects to different environments. This paper also demonstrates that the robot is able to learn and execute some common social behaviors under the proposed method. Several simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the proposed idea in this paper.	cognition;existential quantification;experiment;feature recognition;feature selection;feature vector;loss function;robot;simulation;social force model;socialization	Shu Yun Chung;Han-Pang Huang	2012	2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2012.6385852	human–robot interaction;computer vision;navigation;simulation;cognition;visualization;feature extraction;computer science;artificial intelligence;trajectory;social robot;robot kinematics	Robotics	-21.608696743370547	-40.473217554686194	197789

One key step of opinion mining is feature extraction. Most existing research focus on finding explicit features, only a few attempts have been made to extract implicit features. Nearly all existing research only concentrate on product features, few has paid attention to other features that relates to sellers, services and logistics. Therefore in this paper, we propose a novel co-occurrence association-based method, which aims to extract implicit features in customer reviews and provide more comprehensive and fine-grained mining results.	customer relationship management;feature extraction;logistics	Yu Zhang;Weixiang Zhu	2013		10.1145/2487788.2487835	association;co-occurrence;computer science;data mining;world wide web;sentiment analysis	ML	-21.60206911365182	-51.95721749933273	197856

However, users’ social information is distributed over the web and managed by many different proprietary applications, which is a challenge for application developers as they must collect information from different sources and wade through a lot of irrelevant information to obtain the social context information of interest. Combining the social information from the diverse sources and incorporating richer semantics could greatly assist the developers and enrich the applications. In this paper, we introduce SCIMS, a social context information management system. It includes the ability to acquire raw social data from multiple sources; an ontology based model for classifying, inferring and storing social context information, in particular, social relationships and status; an ontology based policy model and language for owners to control access to their information; a query interface for accessing and utilizing social context information. We evaluate the performance and scalability of SCIMS using real data from Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Google calendar, and demonstrate its applicability through a sociallyaware phone call application.	google calendar;information management system (ims);relevance;scalability	Muhammad Ashad Kabir;Jun Han;Jian Yu;Alan W.

Modeling customersu0027 fit feedback is challenging due to its subtle semantics, arising from the subjective evaluation of products, and imbalanced label distribution. In this paper, we propose a new predictive framework to tackle the product fit problem, which captures the semantics behind customersu0027 fit feedback, and employs a metric learning technique to resolve label imbalance issues.

bf32909cbdabbe7a0c7bf78deb73c8e44bedca27	discovering temporal hidden contexts in web sessions for user trail prediction	context awareness;temporal web analytics;browsing behaviour	In many web information systems such as e-shops and information portals, predictive modeling is used to understand user's intentions based on their browsing behaviour. User behavior is inherently sensitive to various hidden contexts. It has been shown in different experimental studies that exploitation of contextual information can help in improving prediction performance significantly. It is reasonable to assume that users may change their intents during one web session and that changes are influenced by some external factors such as switch in temporal context e.g. 'users want to find information about a specific product' and after a while 'they want to buy this product'. A web session can be represented as a sequence of user's actions where actions are ordered by time. The generation of a web session might be influenced by several hidden temporal contexts. Each session can be represented as a concatenation of independent segments, each of which is influenced by one corresponding context. We show how to learn how to apply different predictive models for each segment in this work. We define the problem of discovering temporal hidden contexts in such way that we optimize directly the accuracy of predictive models (e.g. users' trails prediction) during the process of context acquisition. Our empirical study on a real dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.	concatenation;information system;portals;predictive modelling;while	Julia Kiseleva;Hoang Thanh Lam;Mykola Pechenizkiy;Toon Calders	2013		10.1145/2487788.2488120	computer science;data mining;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-24.832024882212856	-45.61043135647255	198319

In this paper, we focus specifically on the detection of ego networks. They are networks formed by an individual (ego) and all the other people she has a social relationship with. We propose a completely decentralised algorithm that allows each user's mobile device to identify the structure of its user's ego network. The algorithm monitors social interaction patterns between the ego and its peers. It is completely decentralised and runs at each individual node using local information only, scaling with the network size. It does not disclose social interaction patterns, and it is able to dynamically detect changes in the structure of the ego network, being self-adaptive. The algorithm is based on social cognitive heuristics, i.e. Models about how the human brain groups social relationships, described in the cognitive psychology literature. Therefore, our approach reproduces - in users' personal mobile devices - the cognitive processes used by their human users to understand their ego networks' structure. We test it on real datasets of interactions corresponding to (i) physical contacts and (ii) exchange of information in online social networks. We show that in both cases the detected social structures are remarkably consistent with those described in the social sciences literature. In addition, we study the dynamic behaviour of the algorithm, highlighting how such structures evolve dynamically over time.	algorithm;centralisation;cognition;cognitive tutor;fundamental interaction;heuristic (computer science);image scaling;mobile app;mobile device;sensor;social network;social structure	Matteo Mordacchini;Andrea Passarella;Marco Conti	2015	2015 8th IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)	10.1109/WMNC.2015.35	psychology;mobile search;simulation;social heuristics;communication;mobile computing;social psychology;social computing	HCI	-22.786395103970982	-39.52676197622851	198381
5ca0164caea28c122f43dd2bb69e4faec4575adc	leveraging web intelligence for information cascade detection in social streams		In this paper, we present an approach for investigating information cascades in social and collaborative networks. The proposed approach seeks to improve methods limited to the detection of paths through which merely exact content-tokens are propagated. For this sake, we adopt to leverage web intelligence to the purpose of discovering paths that convey exact content-tokens cascades, as well as paths that convey concepts or topics related to these content-tokens. Indeed, we mine sequence of actors involved in cascades of keywords and topics extracted from their posts, using simple to use restful APIs available on the web. For the evaluation of the approach, we conduct experiments based on assimilating a scientific collaborative network to a social network. Our findings reveal the detection of missed information when using merely exact content propagation. Moreover, we noted that the vocabulary of actors is preserved mostly in short cascades, where topics become a better alternative in long cascades.	information cascade;web intelligence	Mohamed Cherif Nait-Hamoud;Fedoua Didi;Abdelatif Ennaji	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-89743-1_6	data mining;leverage (finance);artificial intelligence;streams;web intelligence;computer science;machine learning;information cascade;collaborative network;social network;vocabulary	AI	-23.51307565742657	-51.201214058783954	198441

Recently, Treude et al. manually label 385 questions in StackOverflow and group them into 10 categories based on their contents. They also analyze how tags are used in StackOverflow. In this study, we extend their work to obtain a deeper understanding on how developers interact with one another on such a question and answer web site. First, we analyze the distributions of developers who ask and answer questions. We also investigate if there is a segregation of the StackOverflow community into questioners and answerers. We also perform automated text mining to find the various kinds of topics asked by developers. We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a well known topic modeling approach, to analyze the contents of tens of thousands of questions and answers, and produce five topics. Our topic modeling strategy provides an alternative perspective different from that of Treude et al. for categorizing StackOverflow questions. Each question can now be categorized into several topics with different probabilities, and the learned topic model could automatically assign a new question to several categories with varying probabilities. Last but not least, we show the distributions of questions and developers belonging to various topics generated by LDA.	categorization;google questions and answers;interaction;latent dirichlet allocation;mathematical model;stack overflow;text mining;topic model	Shaowei Wang;David Lo;Lingxiao Jiang	2013		10.1145/2480362.2480557	computer science;data science;machine learning;data mining;database;world wide web	Web+IR	-26.184558753378106	-47.95646385692639	198506

Based on the personal historical record, the recommender system can find interesting and relevant objects for the user within a huge information space. Many physical processes such as the mass diffusion and heat conduction have been applied to design the recommendation algorithms. The hybridization of these two algorithms has been shown to provide both accurate and diverse recommendation results. In this paper, we proposed two similarity preferential diffusion processes. Extensive experimental analyses on two benchmark data sets demonstrate that both recommendation and accuracy and diversity are improved duet to the similarity preference in the diffusion. The hybridization of the similarity preferential diffusion processes is shown to significantly outperform the state-of-art recommendation algorithm. Finally, our analysis on network sparsity show that there is significant difference between dense and sparse system, indicating that all the former conclusions on recommendation in the literature should be reexamined in sparse system. Introduction. – The development of internet and World Wide Web bring many websites that allow a large number of users to interact and share information. Examples include the well-known Twitter.com, facebook.com and so on. Day by day, these online systems are rapidly growing, leading to a massive amount of available information for the users. The accessible information is for sure far more than every individual’s ability to deal with, which is usually refereed as the information overload problem. Therefore, the information filtering techniques nowadays becomes a very necessary and useful tool for online users. Recommendation is one the filtering techniques with the highest potential and widest application [1, 2]. Generally, it predicts users’ taste and interested objects based on their historical records. So far, various kinds of algorithms have been proposed, including collaborative filtering approaches [3], contentbased analyses [4], tag-aware algorithms [5], trust-aware algorithms [6] and social impact based algorithms [7]. For a review in this field, see ref. [8]. Recently, the information filtering has attracted more and more attention from (a)yi-cheng.zhang@unifr.ch physicists. Some classic diffusion processes in physics have been introduced to design recommendation algorithms. The mass diffusion algorithm enjoys a very high recommendation accuracy [9] while the heat conduction algorithm can generate very personalized recommendation results [10]. The hybrid approach of these two algorithms can achieve both high recommendation accuracy and diversity [11]. Based on the hybrid method in [11], many extensions have been made. For example, the setting of initial configuration [12], adding of the ground node [13], personalized hybrid parameters [14] are shown to further improve the recommendation performance. Moreover, the network manipulation has been shown to effectively solve the cold-start problem in recommendation [15]. To enhance the efficiency of the recommendation process, the method to extract the information backbone (minimum structure) from online system is also designed [16]. Very recently, the long-term influence of the recommendation methods on the user-item bipartite network evolution is studied [17]. It is found that many personalized recommendation methods have reinforce effect on item degree	algorithm;benchmark (computing);cold start;collaborative filtering;information filtering system;information overload;internet backbone;personalization;recommender system;sparse matrix;two-port network;whole earth 'lectronic link;world wide web;on-line system	An Zeng;Alexandre Vidmer;Matús Medo;Yi-Cheng Zhang	2013	CoRR			Web+IR	-23.37346984151466	-49.37561194967933	198579
f53564ddde6d503350926dcea6f0645497db2593	a self-adaptive point-of-interest recommendation algorithm based on a multi-order markov model		Abstract As one of the personalization technologies, point-of-interest (POI) recommendation systems have attracted more and more attention from academic and industrial researchers. Exploiting the spatio-temporal pattern of users check-ins for user modeling is the core content of the current research of POI recommendation in location-based social networks (LBSNs). In this paper, we propose a POI recommendation algorithm based on a multi-order Markov model, which predicts users next favorite POIs based not only on their current location but also on their previous location, and propose a self-adaptive algorithm to adjust our multi-order Markov model to be available to all users check-ins. Moreover, to improve the precision of our proposed POI recommendation algorithm, we incorporate the geographical influence and temporal popularity of users checked-in POIs into our proposed algorithm. Finally, experimental results on two real datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art POI recommendation methods in terms of F − m e a s u r e @ N ( N = 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 ) .	algorithm;markov chain;markov model;point of interest	Shudong Liu;Lei Wang	2018	Future Generation Comp.

Collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based (CB) filtering are the most widely used techniques in personalized recommender systems. CF uses only the user-rating data to make predictions, while CB filtering relies on semantic information of items for recommendation. In this paper we present a new approach taking into account the semantic information of items in a CF system. Many works have addressed this problem by proposing hybrid solutions. In this paper, we present another hybridization technique that predicts users „preferences for items based on their inferred preferences for semantic information. With this aim, we propose a new approach to build user semantic profile to model users‟ preferences for semantic information of items. Then, we use this model in a user-based CF algorithm to calculate the similarity between users. We apply our approach to real data, the MoviesLens dataset, and compare our results to standards user-based and item-based CF algorithms.	algorithm;cold start;collaborative filtering;experiment;hybrid algorithm;machine learning;online and offline;personalization;recommender system;scalability;sparse matrix;usage data	Sonia Ben Ticha;Azim Roussanaly;Anne Boyer;Khaled Bsaïes	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-32273-0_18	semantic similarity;semantic computing;user modeling;computer science;collaborative filtering;information filtering system;data mining;database;world wide web;information retrieval;recommender system	AI	-26.619794743379163	-50.15880310335377	198670

1b2133bd0fad035eed6a30437ec1b20a0e5ef67e	applying nosql databases for integrating web educational stores - an ontology-based approach	qa76 electronic computers computer science computer software	Educational content available on the web is playing an important role in the teaching and learning process. Learners search for different types of learning objects such as videos, pictures, and blog articles and use them to understand concepts they are studying in books and articles. The current search platforms provided can be frustrating to use. Either they are not specified for educational purposes or they are provided as a service by a library or a repository for searching a limited dataset of educational content. This paper presents a novel system for automatic harvesting and connecting of medical educational objects based on biomedical ontologies. The challenge in this work is to transform disjoint heterogeneous web databases entries into one coherent linked dataset. First, harvesting APIs were developed for collecting content from various web sources such as YouTube, blogging platforms, and PubMed library. Then, the system maps its entries into one data model and annotates its content using biomedical ontologies to enable its linkage. The resulted dataset is organized in a proposed NoSQL RDF Triple Store which consists of 2720 entries of articles, videos, and blogs. We tested the system using different ontologies for enriching its content such as MeSH and SNOMED CT and compared the results obtained. Using SNOMED CT doubled the number of linkages built between the dataset entries. Experiments of querying the dataset is conducted and the results are promising compared with simple text-based search.	artificial intelligence;nosql	Reem Qadan Al Fayez;Mike Joy	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20424-6_4	computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	AI	-28.07396565237084	-50.53444509866191	199100

However, using CM tools of distinct manufacturers, different results are likely to occur even if the same parameters are given. Obviously the manufacturers do not focus on the same criteria doing their optimizations, which leads to the fact that each CM tool has its own strengths and weaknesses. In this study, new methods for comparing CM tools were evaluated, and with these methods, ICC profiles generated by five CM tools of current leaders on the market were investigated in order to point out their weaknesses and strengths. In addition, the influence of using various CM modules (CMM) was tested. For the generation of each ICC profile, the same measurements (Iris Inkjet, ISO 12642 / ANSI IT8.7/3 target) were used. Since the standardized ISO 12642 file format, in which the measurement data are stored, was not accepted by each of the tools, the file had to be converted to proprietary formats. The investigated quality aspects were accuracy, consistency and smoothness, with ∆Eab and ∆E94 taken as the criteria. For each aspect, performance was visualized by mapping the ∆E values to pseudo colors, giving a very intuitive view on the investigated subject. Results showed that CM tools indeed achieved color fidelity, especially those generating large profiles.	capability maturity model;color management	Hendrik Büring;Patrick G.

e5a430f175e37bb116b4d70a59aaa9f2a265570b	emerging product topics prediction in social media without social structure information		Social media provides a vast continuous supply of dynamic and diverse information contents from the crowd, which serves as useful resources for predictive analytical applications. Although there exist already a number of studies on emerging topics detection, they focused on modelling of textual contents and emerging detection mechanism over topic popularity. To meet the real-life demands, prediction of emerging product topic, rather than detection, in the early stage is required. Besides, despite that some relevant studies considered social structure information, they suffer from the assumption that the complete network is available and the diffusion process only depends on social influence among members of networks. Moreover, not all social media sites provide the functionality to facilitate the development of online social networks. In this paper, we tackle the problem of emerging product topics prediction in social network with implicit networks. Two tasks, one for long-term forecast in pre-production stage and the other for short-term forecast in post-release stage, are investigated. We present a novel framework named Emerging Topics Predictor (ETP). Two novel features, namely author diversity and competition features, are also proposed to accommodate the diffusion process with implicit networks based on the rationale of product marketing. Through empirical evaluation on movie reviews from two real social media sites, ETP is shown to provide effective and efficient performance in predicting the emerging topics as early as possible. In particular, the experiment results show the promising effect of author diversity in emerging prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the very first studies on emerging product topic prediction in social media with considerations of implicit networks.	social media;social structure	Sinya Peng;Vincent S.
