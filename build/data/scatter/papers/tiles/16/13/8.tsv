Both algorithms enable the fast solution of continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations (CAREs) that constitute the bottleneck in the passivity-preserving balanced stochastic truncation (BST). The first algorithm is a Smith-method-based Newton algorithm, called Newton/Smith CARE, that exploits low-rank matrices commonly found in physical system modeling. The second algorithm is a project-and-balance scheme that utilizes dominant eigenspace projection, followed by a simultaneous solution of a pair of dual CAREs through completely separating the stable and unstable invariant subspaces of a Hamiltonian matrix. The algorithms can be applied individually or together.

For degrees two and three, a full description of the conjugacy classes is accomplished, in each case, by a one–parameter family of polynomials. This is done in such a way that, when one applies one of these three root–finding iterative methods to the elements of these parametrized families, a family of iterative methods is obtained, in such a way that its dynamics represents, up to conjugacy, the dynamics of the corresponding iterative root–finding method applied to any complex polynomial having the same degree. For degree four, analogous partial results are obtained.	degree (graph theory);iterative method;polynomial;root-finding algorithm	Sergio Amat;Sonia Busquier;Sergio Plaza	2004	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/S0096-3003(03)00747-1	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;iterative method;algebra	Theory	79.1388941965008	18.00284632151994	66619

First, the derivative of the first Melnikov function is provided. Then, we use it, together with the analytic method, to derive the asymptotic expansion of the first Melnikov function near the loop. Meanwhile, we present the first coefficients in the expansion, which can be applied to study the limit cycle bifurcation near the loop. We give sufficient conditions for this system to have 14 limit cycles in the neighborhood of the loop. As an application, a piecewise polynomial Liénard system is investigated, finding six limit cycles with the help of the obtained method.	bifurcation theory;coefficient;limit cycle;polynomial	Yanqin Xiong	2016	I.

It is better suited to describe experimental data from the time-course microarray. Addressing construction problems in GPBNs may lead to a better understanding of the intrinsic dynamics in biological systems. Using the technique of the semi-tensor product (STP) of matrices, the dynamics of a GPBN can be expressed in an algebraic form and the attractors can be calculated. This paper investigates the issue of construction of GPBNs from prescribed attractors. Based on a rigorous theoretical analysis, some algebraic formulae and a computationally feasible algorithm are obtained to construct the least in-degree model with prescribed attractors. Illustrative examples are presented to show the validity of the theoretical results and the proposed algorithm.

When using the Euler-Maruyama approximation algorithms, an important question is: Suppose the measure of the regime-switching diffusions converges to its invariant measure, will the sequence of measures of the approximation scheme converges to the same limit? This paper provides answers to this question. By appropriate interpolations and weak convergence methods, it shows that a suitably interpolated sequence resulted from the algorithm converges to the switching diffusion. The convergence to the invariant measure of the numerical algorithm is also studied.	approximation algorithm;euler;euler–maruyama method;interpolation;markov chain;modulation;numerical analysis	Gang George Yin;Xuerong Mao;K.

The research is inspired by the problem of optimizing the trajectories of multiple searchers attempting to detect non-evadingmoving targets. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the approximation of the integral in the parameter space for the considered uncertain optimal control problem. The framework is proved to produce a zeroth-order consistent approximation in the sense that accumulation points of a sequence of optimal solutions to the approximate problem are optimal solutions of the original problem. In addition, we demonstrate the convergence of the corresponding adjoint variables. The accumulation points of a sequence of optimal state-adjoint pairs for the approximate problem satisfy a necessary condition of PontryaginMinimumPrinciple type,which facilitates assessment of the optimality of numerical solutions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we introduce a new approach to the design of model predictive controllers to meet the aforementioned requirements while the on-line complexity is essentially tantamount to the one that corresponds to the low-dimensional approximate model.	approximation algorithm;cdd;cplex;computability;computation;discretization;dynamical system;feedback;numerical analysis;online and offline;optimal control;polyhedron;recursion;requirement;sampling (signal processing);solver;state space	Pantelis Sopasakis;Daniele Bernardini;Alberto Bemporad	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6761010	control engineering;mathematical optimization;computer science;engineering;control theory;model predictive control	Robotics	68.81481940440945	7.821137797865406	67815

The algebraic framework of differential oneforms is applied to formulate necessary and sufficient solvability conditions. This approach applies the total differential operator to analytic system equations to obtain the infinitesimal system description in terms of one-forms. This representation can be converted into polynomial system description by interpreting the polynomial indeterminate as the delta derivative acting on one-forms. The system description in terms of two matrices over skew polynomial ring is then used to derive explicit formulas for the differentials of state coordinates that significantly simplify the calculations. The formulas are found from the left quotients computed by the left Euclidean division algorithm. & 2015 European Control Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We consider systems characterized by 2-D polynomials and 2-D state–space descriptions. For each description, we derive necessary and sufficient stability conditions, which all require only the computation of a constant matrix pencil. The stability of the underlying system can then be determined by inspecting the generalized eigenvalues of the matrix pencil. The results consequently yield 2-D stability tests that can be checked both efficiently and with high precision. Additionally, frequency-sweeping tests are also obtained which complement the matrix-pencil tests and are likely to be more advantageous analytically. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

For a given linear time-invariant system that is stable and positive real (PR), our goal is to find a PR reduced-order model to approximate it, and our attention is focused on reducing the error with respect to a finite frequency H ∞ performance, which is the most remarkable difference between the proposed approach and the existing ones. First, by applying multiplier expansion, new conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are derived for characterizing the positive realness of the reduced-order model and the finite frequency H ∞ performance of the error system. A necessary and sufficient condition is then established for parameterizing a PR reduced-order model with finite frequency H ∞ approximation performance, based on which, an iterative algorithm is constructed for numerically exploring such a reduced-order model. Particularly, a partial multiplier expansion treatment is introduced, which greatly reduces the decision variables but does not cause conservatism to the derived conditions. The proposed method is also extended to robust passivity-reserving model reduction with polytopic uncertainty. Finally, we provide two numerical examples about RLC circuits to show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model reduction method.	approximation	Xianwei Li;Shen Yin;Huijun Gao	2014	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2014.07.001	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;calculus;control theory;mathematics	HPC	69.62901486935948	4.4065204181082835	69870

Given a Lie group action that generates transport along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration schemes based on Castell–Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell–Gaines methods are uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes. Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid body such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.	approximation algorithm;autonomous robot;nonlinear system;runge–kutta methods;simulation;time complexity	Simon J.

The kernels are given by a recursive sequence of linear PDE’s in the time domain, and an equivalent algebraic recursion in the Laplace domain. This is used to prove the convergence of the Volterra series to a (possibly weak) trajectory of the system, to provide a practicable value for the radius of convergence of the input in L∞(R+) and to compute a guaranteed error bound in L∞(R+) for the truncated series. The result is then extended to MIMO systems. A numerical simulation is performed on an academic SISO example, to illustrate how easily the truncated Volterra series can be implemented.

The main advantage of our approach is that only a finite number of terms in an asymptotic expansion are needed in order to obtain uniform control. Therefore there are no convergence issues involved. An application of these results is to show that Diophantine invariant tori and Aubry-Mather sets are stable under small perturbations.	jacobi method;perturbation theory;viscosity solution	Diogo A.

Canonical coordinates of the second kind is used for representing the Lie group locally by means of its corresponding Lie algebra. The coordinate map itself can, in many cases, be computed inexpensively, but the approach also involves the inversion of its di erential, a task that can be challenging. To succeed, it is necessary to consider carefully how to choose a basis for the Lie algebra, and the ordering of the basis is important as well. For semisimple Lie algebras, one may take advantage of the root space decomposition to provide a basis with desirable properties. The problem of ordering leads us to introduce the concept of an admissible ordered basis (AOB). The existence of an AOB is established for some of the most important Lie algebras. The computational cost analysis shows that the approach may lead to more e cient solvers for ODEs on manifolds than those based on canonical coordinates of the rst kind presented by Munthe-Kaas. Numerical experiments verify the derived properties of the new methods.

Considering the failure of the traditional irregular solution constructed with the power series, we adopt the corrected Fourier series with only limited smooth degree to approximate the nonsingular function in the interval [x 0 ,∞]. In order to guarantee the series’ uniform convergence and uniform approximation to the derived equation, we introduce constraint and compatibility conditions and hence completely determine all undetermined coefficients of the corrected Fourier series.Thus, whatwe found is not an asymptotic solution atx → ∞ (not to mention a so-called formal solution), but a solution in the interval [x 0 ,∞] with certain regularities of distribution. During the solution procedure, there is no limitation on the coefficient property of the equation; that is, the coefficients of the equation can be any complex constant, so that the solution method presented here is universal.	atx;approximation algorithm;bessel filter;coefficient;window function	Qinghua Zhang;Jian Ma;Yuanyuan Qu	2016	Int.

The obtained discrete solutions using the RK–Butcher algorithms are compared with STWS-I, STWS-II methods and with the exact solutions of the transistor circuit problems and are found to be very accurate. Stability analysis for the RK–Butcher algorithm is presented. Error graphs for time-invariant and time-varying cases are presented in a graphical form to show the efficiency of this method. This RK–Butcher algorithm can be easily implemented in a digital computer and the solution can be obtained for any length of time for this observer design of transistor circuit problem.

Applications of these polynomial extensions to the error analysis for the h-pFEM are presented."""	finite element method;polynomial	Benqi Guo;Jianming Zhang	2014	J.

On the other hand, projections in the L norm are available only on polynomials of degree ≤ k − 2 (directly from the degrees of freedom). Here we present a variant of VEM that allows the exact computations of the L projections on all polynomials of degree ≤ k. The interest of this construction is illustrated with some simple examples, including the construction of three-dimensional Virtual Elements, the treatment of lower order terms, the treatment of the right-hand side, and the L error estimates.	approximation;computation;distribution (mathematics);movie projector;point of view (computer hardware company);polynomial;projection-slice theorem;video projector	Bashir Ahmad;Ahmed Alsaedi;Franco Brezzi;L.

The control problem leads to so-called Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) variational inequalities, where the dike-increase and reinforcement times act as input quantities to the control problem. The HJB equations are solved numerically with an Essentially Non-Oscillatory (ENO) method. The ENO methodology is originally intended for hyperbolic conservation laws and extended to deal with diffusion-type problems in this work. The method is applied to the dike optimisation of an island, for both deterministic and stochastic models for the economic growth.	computation;computational finance;discretization;finite difference;gradient;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;initial condition;jacobi method;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimal control;point process;star height;stochastic process;system dynamics;value at risk;variational inequality;variational principle;viscosity solution	S.

It is already proven that the metric projection mapping onto SOC is strongly semismooth everywhere. However, whether such property holds for each slice of SOC has not been known yet. In this paper, by virtue of a new property of projection onto the closed and convex set with sufficiently smooth boundary, and some new results about projection onto axis-weighted SOC, we give an affirmative answer to this problem. Meanwhile, we also show Clarke’s generalized Jacobian and the directional derivative for the projection mapping onto a slice of SOC.	cone	Yingnan Wang;Naihua Xiu	2011	J.

We show that under a certain Chebyshev-type separation condition on its knots, a spline whose inner-products with a polynomial basis and boundary conditions are known, can be recovered using Total Variation norm minimization. The proof of the uniqueness of the solution uses the method of ‘dual’ interpolating polynomials and is based on [5], where the theory was developed for trigonometric polynomials. We also show results for the multivariate case.	algebraic equation;interpolation;polynomial basis;spline (mathematics);trigonometric polynomial	Tamir Bendory;Shai Dekel;Arie Feuer	2014	Journal of Approximation Theory	10.1016/j.jat.2014.03.001	gegenbauer polynomials;difference polynomials;mathematical analysis;kravchuk polynomials;koornwinder polynomials;topology;jacobi polynomials;discrete orthogonal polynomials;classical orthogonal polynomials;hahn polynomials;mathematics;geometry;orthogonal polynomials;macdonald polynomials;askey–wilson polynomials;algebra	Theory	76.30003577213563	16.86000634122025	74980

Attention is focused on double not-semi-simple and semi-simple eigenvalues, undergoing perturbations, either of regular or singular type. The use of integer (Taylor) or fractional (Puiseux) series expansions is discussed, and the analysis carried out both on the characteristic polynomial and on the eigenvalue problem. It is shown that semi-simple eigenvalues can admit fractional sensitivities when the perturbations are singular, conversely to the not-semi-simple case. However, such occurrence only manifests itself when a second-order perturbation analysis is carried out. As a main result, it is found that such over-degenerate case spontaneously emerges in bifurcation analysis, when one looks for the boundaries of the stability domain of circulatory mechanical systems possessing symmetries. A four degree-of-freedom system under a follower force is studied as an illustrative example. 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Then we use an interpolation inequality similar to the one proved in [P. Bégout and F. Soria, J. Differential Equations, 240 (2007), pp. 324–356] to obtain the explicit decay estimates of the energy for smooth initial data. The obtained decay rate depends on the geometric and topological properties of the network. We also give some examples of particular networks in which our results apply, yielding different decay rates.	dissipative system;interpolation;social inequality;software propagation;springer (tank)	Julie Valein;Enrique Zuazua	2009	SIAM J.

But, for the distribution of zeros of solutions of advanced differential equations, compared with those of delay differential equations, less is known up to now. This paper is devoted to the s tudy of the distribution of zeros of solutions of the following neutral advanced differential equations: Ix(t) + P(t )x( t + T)]' -Q(t)x(t + ~) = O, t >_ to, (1) where P(t) , Q(t) e C ([to, oc), R + ) , r, c re R +. (2) In this paper, we first give several lemmas which will enable us to prove our main results. Next, we study the distribution of zeros of solutions of equation (1). The estimate for the distance between adjacent zeros of the oscillatory solution of equation (1) is obtained. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate our results. 2.

Such a novel DTCVZD model is designed based on the elimination of an indefinite complex-valued error function, instead of a square-based non-negative energy function associated with the discrete-time complex-valued gradient-based dynamics (DTCVGD). Comparing with the well-known (generalized) Newton fractals (i.e., the famous fractals generated by the well-known Newton iteration), we find that the novel Zhang fractals synthesized by the proposed DTCVZD model incorporate such Newton fractals as special cases. The Zhang fractals generated by the novel DTCVZD model are completely different from Newton fractals. The DTCVZD model using different types of activation functions can be seen as a new iterative algorithm to generate new fractals, i.e., Zhang fractals.	algorithm;gradient;iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;newton fractal;newton's method;nonlinear system;whole earth 'lectronic link	Huarong Wu;Fen Li;Zhan Li;Yunong Zhang	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics	10.1109/ICAL.2012.6308160	mathematical optimization;discrete time and continuous time;mathematical analysis;fractal;nonlinear system;calculus;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	73.55483053956038	5.552638784253325	76320

Under suitable conditions we obtain the existence and uniqueness results of solutions to ISDEs. To prove this assertion we use idea of contraction principle and successive approximations. Furthermore, we use the method based on properties of linear transformations (LTM) to find the explicit solution of initial value problem for linear second-order differential equation with interval-valued forcing function and with interval initial values (IIVP). We apply the linear transformations method to two example problems including a vibrating mass and an electrical circuit. Finally, the method based on the analysis of a solution to real-valued second-order differential equation is investigated to solve interval-valued second-order differential equations with interval-valued coefficients, interval-valued forcing function and interval initial values. Some examples are presented to illustrate applicability of the proposed method.	approximation;assertion (software development);coefficient;linear logic	Ngo Van Hoa	2015	Inf.

These problems can have multiple dependent variables, multiorder fractional derivatives, multiorder integral derivatives and boundary conditions. For both problems, we obtain the Euler-Lagrange type necessary conditions which must be satisfied for the given functional to be extremum. Also, we apply the Rayleigh-Ritz method for solving the unconstrained general fractional variational problem depending on indefinite integrals. By this method, the given problem is reduced to the problem for solving a system of algebraic equations using shifted Legendre polynomials basis functions. An approximate solution for this problem is obtained by solving the system.

8427cedd461cf4df4d03f185e38ce32d91b4b6c5	stability analysis of a multi-layer tumor model with free boundary		Abstract In this paper we study a multi-layer tumor model which is expressed as a free boundary problem of a system of partial differential equations. The problem consists of two elliptic equations describing the distribution of nutrient concentration and the pressure between tumor cells, respectively, in an unbounded strip-like region in which the tumor occupies. This region has two disjoint boundaries: While the lower part is fixed, the upper part, which stands for the tumor surface, can move as the tumor grows. Under certain conditions, the problem can be proved to admit a unique equilibrium which corresponds to the flat upper boundary. We first convert the model into a parabolic differential equation in certain function space. Next we compute the spectrum of the linearized problem at the equilibrium. By applying the geometric theory of parabolic differential equations in Banach spaces, we prove that if the cell-to-cell adhesiveness coefficient γ is larger than a threshold value γ ∗ , then the unique flat equilibrium is asymptotically stable, whereas in the case 0 γ γ ∗ the flat equilibrium is unstable.

We derive the precise conditions ensuring the asymptotic stability of the positive equilibrium, with respect to two characteristic parameters of the system. It is shown that for certain values of these parameters, fold or Neimark–Sacker bifurcations occur, but codimension 2 (fold-Neimark–Sacker, double Neimark–Sacker and resonance 1:1) bifurcations may also be present. The direction and the stability of the Neimark–Sacker bifurcations are investigated by applying the center manifold theorem and the normal form theory. 2010 Elsevier Inc.

08d799016123671f158a28520cad89999382e23b	jordan algebra and control theory		In order to understand the governing principles of a specific topic, e.g., control design, and to be able to design efficient algorithms a sound mathematical framework is needed. Due to the complexity of the problems, however, there are different mathematical tools that fit to our needs and which highlights specifics aspects of a given field. In the recent research of the authors concerning global geometrical aspects of robust control theory it turns out that the proper mathematical language for the considerations seems to be a Jordan algebraic one, more precisely the framework of the Jordan pairs that is closely related to geometric, generalised projective geometric ideas. Moreover, this mathematical framework is closely related to the theory of unbounded and bounded symmetrical domains, where we can rediscover the concept of quadratic invariance, an efficient tool for the design of decentralized control systems. Since these mathematical tools seem to be completely unused in the previous control theoretical researches, in this paper we try to give a glimpse on the field. Our aim is to point out the main connections of this mathematical framework and control theory and to illustrate the potential of the framework for control problems.	algorithm;alpha compositing;control engineering;control theory;distributed control system;linear algebra;robust control	Z.

In this analysis we expand the global error in powers of ε and show that the coefficients of the error are the global errors of the IMEX Runge–Kutta method applied to a differential-algebraic system. Interesting convergence results of these errors and of the remainder of the expansion allow us to determine sharp error bounds for stiff problems. As a representative example of stiff problems we have chosen the van der Pol equation. We illustrate that the theoretical prediction is confirmed by the numerical test. Specifically, an order reduction phenomenon is observed when the problem becomes increasingly stiff. In particular, making several assumptions, we try to improve global error estimates of several IMEX Runge–Kutta methods existing in the literature.		Sebastiano Boscarino	2007	SIAM J.

We obtain the exact values on the real parameter M for which the related Green's function is negative in (0, 1) i? (0, 1). Such property is equivalent to the fact that the operator satisfies a maximum principle in the space of functions that fulfil the homogeneous boundary conditions.When M > 0 the best estimate follows from spectral theory. When M < 0, we obtain an estimation by studying the disconjugacy properties of the solutions of the homogeneous equation u(4) + Mu = 0. The optimal value is attained by studying the exact expression of the Green's function. Such study allow us to ensure that there is no real parameter M for which the Green's function is positive on (0, 1) i? (0, 1).Moreover, we obtain maximum principles of this operator when the solutions verify suitable non-homogeneous boundary conditions.We apply the obtained results, by means of the method of lower and upper solutions, to nonlinear problems coupled with these boundary conditions.

Such occurrence consists in the slow convergence of orbits near non-hyperbolic parametric periodic points. We provide a precise new definition of the slowness of convergence which is based on literature results for the critical exponents associated with parametric periodic points. Such exponents establish a general classification for slow systems and provide a measure of rates of convergence. For dynamical systems whose iteration functions have Taylor series expansions, the new definition is natural with wider applicability. However, it can be also used for iteration functions where a more sophisticated approach, such as a Lagrange expansion, is needed. In addition, we show that even for such iteration functions, the critical exponent can be easily computed. The presented theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples having different rates of convergence.	dynamical system	Francisco J. Solis;Benito M. Chen-Charpentier;Hristo V.

In this paper we show that, using a particular nonlinear scaling, these terms in the phase equation can be eliminated, which simplifies the (diffeomorphic) normal form given by [Yu, 1999]. Besides, we have also treated the Neimark– Sacker and Generalized Neimark–Sacker bifurcations, the corresponding discrete cases of the Hopf and Generalized Hopf, obtaining results which are similar to the continuous ones.	bifurcation theory;hopf bifurcation;image scaling;nonlinear system;singularity project	J.

Starting from an algebra with a derivation and integration operator, we construct a ring of linear integro-differential operators that is expressive enough for specifying regular boundary problems with arbitrary Stieltjes boundary conditions as well as their solution operators. Based on these structures, we define a new multiplication on regular boundary problems in such a way that the resulting Green’s operator is the reverse composition of the constituent Green’s operators. We provide also a method for lifting any factorization of the underlying differential operator to the level of boundary problems. Since this method only needs the computation of initial value problems, it can be used as an effective alternative for computing Green’s operators in case one knows how to factor the given differential operators.	baxter (robot);bilinear filtering;buchberger's algorithm;cobham's thesis;commutation theorem;computation;directional derivative;first-order predicate;floor and ceiling functions;image;integer factorization;irreducibility;lambda lifting;levinson recursion;linear algebra;linear system;mv-algebra;nonlinear system;pc bruno;polynomial;recurrence relation;singular value decomposition;well-posed problem;whole earth 'lectronic link;word lists by frequency	Markus Rosenkranz;Georg Regensburger	2008	J.

We place our study within the mathematical theory of random dynamical systems and apply the concept of a random fixed point which is tailor-made for the study of the long-term behavior of sample-paths in stochastic systems. The main tool for the application of this approach is a Banach-type fixed point theorem for non-stationary random dynamical systems which is proved here. The concept and the theorem are thoroughly explained and illustrated by examples from stochastic growth theory.	dynamical system;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point theorem;nonlinear system;stationary process;stochastic process	Klaus Reiner Schenk-Hoppé	2002	Annals OR	10.1023/A:1021074506105	economics	Theory	75.03491768752504	6.829049415210177	79742

These filters employ a model where the disturbances have finite power. The HJB equation for the filter information state is a first-order equation with a term that is quadratic in the gradient. Yet the solution operator is linear in the max-plus algebra. This property is exploited by the development of a numerical algorithm where the effect of the solution operator on a set of basis functions is computed off-line. The precomputed solutions are stored as vectors of coefficients of the basis functions. These coefficients are then used directly in the real-time computations.	algorithm;basis function;bellman equation;coefficient;computation;first-order reduction;gradient;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;jacobi method;numerical analysis;online and offline;precomputation;real-time clock;real-time computing;state (computer science)	Wendell H.

796a68c61df6db087e029e52d6846629b5a04c38	a generalized definition of caputo derivatives and its application to fractional odes		\bfA \bfb \bfs \bft \bfr \bfa \bfc \bft . We propose a generalized definition of Caputo derivatives from t = 0 of order \gamma \in (0, 1) using a convolution group, and we build a convenient framework for studying initial value problems of general nonlinear time fractional differential equations. Our strategy is to define a modified Riemann--Liouville fractional calculus which agrees with the traditional Riemann--Liouville definition for t > 0 but includes some singularities at t = 0 so that the group property holds. Then, making use of this fractional calculus, we introduce the generalized definition of Caputo derivatives. The new definition is consistent with various definitions in the literature while revealing the underlying group structure. The underlying group property makes many properties of Caputo derivatives natural. In particular, it allows us to deconvolve the fractional differential equations to integral equations with completely monotone kernels, which then enables us to prove the general comparison principle with the most general conditions. This then allows for a priori energy estimates of fractional PDEs. Since the new definition is valid for locally integrable functions that can blow up in finite time, it provides a framework for solutions to fractional ODEs and fractional PDEs. Many fundamental results for fractional ODEs are revisited within this framework under very weak conditions.	convolution;fractional fourier transform;nonlinear system;monotone	Lei Li;Jian-Guo Liu	2018	SIAM J.

The nonlinear terms have the form (ri) = (p, + ') (ri) ® (ri) +. . . , i where p~k)(u), etc., are linear operators. The global modes approach applied to analyze the linear stability of (1) entails nothing more than the implementation of the usual spectral analysis of the associated eigenvalue problem in which all spatial directions are considered as eigendirections. As a result, the critical value of the bifurcation parameter ac is determined when the most unstable eigenvalue crosses the imaginary axis from left to right. However, global analysis does not reveal the intrinsic wavenumber structure of the solution in the unstable region as a local approach would. This information is essential in the rigorous investigation of the weakly nonlinear regime. In the case e* = 0, the local approach results in the classical picture, where for a > ac the solution grows for ranges of wavenumbers forming the instability regions in the space (a, k) with envelope(s), referred to as marginal stability curve(s) tha t correspond to the set of wavenumbers that neither grow nor decay. Thus, we have the following. DEFINITION 1. The marginal stability curve &(k) consists of the set of points in the space (a, k), such that the norm of the solution []ri[l(t; 5) for the linear part of (1) neither grows nor decays with time (i.e., it is either constant or oscillatory), and is defined from the linear part of (1) with fi0 = 6(k 5 -1 (k ) ) and £2{~-=0. The solution, in view of the fact tha t the system is local in k, has a point support in wavenumber space (Dirac delta-function) which corresponds to a harmonic function in physical space, thus, justifying normal mode analysis. As soon as e* fi 0, Definition 1 no longer applies since one cannot expect, in general, a solution with point support in wavenumber space, or, more transparently, a solution of harmonic form in physical space, in view of the lack of translational invariance in x. On the contrary, the assumption of existence of a solution with point support for the linearization of (1) immediately leads to a contradiction since the convolution integral (2) results in a continuous function of k, while the other terms give rise to delta-functions. Subsequently, this necessitates a new definition of marginal stability which includes the case e* = 0 as a limit. Before elaborating on this, let us consider a simple example demonstrat ing all necessary important features: Ou 02u + a ~xx + ae2""""~:u + N(u), (3) where x E R, t E R +, a E C, [u[ < oo. For convenience let us assume tha t i f a is real then sign a = sign x. The linear s tat ionary neutral solution is written as UO = Cle-aXe i (a'/2/a) [e°'-l] + C2e -axei (a'/ala) [e°~ -11 (4) S p a t i a l l y D e v e l o p i n g F lows 331 ( i ) I f a 0, then the neutral solution in physical space has the well-known form C e -ial/2z uo(z) = Cle ~ / ~ + 2 , (5) and, correspondingly, in Fourier space it has a singular character (Dirac delta-functions). Subsequently, the neutral curve is of the shape a = k 2, where k is wavenumber (ii) If a -= ie ' , then it is easy to observe that the solution (4) tends to (5) nonuniformly in x as C ~ +0. The last fact may have an effect in wavenumber space, since the Fourier transformation is nonlocal. If a 1/2 ~,~ e*, expression (4), in view of its periodicity with period T = 2u/e* and slow divergence of nonparallel effects, has the asymptotic form for e* << 1 ~ ~ V -i7~ .

(iii) If I m a = ~* -0 in (3), solution (4) is absolutely integrable for a ~ 0, but due to the exponentially divergent properties of nonparallel effects, the limit ~* ~ 0 does not produce a Dirac delta-function sequence uo(k; ~) ~ c T~/2 ~ e,{( . /4)+(k_~, , ,_~n(k/~.2)) / .} + 0 (~*) The fast divergence properties are reflected in the presence of the O(e*1) region in which the difference in phase with the harmonic function e (V-~z is significant and leads to the above asymptot ic behavior. From the example, we conclude that it is possible to have singular behaviors: one solution corresponds to tha t of the originally parallel solution obtained by setting e* = 0, and the other is obtained by taking the limit e* ~ +0. Historically, it is accepted that in the case e* ~ 0 there exists a marginal stability curve ~(k) in the space (k, a), on which disturbances neither grow nor decay. In the parallel case (e* 0) the situation is very simple since disturbances of different wavenumbers are decoupled, thus, corresponding to the local case. In our case, the disturbance of a particular wavenumber is coupled nonlocaUy to all wavenumbers as indicated by (2). As one may conclude from the above example, the case e* ¢ 0 does not conform to the standard concept of a marginal stability curve: the support of the neutral solution u0(k ,a ) (more precisely, the support contributing to the norm) is a region, as shown in Figure 1, which we call the marginal stability region. 332 R .

The wellknown analytic solution to this problem is given by a suitable inverse nonlinear Fourier transform (also known as inverse scattering transform) of the specificed reflection coefficient. Many different algorithms have been proposed to compute this inverse nonlinear Fourier transform numerically. The most efficient ones require O(D) floating point operations (flops) to generate D samples of the grating profile. In this paper, two new fast inverse nonlinear Fourier transform algorithms that require only O(D log D) flops are proposed. The merits of our algorithms are demonstrated in numerical examples, in which they are compared to a conventional layer peeling method, the Toeplitz inner bordering method and integral layer peeling. One of our two algorithms also extends to the design problem for fiber-assisted codirectional couplers, which in turn also arises in modulation step of the nonlinear inverse synthesis method for fiber-optic communications.	acoustic coupler;experiment;flops;fiber-optic communication;flip-flop (electronics);generalized linear model;iterative method;matthews correlation coefficient;modulation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optical fiber;reflection coefficient;toeplitz hash algorithm	Sander Wahls;Vishal Vaibhav	2016	CoRR		electronic engineering;pure mathematics;mathematics;optics	ML	80.89640782111013	15.007338296441581	81467

We developed a method to compute an associate incomplete elliptic integral of the third kind, J(φ, n|m) ≡ [Π(φ, n|m) − F(φ|m)]/n, by the half argument formulas of the sine and cosine amplitude functions and the double argument transformation of the integral. The relative errors of J(φ, n|m) computed by the new method are sufficiently small as less than 20 machine epsilons. Meanwhile, the simplicity of the adopted algorithm makes the new method run 1.5 to 3.7 times faster than Carlson’s duplication method. The combination of the new method and that to compute simultaneously two other associate incomplete elliptic integrals of the second kind, B(φ|m) ≡ [E(φ|m)−(1−m)F(φ|m)]/m andD(φ|m) ≡ [F(φ|m)−E(φ|m)]/m, which we established recently [23], enables a precise and fast computation of arbitrary linear combination of Legendre’s incomplete elliptic integrals of all three kinds, F(φ|m), E(φ|m), and Π(φ, n|m). These new procedures share the same device, the half argument transformations, while the double argument transformation of J(φ, n|m) includes those of B(φ|m) and D(φ|m) as its sub component. As a result, the simultaneous computation of the three associate integrals is significantly faster than computing them separately. In fact, our combined procedure is 2.7 to 5.9 times faster than the combination of Carlson’s duplication method to compute RD and RJ . © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

d99d579fe10d0a8309c2452186507ee5e6db535d	a new numerical method for solving high-order fractional eigenvalue problems	high order;numerical method;backward substitution method;caputo derivative;fractional eigenvalue problems;method of external excitation	The paper presents a new numerical method for solving eigenvalue problems for fractional high-order differential equations with variable coefficients. It combines two techniques: the method of external excitation (MEE) and the backward substitution method (BSM). The first one is a mathematical model of physical measurements when a mechanical, electrical or acoustic system is excited by some source, and resonant frequencies can be determined by using the growth of the amplitude of oscillations near these frequencies. The BSM consists of replacing the original equation by an approximate equation which has an exact analytic solution with a set of free parameters. These free parameters are determined by the use of the collocation procedure. Some examples are given to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the new method, and a comparison is made with the existing results. In particular, fractional problems of the fourth, sixth and eighth orders are considered. The numerical results show that the proposed method is of a high accuracy and is efficient for solving a wide class of eigenvalue problems	acoustic cryptanalysis;approximation algorithm;black–scholes model;coefficient;collocation;linear equation;mathematical model;numerical method;openbsm;point of view (computer hardware company);resonance;substitution method	Sergiy Yu.

These features arise from the nonunimodality of this map. We show that there exists a variety of types of critical points, which are characterized by a universal self-similar topography in a neighborhood of each critical point in the parameter plane. Such universalities are associated with various cycles of Feigenbaum's renormalization group equation.	chua's circuit;self-similarity;universality probability	Alexander P. Kuznetsov;Sergey P.

A complete general parametric solution in a neat explicit closed form is established using the F-coprimeness condition. The primary feature of this solution is that the matrix F does not need to be in any canonical form, or may be even unknown a priori. The matrix R, together with the matrix F, may be both set undetermined and used as degrees of freedom beyond the completely free parameter matrix Z. The results provide great convenience to the computation and analysis of the solutions to this class of equations, and can perform important functions in many control systems analysis and design problems involving second-order dynamical systems.	computation;control system;dynamical system;navier–stokes equations;structured systems analysis and design method;the matrix	Guang-Ren Duan	2013	2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606408	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;sylvester's law of inertia;calculus;sylvester equation;mathematics;state-transition matrix	Robotics	70.73057784446183	4.437660555806587	82733

Except for some regularity conditions, such triangular form is flat. This may lead to the discovery of new flat systems. The proof relies on well-known results for driftless systems with two controls (the chained form) and on geometric tools from exterior differential systems. The paper also illustrates the application of its results on an academic example and on a reduced order model of an induction motor.	nonlinear system;triangular matrix	Hector Bessa Silveira;Paulo Sérgio Pereira da Silva;Pierre Rouchon	2015	Eur.

This is due to their low dimensional Markovian representation, which greatly simplifies their numerical implementation. We present a qualitative study of the solutions of the quasi-Gaussian log-normal HJM model. Using a small-noise deterministic limit we show that the short rate may explode to infinity in finite time. This implies the explosion of the Eurodollar futures prices in this model.

f0a51dd6d6f2deae1ebe34f4ee8bec0124b1e1c3	a unified approach to construct generalized b-splines for isogeometric applications		Generalized B-splines have been employed as geometric modeling and numerical simulation tools for isogeometric analysis (IGA for short). However, the previous models used in IGA, such as trigonometric generalized B-splines or hyperbolic generalized B-splines, are not the unified mathematical representation of conics and polynomial parametric curves/surfaces. In this paper, a unified approach to construct the generalized non-uniform B-splines over the space spanned by {α(t), β(t), ξ(t), η(t), 1, t, · · · , tn−4} is proposed, and the corresponding isogeometric analysis framework for PDE solving is also studied. Compared with the NURBS-IGA method, the proposed frameworks have several advantages such as high accuracy, easy-to-compute derivatives and integrals due to the non-rational form. Furthermore, with the proposed spline models, isogeometric analysis can be performed on the computational domain bounded by transcendental curves/surfaces, such as the involute of circle, the helix/helicoid, the catenary/catenoid and the cycloid. Several numerical examples for isogeometric heat conduction problems are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.	computer simulation;finite element method;geometric modeling;in-game advertising;isogeometric analysis;non-uniform rational b-spline;numerical analysis;polynomial;spline (mathematics)	Gang Xu;Ningning Sun;Jinlan Xu;Kin-Chuen Hui;Guozhao Wang	2017	J.

Different from the results in reference (Hernández and Salanova, J. Comput. Appl. Math. 126:131–143, 2000), the Hölder continuity of the second derivative is replaced by its generalized continuity condition, and the latter is weaker than the former. Using the recurrence relations, we establish the semilocal convergence of these methods and prove a convergence theorem to show the existence-uniqueness of the solution. The R-order of these methods is also analyzed. Especially, when the second derivative of the operator is Hölder continuous, the R-order of these methods is at least 3 + 2p, which is higher than the one of Chebyshev method considered in reference (Hernández and Salanova, J. Comput. Appl. Math. 126:131–143, 2000) under the same condition.

Within the constructive algebraic analysis approach to multidimensional (nD) linear systems theory, this equivalence issue is studied by means of isomorphisms of finitely presented modules. In this paper, we prove that every linear 2D discrete repetitive process is equivalent to an explicit linear 2D discrete Roesser model. Comparing this result to [4], [5] where input / output equivalence is concerned, we point out the differences between these two algebraic notions of equivalence while each notion has interesting applications in nD systems theory.	graph isomorphism;input/output;linear algebra;linear system;systems theory;turing completeness	Olivier Bachelier;Thomas Cluzeau	2017	2017 10th International Workshop on Multidimensional (nD) Systems (nDS)	10.1109/NDS.2017.8070612	constructive;systems theory;algebraic analysis;discrete mathematics;equivalence (measure theory);isomorphism;algebraic number;matrix equivalence;linear system;mathematics	Theory	70.06620076398958	6.550923904902783	83374

This method is well-suited for two classes of problems: (1) analytic integrands over general regions in two dimensions, and (2) families of analytic integrands with special algebraic structure over hyperrectangular regions in higher dimensions.The algebraic theory of multivariate interpolation via natural tensor product series was developed in the doctoral thesis by Chapman, who named this broad new scheme of bilinear series expansions """"Geddes series"""" in honour of his thesis supervisor. This paper describes an efficient adaptive algorithm for generating bilinear series of Geddes-Newton type and explores applications of this algorithm to multiple integration. We will present test results demonstrating that our new adaptive integration algorithm is effective both in high dimensions and with high accuracy. For example, our Maple implementation of the algorithm has successfully computed nontrivial integrals with hundreds of dimensions to 10-digit accuracy, each in under 3 minutes on a desktop computer.Current numerical multiple integration methods either become very slow or yield only low accuracy in high dimensions, due to the necessity to sample the integrand at a very large number of points. Our approach overcomes this difficulty by using a Geddes-Newton series with a modest number of terms to construct an accurate tensor-product approximation of the integrand. The partial separation of variables achieved in this way reduces the original integral to a manageable bilinear combination of integrals of essentially half the original dimension. We continue halving the dimensions recursively until obtaining one-dimensional integrals, which are then computed by standard numeric or symbolic techniques."""	adaptive algorithm;adaptive quadrature;algebraic equation;approximation;bilinear filtering;desktop computer;division by two;finite difference;linear algebra;maple;multivariate interpolation;newton polynomial;newton's method;numerical analysis;recursion	Orlando A.

Model order reduction (MOR) techniques can be used to facilitate the simulation of TDSs. On the other hand, many kinds of variations, such as temperature and geometric uncertainties, can have significant impact on the transient responses of TDSs. Therefore, it is important to preserve parametric dependence during the MOR procedure. This paper presents a new parameterized MOR scheme for TDSs with parameter variations. We derive parameterized reduced-order models (ROMs) for TDSs using balanced truncation by approximating the Gramians in the multi-dimensional space of parameters. The resulting ROMs can preserve the parametric dependence, making it efficient for repeated simulations under different parameter settings. Numerical examples are presented to verify the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed algorithm. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

3fc0e537eb04aaf5da4c7d0f96bf49f122077622	real-time global optimization using multiple units		Abstract   Abstract  Extremum-seeking schemes are real-time optimization methods that control the gradient to zero. Most of these methods can converge only to the closest local optimum, though recently, some schemes have been proposed for global optimization of a restrictive class of nonlinear maps. In this paper, the multi-unit optimization framework is used, where an offset is introduced between the inputs of two identical units and the gradient is estimated by finite difference. It is shown that if the offset is reduced to zero, the system can be made to converge to the global optimum for all nonlinear continuous static, scalar maps. Several illustrative examples are presented to show the capability of this methodology.	global optimization;mathematical optimization;real-time transcription	F.

Their biological modeling poses several computational challenges. In such models, indeed, the evolution of a size structured consumer described by a Volterra functional equation (VFE) is coupled to the evolution of an unstructured resource described by a delay differential equation (DDE), resulting in dynamics over an infinite dimensional state space. As additional complexities, the right-hand sides are both of integral type (continuous age distribution) and given implicitly through external ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Moreover, discontinuities in the vital rates occur at a maturation age, also given implicitly through one of the above ODEs. With the aim at studying the local asymptotic stability of equilibria and relevant bifurcations, we revisit a pseudospectral approach recently proposed to compute the eigenvalues of the infinitesimal generator of linearized systems of coupled VFEs/DDEs. First, we modify it in view of extension to nonlinear problems for future developments. Then, we consider a suitable implementation to tackle all the computational difficulties mentioned above: a piecewise approach to handle discontinuities, numerical quadrature of integrals, and numerical solution of ODEs. Moreover, we rigorously prove the spectral accuracy of the method in approximating the eigenvalues and how this outstanding feature is influenced by the other unavoidable error sources. Implementation details and experimental computations on existing available data conclude the work.	computation;dynamic data exchange;integer (computer science);nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical integration;numerical partial differential equations;population;pseudospectral optimal control;state space	Dimitri Breda;P.

The algorithm is based on the resolvent formalism used in complex analysis to study the spectrum of matrices. The input of the algorithm are the matrix coefficients of the power series expansion of the perturbed matrix. The matrix coefficients of the Laurent expansion of the inverse are computed using recursive analytical formulae. We show that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm grows algebraically with the size of the matrix, but exponentially with the order of the singularity. We apply this algorithm to several matrices that arise in applications. We make special emphasis to interpolation problems with radial basis functions.	algorithm;coefficient;computation;condition number;like button;linear system;maple;numerical analysis;semiconductor industry;technological singularity;the matrix;wolfram mathematica	Pedro González-Rodríguez;Miguel Moscoso;Manuel Kindelan	2015	J.

The problem has been studied in recent years for systems modeled as structured potential-driven systems, for example gradient systems, generalized Hamiltonian systems and systems given in Brayton-Moser form. To recover the advantages of those representations for the stabilization of general nonlinear systems, the present note proposes a geometric decomposition technique to re-express a given vector field into a desired potential-driven form. The decomposition method is based on the Hodge decomposition theorem, where a one-form associated to the given vector field is decomposed into its exact, co-exact, and harmonic parts.	nonlinear system	Martin Guay;Nicolas Hudon	2013		10.3182/20130904-3-FR-2041.00191	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	EDA	70.60437456206853	4.669088898994605	85886

In order to overcome the problem we would apply the theory of epidemic dynamics for safety cultures dissemination. In the paper, an ICB (the people in an organization divided into three groups: incomprehension, comprehension and oblivion) mathematic model will be constructed for safety culture dissemination based on nonlinear dynamic. From the Lyapunov Function, the stability of the mathematical model is proved, and two global asymptotically stable conditions are obtained. The influence of propagation factors and initial conditions on safety culture dissemination is shown. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper is demonstrated by using of five numerical examples. These results will provide certain theoretical guidance and brings some new idea for safety science.	cardiomyoplasty;correctness (computer science);initial condition;lyapunov fractal;mathematical model;mathematics;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;software propagation	Jin Liu;Ziqiang Qiao;Zhengyang Wu;Qi Han	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8217314	stability theory;engineering;nonlinear system;safety culture;correctness;control theory;lyapunov function;comprehension;exponential stability	Robotics	77.64414612007513	4.239886087878226	85944

Theorems are proved which justify the construction of good lattice rules one component at a time – that is, the lattice rule for dimension s+ 1 is obtained from the rule for dimension s by searching over all possible choices of the (s+ 1)th component, while keeping all the existing components unchanged. The construction, which goes against accepted wisdom, is illustrated by numerical examples. The construction is particularly useful if the components of the integrand are ordered, in the sense that the first component is more important than the second, and so on.	numerical analysis	Ian H.

A backward analysis for variable stepsize one-step methods is developed, and it is shown that the numerical solution of a symmetric one-step method, implemented with a reversible stepsize strategy, is formally equal to the exact solution of a perturbed differential equation, which again is reversible. This explains geometrical properties of the numerical flow, such as the nearby preservation of invariants. In a second part, the efficiency of symmetric implicit Runge–Kutta methods (linear error growth when applied to integrable systems) is compared with explicit nonsymmetric integrators (quadratic error growth).	dynamical system;numerical analysis;numerical integration;numerical partial differential equations;runge–kutta methods	Ernst Hairer;Daniel Stoffer	1997	SIAM J.

We first provide an analysis of the integrator when applied for SDEs (finite dimension), where we prove that the method has order 2 for the approximation of the invariant distribution, instead of 1. We then perform a stability analysis of the integrator in the semilinear SPDE context, and we prove in a linear case that a higher order of convergence is achieved. Numerical experiments, including the semilinear heat equation driven by space-time white noise, confirm the theoretical findings and illustrate the efficiency of the approach.	additive model;approximation;commutation theorem;euler;euler–maruyama method;experiment;numerical method;order of accuracy;overhead (computing);parabolic antenna;rate of convergence;semilinear response;utility functions on indivisible goods;white noise	Charles-Edouard Bréhier;Gilles Vilmart	2016	SIAM J.

By leveraging on some simple examples, we introduce the most fundamental concept of mean field games recently introduced by Lasry and Lions [J.-M. Lasry, P.-L. Lions, Mean field games, Jpn. J. Math. 2 (1) (2007) 229-260]. The main interest of mean field games in our work is to simplify the interactions between pedestrians.

2b4213a898ba791f5d5437a2966c1b68fccb9b0f	constructing a simple chaotic system with an arbitrary number of equilibrium points or an arbitrary number of scrolls		In a typical 3D smooth autonomous chaotic system, such as the Lorenz and the Rssler systems, the number of equilibria is three or less and the number of scrolls in their attractors is two or less. Today, we are able to construct a relatively simple smooth 3D autonomous chaotic system that can have any desired number of equilibria or any desired number of scrolls in its chaotic attractor. Nowadays it is known that a 3D quadratic autonomous chaotic system can have no equilibrium, one equilibrium, two equilibria, or three equilibria. Starting with a chaotic system with only one stable equilibrium, by adding symmetry to it via a suitable local diffeomorphism, we are able to transform it to a locally topologically equivalent chaotic system with an arbitrary number of equilibria. In so doing, the stability of the equilibria can also be easily adjusted by tuning a single parameter. Another interesting issue of constructing a 3D smooth autonomous chaotic system with an arbitrary number of scrolls is discussed next. To do so, we first establish a basic system that satisfies Shilnikovs inequalities. We then search for a heteroclinic orbit that connects the two equilibria of the basic system. Finally, we use a copy and lift technique and a switching control method to timely switch the dynamics between nearby sub-systems, thereby generating a chaotic attractor with multiple scrolls. Not only the number but also the positions of the scrolls in the chaotic attractor can be determined by our design method. This talk will briefly introduce the ideas and methodologies.	chaos theory	Guanrong Chen	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-00542-3_1	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;geometry	Theory	72.80187814127635	5.11730590300478	87675

Using an SIVS (susceptible – infected – vaccinated – susceptible) model as a basis, we describe the spread of an infectious disease in a population split into two regions. In each sub-population, both forward and backward bifurcations can occur. This implies that for disconnected regions, the two-patch system may admit several steady states. We consider traveling between the regions, and investigate the impact of spatial dispersal of individuals on the model dynamics. We establish conditions for the existence of multiple non-trivial steady states in the system, and we study the structure of the equilibria. The mathematical analysis reveals an unusually rich dynamical behavior, not normally found in the simple epidemic models. In addition to the disease free equilibrium, eight endemic equilibria emerge from backward transcritical and saddle-node bifurcation points, forming an interesting bifurcation diagram. Stability of steady states, their bifurcations and the global dynamics are investigated with analytical tools, numerical simulations, and rigorous set-oriented numerical computations.	backward compatibility;basis (linear algebra);bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;coexist (image);computation;control theory;dynamical system;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;simulation;steady state	Diána H.

Different from eliminating a square-based positive error-function associated with gradient-based dynamics (GD), the design method of Zhang dynamics (ZD) is based on the elimination of an indefinite (unbounded) error-function. In this paper, for the purpose of online solution of time-varying 4th root, both continuous-time ZD (CTZD) and discrete-time ZD (DTZD) models are developed and investigated. In addition, power-sigmoid activation function is exploited in Zhang dynamics, which makes ZD models possess the property of superior convergence and better accuracy. To summarize generalization for possible widespread application, such approach is further extended to general time-varying nonlinear equations solving. Computer-simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the ZD models for finding online time-varying 4th root and solving general time-varying equations.	activation function;computer simulation;gradient;nonlinear system;root-finding algorithm;sigmoid function	Yunong Zhang;Lin Xiao;Gongqin Ruan;Zhan Li	2010	Numerical Algorithms	10.1007/s11075-010-9410-0	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;mathematical economics	ML	73.5026052410684	5.27168244650483	88057

Using these results, we can implement the Divergence Theorem in three dimensions or the Green’s theorems in two dimensions. These theorems are of central importance in the applications of multidimensional integration. They also provide a strong correctness test for the implementation of our results in a computer algebra system. The resulting software can solve many of the two and some of the three dimensional integration problems in vector calculus textbooks. The three dimensional results are being extended.

Although the whole network of these pathways is far more complex than simple chemical reactions, one of the features of the proposed model is that it can capture the quadratic property of molecular interaction as well as the positivity properties of the state variables with a rather simple form. Based on this model, we derive a sufficient condition of the stability in the sense of Lyapunov, and present a method for estimating a positive invariant set depending on the initial state. We show that the proposed method is effective by numerical simulations of two fundamental biological models.	gene regulatory network;interactome;linear inequality;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;petri net;simulation;transduction (machine learning)	Yuji Okamoto;Jun-ichi Imura;Mariko Okada	2015	2015 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2015.7330759	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;control theory;mathematics	Comp.	76.0716322828709	4.587246670941802	88317

In many situations, the system of equations depend on parameters which are not exactly known. It is then natural to aim proving the existence of a solution for all values of these parameters in some given domains. This is the aim of the parametrization of existence tests. A new parametric existence test based on the Hansen-Sengupta operator is presented and compared to a similar one based on the Krawczyk operator. It is used as a basis of a fixed point iteration dedicated to rigorous sensibility analysis of parametric systems of equations. Notations Vectors are denoted by boldface symbols, and interval, interval vectors and matrices by bracketed symbols. Let f : E −→ F be a function, and X ⊆ dom(f). Then f(X) := {f(x) ∈ F|x ∈ X} is the range of f on X. 1. The Hansen-Sengupta Existence Test The presentation given here follows the one given by Neumaier in [4].

A development of an inverse first-order divided difference operator for multivariable function is applied to prove the local convergence order of the new method. The computational efficiency is compared with some known methods. It is proved that the new method is more efficient. Numerical experiments are performed, which support the theoretical results. From the comparison with some known methods it is observed that the new method remarkably saves the computational time in the high-precision computing.	computation;divided differences;experiment;finite difference;first-order reduction;iterative method;local convergence;nonlinear system;numerical method;rate of convergence;time complexity	Xiaofeng Wang;Tie Zhang;Wei-Yi Qian;Mingyan Teng	2015	Numerical Algorithms	10.1007/s11075-015-9960-2	local convergence;mathematical optimization;steffensen's method;mathematical analysis;nonlinear system;calculus;mathematics;iterative method;algebra	Robotics	82.61833070978359	18.038747218223108	88784

Convergence results for this method have been studied in [3, 4, 9, 12]. Here we show how to improve and extend these results. In particular, we use hypotheses on the second Fréchet derivative of the nonlinear operator instead of the third-derivative hypotheses employed in the previous results and we obtain Banach space versions of some results that were derived in [9, 12] only in the real or complex space. We also provide various examples that validate our results.	fréchet derivative;iterative method;midpoint method;nonlinear system	Ioannis K.

In modelling me- chanical systems the use of redundant coordinates and con- straints results in differential-algebraic equations, the integra- tion of which can lead to numerical instabilities, such as the so-called drift phenomenon. In [1] the authors have proposed a globally convergent conceptual continuous-time algorithm for the integration of constrained mechanical systems which ensures the existence of solutions and global attractivity of the solution manifold. The objective of this paper is to study the numerical implementation of the algorithm presented in [1]. In addition, the stability properties of the constrained system in the manifold are studied in both the continuous and discrete time cases. The proposed technique is illustrated by means of a simple example.	algebraic equation;algorithm;discretization;geographic coordinate system;linear algebra;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;simulation;solutions;manifold	Pierluigi Di Franco;Giordano Scarciotti;Alessandro Astolfi	2018	2018 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.23919/ECC.2018.8550189		Robotics	81.00103539790673	8.13453708322067	88902

There are many literatures on the blow-up result of solutions for the wave equation. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no blow-up result of solutions for von Karman equations. We investigate a finite time blow-up result of solutions with nonpositive initial energy as well as positive initial energy.		Jum Ran Kang	2018	Appl. Math.

Representation of the exact solution is given in the form of series in the reproducing kernel space, its approximate solution is obtained by truncating the series. The error of the approximate solution is monotone decreasing in the sense of k kW 2 1⁄20;1 , and the intrinsic merit of the method given in the paper lies in its speedy convergence.

Viewed as a first order Hamiltonian system in the variables (u, v ≡ ∂tu), the associated flow lets invariant the two dimensional space of (u, v) independent of x. It turns out that in this invariant space, there is a homoclinic orbit to the origin, and a family of periodic solutions inside the loops of the homoclinic orbit. In this paper we study the stability of these periodic orbits under the (KG) flow, i.e. when turning on the nonlinear interaction with the non stationary modes. By a shadowing method, we prove that around the periodic orbits, solutions stay close to them during a time of order (ln η), where η is the distance between the periodic orbit considered and the homoclinic orbit.	emoticon;kasparov's gambit;nonlinear system;stationary process;well-posed problem	Benoît Grébert;Tiphaine Jézéquel;Laurent Thomann	2015	J.

Since, presently, the convergence of spline solution of fifth-order boundary value problem is not found in the literature, therefore the convergence of the method is determined which is found to be of fifth order. The convergence of the method is the extension of that developed by Usmani and Sakai [Riaz A. Usmani, Manabu Sakai, Quartic spline solution of the third-order boundary value problems involving third-order differential equations, J. Math. Phys. Sci. 18 (4) (1984) 365–380] for the solution of third-order boundary value problem. The usefulness of the method is illustrated by four examples and confirm the convergence analysis of the method developed.	sextic equation;spline (mathematics)	Shahid S.

The method involved the solution of functional equations in which the functional was defined over a two-dimensional space. In this paper is formulated an alternative algorithm, using a different criterion function, that reduces to consideration of a functional of one variable. The criterion function gives the best least squares fit of (constant) slopes of line segments to the derivative  g′(x)  of the function  g(x) ; this leads to a class of solutions, from which is selected that which minimizes the original criterion function. An analogy to control theory along lines recently pointed out by Aoki is discussed.	curve fitting	Brian Gluss	1964	Information and Control	10.1016/S0019-9958(64)90109-3	mathematical optimization;computer science;calculus;mathematics;statistics;curve fitting	DB	69.67463782369116	16.63413871326729	91654

Various regulation motifs have been discovered or posited over the recent years, the most recent one being the so-called Antithetic Integral Control (AIC) motif [1]. Several favorable properties for the AIC motif have been demonstrated for classes of reaction networks that satisfy certain irreducibility, ergodicity and output controllability conditions. Here we address the problem of verifying these conditions for large sets of reaction networks with fixed topology using two different approaches. The first one is quantitative and relies on the notion of interval matrices while the second one is qualitative and is based on sign properties of matrices. The obtained results lie in the same spirit as those obtained in [1] where properties of reaction networks are independently characterized in terms of control theoretic concepts, linear programming conditions and graph theoretic conditions.	ampersand;computation;computational problem;ergodicity;graph theory;irreducibility;kinetics internet protocol;linear programming;mixed-signal integrated circuit;motif;np-hardness;polynomial matrix;scalability;semantic network;structural analysis;synthetic intelligence;systems and synthetic biology;verification and validation	Corentin Briat;Mustafa Khammash	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7798358	stochastic process;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;controllability;control theory;mathematics;negative feedback;integral equation;algorithm;statistics;robustness;algebra	Vision	75.7147630493629	5.148163866278889	92420

In many ways, this generalizes the Viability Theorem approach, which is itself a generalization of the Lyapunov function approach for systems described by ordinary differential equations. We give a computable criterion based on SoS methods for a class of differential inclusions to have a non-empty viability kernel within some given region. We use this method to prove the existence of (controlled) invariant sets of switched systems inside a region described by a polynomial template, both with time-dependent switching and with state-based switching through a finite set of hypersurfaces.

First, a formal fashion game model on a social network is given. Second, the utility function of each player is converted into an algebraic form via the semi-tensor product of matrices, based on which the case of two-strategy fashion game is studied and two methods are obtained for the case to verify the existence of PNE. Third, the multi-strategy fashion game model is investigated and an algorithm is established to find all the PNEs for the general case. Finally, two kinds of optimization problems, that is, the so-called social welfare and normalized satisfaction degree optimization problems are investigated and two useful results are given. The study of several illustrative examples shows that the new results obtained in this paper are effective.	computation;nash equilibrium;semiconductor industry	Peilian Guo;Yuzhen Wang	2016	J.

It is concluded that, by factorization, linear Fredholm equations can be effectively replaced by nonlinear Volterra equations. As a byproduct of the investigation, constructive proofs are obtained for existence and uniqueness of solutions to certain nonlinear systems of Volterra equations in two independent variables.

51f42e965291e91aa772dd1d5d50634f73add0e7	computation of optimal control problems with terminal constraint via variation evolution		Enlightened from the inverse consideration of the stable continuous-time dynamics evolution, the Variation Evolving Method (VEM) analogizes the optimal solution to the equilibrium point of an infinite-dimensional dynamic system and solves it in an asymptotically evolving way. In this paper, the compact version of the VEM is further developed for the computation of Optimal Control Problems (OCPs) with terminal constraint. The corresponding Evolution Partial Differential Equation (EPDE), which describes the variation motion towards the optimal solution, is derived, and the costate-free optimality conditions are established. The explicit analytic expressions of the costates and the Lagrange multipliers adjoining the terminal constraint, related to the states and the control variables, are presented. With the semi-discrete method in the field of PDE numerical calculation, the EPDE is discretized as finite-dimensional Initial-value Problems (IVPs) to be solved, with common Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) numerical integration methods.	computation;discretization;dynamical system;evolution;lagrange multiplier;numerical analysis;numerical integration;optimal control;semiconductor industry	Sheng Zhang;Bo Liao;Fei Liao	2018	CoRR		mathematics;mathematical optimization;lagrange multiplier;ordinary differential equation;partial differential equation;numerical integration;equilibrium point;discretization;optimal control;expression (mathematics)	Robotics	80.29197471329539	12.630185097299151	93226

The kernels of such equations have jump discontinuities along the continuous curves (endogenous delays) which start at the origin. In order to linearize these equations the modified Newton–Kantorovich iterative process is employed. Two direct quadrature methods based on the piecewise constant and piecewise linear approximation of the exact solution are proposed for linear solutions. The accuracy of proposed numerical methods is   O(1/N)     O   (  1  /  N  )         and   O(1/N 2 )     O   (  1  /    N    2    )         respectively. A certain iterative numerical scheme enjoying the regularization properties is suggested. Furthermore, generalized numerical method for nonlinear equations is adduced. The midpoint quadrature rule in all the cases is employed. In conclusion several numerical examples are applied in order to demonstrate the efficiency of proposed numerical methods.

As an efficient recovery method, `1-minimization can be used. We establish these results by verifying the restricted isometry property of a preconditioned random Legendre matrix. We then extend these results to a large class of orthogonal polynomial systems, including the Jacobi polynomials, of which the Legendre polynomials are a special case. Finally, we transpose these results into the setting of approximate recovery for functions in certain infinite-dimensional function spaces.	approximation algorithm;jacobi method;legendre polynomials;maximal set;polynomial;restricted isometry property;sparse matrix;verification and validation	Holger Rauhut;Rachel Ward	2012	Journal of Approximation Theory	10.1016/j.jat.2012.01.008	gegenbauer polynomials;legendre function;functional analysis;legendre's constant;chebyshev polynomials;difference polynomials;mehler–heine formula;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;jacobi polynomials;discrete orthogonal polynomials;legendre polynomials;associated legendre polynomials;legendre wavelet;classical orthogonal polynomials;mathematics;orthogonal polynomials;spherical harmonics;legendre's equation;algebra	Theory	74.83544524875556	16.813268688213114	93979

ca34a7f2bdabe206b24a91536b081a6f3355944a	some discrete inequalities for central-difference type operators		Discrete versions of basic inequalities in functional analysis such as the Sobolev inequality play key role in theoretical analysis of finite difference schemes. They have been shown for some simple difference operators, but are still left open for general operators, even including the standard central difference operators. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach for deriving such inequalities for a certain class of central-difference type operators. We illustrate the results by giving a generic a priori estimate for certain conservative schemes for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation.	finite difference method;nonlinear system;schrödinger;social inequality	Hiroki Kojima;Takayasu Matsuo;Daisuke Furihata	2017	Math.

We prove that the space Diff1(R) equipped with the homogeneous Sobolev metric of order one is a flat space in the sense of Riemannian geometry, as it is isometric to an open subset of a mapping space equipped with the flat L2-metric. Here Diff1(R) denotes the extension of the group of all either compactly supported, rapidly decreasing, or W∞,1diffeomorphisms, which allows for a shift toward infinity. Surprisingly, on the non-extended group the Levi-Civita connection does not exist. In particular, this result provides an analytic solution formula for the corresponding geodesic equation, the non-periodic Hunter–Saxton (HS) equation. In addition, we show that one can obtain a similar result for the two-component HS equation and discuss the case of the non-homogeneous Sobolev one metric, which is related to the Camassa–Holm equation.	gerchberg–saxton algorithm;isometric projection;team fortress 2	Martin Bauer;Martins Bruveris;Peter W.

4b8f365e30d207f4cd730dba678643b651923285	twisty takens: a geometric characterization of good observations on dense trajectories		In nonlinear time series analysis and dynamical systems theory, Takens’ embedding theorem states that the sliding window embedding of a generic observation along trajectories in a state space, recovers the region traversed by the dynamics. This can be used, for instance, to show that sliding window embeddings of periodic signals recover topological loops, and that sliding window embeddings of quasiperiodic signals recover high-dimensional torii. However, in spite of these motivating examples, Takens’ theorem does not in general prescribe how to choose such an observation function given particular dynamics in a state space. In this work, we state conditions on observation functions defined on compact Riemannian manifolds, that lead to successful reconstructions for particular dynamics. We apply our theory and construct families of time series whose sliding window embeddings trace tori, Klein bottles, spheres, and projective planes. This greatly enriches the set of examples of time series known to concentrate on various shapes via sliding window embeddings, and will hopefully help other researchers in identifying them in naturally occurring phenomena. We also present numerical experiments showing how to recover low dimensional representations of the underlying dynamics on state space, by using the persistent cohomology of sliding window embeddings and Eilenberg-MacLane (i.e., circular and real projective) coordinates.	dynamical systems theory;experiment;floris takens;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;quasiperiodicity;state space;time series;window function;x-machine	Boyan Xu;Christopher J.

For a completely integrable system, it is known that ergodicity can be characterized by a diophantine condition on its frequencies and that the two averages then coincide. In this paper, we show that we can improve the rate of convergence upon using a filter function in the time-averages. We then show that this convergence persists when a symplectic numerical scheme is applied to the system, up to the order of the integrator.	ergodicity;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);molecular dynamics;numerical analysis;observable;rate of convergence;simulation;symplectic integrator	Eric Cancès;François Castella;Philippe Chartier;Erwan Faou;Claude Le Bris;Frédéric Legoll;Gabriel Turinici	2005	Numerische Mathematik	10.1007/s00211-005-0599-0	mathematical analysis;superintegrable hamiltonian system;topology;calculus;mathematics;rate of convergence;algorithm;quantum mechanics	ML	81.76072989715627	9.010804780198502	94799

The expansions for FOIs of the first-order s-to-z transform proposed by Hsue et al. are obtained by using the Taylor series and continued fraction expansion techniques. Second-order Schneider operator and third-order Al-Alaoui–Schneider–Kaneshige–Groutage (Al-Alaoui–SKG) rule have also been fractionalized to obtain expansions of FODs by using the Taylor series. Specifically, in this paper, Hsue operator based on third-order and fourth-order models of FOI, Schneider operator as well as Al-Alaoui–SKG rule based on third-order, fourth-order, fifth-order and sixth-order models of FOD have been suggested. The stability of the proposed models has been investigated and the unstable ones were stabilized by the pole reflection method. The performance of the proposed models has been compared with that of recent FOD and FOI models based on the Al-Alaoui operator. Performance results using the proposed discrete-time formulations are found to converge to the analytical results of FOD and FOI, in the continuous-time domain.

Among others they have been used as model spaces in the theory of irregular sampling. This class of shift-invariant spaces is characterized by possessing a Riesz basis which consists of a set of translates along some lattice Λ of a finite family of atoms. Part of their usefulness relies on the explicit knowledge of the structure of the projection operator on such a space using the existence of a finite family of dual atoms. The main goal of this paper is to address the problems arising from the discrepancy between a constructive description and an implementable approximate realization of such concepts. Using function space concepts (e.g. Wiener amalgam spaces) we describe how approximate dual atoms can be computed for any given degree of precision. As an application of our result we describe the best approximation of Hilbert-Schmidt operators by generalized Gabor multipliers, using smooth analysis and synthesis windows. The Kohn-Nirenberg symbols of the rank-one operators formed from analysis and synthesis windows satisfy our general assumptions. Applications to irregular sampling are given elsewhere.	approximation algorithm;discrepancy function;gene expression programming;gramian matrix;microsoft windows;numerical method;sampling (signal processing);schmidt decomposition;spline (mathematics);window function	Hans G.

We transform proof traces from δ-complete decision procedures into interpolants that consist of Boolean combinations of linear constraints. The algorithms are guaranteed to find the interpolants between two formulas A and B whenever A ∧ B is not δ-satisfiable. At the same time, by exploiting δ-perturbations one can parameterize the algorithm to find interpolants with different positions between A and B. We show applications of the methods in control and robotic design, and hybrid system verification.	algorithm;conflict-driven clause learning;craig's theorem;disjunctive normal form;first-order predicate;hybrid system;nonlinear system;polynomial;radial (radio);radial basis function;robot;semidefinite programming;solver;spline (mathematics);spline interpolation;theory;tracing (software)	Sicun Gao;Damien Zufferey	2016		10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_41	discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Logic	69.42282176427982	9.374037466368573	95574

We begin this model by proving the positivity and boundedness of the solutions. Our model admits three possible equilibrium solutions, namely the infection-free equilibrium E0, the infectious equilibrium without immune response E1 and the infectious equilibrium with immune response E2. Moreover, by analyzing corresponding characteristic equations, the local stability of each of the feasible equilibria and the existence of Hopf bifurcation at the equilibrium point E2 are established, respectively. Further, by using fluctuation lemma and suitable Lyapunov functionals, it is shown that E0 is globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproductive numbers for viral infection R0 is less than unity. When the basic reproductive numbers for immune response R1 is less than unity and R0 is greater than unity, the equilibrium point E1 is globally asymptotically stable. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried out for illustrating the theoretical results.	bifurcation theory;computer simulation;hopf bifurcation;incidence matrix;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;petri net;quantum fluctuation	Ting Guo;Haihong Liu;Chenglin Xu;Fang Yan	2016	I.

By using a Samelson-like method recursively, we obtain a sequence of polynomials that converges to a factor p∗(z) of f(z) if an initial approximate factor p(z) is sufficiently close to p∗(z). This method includes some well known iterative formulae, and has a close relation to a rational approximation. According to this factoring method, a fixed point relation for p∗(z) is derived. Based on this relation, we obtain a polynomial with complex interval coefficients that includes p∗(z).	approximation algorithm;coefficient;fixed point (mathematics);integer factorization;iterative method;numerical analysis;polynomial;recursion;simple rational approximation	Tetsuya Sakurai;Hiroshi Sugiura	2000	Reliable Computing	10.1023/A:1009931231719	combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;analytic function;calculus;mathematics;geometry;factorization;algebra	Theory	78.5740569389814	17.52822040267592	95700

Thus, in numerous (computational) applications, for instant in electronics, in computers, in engineering, as well as, in financial issues, some elements of the control and system theory have been introduced. In this paper, we are interested to change instantly the state of linear matrix differential systems into zero time by using very appropriate inputs. Thus, our desired inputs are chosen to be sequences of Dirac function and its derivatives. A new algorithmic method for the approximation of the Dirac sequence and the calculations of the relative matrix coefficients is introduced. This approach extends further our knowledge to this issue.	algorithm;approximation;coefficient;computer;control system;dirac delta function;ground state;linear system;state space;systems theory	Athanasios D.

This method is based on a simple generalization of the well-known Sherman–Morrison formula to the infinite dimensional case. In particular, this method constructs a sequence of functions, that converges to the exact solution of the integral equation under consideration. A formal proof of this convergence result is provided for the case of Fredholm integral equations with L2 integral kernel.

The explicit formula of the structured condition number is derived with applying newly defined linear operators. The structured condition number can be applied to some important polynomial matrix equations, including the continuous-time algebraic Riccati equation (CARE), the discrete-time algebraic Lyapunov equation (DALE), etc. Compared with the state-of-the-art condition numbers for CARE and DALE, the newly proposed structured condition number can measure the sensitivity of the solution better, which is validated by numerical examples.	algebraic riccati equation;algebraic equation;condition number;control system;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;polynomial matrix	Zhigang Jia;Meixiang Zhao	2018	J.

We prove that any fractal distribution in the sense of Hochman is generated by a uniformly scaling measure, which provides a converse to a regularity theorem on the structure of distributions generated by the scenery flow. We further show that the collection of fractal distributions is closed under the weak topology and, moreover, is a Poulsen simplex, that is, extremal points are dense. We apply these to show that a Baire generic measure is as far as possible from being uniformly scaling: at almost all points, it has all fractal distributions as tangent distributions.	arc converter;dynamical system;ergodic theory;ergodicity;fractal;image scaling	Antti Käenmäki;Tuomas Sahlsten;Pablo Shmerkin	2015	J.

These results extend that ones in Barbu (2013), which provide a feedback controller expressed in terms of the eigenfunctions φj corresponding to the unstable eigenvalues {λj}j=1N of the operator corresponding to the linearised equation. In Barbu (2013), the stabilisability result is conditioned by the require of linear independence of {∂∂νφj}j=1N, on the part of the boundary where control acts. In this work, we design a similar control as in Barbu (2013), and show that it assures the stability of the system. This time, we drop the require of linear independence and any other additional hypothesis. Some examples are provided in order to illustrate the acquired results.

In terms of computational cost, all these methods require evaluations of one function, one first derivative and one second derivative per iteration. Numerical examples are given to support that the methods thus obtained are competitive with other robust methods of similar kind. Moreover, it is shown by way of illustration that the present methods, particularly fourth-order method, are very effective in high precision computations.	algorithm;arbitrary-precision arithmetic;computation;euler;experiment;iteration;newton;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;rate of convergence	Janak Raj Sharma;Rangan K.

This process generates a family of curves which depends on a time-like variable t . The best approximant is shown to be a stationary point of this evolution process, which is described by a differential equation. Solving it numerically by Euler’s method is shown to be related to Gauss–Newton iterations. Different ways of constructing suitable initial positions for the evolution are suggested. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

How data dependent, then, is the regularity of the limit of a nonlinear subdivision scheme? The answer is the most obvious it depends. In this paper, we prove that the nonlinear convexity preserving subdivision scheme developed independently by Floater/Micchelli [12] and Kuijt/van Damme [14] exhibits a rather strong nonlinear, data-dependent, behavior: For any ν ∈ (1, 2), there exists initial convex data such that the critical Hölder regularity of the limit curve is exactly ν. This result stands in contrast to what are reported in several recent publications on nonlinear subdivision schemes [18, 21, 20, 5], in which various families of nonlinear subdivision schemes are either proved or empirically observed to produce limit curves with smoothness insensitive to initial data.	data dependency;nonlinear system;relevance;subdivision surface	Thomas Pok-Yin Yu	2006	SIAM J.

This allows us to test the Jacobi identity definitely and efficiently and to provide equations between different components defining a potential Poisson bracket. We provide a simple Mathematica TM notebook which allows to perform this task conveniently, and which offers some additional functionalities of use within the framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics: reversible equations of change for fields, and the conservation of entropy during the reversible dynamics.

The Mathematica TM notebook provided here solves this problem using a novel symbolic approach based on inherent properties of the variational derivative, highly suitable for the present tasks. As a by product, calculations performed with the Poisson bracket assume a compact form. Solution method: The problem is first cast into a form which eliminates the need to perform partial integration for arbitrary functionals at the expense of performing variational derivatives. The corresponding equations are conveniently obtained using the symbolic programming environment Mathematica TM .

5874a736a01f2898be8c798f0b477514be458ac6	commutator estimate for nonlinear subdivision		Nonlinear multiscale algorithms often involve nonlinear perturbations of linear coarse-to-fine prediction operators S (also called subdivision operators). In order to control these perturbations, estimates of the “commutator” SF − FS of S with a sufficiently smooth map F are needed. Such estimates in terms of bounds on higher-order differences of the underlying mesh sequences have already appeared in the literature, in particular in connection with manifold-valued multiscale schemes.

5b4df30a0921ddab2da4bfd563c3c47e0329ed34	extended balanced truncation for continuous time lti systems		In this paper we develop a continuous time counterpart of the balancing approach based on the extended Gramians for discrete time LTI systems as given in [14]. The extended Gramians are solutions to LMI’s and can be seen as an extension/generalization of generalized Gramians which are solutions of the standard Lyapunov inequalities. These LMI’s are rather different from the discrete time case, and are coupled to dissipativity arguments related to storage functions that are instrumental for obtaining an a priori error bound if balanced truncation is applied based on these extended Gramians. The approach provides flexibility in choosing the Gramians based on which the model is truncated, in order to get a low error bound, and possibly preserve a desired structure such as a network structure.

We reformulate the bifurcation problem, introducing a new parameter; and in such a way we expel the trivial solution of the original problem. The Method of Variational Imbedding (MVI) is used for solving the inverse problem.

By applying the method of symbolic computation, we obtain the first three singular point quantities. It is proven that Lorenz system can generate 3 small limit cycles from each of the two symmetric equilibria. Furthermore, the center conditions are found and as weak foci the highest order is proved to be the third, thus we obtain at most 6 small limit cycles from the symmetric equilibria via Hopf bifurcation. At the same time, we realize also that though the same for the related three-dimensional chaotic systems, Lorenz system differs in Hopf bifurcation greatly from the Chen system and Lu system.	limit cycle;lorenz system	Qinlong Wang;Wentao Huang;Jingjing Feng	2014	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2014.04.034	center manifold;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;topology;period-doubling bifurcation;lorenz system;control theory;mathematics;saddle-node bifurcation;hopf bifurcation	ML	79.76140511118986	4.752903838713844	100950

Our study reveals how multistability and snaking behavior of plane waves emerge as time delay is introduced. For intermediate values of the delay, bifurcation diagrams are obtained by a combination of analytical and numerical methods. For large delays, using an asymptotic approach we classify plane wave solutions into strongly unstable, weakly unstable, and stable. The results of analytical bifurcation analysis are in agreement with those obtained by direct numerical integration of the model equation.	bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;broadcast delay;control theory;cubic function;experiment;feedback;instability;numerical integration;numerical method;quintic function;utility functions on indivisible goods	Dmitry Puzyrev;Serhiy Yanchuk;A.

Non linear polynomial, exponential, and trigonometric models are mathematically deduced and discussed. Analysis about their pros and cons, and their mathematical modelling are made on what method to chose for what type of highly non linear multi-dimension problems are more suitable to be solved. In this study only deterministic models with analytic solutions are involved, or parameters calculation by numeric methods, which the complete model can subsequently be treated as a theoretical model. Models deduction are summarised and presented as a survey.		Edgar A. Martínez-García;Nancy Ávila Rodríguez;Ricardo Rodríguez Jorge;Jolanta Mizera-Pietraszko;Jaichandar K.

More and more it becomes acknowledged in science and engineering, that these processes exhibit discontinuities. Our paper on theory of control (especially, optimal control) and on theory of dynamical systems gives a contribution to this natural or technical fact. One of the central results of our paper is the Pontryagin maximum principle [L.S. Pontryagin, V.G. Boltyanskii, R.V. Gamkrelidze, E.F. Mishchenko, The Mathematical Theory of Optimal Processes, Interscience Publishers, John Wiley, New York, 1962] which is considered in sufficient form for the linear case of impulsive differential equations. The problem of controllability of boundary-value problems for quasilinear impulsive system of integrodifferential equations is investigated. The control consists of a piecewise continuous function part as well as impulses which act at a variable time. By studying the optimal control of response, we give a first inclusion of an objective function. By this pioneering contribution, we invite to future research in the wide field of optimal control with impulses and in modern challenging applications. 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Eigenanalysis provides a way to determine derivative continuity at specific points based on the eigenvalues of a finite matrix. None of the well-known subdivision schemes for curves have complex eigenvalues. We prove when a convergent scheme with palindromic mask can have complex eigenvalues and that a lower limit for the size of the mask exists in this case. We find a scheme with complex eigenvalues achieving this lower bound. Furthermore we investigate this scheme numerically and explain from a geometric viewpoint why such a scheme has not yet been used in computer-aided geometric design.	coefficient;computer-aided design;dynamical system;geometric design;image scaling;iteration;numerical analysis;scott continuity;stationary process;subdivision surface;whole earth 'lectronic link	Christian Kühn	2008	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;mathematics;geometry;upper and lower bounds	Theory	76.31567180567434	16.57889800890924	101904

Firstly, we identify the critical values for stability switches, Hopf and double Hopf bifurcations. We show how the parameters affect the dynamical behavior of the system. Secondly, the normal forms near the Hopf and double Hopf bifurcations, as well as the classifications of local dynamics are analyzed. These bifurcations lead a chaotic system to be stable states, such as the coexistence of a pair of stable equilibria or a pair of stable periodic oscillations, and then chaos disappears. Numerical simulations are presented to verify the analytical predictions. Furthermore, detailed numerical analysis using MATLAB extends the local bifurcation analysis to a global picture, namely, a family of stable periodic solutions exist in a large region of delay and “chaos switchover” phenomenon appears. Therefore, in accordance with the above theoretical analysis, reasonable parameters can be designed in order to achieve various applications.	bifurcation theory;switchover	Yuting Ding;Jun Cao	2015	I.

e2bdfe42d4e55ea3851b51f22586362d2bffbd55	dynamic analysis of fractional-order singular holling type-ii predator-prey system		In this paper, a fractional-order singular (FOS) predator–prey model with Holling typeII functional response has been introduced, and the mathematical behavior of the model from the aspect of local stability is investigated. Through the fractional calculus and economic theory, a new and more realistic predator–prey model has been extended, and the solvability condition is presented. Besides, numerical simulations are considered to illustrate the effectiveness of the numerical method and confirm the theoretical results to explore the impacts of fractional-order and economic interest on the presented system in biological context. It is found that the presence of fractional-order in the differential model can improve the stability of the solutions and enrich the dynamics of system. In addition, singular models exhibit more complicated dynamics rather than standard models, especially the bifurcation phenomena, which can reveal the instability mechanism of systems. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In Seo et al. (2010, 2014) we studied two mathematical models of the iterative biochemical procedure known as SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential Enrichment): multiple target SELEX and alternate SELEX. It is the purpose of this paper to revisit the mathematics of these processes in the language of dynamical systems on compact manifolds but for a dynamical system on a manifold with compact closure. From the experimentalist’s point of view, multiple target SELEX provides a way of obtaining the best binding ligands to a pool of several fixed targets, whereas alternate SELEX provides a way to specify which of the best binding ligands also bind best to a specified subtarget. Because these procedures are iterative, it is natural to investigate them in the context of the theory of discrete dynamical systems. Although the iterative schemes are nonautonomous, they have the same limiting properties as two closely related autonomous iteration schemes, called simplified multiple target SELEX and simplified alternate SELEX. The iteration scheme defined by simplified multiple target SELEX (simplified MTS) is not defined by the gradient of a potential function as in the standard theory (Akins, 1993). However, there is associated with this scheme, a related function, called the efficiency. From its structure, we show that the basic sets for simplified MTS are the sets of extreme points of this function and only occur on the boundary of the compact manifold. Their union, together with the repeller manifold, constitutes the set of fixed points for the dynamics. We discuss the attracting properties of the basic sets for simplified MTS and multiple target SELEX (or positive SELEX). They can be ordered by their ability to attract the flows, from the strongest attracting set to the repeller manifold. Under the hypothesis that as the SELEX scheme evolves, fewer and fewer nucleic acids can bind with greater efficiency than the overall efficiency for the given round, we prove that simplified MTS possesses a set of global attractors with highest possible overall efficiency. We show that positive SELEX has the same basic sets and that the same attracting properties as simplified MTS hold when the total target concentration decreases neither too quickly nor too slowly as a function of iteration number (Levine et al., 2007). We introduce an iteration scheme for negative SELEX, in which a subtarget is removed and, instead as in positive SELEX, where the bound target is retained and amplified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) at each step, the free nucleic acids are retained and amplified by PCR. Simplified alternate SELEX defines a scheme in which each iteration consists of several iterations of simplified MTS followed by several iterations of negative SELEX. The number of simplified MTS iterations need not be the same as the number of iterations of negative SELEX, but these numbers are fixed for all iterations of simplified alternate SELEX. We examine the convergence properties of alternate SELEX and introduce the notion of limiting ultimate specificity as a consequence of alternating between positive and negative SELEX iterations.	autonomous robot;dynamical system;earl levine;experiment;fixed point (mathematics);gene ontology term enrichment;generative grammar;gradient;iteration;manifold regularization;mathematical model;search engine optimization;sensitivity and specificity	Howard A.

Conditions on local and global stability of the interior equilibrium are established. The equilibria type are determined. All possible global asymptotic behaviors of the system are considered, including the determination of the extinction conditions and existence of periodic orbits. It is shown that mutual interference between predators can alone stabilize predator–prey interactions even when only a linear intrinsic growth rate of the prey population is considered in the mathematical model. Additional biological implications and a set of numerical simulations supporting the analysis are also presented. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This first-principles based model is a coupled system of partial and ordinary differential equations, which is a reduced version of the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model. More precisely, the subsystem of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is the Single Particle Model (SPM) while the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) is a model for the average temperature in the battery. The observer is designed following the PDE backstepping method. Since some coefficients in the coupled ODE-PDE system are time-varying, this results in the time dependency of some coefficients in the kernel function system of the backstepping transformation and it is non-trivial to show well-posedness of the latter system. Adding thermal dynamics to the SPM serves a two-fold purpose: improving the accuracy of SoC estimation and keeping track of the average temperature which is a critical variable for safety management in lithium-ion batteries. Effectiveness of the estimation scheme is validated via numerical simulations. Automatica This work may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part for any commercial purpose.

For the realization of prototype circuits that contain ring-like subnetworks, prior approaches require the decomposition of the structure and thus neglect the notion of modularity of the original Wave Digital concept. In this paper, a new modular approach based on Multidimensional Wave Digital Filters (MDWDFs) is presented. For this, the contractivity property of WDFs is shown. On that basis, the new approach is studied with respect to possible side-effects and an appropriate modification is proposed that counteracts these effects and significantly improves the convergence behaviour.	digital filter;multidimensional signal processing;prototype;side effect (computer science)	Tim Schwerdtfeger;Anton Kummert	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853624	discrete mathematics;control theory;mathematics;digital delay line	EDA	68.69334798402119	5.889587943710618	103859

At first an initial circular spline curve is generated by biarc interpolation. Then an evolution process based on a least-squares approximation is applied to the curve. During the evolution process, the circular spline curve converges dynamically to a stable shape. Our method does not need any tangent information. During the evolution process, the number of arcs is automatically adapted to the data such that the final curve contains as few arc arcs as possible. We prove that the evolution process is equivalent to a Gauss-Newton type method.	approximation algorithm;biarc;data point;evolution;gauss–newton algorithm;interpolation;least squares;newton;smoothing spline;spline (mathematics)	Xinghua Song;Martin Aigner;Falai Chen;Bert Jüttler	2009	J.

The use of such models significantly reduces the complexity of control design, and enables the application of powerful semi-analytical methods for optimal control synthesis. In this paper, we examine the optimal control of a collection of neuron oscillators described by phase models. In particular, we employ Pontryagin's maximum principle to formulate the optimal control problem as a boundary value problem, which we then solve using the homotopy perturbation method. This iterative optimization-free technique is promising for neural engineering applications that involve nonlinear oscillatory systems for which phase model representations are feasible.	deep brain stimulation;iterative method;mit engineering systems division;mathematical optimization;neuron;nonlinear system;optimal control;perturbation theory;pontryagin's maximum principle;semiconductor device;semiconductor industry	Isuru Dasanayake;Anatoly Zlotnik;Wei Zhang;Jr-Shin Li	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760401	control engineering;mathematical optimization;optimal control;nonlinear system;boundary value problem;control theory;mathematics;iterative method;computational complexity theory;maximum principle	Robotics	71.73175452148006	8.436776062947136	104061

We obtain such an observability inequality in two different settings on $(A,B)$. In the first setting, $A$ generates an analytic semigroup, $B$ is an admissible observation operator for this semigroup, and $(A,B)$ satisfies an observability inequality from time intervals. By the propagation estimate of analytic functions and a telescoping series method (provided in the current paper), we build up the desired inequality for this setting. In the second setting, $A$ generates a $C_0$ semigroup, $B$ is a linear and bounded operator, and $(A, B)$ satisfies a spectral-like condition. By methods developed by Phung and Wang [J. Eur. Math.

Focusing on N-point configurations that achieve optimal order QMC error bounds (as is the case for efficient spherical designs), we are led to introduce the concept of QMC designs: these are sequences of N-point configurations XN on S d such that the worst-case error satisfies sup f∈H(S), ‖f‖Hs≤1 ∣∣∣∣ 1 N ∑ x∈XN f(x)− ∫ Sd f(x) dσd(x) ∣∣∣∣ = O ( N−s/d ) , N → ∞, with an implied constant that depends on the Hs(Sd)-norm, but is independent of N . Here σd is the normalized surface measure on S d. We provide methods for generation and numerical testing of QMC designs. An essential tool is an expression for the worst-case error in terms of a reproducing kernel for the space Hs(Sd) with s > d/2. As a consequence of this and a recent result of Bondarenko et al. on the existence of spherical designs with appropriate number of points, we show that minimizers of the N-point energy for this kernel form a sequence of QMC designs for Hs(Sd). Furthermore, without appealing to the Bondarenko et al. result, we prove that point sets that maximize the sum of suitable powers of the Euclidean distance between pairs of points form a sequence of QMC designs for Hs(Sd) with s in the interval (d/2, d/2 + 1). For such spaces there exist reproducing kernels with simple closed forms that are useful for numerical testing of optimal order Quasi Monte Carlo integration. Numerical experiments suggest that many familiar sequences of point sets on the sphere (equal area points, spiral points, minimal [Coulomb or logarithmic] energy points, and Fekete points) are QMC designs for appropriate values of s. For comparison purposes we show that configurations of random points that are independently and uniformly distributed on the sphere do not constitute QMC designs for any s > d/2. If (XN ) is a sequence of QMC designs for H s(Sd), we prove that it is also a sequence of QMC designs for Hs ′ (Sd) for all s′ ∈ (d/2, s). This leads to the question of determining the supremum of such s (here called the QMC strength of the sequence), for which we provide estimates based on computations for the aforementioned sequences.

We propose a mathematical model of prolactin secretion which is mainly controlled by the inhibiting effect of dopamine (DA) and the stimulating effect of thyrotopin releasing hormone (TRH). By applying the singular perturbation technique, the conditions are derived under which our model exhibits a periodic solution corresponding to the normal secretory pattern of PRL which has been observed as a series of daily pulses, occurring every 2-3 hours. Numerical investigations also show that chaotic time series is admitted by our model which resembles irregular patterns observed in PRL concentration profiles of patients with microprolactinoma and macroprolactinoma. Explaining the conditions that delineate varying dynamic behavior in this nonlinear system in terms of the removal rates of the three state variables, the removal rate d""""1 of TRH seems to play the most important role in identifying different physiological conditions."""	dopamine;mathematical model	Chontita Rattanakul;Yongwimon Lenbury	2009	Mathematical and Computer Modelling	10.1016/j.mcm.2008.11.016	singular perturbation;dopamine;nonlinear system;time series;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;circadian rhythm;statistics	Vision	77.96348470504272	5.25292160573155	105803

This results in almost all trajectories diverging off to infinity at the bifurcation point, despite the eigenvalues of the fixed points before and after the bifurcation being within the unit circle. In this paper, we show that similar bifurcation phenomena also occur when the stable orbit in question is of a higher periodicity or is chaotic. Accordingly, we propose a generalized definition of dangerous bifurcation suitable for any kind of attracting sets. We report two types of dangerous border collision bifurcations and show that, in addition to the originally reported mechanism typically involving singleton saddle cycles, there exists one more situation where the basin boundary is formed by a repelling closed invariant curve.	bifurcation theory;dynamical system;elite: dangerous;instability;quasiperiodicity	Viktor Avrutin;Zhanybai T.

For correctly chosen parameters in the unfolding, we prove that there is a transitive attractor of Lorenz type. In particular we show the existence of a bifurcation to an attractor of Lorenz type which is semiorientable, i.e., orientable on one half and nonorientable on the other half. We do not assume any symmetry condition, so we need to discuss nonsymmetric one dimensional Poincar é maps with one discontinuity and absolute value of the derivative always greater than one. We also apply these results to a specific set of degree four polynomial differential equations. The results do not apply to the actual Lorenz equations because they do not have enough parameters to adjust to make them satisfy the hypothesis.	bifurcation theory;fixed point (mathematics);lorenz cipher;lorenz system;map;polynomial;reflections of signals on conducting lines;resonance;unfolding (dsp implementation)	Clark Robinson	2000	SIAM J.

When one species possesses a combination of random dispersal and directed movement upward along its fitness gradient whereas the other species adopts random dispersal, the global existence of smooth solutions to the quasi-linear parabolic system is established. When one species adopts the fitness-dependent dispersal but the other species does not disperse at all, we show the global existence of weak solutions to the degenerate parabolic-ODE system and further describe the asymptotic behavior of these weak solutions.

More precisely, for each function f on I, we choose a sequence ξ = {ξs} s =1 n of n points in I, a sequence a = {as}s=1} n of n functions defined on n and a sequence Φn = {Vks} s=1 n of n functions from a given family Φ. By this choice we define a (non-linear) sampling recovery method so that f is approximately recovered from the n sampled values f(ξ 1), f(ξ 2),..., f(ξ n ), by the n-term linear combination S(f) = S(ξ, Φn,a,f):= ∑s=1 na s(f(ξ ),...,f(ξ))V{ks}. In searching an optimal sampling method, we study the quantity νn(f, Φ)q := {Φn, ξ, a}, ||F S(ξ, Φn, a, f)||q, where the infimum is taken over all sequences ξ = {ξ}s=1 n of n points, a = {as}s =1 n of n functions defined on n, and Φn = {Vks}}s=1 n of n functions from Φ. Let Up,θ be the unit ball in the Besov space B α p,θ} and M the set of centered B-spline wavelets Mk,s(x):= Nr(2 k x + ρ s), which do not vanish identically on I , where N r is the B-spline of even order r ≥ [α] + 1 with knots at the points 0,1,...,r. For 1 ≤ p,q ≤ ∞, 0 < θ ≤ ∞ and α > 1, we proved the following asymptotic order νn(U α p,θ, (f M)q:= sup f∞U α p,θ μn(f,M)q n α. An asymptotically optimal non-linear sampling recovery method S * for μn(U α p,θ, (f M)q is constructed by using a quasi-interpolant wavelet representation of functions in the Besov space in terms of the B-splines M k,s and the associated equivalent discrete quasi-norm of the Besov space. For 1 ≤ p < q ≤ ∞ the asymptotic order of this asymptotically optimal sampling non-linear recovery method is better than the asymptotic order of any linear sampling recovery method or, more generally, of any non-linear sampling recovery method of the form R(H,ξ,f): = H(f(ξ 1),...,f(ξ n)) with a fixed mapping H:n to C(I) and n fixed points ξ = {ξs} s=1 n. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

For large enough |n|, n ∈ Z, there are two (counted with multiplicity) eigenvalues λn , λ + n (periodic if n is even, or antiperiodic if n is odd) such that |λn − n| < 1/2. We study the asymptotics of spectral gaps γn = λn − λn in the case P (x) = ae−2ix +Ae, Q(x) = be−2ix +Be, where a, A, b, B are any complex numbers.

These syzygies come for free as a by-product of the differential Gröbner Basis computation. Compared with the more obvious way of integrating a single equation and substituting the result in other equations the new technique integrates more than one equation at once and therefore introduces temporarily fewer new functions of integration that in addition depend on fewer variables. Especially for high order PDE systems in many variables the conventional integration technique may lead to an explosion of the number of functions of integration which is avoided with the new method. A further benefit is that redundant free functions in the solution are either prevented or that their number is at least reduced. 1 A critical look at conventional integration In this paper a new integration method is introduced that is suitable for the computerized solution of systems of linear PDEs that admit syzygies. In the text we will call the integration of single exact differential equations, i.e. equations which are total derivatives, the ‘conventional’ integration method (discussed, for example, in [11]). To highlight the difference with the new syzygy based integration method we have a closer look at the conventional method first. About notation: To distinguish symbolic subscripts from partial derivatives we indicate partial derivatives with a comma, for example, ∂xyei = ei,xy. To solve, for example, the system 0 = f,xx (1) 0 = xf,y +f,z (2) for f(x, y, z) one would, at first, integrate (1) with 2 new functions of integration g(y, z), h(y, z), then substitute f = xg + h (3)	computation;gröbner basis;numerical partial differential equations	Thomas Wolf	2003	J.

The new exact special solutions with solitary patterns of the equations are found by our new method. The two special cases, B(2,2) and B(3,3), are chosen to illustrate the concrete scheme of our approach in B(m,n) equations. The nonlinear equations B(m,n) are addressed for two different cases, namely when m = n being odd and even integers. An entirely new general formulas for the solutions of B(n,n) equations are established. The general formulas for the solutions of B(n,n) equations with all integer n > 1 can be extended to the case of B(m,n) equations with m = n being noninteger. Our results include not only some known results in literature as special cases but also some new exact special solutions with solitary patterns. The method presented by this paper is suitable for studying exact special solutions with solitary patterns of some other equations. 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In the classical analysis of these operators, certain growth conditions on the coefficients in their series representations insure uniform and absolute convergence, provided each admissible input is uniformly bounded by some fixed upperbound. In some emerging applications of this theory, however, it is more natural to consider other classes of inputs. In this paper, L, function spaces are considered. In particular, growth conditions are developed which provide sufficient conditions for convergence and continuity, and insure that any realization of the operator yields a well defined state space model on the input space.	coefficient;lp-type problem;nonlinear system;scott continuity;state-space representation	W.

The solution space to these ODEs form a proper subspace of the analytic functions with ODEs. They have many interesting algebraic and topological properties.

The main idea is to express the L2 distance as a quadratic function of some parameters provided by G3 continuity conditions. An efficient non-iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal merged curve when the L2 distance is minimized. The uniqueness of the global minimum is also proven. This method can be applied to two adjacent curves with different degrees and has the ability to obtain satisfactory merging results by using curves of lower degree. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed explicitmethod are illustrated through several comparative examples. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

c356ebde946c07d97b8cb8b5c0e874495ba26623	training recurrent neural networks via dynamical trajectory-based optimization		This paper introduces a new method to train recurrent neural networks using dynamical trajectory-based optimization. The optimization method utilizes a projected gradient system (PGS) and a quotient gradient system (QGS) to determine the feasible regions of an optimization problem and search the feasible regions for local minima. By exploring the feasible regions, local minima are identified and the local minimum with the lowest cost is chosen as the global minimum of the optimization problem. Lyapunov theory is used to prove the stability of the local minima and their stability in the presence of measurement errors. Numerical examples show that the new approach provides better results than genetic algorithm and error backpropagation (EBP) trained networks.	algorithmic efficiency;artificial neural network;backpropagation;computer performance;convolutional neural network;feasible region;genetic algorithm;global optimization;gradient;graphics processing unit;loss function;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;newton;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical method;optimization problem;recurrent neural network;simulation;x86	Hamid Khodabandehlou;M.

Advertisement force, contact rate between users and non-users, population dispersal rate and returning rate from user class to non-user class are chosen as key parameters. For the product with a long life-span, it is assumed that the returning rate is proportional to the number of users. It is shown that this model has a unique positive equilibrium which is globally stable. For the product with a short life-span, time delays are introduced to represent the duration of the product in two different markets and the stability of a positive equilibrium is analyzed in one reasonable case. Periodic advertisements are also incorporated and the existence and uniqueness of positive periodic solutions are investigated.		Wendi Wang;P. Fergola;C.

The main idea of this approach is to represent orbits in this manifold as the solutions of an appropriate boundary value problem (BVP). The BVP is underdetermined, and a one-parameter family of solutions can be found by means of arclength continuation. This family of orbits covers a piece of the manifold. The quality of this covering depends on the way the BVP is discretized, as do the tractability and accuracy of the computation. In this paper, we describe an implementation of the orbit continuation algorithm which relies on multiple shooting and Newton-Krylov continuation. We show that the number of time integrations necessary for each continuation step scales with the number of shooting intervals but not with the number of degrees of freedom of the dynamical system. The number of shooting intervals is chosen based on linear stability analysis to keep the conditioning of the BVP in check. We demonstrate our algorithm with two test systems: a low-order model of shear flow and a well-resolved simulation of turbulent plane Couette flow.	computation;control theory	Lennaert van Veen;Genta Kawahara;Matsumura Atsushi	2011	SIAM J.

NORM is suitable for reducing a class of weakly nonlinear systems that can be well characterized by low order Volterra functional series. Unlike existing projection based reduction methods [6]-[8], NORM begins with the general matrix-form Volterra nonlinear transfer functions to derive a set of minimum Krylov subspaces for order reduction. Direct moment matching of the nonlinear transfer functions by projection of the original system onto this set of minimum Krylov subspaces leads to a significant reduction of model size. As we will demonstrate as part of our comparison with existing methods, the efficacy of model order for weakly nonlinear systems is determined by the extend to which models can be reduced. Our results further indicate that a multiple-point version of NORM can substantially reduce the model size and approach the ultimate model compactness that is achievable for nonlinear system reduction. We demonstrate the practical utility of NORM for macro-modeling weakly nonlinear RF circuits with time-varying behavior.	algorithm;krylov subspace;linear time-invariant theory;model order reduction;nonlinear system;radio frequency;time complexity;time-invariant system	Peng Li;Lawrence T.

The center subinterval will be the region of interest. The interval is then bisected and two new points are added at every step. The two points sampled before became two-third and one-third, respectively. Two possibilities of definition of potentially optimal intervals are given. The proposed version predicts a fast convergence, and overcomes some disadvantages of the DIRECT in the case where the global minimum lies at the boundaries. 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper we provide an explicit construction of such an optimal order QMC rule. Our approach is to exploit both the decay and the sparsity of the Walsh coefficients of the reproducing kernel simultaneously. This can be done by applying digit interlacing composition due to Dick to digital nets with large minimum Hamming and Niederreiter--Rosenbloom--Tsfasman metrics due to Chen and Skriganov. To our best knowledge, our construction gives the first QMC rule which achieves the best possible convergence in this function space.	monte carlo method	Takashi Goda;Kosuke Suzuki;Takehito Yoshiki	2016	SIAM J.

9592fa36bfa4e554a9dc9841b7f28f64f8288fee	a stability criterion for general systems	dynamic system;direct method;partial order	The direct method of Liapunov characterizes stability properties of sets in dynamical systems in terms of the existence of corresponding real-valued “Liapunov functions”. The traditional limitation of Liapunov functions to real values has blocked the extension of this approach to more general systems. In this paper, a stability concept analogous to classical uniform stability is defined as a relationship between a quasiorder and a uniformity on the same set, and it is shown that stability in this sense occurs if and only if there exists a Liapunov function taking values in a certain partially ordered uniform space associated with the given uniformity and called its retracted scale. A few general properties of scales and retracted scales are discussed, and the continuity of the Liapunov functions is briefly considered.	circuit complexity;direct method in the calculus of variations;dynamical system;routh–hurwitz stability criterion;scott continuity	D.

In this paper, we introduce an adaptive stepsize selection strategy resulting in an approximate solution whose associated defect (residual) satisfies certain properties that allow us to monitor the global error reliably and efficiently. In addition, a companion system of equations is introduced in order to estimate the mathematical conditioning of the problem. A side effect of introducing this companion system is that it provides a global error estimate, at a modest increase in cost. The significance of our method will be demonstrated through real problems from population dynamics and actuarial sciences.	adaptive stepsize;approximation algorithm;mathematical model;population dynamics;software bug	Mohammad Shakourifar;Wayne H.

Optimal error estimates featuring explicit expressions on the mapping parameters for several popular mappings are derived. These results not only play an important role in numerical analysis of mapped Legendre spectral and pseudospectral methods for differential equations but also provide quantitative criteria for the choice of parameters in these mappings.	approximation;legendre polynomials;numerical analysis;polynomial;spectral method	Jie Shen;Li-Lian Wang	2004	SIAM J.

In particular, we work with the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) with cubic nonlinearity in one spatial dimension, with periodic boundary conditions. A spectralGalerkin method, where solutions are represented by truncated Fourier series modified to include the group element as an unknown, was used to discretize the CGLE in both space and time. Thus, the problem of computing solutions to the PDE was reduced to one of computing solutions of an underdetermined system of nonlinear algebraic equations. A large number of distinct relative periodic solutions were found in a chaotic region of the CGLE. These are new solutions and all have broad temporal and spatial spectra. The value of the time period for the relative periodic solutions found ranges between 0.02 and 0.46 and the value of the largest Lyapunov exponent of each solution varies from 1.88 to 17.20. The solutions exhibit a great deal of variety in their spatio-temporal profiles.	algebraic equation;approximation algorithm;coefficient;control theory;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;periodic boundary conditions	Vanessa López;Philip Boyland;Michael T.

We then apply the one-dimensional Gauss Legendre quadrature rules in n and g variables to arrive at an efficient Quadrature rules with new weight coefficients and new sampling points. Then a second Gauss Legendre quadrature rule of composite type is obtained. This rule is derived by discretising T into three new triangles T i ði 1⁄4 1; 2; 3Þ of equal size which are obtained by joining centroid of T, C 1⁄4 ð1=3; 1=3Þ to the three vertices of T.

The reason for this difference in nature can be seen in the ridge-type arguments which are commonly used. It is the aim of this paper to show that the situation completely changes when instead of ridge-type arguments were so-called hyperbolic-type arguments. In detail, we show that usual sigmoidal transfer functions evaluated at hyperbolic-type arguments—usually called sigma—pi units—can be used to construct local basis functions which vanish at infinity and, moreover, are integrable and give rise to a partition of unity, both in Cauchy's principal value sense. At this point, standard strategies for approximation with local basis functions can be used without giving up the concept of non-local sigmoidal transfer functions.	artificial neural network	Burkhard Lenze	1994	Adv.

In order to properly control the error tolerance for the adaptive quadrature and to obtain a reliable estimation of the approximation error, we research the possible influence of round-off errors on the computed result. As the numerical experiments confirm, the proposed method can successfully compete with other algorithms for computing such type integrals. Moreover, the presented method is very easy to implement on any system equipped with a reliable adaptive integration subroutine. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we show that for the same model there exists a unique degenerate positive equilibrium which is a degenerate Bogdanov–Takens singularity (focus case) of codimension 3 for other values of parameters. We prove that the model exhibits degenerate focus type Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation of codimension 3 around the unique degenerate positive equilibrium. Numerical simulations, including the coexistence of three hyperbolic positive equilibria, two limit cycles, bistability states (one stable equilibrium and one stable limit cycle, or two stable equilibria), tristability states (two stable equilibria and one stable limit cycle), a stable limit cycle enclosing a homoclinic loop, a homoclinic loop enclosing an unstable limit cycle, or a stable limit cycle enclosing three unstable hyperbolic positive equilibria for various parameter values, confirm the theoretical results.	bifurcation theory;bistability;coexist (image);control theory;floris takens;functional response;hopf bifurcation;leslie speaker;li sanli;limit cycle;lotka–volterra equations;numerical linear algebra;prey;simulation;singularity project	Jicai Huang;Xiaojing Xia;Xinan Zhang;Shigui Ruan	2016	I.

However, there are many ways in which computers may be used in a mathematical proof. But """"proofs by computers"""" or even the use of computers in the course of a proof are not so readily accepted (the December 2008 issue of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society is devoted to formal proofs by computers).  In this talk we discuss how verification methods may assist in achieving a mathematically rigorous result. In particular we emphasize how floating-point arithmetic is used.  The goal of verification methods is ambitious: For a given problem it is proved, with the aid of a computer, that there exists a (unique) solution within computed bounds. The methods are constructive, and the results are rigorous in every respect. Verification methods apply to data with tolerances as well.  Rigorous results are the main goal in computer algebra. However, verification methods use solely floating-point arithmetic, so that the total computational effort is not too far from that of a purely (approximate) numerical method. Nontrivial problems have been solved using verification methods. For example:  Tucker (1999) received the 2004 EMS prize awarded by the European Mathematical Society for (citation) """"giving a rigorous proof that the Lorenz attractor exists for the parameter values provided by Lorenz. This was a long standing challenge to the dynamical system community, and was included by Smale in his list of problems for the new millennium. The proof uses computer estimates with rigorous bounds based on higher dimensional interval arithmetics.""""  Sahinidis and Tawaralani (2005) received the 2006 Beale-Orchard-Hays Prize for their package BARON which (citation) """"incorporates techniques from automatic differentiation, interval arithmetic, and other areas to yield an automatic, modular, and relatively efficient solver for the very difficult area of global optimization"""".  A main goal of this talk is to introduce the principles of how to design verification algorithms, and how these principles differ from those for traditional numerical algorithms.  We begin with a brief discussion of the working tools of verification methods, in particular floating-point and interval arithmetic. In particular the development and limits of verification methods for finite dimensional problems are discussed in some detail; problems include dense systems of linear equations, sparse linear systems, systems of nonlinear equations, semi-definite programming and other special linear and nonlinear problems including M-matrices, simple and multiple roots of polynomials, bounds for simple and multiple eigenvalues or clusters, and quadrature. We mention that automatic differentiation tools to compute the range of gradients, Hessians, Taylor coefficients, and slopes are necessary. If time permits, verification methods for continuous problems, namely two-point boundary value problems and semilinear elliptic boundary value problems are presented.  Throughout the talk, a number of examples of the wrong use of interval operations are given. In the past such examples contributed to the dubious reputation of interval arithmetic, whereas they are, in fact, just a misuse.  Some algorithms are presented in executable Matlab/INTLAB-code. INTLAB, the Matlab toolbox for reliable computing and free for academic use, is developed and written by Rump (1999). It was, for example, used by Bornemann, Laurie, Wagon, and Waldvogel (2004) in the solution of half of the problems of the 10 x 10-digit challenge by Trefethen (2002)."""	approximation algorithm;automatic differentiation;baron;coefficient;commutation theorem;computer;dynamical system;executable;formal proof;global optimization;gradient;interval arithmetic;linear equation;linear system;lorenz system;matlab;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical method;orchard;polynomial;rump kernel;semiconductor industry;semidefinite programming;solver;sparse matrix;symbolic computation;system of linear equations;tucker decomposition	Siegfried M.

A simple necessary and sufficient condition for output feedback stabilizability of a given MIMO n-D linear system is derived in terms of the generating polynomials associated with any matrix fraction descriptions of the system. When a given unstable plant is feedback stabilizable, constructive method is provided for obtaining a stabilizing compensator. Moreover, a strictly causal compensator can always be constructed for a causal (not necessarily strictly causal) plant. A non-trivial example is illustrated.	anatomy, regional;arabic numeral 0;bibo stability;block cipher mode of operation;cns disorder;causal filter;cobham's thesis;constant function;control theory;description;generalization (psychology);graph minor;gröbner basis;hospital admission;linear system;mimo;maximal set;note (document);numerous;polynomial matrix;ring device;the matrix;unstable medical device problem	Zhiping Lin	1998	Multidim.

Using these approximations, we show that a nontrivial, physically meaningful approximate steady state may exist even for a linear operator.

3d1639a6beee73e0561ceaca78cd25c4a97ca838	a state constrained optimal control problem related to the sterilization of canned foods	optimal control problem;canned food;sterilization;constrained optimization	Al~traet--The industrial sterilization of canned foods is a process in which there usually occurs a degradation of the nutrients and a deterioration of the qualitative properties due to the temperature to which the food is overexposed in order to assure sterilization. In this work we face the problem using optimal control methods. Linear constraints on the control and nonlinear ones on the state will appear as a consequence of the technological restrictions and the request for quality and economy. Besides an existence result for the optimal control and an optimality system we give numerical results for some real industrial examples. They show that present industrial sterilization processes can be improved in terms of saving energy and nutrient retention.	algorithm;canned response;elegant degradation;emoticon;industrial engineering;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;optimal control	Alfredo Bermúdez;Aurea Martínez	1994	Automatica	10.1016/0005-1098(94)90033-7	mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;canned foods;constrained optimization;food processing;sterilization (microbiology);mathematics;energy conservation;optimal control	Robotics	71.40652603285675	10.517940477625684	112332

The purpose of this paper is (i) to extend the recursive formulation of this method to general linear operator equations defined in a separable Hilbert space, and (ii) to develop an iterative refinement procedure which improves on the accuracy of Tau approximations. Applications to Fredholm integral equations demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique. 1. Canonical polynomials of linear operators Let X be a separable Hilbert space having a basis x := {x0, x1, x2, . . . } , and let A(X) denote the space of all linear operators on X . Then, for A ∈ A(X) and for all i ∈N, Axi is a linear combination of the basis elements: Axi = ∑ j aijxj , aij ∈ C. (1) For A ∈ A(X) and x, y ∈ X , we define the equivalence relation x ≡A y iff x− y ∈ kerA . An operator A is said to be banded-from-above if there exists an integer k ∈ N which satisfies the property P (k) defined as: aij = 0 ∀i, j ≥ 0 with j − i ≥ k + 1. Let Ab(X) ⊆ A(X) denote the subspace of all banded-from-above operators on X , and define an integer-valued function on the elements of Ab(X) by h(A) := min{k ∈ N : P (k)} which, following Ortiz [3, 4], is called the height of A . Then, if A ∈ Ab is of height h(A) equation (1) becomes Axi = h+i ∑	approximation;automated x-ray inspection;finite element method;hilbert space;iterated function;iterative method;iterative refinement;polynomial;recursion;refinement (computing);turing completeness	M.

b8a5c9de5dae514c58e4947f61cdd20e29711dc1	error bounds for gauss-type quadratures with bernstein–szegő weights	65d30;kernel;41a55;gaussian quadrature;elliptical contour;error bound;remainder term;65d32;analytic function	The paper is concerned with the derivation of error bounds for Gauss-type quadratures with Bernstein−Szegő weights, $${\int\limits_{-1}^{1}}f(t)w(t)\, dt=G_{n}[f]+R_{n}(f),\quad G_{n}[f]=\sum\limits_{\nu=1}^{n}\lambda_{\nu} f(\tau_{\nu}) \quad(n\in\textbf{N}),$$ where f is an analytic function inside an elliptical contour $\mathcal{E}_{\rho}$ with foci at $\mp 1$ and sum of semi-axes $\rho > 1$ , and w is a nonnegative and integrable weight function of Bernstein−Szegő type. The derivation of effective bounds on $|R_{n}(f)|$ is possible if good estimates of $\max_{z\in\mathcal{E}_{\rho}}|K_{n}(z)|$ are available, especially if one knows the location of the extremal point $\eta\in\mathcal{E}_{\rho}$ at which $|K_{n}|$ attains its maximum. In such a case, instead of looking for upper bounds on $\max_{z\in\mathcal{E}_{\rho}}|K_{n}(z)|$ , one can simply try to calculate $|K_{n}(\eta,w)|$ . In the case under consideration, i.e. when $$w(t)= \frac{(1-t^{2})^{-1/2}}{\beta(\beta-2\alpha)\,t^{2} +2\delta(\beta-\alpha)\,t+\alpha^{2}+\delta^{2}},\quad t\in(-1,1),$$ for some $\alpha,\beta,\delta$ , which satisfy $0<\alpha<\beta,\ \beta\ne 2\alpha,\vert\delta\vert<\beta-\alpha$ , the location on the elliptical contours where the modulus of the kernel attains its maximum value is investigated. This leads to effective bounds on $|R_{n}(f)|$ . The quality of the derived bounds is analyzed by a comparison with other error bounds proposed in the literature for the same class of integrands.	modulus of continuity;phil bernstein;semiconductor industry;weight function	Aleksandar V.

1d31cb7f6e2574d41dc7dc7231087ee87a81ca08	analysis of fractional order mathematical model of hematopoietic stem cell gene-based therapy		Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) has been discussed as a basis for gene-based therapy aiming to cure immune system infections, such as HIV. This therapy protects target cells from infections or specifying technic and immune responses to face virus by using genetically modified HSCs. A mathematical model approach could be used to predict the dynamics of HSC gene-based therapy of viral infections. In this paper, we present a fractional mathematical model of HSC gene-based therapy with the fractional order derivative . We determine the stability of fractional model equilibriums. Based on the model analysis, we obtained three equilibriums, namely, free virus equilibrium (FVE) , CTL-Exhaustion Equilibrium (CEE) , and control immune equilibrium (CIE) . Besides, we obtained Basic Reproduction Number that determines the existence and stability of the equilibriums. These three equilibriums will be conditionally locally asymptotically stable. We also analyze the sensitivity of parameters to determine the most influence parameter to the spread of therapy. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations with variations of to illustrate the dynamical HSC gene-based therapy to virus-system immune interactions. Based on the numerical simulations, we obtained that HSC gene-based therapy can decrease the concentration of infected cells and increase the concentration of the immune cells.	mathematical model	Mohammad Imam Utoyo;Windarto;Aminatus Sa'adah	2018	Int.

The main tool is Bertoin’s Lévy-Khintchine representation formula for eternal solutions of Smoluchowski’s equation (Adv. Appl. Prob. 12 (2002) 547–64). This representation linearizes the dynamics on the scaling attractor, revealing these dynamics to be conjugate to a continuous dilation, and chaotic in a classical sense. Furthermore, our study of scaling limits explains how Smoluchowski dynamics “compactifies” in a natural way that accounts for clusters of zero and infinite size (dust and gel).	chaos theory;dilation (morphology);dynamical system;image scaling;modulo operation;self-similarity;universality probability	Govind Menon;Robert L.

Except for eight rather special local rules whose global dynamics are described by an affine (mod 1 ) function of only one binary cell state variable, all characteristic functions exhibit a fractal geometry where self-similar two-dimensional substructures manifest themselves, ad infinitum, as the number of cells (I + 1) → ∞. In addition to a complete gallery of time-1 characteristic functions for all 256 local rules, an accompanying table of explicit formulas is given for generating these characteristic functions directly from binary bit-strings, as in a digital-to-analog converter. To illustrate the potential applications of these fundamental formulas, we prove rigorously that the “right-copycat” local rule 170 is equivalent globally to the classic “left-shift” Bernoulli map. Similarly, we prove the “left-copycat” local rule 240 is equivalent globally to the “right-shift” inverse Bernoulli map. Various geometrical and analytical properties have been identified from each characteristic function and explained rigorously. In particular, two-level stratified subpatterns found in most characteristic functions are shown to emerge if, and only if, b1 = 0, where b1 is the “synaptic coefficient” associated with the cell differential equation developed in Part I. Gardens of Eden are derived from the decimal range of the characteristic function of each local rule and tabulated. Each of these binary strings has no predecessors (pre-image) and has therefore no past, but only the present and the future. Even more fascinating, many local rules are endowed with binary configurations which not only have no predecessors, but are also fixed points of the characteristic functions. To dramatize that such points have no past, and no future, they are henceforth christened “Isles of Eden”. They too have been identified and tabulated.	a new kind of science;bernoulli polynomials;cellular automaton;characteristic function (convex analysis);coefficient;copycat (software);digital-to-analog converter;dyadic transformation;euler–bernoulli beam theory;fixed point (mathematics);fractal;memory cell (binary);nonlinear dynamics;self-similarity;synaptic package manager	Leon O.

Asymptotics of coefficients of functions satisfying such equations has been studied for several special cases in the literature. We study in this paper the most general framework for Cauchy-Euler equations and propose an asymptotic theory that covers almost all applications where Cauchy-Euler equations appear. Our approach is very general and requires almost no background on differential equations. Indeed the whole theory can be stated in terms of recurrences instead of functions. Old and new applications of the theory are given. New phase changes of limit laws of new variations of quicksort are systematically derived. We apply our theory to about a dozen of diverse examples in quicksort, binary search trees, urn models, increasing trees, etc.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;coefficient;euler;quicksort;recurrence relation;sorting	Hua-Huai Chern;Hsien-Kuei Hwang;Tsung-Hsi Tsai	2002	J.

To fill a gap in this issue, this study focuses on the almost everywhere approximation capabilities of single-hidden-layer feedforward double Mellin approximate identity neural networks. First, the notion of double Mellin approximate identity is introduced. Using this notion, an auxiliary theorem is proved. The auxiliary theorem provides a connection between a class of double Mellin convolution linear operators and the notion of almost everywhere convergence. This theorem is applied to prove a main theorem. The proof of the main theorem is based on the notion of epsilon-net. The main theorem shows almost everywhere approximation capability of single-hidden-layer feedforward double Mellin approximate identity neural networks in the space of almost everywhere continuous bivariate functions on $$ \mathbb {R}_{+}^{2} $$R+2.

In this paper, the perturbation theory of complex Weierstrass canonical form for regular matrix pencils is investigated. By using matrix pencil theory and the Weierstrass canonical form of the pencil we obtain bounds for the finite elementary divisors of a perturbed pencil. Moreover we study robust stability of a class of linear matrix difference equations (of first and higher order) whose coefficients are square constant matrices. 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Continuous kernels on compact domains have an expansion into eigenfunctions that are both L2-orthonormal and orthogonal in H (Mercer expansion). This paper examines the corresponding eigenspaces and proves that they have optimality properties among all other subspaces of H. These results have strong connections to n-widths in Approximation Theory, and they establish that errors of optimal approximations are closely related to the decay of the eigenvalues. Though the eigenspaces and eigenvalues are not readily available, they can be well approximated using the standard n-dimensional subspaces spanned by translates of the kernel with respect to n nodes or centers. We give error bounds for the numerical approximation of the eigensystem via such subspaces. A series of examples shows that our numerical technique via a greedy point selection strategy allows to calculate the eigensystems with good accuracy. ∗gsantin@math.unipd.it †schaback@math.uni-goettingen.de 1 ar X iv :1 41 1. 76 56 v2 [ m at h.

2f49aa83f7c2403082e3ce5887dca1ef7de869f4	interior and boundary stabilization of navier-stokes equations		"""We report on very recent work on the stabilization of the steady-state solutions to Navier-Stokes equations on an open bounded domain R C Rd, d = 2,3, by either interior, or else boundary control. More precisely, as to the interior case, we obtain that the steadystate solutions to Navier-Stokes equations on R C Rd, d = 2,3, with no-slip boundary conditions, are locally exponentially stabilizable by a finite-dimensional feedback controller with support in an arbitrary open subset w C R of positive measure. The (finite) dimension of the feedback controller is minimal and is related to the largest algebraic multiplicity of the unstable eigenvalues of the linearized equation. Second, as to the boundary case, we obtain that the steady-state solutions to Navier-Stokes equations on a bounded domain R C Rd, d = 2,3, are locally exponentially stabilizable by a boundary closedloop feedback controller, acting on the boundary 80, in the Dirichlet boundary conditions. If d = 3, the non-linearity imposes and dictates the requirement that stabilization must occur in the space (H;+'(R))~, E > 0, a high topological level. A first implication thereof is that, for d = 3, the boundary feedback stabilizing controller must be infinite dimensional. Moreover, it generally acts on the entire boundary dR. Instead, for d = 2, where the topological level for stabilization is (H$-""""(R))', the boundary feedback stabilizing controller can be chosen to act on an arbitrarily small portion of the boundary. Moreover, still for d = 2, it may even be finite dimensional, and this occurs if the linearized operator is diagonalizable over its finite-dimensional unstable subspace."""	algebraic equation;boundary case;control theory;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;steady state	Roberto Triggiani	2003		10.1007/0-387-23467-5_3	boundary value problem	Theory	82.59248494166795	7.023547369470508	119610

It is a natural extension to the basic tanh-function expansion method which was developed in the 1990s. It usually delivers three types of solution, namely a tanh-function expansion, a coth-function expansion, and a tanh-coth expansion. It is known that, for every tanh-function expansion solution, there is a corresponding coth-function expansion solution. It is shown that there is a tanh-coth expansion solution that is merely a disguised version of the coth solution. In many papers, such tanh-coth solutions are erroneously claimed to be ‘new’. However, other tanh-coth solutions may be delivered that are genuinely new in the sense that they would not be delivered via the basic tanh-function method. Similar remarks apply to tan, cot and tan-cot expansion solutions.	nonlinear system;os-tan;tanh-sinh quadrature	E. J.

588a6f6463158181c2bfd4980517844916a3a5f4	on the reduction of continuous problems to discrete form	convenient retention;adjacent cell;entire set;continuous problem;discrete problem;evaluative operation;particular cell;exact condition;certain interface condition;certain difficulty;discrete form	"""A continuous problem, defined as one involving derivatives or integrals, is to be reduced to a discrete problem, involving only algebraic or evaluative operations. An approach involving cells instead of points is taken, and the unknown function is approximated by functional representations, each associated with one cell and an associated set of parameters. Suitable operations are then defined, each associated with a particular cell. These operations remove the configuration coordinates from the problem, leaving only the parameters. Similar operations are defined which link the approximations in adjacent cells, and which translate certain interface conditions to relations between parameters associated with cells. The entire set of relations is then the equivalent of the usual difference equations. A variational algorithm is introduced in order to circumvent certain difficulties associated with matching equations and unknowns. This also permits the convenient retention of certain """"exact conditions"""" associated with the continuous problem. Some illustrative examples are given. 1. Correspondence between continuous and discrete problems The most important class of problems in applied mathematics is that consisting in what we may call the continuous type. In this class are included those problems containing equations which involve the operations of classical analysis, viz., differentiation and integration. One might also include any other operations in which limiting procedures playa role. The one thing common to all of these limiting operations of analysis is that none can be performed on a digital computer, which does not deal with continuously varying quantities and hence is incapable of taking limits by finite numerical processes. For this reason, the universal practice in solving continuous problems by digital computation is to stop short of the limit by solving, not the original continuous problem, but another discrete problem which approximates, in some appropriate sense, to the continuous problem, and whose discrete solution approximates to the continuous solution of the continuous problem. By """"appropriate,"""" we mean, in general, that if one were to allow a characteristic parameter (or parameters) of the discrete problem to approach its limiting value, then the discrete problem (and its solution) would go over-in the sense of a limit-into the continuous problem (and its solution). Examples of characteristic parameters would be mesh size, number of terms in a series, time increment, et cetera. We may think of the relationship between the corresponding problems as a mapping of the continuous into the discrete, and vice versa. The difficulty is that there is (for the class of """"proper"""" limiting procedures) a unique continuous problem corresponding to an infinite set of discrete problems, i.e., the mapping from discrete problem to continuous problem is many-to-one. This is advantageous in theoretical derivations of continuous formulations of physical problems, but it leads to an enormous ambiguity when, conversely, one wishes to map the continuous problem into a discrete one. For this reason it is possible to write several difference equations corresponding to the same differential equation. It would be very desirable to find some principle, or procedural guide, which would enable one to map continuous problems into discrete ones without such a great ambiguity. Thus by setting certain general requirements on the discrete formulation, one would be led automatically to the proper set of discrete equations. The examination of one such general procedure is the subject of this paper. 35$ IBM JOURNAL' OCTOBER 1959 then v (3) The derivatives of.p with respect to the xa are computed directly from Eq. (2.1).

This approach is then generalized to a broader class of nonlinear systems with delays that are called generalized Roesser systems. Finally, the theory is applied to analyze nonlinear time-delay systems. A weak observability is de:ned and characterized, generalizing the well-known linear result.

06b93c33a72e4bde919f9ebb8a2613eda28712ee	stability and sensitivity analysis of a plant disease model with continuous cultural control strategy	期刊论文	In this paper, a plant disease model with continuous cultural control strategy and time delay is formulated. Then, how the time delay affects the overall disease progression and, mathematically, how the delay affects the dynamics of the model are investigated. By analyzing the transendental characteristic equation, stability conditions related to the time delay are derived for the diseasefree equilibrium. Specially, when R 0 = 1, the Jacobi matrix of the model at the disease-free equilibrium always has a simple zero eigenvalue for all τ ≥ 0. The center manifold reduction and the normal form theory are used to discuss the stability and the steadystate bifurcations of the model near the nonhyperbolic disease-free equilibrium. Then, the sensitivity analysis of the threshold parameter R 0 and the positive equilibrium E∗ is carried out in order to determine the relative importance of different factors responsible for disease transmission. Finally, numerical simulations are employed to support the qualitative results.	broadcast delay;color gradient;computer simulation;control theory;jacobi method;numerical analysis	Zhonghua Zhang;Yaohong Suo	2014	J.

The analysis consists in showing that the endpoint map acting on control space is a Hurewicz fibration for a large class of affine control systems with vector controls. Exploiting the resulting fibration sequence and the long exact sequence of basepoint-preserving homotopy classes of maps, we show that the indicated subset of controls is homotopy equivalent to the loopspace of the state manifold. This not only allows us to understand the connectedness of “dynamical sets” realized as preimages of subsets of the state space through this endpoint map, but also provides a wealth of additional topological information about such subsets of control space.

1e267e98e590747da985a0e0ccf956fa90786513	hybrid second-order iterative algorithm for orthogonal projection onto a parametric surface		To compute the minimum distance between a point and a parametric surface, three well-known first-order algorithms have been proposed by Hartmann (1999), Hoschek, et al. (1993) and Hu, et al. (2000) (hereafter, the First-Order method). In this paper, we prove the method’s first-order convergence and its independence of the initial value. We also give some numerical examples to illustrate its faster convergence than the existing methods. For some special cases where the First-Order method does not converge, we combine it with Newton’s second-order iterative method to present the hybrid second-order algorithm. Our method essentially exploits hybrid iteration, thus it performs very well with a second-order convergence, it is faster than the existing methods and it is independent of the initial value. Some numerical examples confirm our conclusion.	algorithm;converge;first-order predicate;first-order reduction;holographic principle;iteration;iterative method;newton;numerical analysis;pipelines	Xiaowu Li;Lin Wang;Zhinan Wu;Linke Hou;Juan Liang;Qiaoyang Li	2017	Symmetry	10.3390/sym9080146	parametric surface;local convergence;initial value problem;combinatorics;iterative method;mathematics;mathematical optimization;orthographic projection;convergence (routing)	AI	80.93654420125553	17.874538947299126	121851

One restriction is ‘‘error saturation’’ which occurs for many types of RBFs including Gaussian RBFs of the form φ(x;α, h) = exp(−α2(x/h)2): in the limit h→ 0 for fixed α, the error does not converge to zero, but rather to ES(α). Previous studies have theoretically determined the saturation error for Gaussian RBF on an infinite, uniform interval and for the same with a single point omitted. (The gap enormously increases ES(α).) We show experimentally that the saturation error on the unit interval, x ∈ [−1, 1], is about 0.06 exp(−0.47/α2)‖f ‖∞ — huge compared to the O(2π/α2) exp ( −π2/[4α2] ) saturation error for a gridwith one point omitted.We show that the reason the saturation is so large on a finite interval is that it is equivalent to an infinite grid which is uniform except for a gap of many points. The saturation error can be avoided by choosing α 1, the ‘‘flat limit’’, but the condition number of the interpolationmatrix explodes asO(exp(π2/[4α2])). The best strategy is to choose the largest α which yields an acceptably small saturation error: If the user chooses an error tolerance δ, then αoptimum(δ) = 1/ √ −2 log(δ/0.06). © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The Taylor series expansion for arguments less than unity converges rather slowly for those near unity. The method of small increments of the argument [2] is again inconvenient for a subroutine. A more rapid series expansion in terms of Chebyshev polynomial [3] is given in terms of a new argument, which is less than 0.1989. This method requires the storage of π, √2 - 1 and seven coefficients and is perhaps widely used. However, for multiple precision not only the coefficients have to be evaluated to the precision desired, but more must be used. Therefore the following alternative method may prove to be convenient and efficient.	chebyshev polynomials;coefficient;interpolation;iterative method;polynomial;semiconductor industry;series expansion;subroutine	Wen-Hwa Chu;Donald R.

97817936816be0a411d6bee705c1e450046aa46a	control bifurcations	bifurcation;nonlinear control systems;stability;nonlinear differential equations	A parametrized nonlinear differential equation can have multiple equilibria as the parameter is varied. A local bifurcation of a parametrized differential equation occurs at an equilibrium where there is a change in the topological character of the nearby solution curves. This typically happens because some eigenvalues of the parametrized linear approximating differential equation cross the imaginary axis and there is a change in stability of the equilibrium. The topological nature of the solutions is unchanged by smooth changes of state coordinates so these may be used to bring the differential equation into Poincare/spl acute/ normal form. From this normal form, the type of the bifurcation can be determined. For differential equations depending on a single parameter, the typical ways that the system can bifurcate are fully understood, e.g., the fold (or saddle node), the transcritical and the Hopf bifurcation. A nonlinear control system has multiple equilibria typically parametrized by the set value of the control. A control bifurcation of a nonlinear system typically occurs when its linear approximation loses stabilizability. The ways in which this can happen are understood through the appropriate normal forms. We present the quadratic and cubic normal forms of a scalar input nonlinear control system around an equilibrium point. These are the normal forms under quadratic and cubic change of state coordinates and invertible state feedback. The system need not be linearly controllable. We study some important control bifurcations, the analogues of the classical fold, transcritical and Hopf bifurcations.	apache axis;bifurcation theory;control system;control theory;cubic function;database normalization;hopf bifurcation;imaginary time;linear approximation;nonlinear system;uncontrolled format string	Arthur J.

This problem, known as strong stabilizability, is fundamental in control theory, with important applications in designing stable feedback systems with a stable compensator. Our algorithm for solving the problem is formulated based on the cylindrical algebraic decomposition(cad) of an algebraic variety. While recent applications of cad to systems and control have been focused on those problems which have a quantifier elimination formulation, our method is novel in that it explicitly computes some topological properties of an algebraic variety based on the cad to solve the problem for which a quantifier elimination formulation is not readily available.	computation	Jiang Qian Ying;Li Xu;Zhiping Lin	1999	J.

Due to the presence of continuous dynamics and binary hysteresis, we propose a hybrid system model. Binary hysteresis with different thresholds captures the interaction between the genes. We analyze properties of the solutions and asymptotic stability of equilibria in the system as a function of its parameters. Our analysis reveals the presence of limit cycles for a certain range of parameters, a behavior that is associated with the presence of binary hysteresis. The set of points defining the limit cycle is characterized and its asymptotic stability properties are studied.

We study optimal information and optimal algorithms in average case, probabilistic, and asymptotic settings, for a general error criterion. We prove that adaptive information is not more powerful than nonadaptive information and that μ-spline algorithms, which are linear, are optimal in all three settings. Some of these results hold for approximation of linear operators. We specialize our results to the space of functions with continuous  r th derivatives, equipped with a Wiener measure. In particular, we show that the natural splines of degree 2 r  + I yield the optimal algorithms. We apply the general results to the problem of integration.	approximation	David Lee;Grzegorz W.

Let us consider an optimal method of order q = 2n−1, v = φn(x), that uses n functional evaluations. Performing a Newton step w = v − f(v) f ′(v) one obtains a method of order 2, that is not optimal because it introduces two new functional evaluations. Instead, we approximate the derivative by using a polynomial of degree n that interpolates n + 1 already known functional values and keeps the order 2. We have applied this idea to Steffensen’s method, [5], obtaining a family of optimal derivative free iterative methods of arbitrary high order. We provide different numerical tests, that confirm the theoretical results and compare the new family with other well known family of similar characteristics.

Particularly, both Pareto and Nash strategies are discussed. After defining the equilibrium condition, sufficient conditions for the existence of the strategy sets are obtained, which are associated with the solvability of the corresponding generalized difference Riccati equations (GDREs). Furthermore, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the related GDREs and a simple numerical example is given to show the reliability and usefulness of the considerable results.	stochastic process	Huai-Nian Zhu;Cheng-Ke Zhang	2016	Oper.

In the context of the Evans function shooting and matching approach, all the relevant information is carried by the flow projected onto the underlying Grassmann manifold. We show how to numerically construct this projected flow in a stable and robust manner. In particular, the method avoids representation singularities by, in practice, choosing the best coordinate patch representation for the flow as it evolves. The method is analytic in the spectral parameter and of complexity bounded by the order of the spectral problem cubed. For large systems it represents a competitive method to those recently developed that are based on continuous orthogonalization. We demonstrate this by comparing the two methods in three applications: Boussinesq solitary waves, autocatalytic travelling waves and the Ekman boundary layer.	coherence (physics);manifold regularization;numerical method;periodic boundary conditions;robustness (computer science)	Veerle Ledoux;Simon J.

Because the calculation is difficult to do by hand, symbolic algebra programs are used. To access the usefulness of these programs and to solve some design problems, a MAPLE procedure, ZERODYN, is written to calculate the zero dynamics symbolically. The procedure can, however, not solve all problems, mainly because general symbolic algebra programs have insufficient capabilities to solve sets of nonlinear equations and partial differential equations. A realistic analysis problem shows this.	computer algebra system;maple;nonlinear system;symbolic computation	Bram de Jager	1991		10.1145/120694.120746	burgers' equation;mathematical optimization;split-step method;first-order partial differential equation;nonlinear schrödinger equation;nonlinear system;nonlinear resonance;control theory;mathematics;kadomtsev–petviashvili equation;feedback linearization;differential equation;partial differential equation;breather	Arch	81.17426950608764	13.937216139423855	124543

For some classes of functions, defined by specific moduli of continuity, the exact values of the various n-widths in L2 are calculated. In particular the problem of minimizing the constants in inequalities of Jackson–Stechkin type over all subspaces of dimension N is solved. It is proved that this value is equal to the exact value of the different widths of the class L 2 (β, p, h, φ), where φ is a non-negative integrable weight function on (0, h] (0 < h ≤ π/n). c ⃝ 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast to numerous approximation techniques that pursue acceleration of the online optimization procedure, relatively few work has been devoted towards shifting the optimization effort to a precomputational phase, especially for nonlinear system dynamics. Recently, interest revived in the theory of general Polynomial Chaos (gPC) in order to appraise the influence of variable parameters on dynamic system behaviour and proved to yield reliable results. This article establishes an explicit solution of the multi-parametric Nonlinear Problem (mp-NLP) based on the theoretical framework of gPC, which enabled a polynomial approximated nonlinear feedback law formulation.

Applying the HPM, the non-linear two-point boundary-value problem (TPBVP) and linear systems, derived from the Pontryagin’s maximum principle, are transformed into a sequence of linear time-invariant TPBVPs. Solving the proposed linear TPBVP sequence in a recursive manner leads to the optimal control law and the optimal trajectory in the form of rapid convergent series.

Applying Hopf bifurcation analysis, we obtain the critical conditions under which the model generates spatially nonhomogeneous bifurcating periodic solutions. It is shown that the spatially homogeneous Hopf bifurcations always exist and that the spatially nonhomogeneous Hopf bifurcations will arise when the diffusion coefficients are suitably small. The explicit formulae for determining the direction of Hopf bifurcation and the stability of the bifurcating periodic solutions are derived by employing the normal form theory and center manifold theorems for partial functional differential equations.	prey	Chaoqun Xu;Sanling Yuan	2015	I.

In this talk we present a generalized theory on convergence/stability of the networks. In the general setting that E is only convex and Ω is any closed bounded convex set, it is shown the global convergence/asymptotic stability of the networks in a specified sense. The presented theory sharpens and generalizes the existing results, and, consequently, underlies the applicability of the neural networks for a broader type of optimization problems.	artificial neural network	Rui Zhang;Zongben Xu	2005		10.1007/11596448_115	optimization problem;mathematical optimization;constrained optimization;von neumann stability analysis;systems modeling;computer science;calculus;mathematics;convex set;mathematical economics;type theory;artificial neural network	ML	69.85459718330557	13.463768597045311	127166
9b70f9caf81ab3af64194cd7bf4543ef14a90835	new exact jacobi elliptic function solutions for the coupled schrödinger-boussinesq equations		A general algebraic method based on the generalized Jacobi elliptic functions expansion method, the improved general mapping deformation method, and the extended auxiliary function method with computerized symbolic computation is proposed to construct more new exact solutions for coupled Schrödinger-Boussinesq equations. As a result, several families of new generalized Jacobi elliptic function wave solutions are obtained by using this method, some of them are degenerated to solitary wave solutions and trigonometric function solutions in the limited cases, which shows that the general method is more powerful than plenty of traditional methods and will be used in further works to establish more entirely new solutions for other kinds of nonlinear partial differential equations arising in mathematical physics.

A local integration defines a windowed scattering transform, which is proved to be Lipschitz-continuous to the action of C2 diffeomorphisms. As the window size increases, it converges to a wavelet scattering transform that is translation invariant. Scattering coefficients also provide representations of stationary processes.

In addition,the solutions we get are more general than the solutions the extended F-expansion method gets. At the same time, our method is more convenient than the method in [Chaos, Solitons and Fractals 18 (2003) 299-309] and the solutions we get are more abundant than the solutions in [H-q Zh. Appl.

It is shown that spectrally stable semidiscrete Lax shocks are nonlinearly stable. In addition, it is proved that weak semidiscrete Lax profiles satisfy the spectral stability hypotheses made here and are therefore nonlinearly stable. The nonlinear stability results are proved by constructing the resolvent kernel using exponential dichotomies, which have recently been developed in this setting, and then using the contour integral representation for the associated Green’s function to derive pointwise bounds that are sufficient for proving nonlinear stability. Previous stability analyses for semidiscrete shocks relied primarily on Evans functions, which exist only for one-sided upwind schemes. ∗Beck was partially supported under NSF grant DMS-0602891 †Hupkes acknowledges support from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) ‡Sandstede was partially supported by the NSF through grant DMS-0907904 §Zumbrun was partially supported by the NSF through grant DMS-0801745	discretization;ibm notes;nonlinear system;resolution (logic);time complexity;upwind scheme	Margaret Beck;Hermen Jan Hupkes;Björn Sandstede;Kevin Zumbrun	2010	SIAM J.

Then, for the same problem-solving task, different Gtype (gradient type) models based on different energy functions (EFs) are developed and investigated as well. Moreover, the convergence analyses of Z-type and G-type models are studied in-depth for the completeness of this paper. Besides, for possible circuit and/or computer realization, Matlab Simulink modeling of Z-type and G-type models is illustrated. Through illustrative examples, the efficacy and superiority of the proposed Z-type and G-type models for TVISR problem solving are verified and substantiated.	glib;gradient;matlab;methods of computing square roots;problem solving;simulink	Yunong Zhang;Zhen Li;Dongsheng Guo;Weibing Li;Pei Chen	2013	Soft Comput.	10.1007/s00500-013-1124-5	mathematical optimization;calculus;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	AI	73.53203556455905	5.876307715098585	128135

Moreover, the stability of a traveling wave is equivalent to that of the corresponding fixed point. Space translational system is chaotic on the set of traveling waves with rational velocities. In addition, time evolution operator exhibits sensitivity-like behavior with respect to initial conditions. By investigating the spatial periodicity of traveling waves, we obtain infinitely many space-time periodic structures. We also consider spatial asymptoticity of these traveling waves, which leads to the existence of fronts, defect solutions and soliton-like solutions. The abundance of traveling waves may be regarded as a signature of the spatial-temporal complexity in extended systems.	map	Wen-Xin Qin	2000	I. J.

In general, the behavior of a given linear differential system has many different representations. In this paper we restrict ourselves to kernel and image representations. Two kernel representations are called equivalent if they represent one and the same behavior. For kernel representations defined by polynomial matrices, necessary and sufficient conditions for equivalence are well-known. In this paper, we deal with the equivalence of rational representations, i. e. kernel and image representations that are defined in terms of rational matrices. As the main result of this paper, we will derive a new condition for equivalence of rational kernel representations of possibly noncontrollable behaviors. This paper also deals with the equivalence of polynomial as well as rational image representations.		Sasanka V. Gottimukkala;Harry L.

The problem is related to a group of recursive equations. By proposing a general complete parametric solution to this group of recursive equations, a general complete parametric approach is presented for the proposed infinite eigenvalue assignment problem. General parametric forms of the closed-loop eigenvectors and the feedback gain matrix are given in terms of certain parameter vectors which represent the design degrees of freedom. The approach involves mainly a singular value decomposition of the matrix E and a singular value decomposition of a lower dimension matrix, and thus is very simple and requires less computational work. Moreover, it overcomes the defects of some previous works. An example is given to illustrate the effect of the approach.		Biao Zhang	2010	Int. J.

The quantum eigenvalue problem is derived to compute the separable pure state nearest to the given multipartite pure state. Computing the modulus largest quantum eigenvalue for a multipartite pure state is equivalent to finding the best complex rank-one approximation of the complex unit tensors, associated with the multipartite pure states. This paper is devoted to present a complex-valued neural networks approach for the computation of the quantum eigenvalue problem for multipartite pure states. We design the neural networks for computing the best rank-one tensor approximation of complex tensors, and prove that the solution of the networks is locally asymptotically stable in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. This solution also converges to the local optimal solutions of the best complex rank-one tensor approximation. We illustrate our theoretical results via numerical simulations.	artificial neural network;quantum entanglement;quantum state	Maolin Che;Liqun Qi;Yimin Wei;Guofeng Zhang	2018	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2018.05.094	tensor;discrete mathematics;quantum entanglement;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;multipartite;lyapunov stability;machine learning;artificial neural network;artificial intelligence;separable space;stability theory;mathematics	ML	71.63472487759907	12.844398388183894	129831

The latter is chosen to overcome restrictions by widely known Givone-Roesser and Fornasini-Marchesini models. It is capable of describing noncausal systems as well as shift operations with respect to more than one coordinate direction. It thus provides a system description that offers better compliance with possible hardware realizations than existing models and thus allows evaluation and consideration of many realization specific effects.

Sometimes only a short piece of history provides the relevant influence (bounded or finite delay), while in other cases it is the whole history that has to be taken into account (unbounded or infinite delay). In this paper a chemostat model with time variable delays and wall growth, hence a nonautonomous problem, is investigated. The analysis provides sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of nontrivial equilibria of the chemostat with variable delays, as well as for the existence of nonautonomous pullback attractors.	dynamical system;multiscroll attractor	Tomás Caraballo;Xiaoying Han;Peter E.

This ensures that the cost of each step is minimized. However, the cost per unit step is not necessarily minimized because it may be possible to take larger steps if an extra evaluation is used. The change in efficiency when one extra evaluation per step is used is investigated for classes of (4,5), (5,6), and (6,7) pairs with the minimum number of evaluations. The aim is to show that using an extra evaluation does not necessarily increase the cost per unit step, and that in some cases the cost may decrease.The paper begins with the derivation of the new classes. Then the new and existing classes are compared using standard functions of the free parameters. Following this, numerical comparisons of representative pairs from the new and existing classes are presented. The new (4,5) and (5,6) pairs are found to be more efficient and just as reliable as the existing (4,5) and (5,6) pairs. For the (6,7)...	runge–kutta methods	Philip W. Sharp;E. Smart	1993	SIAM J.

If the deficiency is equal to or greater than one, and the CRN fulfills some structural conditions, then it is possible to establish whether or not the set of Mass Action Kinetics Ordinary Differential Equations (MAK-ODEs) induced by the CRN can support Multiple Positive Steady States (MPSS) within each stoichiometric compatibility class. If MPSS exists the CRNT provides a set of kinetic constants for such steady states. Most of the heterogeneous catalytic CRNs are of deficiency one, thus the CRNT applies straightforwardly. Moreover, the balance of catalytic sites defines a stoichiometric compatibility class. In this contribution, CRNT is used along with Grobner basis to derive analytical polynomial expressions depending on a measurable chemical species ( e.g.  the product of interest) and the catalytic site concentration. This methodology reveals the exact regions where MPSS are supported. Putative heterogeneous catalytic CRNs, such as Eley–Rideal and Langmuir–Hinshelwood, are analyzed using this methodology.	chemical reaction network theory;gröbner basis	José Martín Méndez González	2017	J.

The Morse-Smale complex associated with f induces a subdivision of M into regions of uniform gradient flow, and represents the topology of M in a compact way. Function f can be simplified by cancelling its critical points in pairs, thus simplifying the topological representation of M, provided by the Morse-Smale complex. Here, we investigate the effect of the cancellation of critical points of f in Morse-Smale complexes in two and three dimensions by showing how the change of connectivity of a Morse-Smale complex induced by a cancellation can be interpreted and understood in a more intuitive and straightforward way as a change of connectivity in the corresponding ascending and descending Morse complexes. We consider a discrete counterpart of the Morse-Smale complex, called a quasi-Morse complex, and we present a compact graph-based representation of such complex and of its associated discrete Morse complexes, showing also how such representation is affected by a cancellation.

Since the nonsmoothness is inherent in this field, the viscosity solution approach is employed to investigate the relationships among the value function, the adjoint equations along near-optimal trajectories. Unlike the classical case, the definition of viscosity solution contains a perturbation factor, through which the illusory differentiability conditions on the value function are dispensed properly. Moreover, we establish new relationships between variational equations and adjoint equations. As an application, a kind of stochastic recursive near-optimal control problem is given to illustrate our theoretical results.	optimal control;recursion (computer science);viscosity solution	Liangquan Zhang;Qing Zhou	2018	J.

When n 1⁄4 1 2 and 1 3 , traveling solitary wave solutions and periodic solutions are computed by using the tanh method and hyperbolic function method, respectively. Then we generalize the results to the case n 1⁄4 k kþ2 ðk 2 NÞ and general formulas for exact solutions of K(n,n) equation are established, which indicate that under appropriate conditions, traveling solitary wave solutions and periodic solutions of the focusing branch of the genuinely nonlinear dispersive K(n,n) equation can be found explicitly. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Compared with the predator–prey model without Allee effect, we find that the Allee effect of prey species increases the extinction risk of both predators and prey. When the handling time of predators is relatively short and the Allee effect of prey species becomes strong, both predators and prey may become extinct. Moreover, it is shown that the model with Allee effect undergoes the Hopf bifurcation and heteroclinic bifurcation. The Allee effect of prey species can lead to unstable periodical oscillation. It is also found that the positive equilibrium of the model could change from stable to unstable, and then to stable when the strength of Allee effect or the handling time of predators increases continuously from zero, that is, the model admits stability switches as a parameter changes. When the Allee effect of prey species becomes strong, longer handling time of predators may stabilize the coexistent steady state.	functional response;lotka–volterra equations;prey	Jian Zu;Masayasu Mimura	2010	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2010.09.029	functional response;heteroclinic cycle;control theory;mathematics;limit cycle;allee effect;steady state;oscillation;hopf bifurcation	Logic	78.19343580951734	5.597924853696844	131084

This paper presents a new class of discretization methods, which we refer to as anti-Szegő quadrature rules. AntiSzegő rules can be used to estimate the error in Szegő quadrature rules: under suitable conditions, pairs of associated Szegő and anti-Szegő quadrature rules provide upper and lower bounds for the value of the given integral. The construction of anti-Szegő quadrature rules is almost identical to that of Szegő quadrature rules in that pairs of associated Szegő and anti-Szegő rules differ only in the choice of a parameter of unit modulus. Several examples of Szegő and anti-Szegő quadrature rule pairs are presented.	discretization;modulus robot;numerical integration;trigonometric polynomial	Sun-Mi Kim;Lothar Reichel	2007	Math.

Due to their computational advantages, they are widely used in scientific computation. Here we are interested in linear parabolic problems where the evolution is given by an analytic semigroup. Apart from the simple situation where the single operators generate semigroups of contractions, the stability of operator splitting methods in Banach spaces can be a delicate problem. In this paper we derive a Banach space framework that allows us to prove the stability of the Lie--Trotter splitting for noncontractive semigroups under reasonable assumptions on the involved operators. It is noteworthy that the same assumptions also imply stability of the Strang--Marchuk splitting. The stability result is verified with the help of a particular representation of the local error combined with an appropriate commutator bound. Our abstract stability result can be applied, in particular, to the dimension split...	automatic semigroup	Alexander Ostermann;Katharina Schratz	2013	SIAM J.

Introduction. In 1972, Chang and Zadeh [2] first introduced the concept of fuzzy derivative, followed up ten years later by Dubois and Prade [5], who used the extension principle in their approach. In the mean time, Puri and Ralescu [12] used the notion of H-differentiability to extend the differential of set-valued functions to that of fuzzy functions. This led Seikkala [13] to introduce the notion of fuzzy derivative as an extension of the Hukuhara derivative and the fuzzy integral, which was the same as that proposed by Dubois and Prade [3, 4]. Naturally, the investigation of fuzzy differential and integral equations, existence and uniqueness theorems for the solutions of fuzzy initial value problems, drew upon the interest of many researchers of the fuzzy domain. and the references therein. In this paper, using the properties of fuzzy integration [8, 9], we examine the existence and uniqueness of initial value problems of second-order fuzzy differential equations:	fuzzy set	Dimitris N.

In this model, the linear dynamics are formulated in terms of orthonormal basis functions (OBFs). The nonlinearity is modeled by a multivariate polynomial. In general, an infinite number of OBFs is needed for an exact representation of the system. This paper considers the approximation of a Wiener system with finite-order infinite impulse response dynamics and a polynomial nonlinearity. We propose to use a limited number of generalized OBFs (GOBFs). The pole locations, needed to construct the GOBFs, are estimated via the best linear approximation of the system. The coefficients of the multivariate polynomial are determined with a linear regression. This paper provides a convergence analysis for the proposed identification scheme. It is shown that the estimated output converges in probability to the exact output. Fast convergence rates, in the order Op(NF −nrep/2), can be achieved, with NF the number of excited frequencies and nrep the number of repetitions of the GOBFs.	algorithm;basis function;chua's circuit;coefficient;expanded memory;fmrib software library (fsl);identification scheme;infinite impulse response;linear approximation;linear time-invariant theory;mathematical optimization;new foundations;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;polynomial;soft-in soft-out decoder;system identification;time-invariant system	Koen Tiels;Johan Schoukens	2014	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2014.10.010	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;system identification;nonlinear system;dynamical system;calculus;control theory;mathematics;statistics	ML	69.98240321936562	8.141666051694221	132105

Under mass-action kinetics the steady states of these networks are described by fewnomial systems, that is polynomial systems defined by polynomials having few distinct monomials. Such systems of polynomials are often studied in real algebraic geometry by the use of Gale dual systems. We explore how the idea of Gale duality can be used to learn about the steady states of fewnomial networks. In particular, we give precise conditions in terms of the reaction rate constants for the number and stability of the steady states of families of reaction networks with one non-flow reaction.	algebraic equation;bistability;chemical reaction network theory;kinetics internet protocol;monomial;polynomial	Elisenda Feliu;Martin Helmer	2018	CoRR		discrete mathematics;monomial;chemical reaction;duality (optimization);mathematics;real algebraic geometry;reaction rate;kinetics;polynomial	NLP	76.31515458983151	5.388796857572938	132330

The dynamics of the model depend on the basic reproductive numbers of the prey and predator. Intratrophic predation can have impact on the system only if the basic reproductive number of the predator is greater than 1. In this case, the system may have multiple coexisting equilibria. However, intratrophic predation can stabilize the system when such an equilibrium is unique. Moreover, it can elevate the magnitude of the prey population and diminish the level of nutrient concentration of any coexisting equilibrium. 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

It is shown that the ``dummy variable'' [2] method of analog solution is not suitable if we want not only the ``forced'' solution, but also the ``free'' or ``homogeneous'' solution (corresponding to arbitrary initial conditions y(0), py(0) ... p n-1 y(0)). It is in fact impossible to find the initial conditions x 1 (0) ... x n (0) at the output of the integrators in the analog scheme, corresponding to the ``dummy variable'' method. The reason is found in the framework of linear system theory, which shows that this scheme represents a non observable system. An intuitive explanation of this fact is shown at the end of the paper. Other analog computer schemes are shown which do not present this difficulty, and which give the ``free'' as well as the ``forced'' solution of our equation.		Angelo Marzollo	1966	IEEE Trans.

It is shown that the state trajectory of the projection neural network is exponentially convergent to its equilibrium point if the Jacobian matrix of the nonlinear mapping is positive definite, while the convergence rate is proportional to a design parameter if the Jacobian matrix is only positive semidefinite. Moreover, the convergence time is guaranteed to be finite if the design parameter is chosen to be sufficiently large. Furthermore, if a diagonal block of the Jacobian matrix is positive definite, then the corresponding partial state trajectory of the projection neural network is also exponentially convergent. Three optimization examples are used to show the convergence performance of the projection neural network.	artificial neural network;constrained optimization;jacobian matrix and determinant;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;rate of convergence	Youshen Xia;Gang Feng	2004	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2003.821413	jacobian matrix and determinant;equilibrium point;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;modes of convergence;compact convergence;control theory;mathematics;convergence tests;positive-definite matrix;rate of convergence;normal convergence;artificial neural network	ML	73.30909863693242	4.374028853435915	134287

26e0bdbc54916095162fc2db6ac3672f2c666b8f	existence and uniqueness theorem for uncertain heat equation		with stationary and independent increments which are normal uncertain variables. Later on, uncertain calculus was developed by Liu (2009) to handle the integration and differentiation of functions of uncertain processes. By now, uncertain process has been successfully extended in many directions, including uncertain renewal process (Liu 2008), uncertain renewal reward process (Liu 2010), uncertain alternating renewal process (Yao and Li 2012), and uncertain contour process (Yao 2015). As a type of differential equations, uncertain differential equation driven by Liu process was first developed by Liu (2008). The existence and uniqueness theorem for an uncertain differential equation was proved by Chen and Liu (2010). Moreover, Yao and Chen (2013) proved that the solution of an uncertain differential equation can be represented by a spectrum of ordinary differential equations. For more detailed exposition of uncertain differential equation, the readers may consult Yao’s recent book (Yao 2016). At present, uncertain differential equation has been widely applied in many fields such as uncertain finance (Liu 2009, 2013; Chen and Gao 2013; Liu et al. 2015), uncertain optimal control (Zhu 2010), and uncertain differential game (Yang and Gao 2013, 2016). Uncertain partial differential equation driven by Liu process was first proposed by Yang and Yao (2016). They also studied uncertain heat equation whose heat source is affected by uncertain interference. And they obtained the solution and inverse uncertainty distribution of solution for a special linear uncertain heat equation. Based on this work, this paper will prove an existence and uniqueness theorem of solution for general uncertain heat equation under linear growth condition and Lispchitz condition. The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 reviews some basic definitions and results of uncertainty theory. Section 3 introduces uncertain partial differential equation. Abstract Uncertain heat equation is a type of uncertain partial differential equations, whose heat source is affected by uncertain interference. This paper proves an existence and uniqueness theorem of solutions for general uncertain heat equations under linear growth condition and Lipschitz condition. Moreover, for several special uncertain heat equations, the conditions of existence and uniqueness are derived.	entity–relationship model;granular computing;interference (communication);linear function;optimal control;stationary process;uncertainty theory;yang;yao graph	Xiangfeng Yang;Yaodong Ni	2017	J.

Further, we deduce the necessary condition for the minimizer of the control functional.

A software package, intended for normalization of autonomous Hamiltonian systems by means of computer algebra, is designed so that normalization problems of high analytical complexity could be solved. It is used to obtain the Birkhoff normal form of the Hamiltonian in the given problem. The normalization is carried out up to the 6th order of expansion of the Hamiltonian in the coordinates and momenta. Analytical expressions for the coefficients of the normal form of the 6th order are derived. Though intermediary expressions occupy gigabytes of the computer memory, the obtained coefficients of the normal form are compact enough for presentation in typographic format. The analogue of the Deprit formula for the stability criterion is derived in the 6th order of normalization. The obtained floating-point numerical values for the normal form coefficients and the stability criterion confirm the results by Markeev (1969) and Coppola and Rand (1989), while the obtained analytical and exact numeric expressions confirm the results by Meyer and Schmidt (1986) and Schmidt (1989). The given computational problem is solved without constructing a specialized algebraic processor, i.e., the designed computer algebra package has a broad field of applicability. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Frame theory describes how one can choose the corresponding coefficients, which are called frame coefficients. From the mathematical point of view this is gratifying, but for applications it is a problem that the calculation requires inversion of an operator on H. The projection method is introduced in order to avoid this problem. The basic idea is to consider finite subfamilies {fi}i=1 of the frame and the orthogonal projection Pn onto span{fi}i=1. For f ∈ H, Pnf has a representation as a linear combination of fi, i = 1, 2, ..n, and the corresponding coefficients can be calculated using finite dimensional methods. We find conditions implying that those coefficients converge to the correct frame coefficients as n → ∞, in which case we have avoided the inversion problem. In the same spirit we approximate the solution to a moment problem. It turns out, that the class of “well-behaving frames” are identical for the two problems we consider.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;converge;hilbert space;moment problem;regular expression	Peter G.

By using the method of lines, the PDAE is transformed into a large system of usually stiff ordinary differential algebraic equations and integrated by standard methods. The resulting nonlinear programming problem is solved by the sequential quadratic programming code NLPQL. Optimal control functions are approximated by piecewise constant, piecewise linear or bang-bang functions. Three different types of cost functions can be formulated. The underlying model structure is quite flexible. We allow break points for model changes, disjoint integration areas with respect to spatial variable, arbitrary boundary and transition conditions, coupled ordinary and algebraic differential equations, algebraic equations in time and space variables, and dynamic constraints for control and state variables. The PDAE is discretized by difference formulae, polynomial approximations with arbitrary degrees, and by special update formulae in case of hyperbolic equations. Two application problems are outlined in detail. We present a model for optimal control of transdermal diffusion of drugs, where the diffusion speed is controlled by an electric field, and a model for the optimal control of the input feed of an acetylene reactor given in form of a distributed parameter system.	approximation algorithm;bang file;control function (econometrics);discretization;dynamical system;iterative method;mathematical optimization;method of lines;nlpqlp;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimal control;partial differential algebraic equation;piecewise linear continuation;polynomial;rate of convergence;reactor (software);real life;sequential quadratic programming	M.

Our method consists of sampling the time domain [0, T] as well as the parameter space Ω and constructing a continuous piecewise bilinear function which interpolates the solution of the parameterized system at these sample points. More precisely, given an ε > 0, we compute a sampling interval Δ > 0, such that the piecewise bilinear function obtained from the sample points is within ε of the original trajectory. We present experimental results which suggest that our method is scalable.	approximation;bilinear filtering;computation;interpolation;linear system;polyhedron;sampling (signal processing);scalability	Ratan Lal;Pavithra Prabhakar	2015	2015 International Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT)	10.1109/EMSOFT.2015.7318279	mathematical optimization;interpolation;abstraction;linear system;approximation algorithm	Embedded	69.3035003675341	9.017232454508996	136918

For this purpose we use a fixed point algorithm and provide a function whose fixed points correspond to decay points of the monotone operator. This decay point plays a crucial role in checking, in a semi-global fashion, the local input-to-state stability of an interconnected system numerically and in the numerical construction of local input-to-state stability (LISS) Lyapunov functions. We give some improvements of this algorithm and show the advantage to an earlier approach based on the algorithm of Eaves.	algorithm;control theory;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point iteration;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;semiconductor industry;monotone	Roman Geiselhart;Fabian R.

The dynamical system is first decoupled in order to reduce the search size. The reference curves and the simulation curves are obtained with the pre-optimization. A contractive mapping procedure is designed to asymptotically reduce the differences between the curves, whereby the parameters are further optimized. Numerical results indicate that the present method can solve some large-scale problems that are difficult for the previous methods.	dynamical system;mathematical optimization	Guanyu Wang	2004	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/j.matcom.2004.04.005	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;dynamical system;mathematics;statistics;curve fitting	Robotics	82.70664486043587	17.900422608452708	137296

697e0569d55153b8fbbd6d050e048a1f7417c961	on some aspects of non-linear signal modeling and its real world applications		The aim of this thesis is to investigate some new directions in non-linear signal modeling. It begins with a review of existing non-linear models which underlines the multiplicity of the approaches already proposed and their respective features of interest. The first direction investigated is the possible contribution of the theory of stochastic differential equations (SDE) to signal-modeling. This topic is justified by the fact that SDE are known to provide continuous-time representations of many random physical phenomena. Their time discretization however poses a problem, because classical discretization schemes such as Euler method lead to unstable discrete-time models. Ozaki discretization scheme, which lead to stable models, is presented, and a parameter estimation method corresponding to these models is proposed. There are however restrictions on the probability density function of the signals that can be modeled in this way. A much more flexible discrete-time model class is then introduced. The models of this class have a structure based on that of an SDE, and an approximation of the probability density function of a signal generated with a first-order model of this type	approximation;control theory;discretization;estimation theory;euler method;first-order predicate;linear model;nonlinear system;upwind scheme	Jean-Marc Vesin	1993	Signal Processing	10.1016/0165-1684(93)90153-2	computer science;mathematics	ML	74.914086968812	7.683799592218995	137888

Further, a condition for fault detectability in DAE systems is given. Based on the characterization of all residual generators, a design strategy for residual generators for DAE systems is presented. The design strategy guarantees that the resulting residual generator is sensitive to all the detectable faults and also that the residual generator is of lowest possible order. In all results derived, no assumption about observability or controllability is needed. In particular, special care has been devoted to assure the lowest-order property also for non-controllable systems	differential algebraic equation;polynomial	Mattias Nyberg;Erik Frisk	2006	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2006.884960	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;observability;differential algebra;differential algebraic equation;residual;control theory;mathematics	Embedded	71.89666979243839	6.29954955873362	138105

Currently supported machines include the Apple, Atari, Pet, TRS80, TI99/4 and Exidy Sorcerer. The manual, available separately for $15.95 from Programma, contains program listings and an adaptation guide for other dialects of BASIC or other programming languages. The Soft Warehouse 3 is also seeking arrangements for hardware manufacturers and other software distributors to distribute machine-readable versions already customized for various other computers. The symbol calculus consists in the rules of algebra for partial differential (or pseudo-differential) operators, expressed as functions of the non-commuting quantities x~ and ~ / ~ x~ (j=1,... ,n). In quant~n mechanics, the symbol calculus produces semi-classical expansions (i.e. in powers of Planck's constant ~), which are interesting mathematically and also yield accurate numerical approximations. Such expansions are generally quite complicated and justify the use of a computer with an algebraic language. We have shown that most of the popular semi-classical methods (Thomas-Fermi, WKB, Bohr-Sommerfeld) reduce to the semi-classical expansion of the resolvent (H-z)-i by symbol calculus (H is the Hamiltonian operator, z e ~). We have developed a variety of efficient algorithms for that purpose and implemented them on computer. Various applications to concrete physical problems have been found since. We propose a survey of our methods and results, stressing the relevance of algebraic computations to the mathematical problems.	approximation;atari;basic;computer;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);human-readable medium;linear algebra;numerical analysis;programming language;relevance;resolution (logic);semiconductor industry;sorcerer;symbolic computation;tridiagonal matrix algorithm	A.

In computing this period numerically, the integral (3.6), which possesses a weak singularity of the square root type at each endpoint of the integration, is an excellent example of using the Gauss–Chebyshev integration rule of the first kind; while the integral (4.7), which is an integral of a smooth periodic function over its period \([0, 2\pi]\), is an excellent example of using the midpoint rule, but not the trapezoidal rule, suggested by Waldvogel [39, 40], due to a removable singularity of the integrand at \(0\), \(\pi/2\), \(\pi\), \(3\pi/2\), and \(2\pi\), respectively. This paper shows, in computing the period of a periodic solution of the Lotka–Volterra system, the \(n\)-point Gauss–Chebyshev integration rule of the first kind applied to the integral (3.6) becomes the \(4n\)-point midpoint rule to the integral (4.7).	lotka–volterra equations;turing completeness	Shagi-Di Shih;Shue-Sum Chow	2008	Adv.

This kind of infinite-dimensional HJB equation has not been previously studied and is difficult due to the presence of state constraints and the lack of smoothing properties of the state equation. Our main result on the regularity of solutions to such a HJB equation seems to be entirely new. More precisely, we prove that the value function is continuous in a sufficiently big open set of H, that it solves in the viscosity sense the associated HJB equation and it has continuous classical derivative in the direction of the “present”. This regularity result is the starting point to define a feedback map in classical sense, which gives rise to a candidate optimal feedback strategy.	bellman equation;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;hilbert space;jacobi method;navier–stokes equations;optimal control;smoothing;viscosity solution	Salvatore Federico;Ben Goldys;Fausto Gozzi	2010	SIAM J.

In this paper, the method called spectral analysis is newly adopted for periodically time varying (PTV) discrete time systems from the theory of the spectral analysis of linear PTV continuous time systems. Shortly, it describes the steady-state analysis of PTV discrete time systems. It leads to a simple algebraic relations in the frequency domain that minimizes calculations in the time domain. In order to show the generality and usefulness of this method, an illustrative examples are chosen. The comparison of the results with the exact solution concludes that the systems having smooth variation-less number of harmonics with respect to strongly varying systems are rapidly convergent with the high accuracy. The error analysis has being done by computing the root-mean-square error.	spectral method	Gulay Tohumoglu	2005	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2004.02.002	time domain;calculus;control theory;mathematics;mean squared error;steady state;algorithm;discrete frequency domain	Theory	79.58869405946326	14.967459751204386	139549

Individuals mature more quickly when there are fewer of them around. The state dependent time delay is taken to be an increasing differentiable bounded function. In this research, we study the dynamics of our model analytically. We present results on positivity and boundedness of all populations. Criteria for the existence of all equilibria and uniqueness of a positive equilibrium are given. In order to observe the effect of state-dependent maturation delay, local stability analysis around all equilibria of the proposed model is discussed due to variation of maturation delay. Also, global stability of trivial and the boundary equilibria is investigated, using Liapunov functional and LaSalle invariant principle. To investigate the effect of state-dependent maturation delay and the harvesting effort of all species we carried out numerical simulations.	lotka–volterra equations;prey	Jafar Fawzi M.

Convergence aspects are investigated in the case, where the Euler-Maruyama method is simulated in dyadic points. A strong rate of convergence is presented for the numerical simulations and it is shown that the produced sequences converge almost surely. This is an improvement of the general result for SDEs with discontinuous drift, i.e. that the Euler-Maruyama approximations converge in probability to a strong solution of the SDE. A numerical example is presented together with a confidence interval for the numerical solutions.	approximation;converge;dyadic transformation;euler;euler–maruyama method;numerical analysis;rate of convergence;simulation	Maria Simonsen;John Leth;Henrik Schiøler;Horia D.

Moreover a quadratic nonlinear majorant for a nonlinear operator, according to the conditions laid upon it, is built. A priori and a posteriori estimations of the method's error are received. The method needs almost the same number of computations as the classical Secant method, but has a higher order of convergence.

The approximation and localization properties of our operators are studied theoretically in deterministic as well as probabilistic settings. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate their superiority over traditional least squares and discrete Fourier projection polynomial approximations. An essential ingredient in our construction is the construction of quadrature formulas based on scattered data, exact for integrating spherical polynomials of (moderately) high degree. Our formulas are based on scattered sites; i.e., in contrast to such well known formulas as Driscoll–Healy formulas, we need not choose the location of the sites in any particular manner. While the previous attempts to construct such formulas have yielded formulas exact for spherical polynomials of degree at most 18, we are able to construct formulas exact for spherical polynomials of degree 178.	algorithm;approximation;approximation theory;discrete fourier transform;experiment;gramian matrix;least squares;newton–cotes formulas;numerical analysis;numerical integration;order of approximation;polynomial;real life;vieta's formulas	Quoc Thong Le Gia;H.

We apply numerical methods to this problem which, unlike existing symbolic methods for exact systems, can be applied to approximate systems arising in applications.We use Numerical Algebraic Geometry to process the lower order leading nonlinear parts of such pde systems. The irreducible components of such systems are represented by certain generic points lying on each component and are computed by numerically following paths from exactly given points on components of a related system. To check the conditions for involutivity Numerical Linear Algebra techniques are applied to constant matrices which are the leading linear parts of such systems evaluated at the generic points. Representations for the constraints result from applying a method based on Polynomial Matrix Theory.Examples to illustrate the new approach are given. The scope of the method, which applies to complexified problems, is discussed.

This leads to a new class of algebraic constraints in physical systems modeling, and to an interesting class of DAE systems. It is shown how constant Dirac structures and Lagrangian subspaces allow for similar representations, and how this leads to descriptions of the DAE systems entailing generalized Lagrange multipliers.	augmented lagrangian method;differential algebraic equation;euler–lagrange equation;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);lagrange multiplier;systems modeling	Arjan van der Schaft;Bernhard Maschke	2018	Systems & Control Letters	10.1016/j.sysconle.2018.09.008	mathematics;mathematical optimization;linear subspace;algebraic number;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);mathematical analysis;dirac (video compression format);subspace topology;hamiltonian mechanics;lagrangian;physical system	AI	72.81951011612936	11.47680041995914	141238

Secondly, an effective method is proposed for the control design of the output regulation problem by using an augmented system approach. The study of an illustrative example shows that the obtained new results are effective in dealing with the output regulation of BCNs.	control theory;effective method;linear algebra;semiconductor industry;state-space representation	Haitao Li;Lihua Xie;Yuzhen Wang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2016.2606600	control engineering;boolean network;trajectory;manganese;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;artificial neural network	Vision	75.44306793274724	4.42057296086335	141565

This model has two equilibrium solutions, disease-free equilibrium and disease equilibrium. The positivity of the solutions of the model and the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium have been proved. In this paper we particularly focus on Hopf bifurcation which occurs from the disease equilibrium. We present a detailed study on the use of center manifold theory and normal form theory, and derive the normal form associated with Hopf bifurcation, from which approximate amplitude of the bifurcating limit cycles and their stability conditions are obtained. Numerical simulations are compared with the analytical predictions to show a very good agreement.	approximation algorithm;bifurcation theory;computational fluid dynamics;database normalization;dynamical system;hopf bifurcation;limit cycle;nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;simulation	Wenjing Zhang;Pei Yu	2016	I.

Convergence to simple roots is quadratic, but individual approximations to a multiple root converge only linearly. However, it is shown here that the mean of such individual approximations converges quadratically to that root. This result, along with some detail about the behavior of such approximations in the neighborhood of the multiple root, suggests a new approach to the design of polynomial rootfinders. It should also be noted that the technique is well suited to take advantage of a parallel environment. This article first provides the relevant mathematical results: a short derivation of the formulas, convergence proofs, an indication of the behavior near a multiple root, and some error bounds. It then provides the outline of an algorithm based on these results, along with some graphical and numerical results to illustrate the major theoretical points. Finally, a new program based on this algorithm, but with a more efficient way of choosing starting values, is described and then compared with corresponding programs from IMSL and NAG with good results.

More importantly, such a ZNN is based on the Zhang function (ZF) as the error-monitoring function, which is indefinite and quite different from the usual error functions in the study of conventional algorithms, such as a scalar-valued norm-based energy function involved in the gradient-based neural network (GNN). Meanwhile, the resultant ZNN model can guarantee the global/exponential convergence performance for online time-varying problems solving by following Zhang et al.'s design method. In this paper, focusing on solving the time-varying complex matrix-inversion problem, the complex ZNN models are proposed, developed and investigated for time-varying complex matrix inversion. In addition, by introducing different complex ZFs, different corresponding complex ZNN models can be proposed and developed for time-varying complex matrix inversion. Finally, through some simulations and verifications, the illustrative results substantiate the efficacy of the complex ZNN models based on different complex ZFs for time-varying complex matrix inversion.	algorithm;artificial neural network;first-order predicate;gradient;local convergence;mathematical optimization;random neural network;recurrent neural network;resultant;simulation;time complexity;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Yunong Zhang;Dongsheng Guo;Fen Li	2013	2013 10th IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation (ICCA)	10.1109/ICCA.2013.6564858	artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;algorithm	Robotics	73.439791235844	5.64793998797549	142588

In this approach, a problem is modeled in terms of hypotheses and conclusion constraints, and it is solved via constraint satisfaction. The ability to handle linear and nonlinear algebraic constraints is essential for successful application of constraint-based reasoning in engineering. Due to the scarcity of algebraic techniques for satisfying nonlinear constraints, little attention has been paid to the use of constraint-based reasoning for solving nonlinear problems. This paper examines the use of the Grobner Bases method for satisfying nonlinear constraints in the context of constraint-based reasoning. After a brief introduction to the Grobner Bases method and its role in constraint-based reasoning, two examples are presented. The first example illustrates the use of Grobner bases, in the context of constraint-based reasoning, for reasoning about the behavior of beams. The second example illustrates the geometry configuration of truss structures via constraint-based reasoning.	case-based reasoning;constraint satisfaction;gröbner basis;linear algebra;nonlinear system;problem solving	Sivand Lakmazaheri	1997	AI EDAM	10.1017/S0890060400001803	constraint logic programming;knowledge base;constraint programming;binary constraint;qualitative reasoning;constraint satisfaction;computational geometry;computer science;constraint graph;artificial intelligence;adaptive reasoning;computer aided design;reasoning system;constraint;deductive reasoning;expert system;algorithm	AI	70.31155294809474	15.54565134513108	142644

The Hamilton–Jacobi equations are deduced by variational calculus. A Hamilton space is a pair H = (M, H) formed by a differentiable manifold M and a regular Hamiltonian H : T ∗M −→ . The notion was introduced by the present author in 1987 and published in the paper [1]. In the last five years many geometers as: S. Watanabe, S. Ikeda, H. Shimada, M. Anastasiei, Gh. Atanasiu, D. Hrimiuc, M. Kirkovits and others have obtained new important results in this field and its applications. In my lecture I shall present the notion of Hamilton space, its relationship to Lagrange spaces, as well as to Cartan spaces (as duals of Finsler spaces) and generalized Hamilton spaces. Among the classes of these spaces and Riemann spaces we have the inclusions {Rn} ⊂ {Cn} ⊂ {Hn} ⊂ {GHn} which show the importance of these geometries. The variational problem is discussed, too. The recent book [3] contains part of these problems.

48a07e166cec5ce7427d6b2884ff1aec856b53c0	a new criterion for strong observability		Apart from controllability and observability an important concept in linear system theory is strong observability [1] — [4j. This latter concept appears naturally in the study of singular quadratic optimal control problems [4]. A strongly (alternatively perfectly) observable is that system for which an observer can determine the state vector x(0) = x0 with the knowledge of output y(t) only, information regarding input u(t) not required. The criteria of these concepts in terms of system matrices (A, B, C, D) are well known [ l ] . In this correspondence we shall formulate these criteria in terms of parameters contained in transfer-function matrix representation of the system in the form P(s) <z(s). Given a transfer-function matrix description T(s) of a system it may be of interest to decide whether any minimal realization of this system is strongly observable or not. So one has to find out at first the minimal realization by applying the existing methods and then to apply the available criteria given in terms of state space descrip^tion to check whether this realization of the system is strongly observable or not. If instead one could check the strong observability of state realization with the help of parameters of T(s) the first step could be avoided to get the desired information. The aim of this short note is to formulate a criterion of strong observability of the state-space realization of a given system in terms of the parameters of its transferfunction matrix.

Under the nonresonant condition, existence, uniqueness, and incoexistence of 1-homoclinic loop and 1-periodic orbit, the inexistence of k-homoclinic loop and k-periodic orbit is obtained. Under the resonant condition, we study the existence of 1-homoclinic loop, 1-periodic orbit, 2-fold 1-periodic orbit, and two 1-periodic orbits; the coexistence of 1-homoclinic loop and 1-periodic orbit. Moreover, we give the corresponding existence fields and bifurcation surfaces. At last, we study the stability of the homoclinic loop for the two cases of non-resonant and resonant, and we obtain the corresponding criterions.	anatomic bifurcation;bifurcation theory;calculus of variations;coexist (image);geosynchronous orbit;hopf bifurcation;ocular orbit;solutions	Yinlai Jin;Feng Li;Han Xu;Jing Li;Liqun Zhang;Benyan Ding	2013		10.1155/2013/582820	computer simulation;classical mechanics;homoclinic orbit;computer science;linear model;homoclinic bifurcation;control theory;mathematics;geometry;population dynamics;algorithm;statistics;heteroclinic orbit	ML	80.187301161841	4.716359144226205	143515

The user specifies an accuracy parameter and the method attempts to produce a solution consistent with this accuracy requirement. The relationship between the global error in the numerical solution and the prescribed accuracy requirement is problem dependent and very difficult to quantify precisely. On the other hand, most variable-order Adams methods provide the user with a piecewise polynomial approximation to the solution and use this to provide intermediate solutions at specified output points. Since the pmcewlse polynomial is dlfferentlable at all but a fimte number of points, one can define the defect of the numerical solution as the amount by which the plecewlse polynomial fails to satisfy the differential equation The maximum magnitude of the defect can then be used as a measure of the accuracy of the solution and, since the defect can be shown to be directly related to the local error, it provides a measure of accuracy that is relatively insensitive to the specific problem. In this study, the underlying piecewise polynomial approximates associated with two of the popular Adams codes are analyzed and assessed, and it is shown how the magnitude of the defect Is related to the prescribed accuracy parameter That current methods can keep the maximum magnitude of the defect bounded by a small multiple of the tolerance is also shown Numerical results that verify the analysis on a variety of problems are presented.	anomaly detection at multiple scales;approximation;code;linear multistep method;numerical method;numerical partial differential equations;polynomial;small multiple;software bug	P.

This result has found many applications in models from various fields including biology, ecology, and chemistry. Smith (1991) has extended Smillie's result and proved entrainment in the case where the vector field is time-varying and periodic. We use the theory of linear totally nonnegative differential systems developed by Schwarz (1970) to give a generalization of these two results. This is based on weakening the requirement for strong cooperativity to cooperativity, and adding an additional observability-type condition.

The multivariate weight functions dependent on function-to-function ratios play a key role in constructing higher-order iterative methods. Extensive investigation of extraneous fixed points of the proposed iterative methods is carried out for the study of the dynamics associated with corresponding basins of attraction. Numerical experiments applied to a number of test equations strongly support the underlying theory pursued in this paper. Relevant dynamics of the proposed methods is well presented with a variety of illustrative basins of attraction applied to various test polynomials.	fixed point (mathematics);newton	Young Hee Geum;Young Ik Kim;Beny Neta	2016	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2016.02.029	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;mathematics	Logic	81.24399513702096	17.100316687656168	145729

Integro-differential operators allow us in particular to study initial value and boundary problems for linear ODEs from an algebraic point of view. Differential operators already provide a rich algebraic structure with a wealth of results and algorithmic methods. Adding integral operators and evaluations, many new phenomena appear, including zero devisors and non-finitely generated ideals. In this tutorial, we give an introduction to symbolic methods for integro-differential operators and boundary problems developed over the last years. In particular, we discuss normal forms, basic algebraic properties, and the computation of polynomial solutions for ordinary integro-differential equations with polynomial coefficients. We will also outline methods for manipulating and solving linear boundary problems and illustrate them with an implementation.	coefficient;database normalization;iterative method;linear algebra;polynomial;symbolic computation	Georg Regensburger	2016		10.1145/2930889.2930942	microlocal analysis;constant coefficients;spectral theorem;operator theory;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algebraic differential equation;fourier integral operator;differential algebraic geometry;algebra	Theory	78.73235061604188	12.6988150923006	145774

4bbd0b2a1d0fa11a53a3324861d84fa903e27c67	analytical scrutiny of nonlinear equation of hypocycloid motion by agm		The curve produced by fixed point on the circumference of a small circle of specified radius rolling around the inside of a large circle with bigger radius than the other one is named hypocycloid. In the present paper, a semi-hypocycloid motion of a cylinder has been simulated by extracting the governing nonlinear differential equation of this especial motion, and then, the obtained equation has been solved completely by a simple and innovative approach which we have named it Akbari–Ganji’s method (AGM). On the basis of comparisons which have been made between the gained solutions by AGM, numerical method (Runge–Kutta 4th) and VIM, it is possible to indicate that AGM can be successfully applied for various differential equations. In this paper, a nonlinear vibrational equation has been solved by AGM, and afterward, the application of AGM will be shown in our own specified problem. It is noteworthy that this method has some valuable advantages, for instance in this approach, it is not necessary to utilize dimensionless parameters in order to simplify equation. So there is no need to convert the variables to new ones that heightens the complexity of the problem. Moreover by utilizing AGM, the shortage of boundary condition(s) for solving differential equation will be terminated by using derivatives of main differential equation(s). The results reveal that this method is very effective, simple, reliable and can be applied for many other nonlinear problems.	angularjs;approximation;belief revision;boundary element method;chart;coefficient;cylinder seal;fixed point (mathematics);in the beginning... was the command line;initial condition;iteration;newton's method;nonlinear system;numerical method;numerical partial differential equations;runge–kutta methods;semiconductor industry;vim	Navid Balazadeh Meresht;D.

296d7487c4acf53117c5b32bd70ca19287ea6f10	sensitivity curve approximation using linear algebra		Calibration of color cameras requires that a calibration pattern is recorded and color responsivity curves are estimated from the recorded data. Very often, these curves are sampled at discrete wavelength, so that the calibration problem can be written as a system of linear equations. The solution of the – usually overdetermined – problem is subject to a constrained optimization problem, as these curves need to have a certain shape. In this article we apply different methods to incorporate constraints into the estimation problem while still keeping the problem linear.	approximation;clipping (computer graphics);constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);linear algebra;linear equation;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;optimization problem;system of linear equations	Dietrich Paulus;Vinh Hong;Corvin Idler;Joachim Hornegger;Laszlo Csink	2004			discrete mathematics;linear algebra;linear approximation;coefficient matrix;mathematical analysis;mathematics	Vision	77.01081873222803	17.762715737356668	146508

These filters are characterized by two relevant properties: i) they are able to arbitrarily well approximate any discrete-time, time-invariant, causal, infinite-memory, continuous, nonlinear system and ii) they are always stable according to the bounded-input-bounded-output criterion. Even though recursive models can represent many systems with fewer coefficients than their finite-memory counterparts, it is still possible to further reduce their computational complexity. In fact, while in general simplified structures lead to a loss of performance, it is pointed out in the paper that in various common real-world situations, they are able of giving remarkable complexity reductions without negatively affecting the modeling capabilities.	approximation algorithm;bibo stability;basis function;causal filter;coefficient;computational complexity theory;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;nonlinear system;pseudocode;recursion (computer science);time-invariant system	Alberto Carini;Giovanni L.

And artificial neural network is an effective and practical method and approach for solving linear programming problem of nonlinear convex set constraints in engineering field. Most models of artificial neural network are nonlinear dynamic system. If the objective function of optimization calculation problem is corresponding to some energy function of network, steady state point is the local or global optimal dynamic process solution for optimizing the problem. This paper studied the optimization problem with nonlinear constrained convex set by the application of nonlinear neural network. First, the inverse optimization problem with nonlinear convex set constraints into nonlinear bilevel programming problem. Then the optimization solution was searched by establishing neural network model. In addition, the stability of model was analyzed and sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability of the balance point were given. Finally, the validity and effectiveness of the conclusion was verified by example.	artificial neural network;convex set;dynamical system;linear programming;mathematical optimization;network model;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;steady state	Huaxian Cai;Tian Tian;Yilin Cai	2014	JDIM		fractional programming;optimization problem;mathematical optimization;convex optimization;second-order cone programming;linear matrix inequality;nonlinear programming;cutting stock problem;machine learning;interior point method;active set method;quadratic programming;global optimization	ML	69.60805901044739	12.62510888796549	147258

As the authors of [2] remarked, the products of Bessel and of modified Bessel functions of the first kind appear frequently in problems of statistical mechanics and plasma physics [3]. Motivated by the importance of products of modified Bessel functions in [2] the authors deduced explicit representations for powers of these functions. In this note we would like to point out that although little is known about the explicit expression for the MacLaurin series of powers of modified Bessel functions of the first kind, the general theory is very old and is well developed. In [2, Eq. 30] the authors deduced an explicit recurrence formula which determines the coefficients in the MacLaurin series expansion of powers of modified Bessel functions of the first kind, i.e. they proved that [Iν(x)] = ∑ n≥0 an(r)(x/2) n!(ν + n)!(ν!)r−1 , (1) where the polynomials an(r) are determined recursively by [2, Eq. 31] an(r) = r ν + n ν + 1 an−1(r)+ n ∑ k=0 bk(ν) (ν + 1)!Ck ν+n n!(ν + k+ 1)! an−1(r), (2) and the integer sequence bk(ν) is identified by expanding the right-hand side of ∑ k≥0 bk(ν)x (ν + k)!(k− 1)! = x (ν + 1)! [ √ xIν(2 √ x) (ν + 1)Iν+1(2 √ x) − 2 ] . I Research supported by the János Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

Baricz / Applied Mathematics Letters 23 (2010) 722–724 723 Here, as usual, Ck n = ( n k ) = n! k!(n− k)! denotes the binomial coefficient. Although in [2] the ranges of validity of ν and r are not specified, due to the notation tacitly it is assumed that ν is a natural number and r is an arbitrary real number. In this short note we show that in fact (1) can be deduced easily for ν and r real (or complex) numbers by using a very old formula of Euler; moreover instead of (2) we propose another recurrence formula for the coefficients which is more convenient for direct computations. To this end let r be an arbitrary real (or complex) number and consider the power series f (x) = ∑ n≥0 cnx n and [f (x)]r = ∑ n≥0 dnx n. Thus [4, p. 754] d0 = cr 0, c0 6= 0, dn = 1 nc0 n ∑ k=1 [k(r + 1)− n]ckdn−k. (3) This recurrence formula was deduced first in 1748 by the genius of the ‘‘teacher of all mathematicians’’ whose iconic name is Leonhard Euler, in his famous Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum. However, this basic recurrence formula is not as widely known as it should be, and it has been rediscovered several times. For more details on the history of relation (3) and related coefficient problems in multiplying power series the interested reader is referred to [5] and to the references therein. Now consider the power series Iν(x) = 20(ν + 1)xIν(x) = ∑ n≥0 (x/4)n n!(ν + 1)n , which is sometimes called the normalized modified Bessel function of the first kind. Here (ν + 1)n for ν 6= −1,−2, . . . denotes the well-known Pochhammer (or Appell) symbol defined in terms of Euler’s gamma function, i.e. (ν + 1)n = (ν + 1)(ν + 2) · · · (ν + n) = 0(ν + n + 1)/0(ν + 1). For convenience we denote by αn the general coefficient of the above power series, i.e. let αn = [4nn!(ν + 1)n] for all n ≥ 0 integer. Moreover we assume that the power series of [Iν(x)] has the form ∑ n≥0 βn(r)x n. Observe that α0 = 1 and hence β0(r) = 1. Then by using Euler’s formula (3) we easily get	academy;appell sequence;bessel filter;coefficient;computation;cosmographiae introductio;elasticity (data store);electrical engineering;emoticon;euler;jános komlós (mathematician);nc (complexity);plasma active;polynomial;recursion;regular expression;series expansion;whole earth 'lectronic link	Árpád Baricz	2010	Appl.

The eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at this fixed point determine the local stability of the periodic orbit. Analogously, a quasi-periodic orbit (2-torus) becomes an invariant closed curve (ICC) on a Poincare section. From the Lyapunov exponents of an ICC, we can determine the time average of the exponential divergence rate of the orbit, which corresponds to the eigenvalues of a fixed point. We denote the Lyapunov exponent with the smallest nonzero absolute value as the Dominant Lyapunov Exponent (DLE). A local bifurcation manifests as a crossing or touch of the DLE locus with zero. However, the type of bifurcation cannot be determined from the DLE. To overcome this problem, we define the Dominant Lyapunov Bundle (DLB), which corresponds to the dominant eigenvectors of a fixed point. We prove that the DLB of a 1-torus in a map can be classified into four types: A+ (annulus and orientation preserving), A- (annulus and orientation reversing), M (Mobius band), and F (focus). The DLB of a 2-torus in a flow can be classified into three types: A+ × A+, A- × M (equivalently M × A- and M × M), and F × F. From the results, we conjecture the possible local bifurcations in both cases. For the 1-torus in a map, we conjecture that type A+ and A- DLBs correspond to a saddle-node and period-doubling bifurcations, respectively, whereas a type M DLB denotes a double-covering bifurcation, and type F relates to a Neimark–Sacker bifurcation. Similarly, for the 2-torus in a flow, we conjecture that type A+ × A+ DLBs correspond to saddle-node bifurcations, type A- × M DLBs to double-covering bifurcations, and type F × F DLBs to the Neimark–Sacker bifurcations. After introducing the mathematical concepts, we provide a DLB-calculating algorithm and illustrate all of the above bifurcations by examples.	lyapunov fractal	Kyohei Kamiyama;Motomasa Komuro;Tetsuro Endo;Kazuyuki Aihara	2014	I.

4c012fde7283cfb4d0c3e4c61e55bfd11b79b7e1	stability analysis of a dynamical model representing gene regulatory networks		In this paper we perform stability analysis of a class of cyclic biological processes involving time delayed feedback. More precisely, we analyze the genetic regulatory network having nonlinearities with negative Schwarzian derivatives. We derive a set of conditions implying global stability of the genetic regulatory network under positive feedback. As a special case, we also consider homogenous genetic regulatory networks and obtain an appropriate stability condition which depends only on the parameters of the nonlinearity function.	dynamical system;gene regulatory network;nonlinear system;positive feedback	Mehmet Eren Ahsen;Hitay Özbay;Silviu-Iulian Niculescu	2012		10.3182/20120622-3-US-4021.00020	bioinformatics	Logic	76.59873655773625	4.270696379950945	148832

Such a basis of simultaneously spatially and spectrally concentrated functions should be a useful data analysis and representation tool in a variety of geophysical and planetary applications, as well as in medical imaging, computer science, cosmology, and numerical analysis. The spherical Slepian functions can be found by solving either an algebraic eigenvalue problem in the spectral domain or a Fredholm integral equation in the spatial domain. The associated eigenvalues are a measure of the spatiospectral concentration. When the concentration region is an axisymmetric polar cap, the spatiospectral projection operator commutes with a Sturm–Liouville operator; this enables the eigenfunctions to be computed extremely accurately and efficiently, even when their area-bandwidth product, or Shannon number, is large. In the asymptotic limit of a small spatial region and a large spherical harmonic bandwidth, the spherical concentration problem reduces to its planar equivalent, which exhibits self-similarity when the Shannon number is kept invariant.	asymptote;bandlimiting;bandwidth (signal processing);cartesian closed category;computer science;eigenvalue algorithm;linear algebra;maximal set;medical imaging;numerical analysis;planetary scanner;self-similarity;shannon (unit);shannon number;sturm's theorem	Frederik J.

The ideas developed in Chapters II, III, and V are applied to the more general equation ut AK(u) with K’(0) 0 with special attention given to the one-dimensional case. A theory of approximate self-similar solutions is developed and various questions related to rates of convergence of solutions to such self-similar solutions are discussed. Other methods for studying blow-up problems are considered. There is a discussion of certain systems of equations as well as a study of an implicit finite difference scheme for/A (/Acr+l)x -’[/AP, especially when the discretized problem possesses unbounded solutions. The book is well written and well organized. It is worthy of a place on the bookshelf of anyone with a serious interest in nonlinear phenomena. Each chapter contains a section on references to the relevant literature and a section on open problems. There are some 394 citations to the literature, over 100 of which have been added since the appearance of the Russian version. Many of the references added refer to the recent literature on single point blow up. By way of criticism, the subject index is skimpy and the author index is nonexistent. Moreover, the price ($198.00) is anything but skimpy. So rather than wait for the paperback edition, the pirated version from other locales, or the movie, you should at least try to talk your library purchasing agent into getting a copy for your local collection of applied mathematics treatises.	algebraic riccati equation;approximation algorithm;discretization;finite difference method;graph coloring;nonlinear system;parabolic antenna;purchasing;self-similarity	Volker Mehrmann	1996	SIAM Review	10.1137/1038142	algebraic riccati equation;riccati equation;mathematics	Theory	76.18698824045083	11.067106802545114	149360

In this paper, the computational procedure is considered more fully, and the similarities to some of Stone's equations are indicated. It is further shown that an equation for <italic>u<subscrpt>2</subscrpt></italic> involving no minimization may be found. In addition, it is shown how Bellman's method may be applied to the curve-fitting problem when the additional constraints are added that the ends of the line segments must be on the curve.	bellman equation;computation;curve fitting;dynamic programming;least squares;subdivision surface	Brian Gluss	1962	Commun.

803acb0923311084bf5b150051aab48157d78096	connection theory on differentiable fibre bundles: a concise introduction		This is a partial review of the connection theory on differentiable fibre bundles. From different view points, this theory can be found in many works, like [2–6, 9, 13–15, 18, 19, 24, 26, 27, 30, 31, 35–40, 42]. The presentation of the material in Sections 2–5, containing the grounds of the connection theory, follows some of the main ideas of [30, Chapters 1 and 2], but their realization here is quite different and follows the modern trends in differential geometry. Since in the physical literature one can find misunderstanding or not quite rigorous applications of known mathematical definitions and results, the text is written in a way suitable for direct application in some regions of theoretical physics. The work is organized as follows. In Section 2 some introductory material is collected, like the notion of Lie derivatives and distributions on manifolds needed for our exposition. Here some of our notations are fixed too. Section 3 is devoted to the general connection theory on bundles whose base and bundles spaces are differentiable manifolds. In Section 3.1 some coordinates and frames/bases on the bundle space which are compatible with the fibre structure of a bundle are reviewed. Section 3.2 deals with the general connection theory. A connection on a bundle is defined as a distribution on its bundle space which is complimentary to the vertical distribution on it. The notion of parallel transport generated by connection and of specialized frame is introduced. The fibre coefficients and fibre components of the curvature of a connection are defined via part of the components of the anholonomicity object of a specialized frame. Frames adapted to local bundle coordinates are introduced and the local (2-index) coefficients in them of a connection are defined; their transformation law is	bilinear filtering;coefficient;local coordinates;theory	Bozhidar Zakhariev Iliev	2006	Int.

The most common of them are the so called row simplifying assumptions. Here we negligible them and present an algorithm for the construction of Runge–Kutta pairs of orders 5 and 4 based only in the first column simplifying assumption. The result is a pair that outperforms other known pairs in the bibliography when tested to standard set of problems of DETEST.

f68d75e3324d69424e0adb0519a08f8bf4bc0aa6	the pth moment exponential stability of uncertain differential equation		Uncertain variable and uncertain process are often employed to describe uncertainty phenomena. Uncertain variable is a measurable function from an uncertainty space to the real number set and uncertain process is essentially a sequence of uncertain variables indexed by time. Uncertain differential equation is a type of differential equation involving uncertain processes. Stability of an uncertain differential equation plays a very important role in differential equation which means insensitivity of the state of a system to small changes in the initial state. In this paper, we focus on pth moment exponential stability of uncertain differential equation which is regarded as an extension of pth moment stability and exponential stability. Some stability theorems are given for uncertain differential equation, in which a sufficient and necessary condition for a linear uncertain differential equation being pth moment exponentially stable is provided.

This result is extended to nonautonomous systems in Section 2, and in Section 3 results on asymptotic behavior similar to those in [1], [2], [3], and [5] are obtained. Because part of F i s bounded by a function independent of x, these results are, in a sense, extensions of the previous theorems.

The methods include two classical finite elements, a cotan formula-based discrete differential geometry approach and four isogeometric constructions. The comparison reveals numerical convergence rates and, particularly for isogeometric constructions based on Catmull–Clark elements, the need to carefully choose quadrature formulas. The seven methods include two that are new to isogeometric analysis. Both new methods yield O(h) convergence in the L norm, also when points are included where n 6= 4 pieces meet. One construction is based on a polar, singular parameterization; the other is a G tensor-product construction.	catmull–clark subdivision surface;duckduckgo;finite element method;gnome;isogeometric analysis;newton–cotes formulas;numerical analysis;polynomial;singular value decomposition	Thien Nguyen;Kestutis Karciauskas;Jörg Peters	2014	Axioms	10.3390/axioms3020280	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;mathematics;geometry	Theory	81.10376162999881	15.856425521376531	151138

The basic reproduction number is derived. It is shown that the infection-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if . Sufficient conditions for the existence of Hopf bifurcation at the infected equilibrium are investigated by analyzing the distribution of eigenvalues.

It is demonstrated that in practice it is faster than the “conventional” resultant-based algorithm, at least for small problems. It can be applied to algorithms for indefinite summation and closed-form solution of linear difference equations. A brief survey of existing mostly resultant-based dispersion algorithms is given and the complexity of the resultant involved is analysed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm applied to indefinite summation is demonstrated by some examples that are not easily summed by the standard facilities in several computer algebra systems.	algorithm;computation;computer algebra system;fast fourier transform;irreducibility;irreducible polynomial;recurrence relation;resultant	Yiu-Kwong Man;Francis J.

For special types of such problems, their reduction to ones with strongly saddle operators leads to remarkable improvement of correctness and to justification of the famous Bakhvalov--Kolmogorov principle about asymptotically optimal algorithms.The first goal of the present paper is to present a short review of recently obtained results for stationary problems in classical Sobolev and more general energy spaces. The second goal is a study of the approach indicated above to the case of nonstationary problems; special attention is paid to parabolic problems with large jumps in coefficients; the study is based on relatively new extension theorems and special energy methods.	numerical method;spaces	Eugene G.

This is the task of extending a nonperiodic function, defined on an interval x ∈ [−χ,χ ], to a function f̃ which is periodic on the larger interval x ∈ [−Θ,Θ]. We derive the asymptotic Fourier coefficients for an infinitely differentiable function which is one on an interval x ∈ [−χ,χ ], identically zero for |x| > Θ, and varies smoothly in between. Such smoothed “top-hat” functions are “bells” in wavelet theory. Our bell is (for x ≥ 0) T (x;L,χ,Θ) = (1 + erf(z))/2 where z = Lξ/ √ 1− ξ2 where ξ ≡ −1 + 2(Θ − x)/(Θ − χ). By applying steepest descents to approximate the coefficient integrals in the limit of large degree j , we show that when the width L is fixed, the Fourier cosine coefficients aj of T on x ∈ [−Θ,Θ] are proportional to aj ∼ (1/j) exp(−Lπ1/22−1/2(1 − χ/Θ)1/2j1/2)Λ(j) where Λ(j) is an oscillatory factor of degree given in the text. We also show that to minimize error in a Fourier series truncated after the N th term, the width should be chosen to increase with N as L= 0.911−χ/ΘN1/2. We derive similar asymptotics for the function f (x) = x as extended by a more sophisticated scheme with overlapping bells; this gives an even faster rate of Fourier convergence.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;constant function;discrete fourier transform;emoticon;extension method;fagan inspection;gradient descent;higher-order function;linear programming relaxation;reflections of signals on conducting lines;sawtooth (cellular automaton);singular function;smoothing;software bug;triangular function;truncation;wavelet	John P.

In fact, we complement the dynamical study started in previous works with a more systematic analysis for polynomials with at most two different roots and different multiplicities. In addition, we characterize some polynomials of degree greater or equal to 4, such that the related methods are not generally convergent. We also analyse the degrees of the rational functions associated with two-point methods when they are applied to polynomials of degree n, showing their dependence on n 2 and how this fact considerably complicates the dynamical study.	iterative method	José Manuel Gutiérrez Jiménez;Sergio Plaza;Natalia Romero	2012	Int.

In this paper we present a method that, starting from certain parameterized PieceWise-Linear (PWL) curves in the Kirchhoff domain, allows us to express them in the WD domain using a global and explicit representation. We will show how some curves (multi-valued functions in the Kirchhoff domain) can be represented as functions in canonical PWL form in the WD domain. In particular, we will present a procedure, which, in the most general case, also returns the conditions on the reference port resistance under which it is possible to find explicit mappings in the WD domain.	apache wave;interpolation;iterative method;kirchhoff's theorem;lookup table;nonlinear system	Alberto Bernardini;Augusto Sarti	2017	2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081383	interpolation;parameterized complexity;signal processing;piecewise linear function;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;mathematics	Graphics	79.13151922343212	13.798862402724488	154556

Iterative dynamics are widespread in distributed algorithms and numerical analysis. However, efficient analysis of convergence and sensitivity of iterative dynamics is quite challenging due to the lack of systematic tools. For instance, the trajectories of iterative dynamics are usually not continuous with respect to the initial condition. Hence, the classical dynamical systems theory cannot be applied directly. In this paper, a trajectory distance based Lyapunov approach is proposed as a means to tackling convergence and sensitivity to the initial condition of iterative processes. Technically the problem of convergence and sensitivity is converted into finiteness of trajectory distance and semistability analysis of discrete-time systems. A semidefinite Lyapunov function based trajectory distance approach is proposed to characterize convergence and semistability of iterative dynamics. Three examples are provided to elucidate the proposed method. Finally, the proposed framework is used to solve the convergence and stability of iterative algorithms developed for balanced resource allocation and damage mitigation problems under adversarial attacks.	iterative method;lyapunov fractal	Qing Hui	2013	J.

Under some conditions these terms can be locally approximated by linear factors, which can be, after discretization transformed in the sequence of (hyperbolic) Iterated Function Systems (IFS) that generates a unique fractal attractor. This attractor reflects the dynamics in the vicinity of the approximated point of the nonlinear system. Here, the IFS is replaced with an associate AIFS (Affine invariant IFS), a kind of IFS that has affine invariance property and permits further manipulating of this fractal attractor.	fractal;nonlinear system	Ljubisa Kocic;Sonja Gegovska-Zajkova;Elena Babace	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-00464-3_39	mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;attractor	Robotics	80.37119431391224	5.431495413073834	155360
6bcb3b681677bb86853deb17e84cf1cb3bbb5e74	complex dynamic behavior of a rumor propagation model with spatial-temporal diffusion terms	rumor propagation;reaction diffusion equations;stability;online social networks	Rumor propagation as a typical form of social communication in online social networks has had a significant negative impact on a harmonious and stable society. With the rapid development of mobile communication equipments, traditional rumor propagation models, which depend on ordinary differential equations (ODE), may not be suitable for describing rumor propagation in an online social network. In this paper, based on reaction-diffusion equations, we propose a novel epidemic-like model with both discrete and nonlocal delays for investigating the spatial-temporal dynamics of rumor propagation. By analyzing the corresponding characteristic equations of this model, the local stability conditions of a boundary equilibrium point and a positive equilibrium point are established. By applying the linear approximation method of nonlinear systems, sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of Hopf bifurcation at the above two kinds of equilibrium points. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis method based on the density of spreading users is proposed, and then in theoretical and experimental aspect we identify some sensitive parameters in the process of rumor propagation. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the theoretical results. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

PWP maps are areapreserving maps that have constant linearizations but only one eigenvector with eigenvalue one. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a two-torus parabolic map to be invertible. For noninvertible PWP maps, there are a number of questions about the existence and structure of attractors for such maps. We introduce the simplest example of a nontrivial PWP map, defined by a parabolic linear map with a translation that is a different constant on each side of a given line in the plane. For this “half plane parabolic map” we obtain sufficient conditions for a bounded attractor to exist, discuss their dynamical properties and give some examples of these and related maps.	dynamical system;iteration;line level;map;parabolic antenna	Peter Ashwin;Xin-Chu Fu;Congping Lin	2009	I.

The resulting processes are no longer chaotic but are left with realizable statistical behavior. Such processes have appeared over several years in the electronic engineering literature. Informal but extended mathematical theory that facilitates the practical calculation of autocorrelation of such statistical behavior, is developed. Both the continuous and discretized cases are treated further by using Kohda's notions of equidistribution and constant-sum to maps which are not onto. Some particularly structured chaotic map processes, and also well-known maps are examined for their statistical dependency, with the tailed shift map family from chaotic communications receiving detailed attention.

Instead of a C0-semigroup associated with the mild solution of the system, we use the so-called fundamental solution. Controllability results are obtained by sequential approach and operator semigroup theory.

The study of fuzzy differential equations has been initiated as an independent subject in conjunction with fuzzy valued analysis [4,18] and set-valued differential equations [16]. Using the Hukuhara derivative of multivalued functions, Puri and Ralescu [25] introduced the concept of H-differentiability for fuzzy functions. This concept has been studied and applied in context of fuzzy differential equations by Seikkala [27] and Kaleva [10] in time dependent form. Kaleva showed in [10,11] that, if f is continuous and satisfies the Lipschitz condition with respect x, then there exists a unique local solution for the fuzzy initial value problem u0ðtÞ 1⁄4 f ðt;uÞ, uð0Þ 1⁄4 u0 on ðE;DÞ. Also, in [11], he has shown that the Peano theorem does not hold because the metric space ðE;DÞ is not locally compact. Nieto [19] proved the existence theorem of Peano for fuzzy differential equations on ðE;DÞ if f is continuous and bounded. Buckley and Feuring [3] gave a very general formulation of a fuzzy first-order initial value problem. This approach based on H-differentiability has the disadvantage that any solution of a fuzzy differential equation has increasing length of its support. Consequently, this approach cannot really reflect any of the rich behavior of ordinary differential equations such as periodicity, stability, bifurcation, and the like and is ill suited for modeling [5]. This shortcoming was resolved by interpreting a fuzzy differential equations as a family of differential inclusions [9]. The main shortcoming of using differential inclusions is that we do not have a derivative of a fuzzy-number-valued function. Recently, Bede and Gal [2] solved the above mentioned approach under strongly generalized differentiability of fuzzy-number-valued functions In this case the derivative exists and the solution of a fuzzy differential equation may have decreasing length of the support, but the uniqueness is lost. The existence theorems of solutions for fuzzy initial value problem under different sets of assumptions are given in	bifurcation theory;differential inclusion;dynamical system;first-order predicate;fuzzy concept;fuzzy number;fuzzy set;nonlinear system;peano axioms;quasiperiodicity;race condition	Vasile Lupulescu	2008	Inf.

The construction of boundary wavelets is remarkably simple. Furthermore, global stability of the wavelet basis is established. The wavelet basis is used to solve the Sturm–Liouville equation with the Dirichlet boundary condition. Numerical examples are provided.

Hybrid Control is the name we give to control of continuous plants by digital sequential control automata, that is, by control programs implemented on sequential automata. We associate, without using any approximations, sequential automata with continuous plants, and use this to bring sequential control automata and continuous plants into automata networks which themselves are sequential automata modelling hybrid systems. To be useful, the control automaton's ability to control plant trajectories in a hybrid system should be maintained under small changes in control laws, disturbance, trajectory, measurement, etc. We formalize this notion of controllability and observability for hybrid systems by continuity of system functions, including the input-output function of the control automaton, in non-Hausdorff subtopologies of the usual topologies on spaces of controls, sensor data, plants, disturbances, target sets, etc. These subtopologies arise from the limited ability of digital programs to discriminate between continuous inputs. These notions are appropriate for any knowledge or rule based system where automated deduction interacts in real time with the external world. This topological approach was announced in [46]. (What we call controllability and observability here is what we called stability in [46] in order to correspond somewhat more closely to usage in the literature [3].)	automaton	Anil Nerode;Wolf Kohn	1992		10.1007/3-540-57318-6_35	control engineering;discrete mathematics;observability;control theory;mathematics;hybrid system	Logic	68.46067130901766	4.786488704988504	159421

If there is only one opportunity for reproduction per year, and all individuals born in a certain year reproduce k years later, then the population can be divided into year classes according to the year of birth modulo k. The dynamics is described by a discrete-time nonlinear Leslie matrix model, where the nonlinearity enters through the density dependent fertility and mortality rates. When the reproduction ratio is close to one, the full-life-cycle-map can be approximated by the solution of a differential equation of Lotka–Volterra type, which inherits the cyclic symmetry that is present in the full-life-cyclemap. The Lotka–Volterra equation can next be reduced to the replicator equation on the (k − 1)dimensional simplex. In this paper we classify the repertoire of dynamical behavior for k = 2, 3 and derive an almost complete picture for k = 4, with some open problems identified. We pay special attention to the single year class (SYC) state (all but one year class are absent), multiple year class patterns (with several but not all year classes present), heteroclinic cycles, and periodic orbits.	approximation algorithm;dynamical system;leslie speaker;modulo operation;nonlinear system;population;resource bounded measure	O.

The problem of optimal conjugacy estimates remains open. 1. Numerical bifurcations and the conjugacy problem The present paper addresses a problem in numerical dynamics, i.e., in the theory of comparing exact and approximating solution dynamics of differential equations. Questions of numerical structural stability have been satisfactorily solved [13]. If an equation ẋ = f(x) (defined on a compact smooth manifold, or, on a positively invariant subset of R) is structurally stable, then—up to a suitable timereparametrization—the time-h-map of the exact dynamics and the stepsize-h-map of the discretized dynamics are conjugate and the conjugacy is O(hp)-near to the identity. Here, of course, p is the order of the underlying one-step discretization method. For gradient-like Morse–Smale systems, e.g. for systems in the vicinity of a hyperbolic equilibrium point, no time-reparametrization is needed [4], [12]. The latter result is the numerical Grobman–Hartman lemma.

Every iteration of the method requires two function evaluations, two first Frechet derivative evaluations and two matrix inversions. Hence, the efficiency index is 6 1 / ( 2 n + 6 n 2 + 4 3 n 3 ) , which is better than that of other sixth order methods. The advantages of the method lie in the feature that this technique not only achieves an approximate solution with high accuracy, but also improves the calculation speed. Also, under several mild conditions the convergence analysis of the proposed method is provided. An efficient error estimation is presented for the approximate solution. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the method and the comparisons are made with the existing results.	nonlinear system	H.

In particular, for the continuous-time setting, we show how to locate a scattering-conservative L2-well-posed linear system (in the sense of Staffans and Weiss) embedded in a Lax-Phillips scattering system presented in axiomatic form; conversely, given a scattering-conservative linear system, we show how one can view the space of finite-energy input-state-output trajectories of the system as the ambient space for an associated Lax-Phillips scattering system. We use these connections to give a simple, conceptual proof of the identity of the scattering function of the scattering system with the transfer function of the input-state-output linear system. As an application we show how system-theoretic ideas can be used to arrive at the spectral analysis of the scattering function.	axiomatic system;embedded system;linear system;scattering theory;transfer function;well-posed problem	Joseph A.

Here, we consider a simple modified Newton method depending on a parameter. It is demonstrated using polynomiography that even in the simple algorithm the presence and the position of the convergent regions, i.e. regions where the method converges nicely to a root, can be complicatedly a function of the parameter. The study of root-finding to an equation through an iterative function has a very long history [1]. An algorithm, which is a cornerstone to the modern study of root-finding algorithms was made by Newton through his 'method of fluxions'. Later on this method was polished by Rapshon to produce what we now know as the Newton–Raphson method [1–3]. Suppose we want to solve a nonlinear equation f ðzÞ ¼ 0 numerically, where z 2 R and the function f : R ! R is at least once differentiable. Starting from some z 0 , the Newton–Raphson method uses the iterations:	converge;interpolation;iterated function;iteration;iterative method;newton;newton's method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;randomness;rate of convergence;root-finding algorithm	Hadi Susanto;Natanael Karjanto	2009	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2009.06.041	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;newton fractal;calculus;mathematics;newton's method;algorithm	ML	80.51723689741871	17.144134751941536	160599

We find that in many cases such integrals can be “experimentally” evaluated in closed form or that intriguing linear relations exist within a class of similar integrals. Discovering these identities and relations often requires the evaluation of integrals to extreme precision, combined with large-scale runs of the “PSLQ” integer relation algorithm.

13a65679dcb94650a6b6d065f39b49162ed5ff78	new approach for solving a class of doubly singular two-point boundary value problems using adomian decomposition method		We propose two new modified recursive schemes for solving a class of doubly singular two-point boundary value problems. These schemes are based on Adomian decomposition method ADM and new proposed integral operators. We use all the boundary conditions to derive an integral equation before establishing the recursive schemes for the solution components. Thus we develop recursive schemes without any undetermined coefficients while computing successive solution components, whereas several previous recursive schemes have done so. This modification also avoids solving a sequence of nonlinear algebraic or transcendental equations for the undetermined coefficients withmultiple roots, which is required to complete calculation of the solution by several earlier modified recursion schemes using the ADM. The approximate solution is computed in the form of series with easily calculable components. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested by considering four examples and results are compared with previous known results.	approximation algorithm;boundary case;coefficient;computability;linear algebra;nonlinear system;recursion	Randhir Singh;Jitendra Kumar;Gnaneshwar Nelakanti	2012	Adv.

be377b4f8d63dda80149b6d6d955c90d8dffa38e	stability, convergence, and limit cycles in some human physiological processes		Mathematical models for physiological processes aid qualitative understanding of the impact of various parameters on the underlying process. We analyse two such models for human physiological processes: the Mackey-Glass and the Lasota equations, which model the change in the concentration of blood cells in the human body. We first study the local stability of these models, and derive bounds on various model parameters and the feedback delay for the concentration to equilibrate. We then deduce conditions for non-oscillatory convergence of the solutions, which could ensure that the blood cell concentration does not oscillate. Further, we define the convergence characteristics of the solutions which govern the rate at which the concentration equilibrates when the system is stable. Owing to the possibility that physiological parameters can seldom be estimated precisely, we also derive bounds for robust stability—which enable one to ensure that the blood cell concentration equilibrates despite parametric uncertainty. We also highlight that when the necessary and sufficient condition for local stability is violated, the system transits into instability via a Hopf bifurcation, leading to limit cycles in the blood cell concentration. We then outline a framework to characterise the type of the Hopf bifurcation and determine the asymptotic orbital stability of limit cycles. The analysis is complemented with numerical examples, stability charts and bifurcation diagrams. The insights into the dynamical properties of the mathematical models may serve to guide the study of dynamical diseases.	bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;chart;dynamical system;hopf bifurcation;instability;limit cycle;mathematical model;molecular orbital;numerical analysis	Sreelakshmi Manjunath;Gopal Krishna Kamath;Gaurav Raina	2018	CoRR		hopf bifurcation;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematical model;mathematics;parametric statistics;oscillation;instability;orbital stability;convergence (routing)	ML	78.71615491600735	4.396467586669719	162330

Sufficient conditions for positive recurrence and recurrence are obtained using the concept of conditional expected one-step displacement of the chain. The proof makes use of the fundamental dual theorem of linear programming. A numerical example is given showing that the sufficient conditions are not necessary. The results of this paper apply to certain aspects of previous work by Harris on “Queues with State Dependent Stochastic Service Rates,” (1967) in this Journal. Specifically, the results of this paper generalize the sufficient conditions for recurrence given by Theorems 1 and 2 of that paper.	markov chain	Thomas B.

It consists of a phased transition from of the initial problem to the formula for the determination of some part of the functions of control and a problem similar to the previous one for a system with a smaller number of equations. The suggested method is a modification of the previous method of cascade decomposition, which solves problems using the projectors on the subspace. In the present paper, decomposition was carried out by solving the linear algebraic equations and replacing linearly the desired vector functions.

We present an approach for computing over-approximations of the set of reachable states. It is based on the notion of support function and thus it allows us to consider invariants, guards and constraints on continuous inputs and initial states defined by arbitrary compact convex sets. We show how the properties of support functions make it possible to derive an effective algorithm for approximate reachability analysis of hybrid systems. We use our approach on some examples including the navigation benchmark for hybrid systems verification.	approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);convex set;guard (computer science);guard (information security);hybrid system;invariant (computer science);map;prototype;reachability;state (computer science)	Colas Le Guernic;Antoine Girard	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02658-4_40	differential inclusion;support function;mathematical optimization;convex set;hybrid system	Logic	68.62813390614664	4.381968049656664	163130

Many linear and quadratic programming problems can ultimately be converted into absolute value equation problems so research on solving an absolute value problem has important practical and theoretical significance. An improved adaptive differential evolution algorithm was proposed to solve the absolute value equations in this paper. The algorithm combined global search ability and local search ability, using an adaptive quadratic mutation operation and crossover operation. Numerical results show that the improved algorithm can quickly find the solutions of these equations.	algorithm;differential evolution	Guiying Ning;Yongquan Zhou	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-32557-6_4	mathematical optimization;differential algebraic equation;numerical partial differential equations;equation solving	Logic	82.8497045383301	18.063429209369865	163520

The filtering technique is based on a sweeping algorithm that requires the ability for each constraint to compute a forbidden box around a given fixed point and within a surrounding area. Several cases have been studied so far, including integer linear inequalities. Motivated by the placement of objects with curved shapes, this paper shows how to implement this service for continuous constraints with arbitrary mathematical expressions. The approach relies on symbolic processing and defines a new interval arithmetic.	algorithm;constraint satisfaction problem;fixed point (mathematics);interval arithmetic;linear inequality;set packing;symbolic computation	Gilles Chabert;Nicolas Beldiceanu	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15396-9_14	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;fixed point;interval arithmetic	PL	69.7926893712896	16.758109858576603	164036

Also, it can be used to calculate the derivatives of f for any non-integer order α f at the Gauss–Lobatto points in [ − 1 , 1 ] . Less computational complexity and programming, much higher rate in running, calculating the integral/derivative of fractional order and its extraordinary accuracy, are advantages of this method in comparison with other known methods. We apply two approaches by using this matrix to solve some fractional differential equations with high accuracy. Some numerical examples are presented.		Saeid Gholami;Esmail Babolian;M.

We investigate how more and more coexistence is gained as the area-contraction rate b → 1.

Given an asymptotically stable system, our goal is to find a stable reduced-order system in such a way that the error of the transfer functions between the original system and the reduced-order one is bounded over a finite frequency range. By virtue of the generalized Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (GKYP) Lemma, we first establish necessary and sufficient characterizations for this problem in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). For the low- and mid-frequency cases, through introducing a non-conservative multiplier and resorting to the projection lemma, the reduced-order system matrices are decoupled with the matrix variables from the GKYP Lemma. Then, by introducing a new diagonal matrix variable and based on congruence transformation, the reduced-order system matrices are further decoupled with the matrix variable induced by the projection lemma and can be parameterized by a new matrix variable. The results are extended to the high-frequency case without the use of projection lemma to reduce the conservatism. Moreover, an iterative convex optimization algorithm is developed to solve the conditions. Finally, we demonstrate via numerical examples that our method can achieve much smaller approximation error than existing results.	linear system	Jun Shen;James Lam	2015	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2014.12.029	mathematical optimization;haplogroup h;céa's lemma;discrete mathematics;linear matrix inequality;calculus;control theory;mathematics	EDA	69.59147355943075	4.373161282464313	168331

The fractional derivatives which are coming from the formulation of the problem are defined in the Riemann–Liouville sense. Some terminal conditions are imposed on the state and control variables whose dimensions need not be the same. A numerical scheme is described by using the Grünwald–Letnikov definition to approximate the Riemann–Liouville Fractional Derivatives. The set of fractional differential equations, which are obtained after the discretization of the time domain, are solved within the Grünwald–Letnikov approximation to obtain the state and the control variable numerically. A two-dimensional fractional optimal control problem is studied as an example to demonstrate the performance of the scheme. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

First, the existence of standing waves associated with the ground states is obtained by using variational calculus as well as a compactness lemma. Next, a series of sharp conditions for global existence of nonlinear Klein–Gordon equations with nonnegative potentials are established in terms of the characteristics of the ground state and the local theory. Then, that how small the initial data are, the global solutions exist is given. Finally, the instability of standing wave is shown by combining those results. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This approach leads us to the integration by Taylor polynomials. On the other hand, with the goal of minimizing the quadrature error bound for analytic functions, in the set of quadrature formulas of Hermite interpolatory type, we found that this minimum is attained by the quadrature formula based on the integration of the Taylor polynomial. These two different approaches suggest the effectiveness of this formula. Numerical experiments comparing with other quadrature methods with the same domain of validity, or even greater such as Szego formulas, (traditionally considered as the counterpart of the Gauss formulas for integrals on the unit circle) confirm the superiority of the numerical estimations.	computation;newton–cotes formulas	J.

Kantorovich's theorem on Newton's method has the advantage of proving existence of a solution and convergence to it under very mild conditions. This theorem holds in Banach spaces. Newton's method has been extended to the problem of finding a singularity of a vectorial field in Riemannian manifold. We extend Kantorovich's theorem on Newton's method to Riemannian manifolds. 2001 Elsevier Science (USA)	centrality;newton's method;singularity project	Orizon Pereira Ferreira;Benar Fux Svaiter	2002	J.

In this paper, we first give the following nonsmooth version of Lojasiewicz gradient inequality for the function f with an explicit exponent: For any x̄ ∈ R, there exist c > 0 and > 0 such that we have for all ‖x− x̄‖ < , inf{‖w‖ : w ∈ ∂f(x)} ≥ c |f(x)− f(x̄)|1−τ , where ∂f(x) is the limiting subdifferential of f at x, d := maxi=1,...,p;j=1,...,q deg fij, R(n, d) := d(3d− 3)n−1 if d ≥ 2 and R(n, d) := 1 if d = 1, and τ := 1 R(n+ p, 2d+ 2) .

The work on canards in nonsmooth, planar systems is recent and has thus far been restricted to piecewise-linear or piecewise-smooth Van der Pol systems, where an extremum of the critical manifold arises from the nonsmoothness. In both of these cases, a canard (or canard-like) explosion may be created through a nonsmooth bifurcation as the slow nullcline passes through a corner of the critical manifold. Additionally, it is possible for these systems to exhibit a super-explosion bifurcation where the canard explosion is skipped. This paper extends the results to more general piecewise-smooth systems, finding conditions for when a periodic orbit is created through either a smooth or nonsmooth bifurcation. In the case the bifurcation is nonsmooth, conditions are found determining whether the bifurcation is a superexplosion or canards are created.	hopf bifurcation;lagrangian relaxation;maxima and minima;relaxation (approximation);relaxation oscillator	Andrew W Roberts	2016	SIAM J.

The approach we consider has been proposed in some previous works of D.Yu. Grigor’ev and M.F. Singer on one hand, and of J. Cano on the other hand, led yet to very interesting results. But, it has its limits: we show simple examples, on which this method is unsuccessful and we try to analyse why it fails to give a solution. We suggest some ideas, based on our experience in the linear case, to pass beyond the difficulties and approach a “complete” algorithm. Through the discussion, we have to extend the classical ideas of real asymptotic to the complex plane.	algorithm;computer algebra system;newton;polynomial	Jean Della Dora;Françoise Richard-Jung	1997		10.1145/258726.258817	explicit and implicit methods;ordinary differential equation;liénard equation;mathematical optimization;exact differential equation;examples of differential equations;mathematical analysis;first-order partial differential equation;differential algebraic equation;method of characteristics;universal differential equation;bernoulli differential equation;integrating factor;collocation method;calculus;linear differential equation;riccati equation;mathematics;homogeneous differential equation;hill differential equation;algebraic differential equation;power series;separable partial differential equation;multiplication;differential equation;matrix differential equation	Theory	80.96998873275123	16.525868475446924	171601

Tropical varieties over K can be defined with a theory of Gröbner bases taking into account the valuation of K. Because of the use of the valuation, this theory is promising for stable computations over polynomial rings over a p-adic fields.  We design a strategy to compute such tropical Gröbner bases by adapting the Matrix-F5 algorithm. Two variants of the Matrix-F5 algorithm, depending on how the Macaulay matrices are built, are available to tropical computation with respective modifications. The former is more numerically stable while the latter is faster.  Our study is performed both over any exact field with valuation and some inexact fields like Qp or Fq [[t]]. In the latter case, we track the loss in precision, and show that the numerical stability can compare very favorably to the case of classical Gröbner bases when the valuation is non-trivial. Numerical examples are provided.	algorithm;computation;faugère's f4 and f5 algorithms;gröbner basis;macaulay;matrix multiplication;numerical stability;polynomial ring;the matrix;theory;value (ethics)	Tristan Vaccon	2015		10.1145/2755996.2756665	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;tropical geometry;mathematics;algebra	ML	79.96881770073193	18.145440618464896	171901

The approach exploits an intriguing relationship between the theory of Gröbner bases and polynomial spectral factorization which can be observed through the sum of roots, and allows us to perform polynomial spectral factorization in the presence of real parameters. It is discussed that parametric polynomial spectral factorization enables us to express quantities such as the optimal cost in terms of parameters and the sum of roots. Furthermore an optimization method over parameters is suggested that makes use of the results from parametric polynomial spectral factorization and also employs quantifier elimination. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a numerical example of a particular control problem.	gröbner basis;linear algebra;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;polynomial;quantifier (logic);signal processing	Hirokazu Anai;Shinji Hara;Masaaki Kanno;Kazuhiro Yokoyama	2009	J.

The idea is to solve a projected boundary value problem (BVP) in a function space via a fixed point argument. The formulation of the projected BVP involves a high-order parameterization of the invariant manifolds at the steady states. Using this parameterization, one can obtain explicit exponential asymptotic bounds for the coefficients of the expansion of the manifolds. Combining these bounds with piecewise linear approximations, one can construct a contraction in a function space whose unique fixed point corresponds to the wanted connecting orbit. We have implemented the method to demonstrate its effectiveness, and we have used it to prove the existence of a family of even homoclinic orbits for the Gray-Scott system.	approximation;coefficient;computation;fixed point (mathematics);numerical analysis;piecewise linear continuation;time complexity;verifiable computing	Jan Bouwe van den Berg;Jason D.

Such spaces are composed of a hierarchy of nested spaces and provide a flexible framework for local refinement in any dimensionality. We provide approximation estimates for general hierarchical quasi-interpolants expressed in terms of the truncated hierarchical basis. Under some mild assumptions, we prove that such hierarchical quasi-interpolants and their derivatives possess optimal local approximation power in the general q-norm with \(1\leq q\leq \infty \). In addition, we detail a specific family of hierarchical quasi-interpolants defined on uniform hierarchical meshes in any dimensionality. The construction is based on cardinal B-splines of degree p and central factorial numbers of the first kind. It guarantees polynomial reproduction of degree p and it requires only function evaluations at grid points (odd p) or half-grid points (even p). This results in good approximation properties at a very low cost, and is illustrated with some numerical experiments.	approximation;spline (mathematics)	Hendrik Speleers	2017	Adv. Comput.

8d9804afc62e973e389f8712a87e8fcec351e694	hipercomputación desde la computación cuántica		The proposed research problem was the construction of a new hypercomputation models [5, 29] based on quantum computation. In particular, we proposed to adapt Kieu’s algoritmh (KA) to other physical referents ([13] and references therein). KA was proposed to solve a Turing machine incomputable problem, Hilberts tenth problem [17], and KA uses as physical referent the simple harmonic oscillator which has as associated dynamical algebra the Lie algebra Weyl-Heisenberg. A detailed analysis of KA shows that its hypercomputational power is underlying in the dynamical algebra associated to the physical referent, and the possibility of established an adiabatic evolution between some unbounded Hamiltonians [3]. The main obtained result was the adaptation of KA on Lie algebra su(1, 1), from the identification of the following characteristics required by the dynamical algebra [28, 26]: To admit an infinite-dimensional irreducible representation that acts on the base of the space of Hilbert associated to the physical referent’s Hamiltonian. To admit the factorization of the physical referent’s Hamiltonian in terms of the algebra’s generators. To allow the construction of a number operator, where its eigenvectors are the eigenvectors of the physical referent’s Hamiltonian, and its eigenvalues are the non-negative integers numbers N. To allow the construction of coherent states. From this algebraic adaptation, KA was adapted to the following physical referents whose dynamical algebra is su(1, 1): infinite square well [30, 24], Pöschl-Teller potentials [36, 35], generalized Laguerre oscillator, infinite cylindrical, perturbed cylindrical well and HolsteinPrimakoff system [28]. On other hand, on strict sense the indicated adaptations are based on algebra suk(1, 1) ≡ su(1, 1)⊗· · ·⊗su(1, 1), and we are making an adaptation of KA on algebra su(k, 1) [27]. Moreover, from an algebra that it interpolates between Weyl-Heisenberg and su(1, 1) algebras [32], we are making a generalization of KA, where KA and our adaptations on su(1, 1) are particular cases [25]. The algebraic adaptation made by the authors establishes that the algebraic properties required by KA are not exclusive of the Lie algebra Weyl-Heisenberg and, the adaptations made on some physical referents extend the spectrum of possibilities on which it is possible to consider an implementation of KA.	algebraic equation;coherent states;computation;dynamical system;gauss–laguerre quadrature;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);hilbert's tenth problem;hypercomputation;interpolation;irreducibility;linear algebra;particle number operator;pöschl–teller potential;quantum computing;turing machine	Andrés Sicard;Juan Ospina;Mario Vélez	2006	Revista Colombiana de Computación	10.29375/25392115.1050	mathematical physics;philosophy	Theory	74.43651601741772	10.922694483610965	173046

Instead of using approximations such as difference quotients for the derivatives needed in the Taylor series expansions, we use recursive formulas obtained using the governing differential equation itself to calculate exact derivatives. Since our approach does not use difference formulas or symbolic manipulation, it requires much less computational effort when compared to the techniques previously reported in the literature. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method by obtaining numerical solutions of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the hydrogen atom, and the one-dimensional double-well anharmonic oscillator. 2010 Elsevier Inc.

0f543ce85d750ca2f8c10e1a178c0812664d1e7d	model reduction of linear systems with random parameters		This paper is devoted to model reduction of linear time invariant (LTI) systems with random parameters. A novel framework is proposed to deal with this challenging problem. It consists in the combination of the generalized polynomial chaos (GPC) formalism and the truncated balanced realization (TBR) based method. The GPC formalism is known to be a powerful tool for the random uncertainty propagation and quantification while the TBR is efficient in model reduction of LTI systems. So, to couple these two methods helps to generate an efficient methodology to reduce linear models with random parameters. Two techniques exploiting this combination are proposed and tested on the model reduction of a mechanical system with random parameters. High efficiency is shown for both methods.	computer;linear model;linear system;linear time-invariant theory;polynomial;propagation of uncertainty;semantics (computer science);software propagation;time complexity;time-invariant system	Lyes Nechak;Henri-François Raynaud;Caroline Kulcsar	2013		10.3182/20130703-3-FR-4038.00057	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;mathematics;statistics	EDA	69.30174728496492	7.749678795479773	173525

Firstly, by assuming that the singular fractional system has a unique solution for given initial conditions, we study the asymptotic stability of the equilibria of the homogeneous system. We also prove conditions on the input vector under which the solution of the non-homogeneous system converges. Next, since it is known that existence and uniqueness of solutions depend on the invariants of the pencil of the system, by taking into consideration the fact that small perturbations can change the invariants, we perturb the singular fractional system and obtain bounds on the perturbation effect of the invariants of the pencil. In addition, by using this result, we study the robustness of solutions of the system. Finally, we give numerical examples based on a real singular fractional nabla dynamical system to illustrate our theory.	recurrence relation	Ioannis K.

In particular, such a problem arises in the context of switching surfaces in optimal control. Recently, a powerful new methodology for doing symbolic manipulations with polynomial data has been developed and tested, namely the use of Gröbner bases. In this paper, we apply the Gröbner basis technique to find effective solutions to the classical problem of time-optimal control.	algebraic equation;gröbner basis;optimal control;polynomial;symbolic computation	Uli Walther;Tryphon T.

In this paper we prove that the invariant subspaces of the Dirichlet shift are in 1-1 correspondence with the kernels of the Dirichlet-Hankel operators. We then apply this result to obtain information about the invariant subspace lattice of the weak product D D and to some questions about approximation of invariant subspaces of D. Our main results hold in the context of superharmonically weighted Dirichlet spaces.	approximation	Shuaibing Luo;Stefan Richter	2015	J. London Math.

Reachable set computations suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which has been successfully addressed by using zonotopes for linear systems. However, zonotopes are not closed under intersection leading to challenges when applying them to nonlinear and hybrid problems. We introduce zonotope bundles as the intersection of zonotopes (without explicitly computing the intersection). Zonotope bundles are closed under intersection, while inheriting many positive properties of zonotopes. This is demonstrated for linear, nonlinear, and hybrid systems. A further property of zonotope bundles is that their computation can be easily parallelized.	computation;curse of dimensionality;dynamical system;hausdorff dimension;hybrid system;linear system;nonlinear system;parallel computing;reachability;scalability;verification and validation;zonohedron	Matthias Althoff;Bruce H.

Given a control net, the spanning functions of one spatial coordinate of a generalized subdivision surface are called nodal functions. They are the limit, under subdivision, of associating the value one with one control net node and zero with all others. No characterization of independence of nodal functions has been published to date, even for the two most popular generalized subdivision algorithms, Catmull–Clark subdivision and Loop’s subdivision. This paper provides a road map for the verification of linear and local linear independence of generalized subdivision functions. It proves the conjectured global independence of the nodal functions of both algorithms, disproves local linear independence (for higher valences), and establishes linear independence on every surface region corresponding to a facet of the control net. Subtle exceptions, even to global independence, underscore the need for a detailed analysis to provide a sound basis for a number of recently developed computational approaches.	algorithm;b-spline;basis (linear algebra);catmull–clark subdivision surface;computation;condition number;control flow;file spanning;numerical analysis	Jörg Peters;Xiaobin Wu	2006	SIAM J.

The vector field of this discontinuous model does not follow the Filippov convention, and the concept of Filippov solution cannot be used. Furthermore, some Caratheodory solutions are unphysical. Therefore, we introduce the concept of stiction solutions: these are the Caratheodory solutions that are physically relevant, i.e., the ones that follow the stiction law. However, we find that some of the stiction solutions are forward nonunique in subregions of the slip onset. We call these solutions singular, in contrast to the regular stiction solutions that are forward unique. In order to further the understanding of the nonunique dynamics, we introduce a regularization of the model. This gives a singularly perturbed problem that captures the main features of the original discontinuous problem. We identify a repelling slow manifold that separates the forward slipping from the forward sticking solutions, leading to a high sensitivity to the i...	matrix regularization	Elena Bossolini;Morten Brøns;Kristian Uldall Kristiansen	2017	SIAM J.

Five years ago, the author published a paper that presented computed pseudospectra of thirteen highly nonnormal matrices arising in various applications. Since that time, analogous computations have been carried out for differential and integral operators. This paper, a companion to the earlier one, presents ten examples, each chosen to illustrate one or more mathematical or physical principles.	computation;pseudospectrum;resolution (logic)	Lloyd N.

The analysis relies on the dispersive decay estimates from Pelinovsky and Stefanov [J. Math. Phys., 49 (2008), 113501] and the arguments of Mizumachi [J. Math. Kyoto Univ., 48 (2008), pp. 471–497] for a continuous nonlinear Schrödinger equation in one dimension. Numerical simulations suggest that the actual decay rate of perturbations near the asymptotically stable bound states is higher than the one used in the analysis.	bound state;dispersive partial differential equation;hp 48 series;nonlinear system;numerical linear algebra;schrödinger;septic equation;simulation;zentralblatt math	Panayotis G.

In contrast to generic Chaplygin systems, the reductions of our LR systems onto the homogeneous space Q always possess an invariant measure. We study the case G = SO(n), when LR systems are multidimensional generalizations of the Veselova problem of a nonholonomic rigid body motion which admit a reduction to systems with an invariant measure on the (co)tangent bundle of Stiefel varieties V (k, n) as the corresponding homogeneous spaces. For k = 1 and a special choice of the left-invariant metric on SO(n), we prove that after a time substitution the reduced system becomes an integrable Hamiltonian system describing a geodesic flow on the unit sphere Sn−1. This provides a first example of a nonholonomic system with more than two degrees of freedom for which the celebrated Chaplygin reducibility theorem is applicable for any dimension. In this case we also explicitly reconstruct the motion on the group SO(n).	chaplygin problem;dynamical system;geodesics on an ellipsoid;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);jacobi method;lr parser;spaces;symplectic integrator	Yuri N.

Then the interaction solution between lump solution and one stripe solution is obtained and the result shows that the lump soliton will be drowned or swallowed by the stripe soliton, which can also be called the fission or fusion phenomenon. Furthermore, by the interaction between lump solution and a pair of resonance stripe solitons, a rogue wave phenomenon is revealed.	lumped element model	Honghong Wang	2018	Appl. Math.

We design some numerical schemes which preserve the original conservative properties for the equations. The first scheme is two-level and nonlinear-implicit. Existence of its difference solutions are proved by Brouwer fixed point theorem. It is proved by the discrete energy method that the scheme is uniquely solvable, unconditionally stable and second-order convergent for U in L1 norm, and for N in L2 norm on the basis of the priori estimates. The second scheme is three-level and linear-implicit. Its stability and second-order convergence are proved. Both of the two schemes are conservative so can be used for long time computation. However, they are coupled in computing so need more CPU time. Thus we propose another three-level linear scheme which is not only conservative but also uncoupled in computation, and give the numerical analysis on it. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the schemes are accurate and efficient. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We first analyze the stability of the nonnegative steady states for the reduced ODE system and then study the same question for the corresponding reaction-diffusion system with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. We find that a Hopf bifurcation occurs in the ODE system, but no Turing pattern happens in the reaction-diffusion system. However, when a natural cross diffusion term is included in the model, we can prove the emergence of stationary patterns (i.e., nonconstant positive stationary solutions) for this system; moreover, these stationary patterns do not exist in the considered parameter regime when there is no cross diffusion.	bifurcation theory;emergence;hopf bifurcation;lotka–volterra equations;prey;stationary process;the chemical basis of morphogenesis;turing	Yihong Du;Peter Yu Hu Pang;Mingxin Wang	2008	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/070684173	stability;qualitative research;calculus;mathematics;mathematical economics;statistics	ML	82.70746709738009	4.555612502816061	178241

Such bifurcations are called homoclinic cycle (HCC) bifurcations of the saddle fixed point. We examine the HCC bifurcation structure and the properties of the generated ICC. A planar map that can accurately control the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle fixed point is designed for this analysis and the results indicate that the HCC bifurcation depends upon a product of two eigenvalues of the saddle fixed point, and the generated ICC is a chaotic attractor with a positive Lyapunov exponent.	bifurcation theory;control theory;digraphs and trigraphs;fixed point (mathematics);human-centered computing;lyapunov fractal;nl-complete;numerical aperture;planar graph	Kyohei Kamiyama;Motomasa Komuro;Kazuyuki Aihara	2017	I.

It is well known that the evaluation of the coefficients of the asymptotic series near the transition point is a difficult problem. We discuss two methods for computing the asymptotic series. One method is based on expanding the coefficients of the asymptotic series in Maclaurin series. In the second method we consider auxiliary functions that can be computed more efficiently than the coefficients in the first method, and we do not need the tabulation of many coefficients. The methods are quite general, but the paper concentrates on Bessel functions, in particular on the differential equation of the Bessel functions, which has a turning point character when order and argument of the Bessel functions are equal.	algorithm;bessel filter;coefficient;numerical analysis;point of view (computer hardware company);table (information)	Nico M.

First we address how such the systems may be investigated using the Single Sinusoidal Input Describing Function (SIDF) philosophy. The extension of the SIDF to multi loop nonlinear systems is presented. For the class of separable nonlinear element of any general form, the harmonic balance equations are derived. A numerical search based on multiobjective genetic algorithm is addressed for the direct solution of the harmonic balance system matrix equation. The MOGA is employed to solve the multiobjective formulation and obtain the quantitative values for amplitude, frequency and phase difference of possible limit cycle operation. The search space of MOGA is the space of the possible limit cycle parameters, such as amplitudes, frequency and phase difference between the interacting loops. Finally computer simulation is performed to show how the analysis given in the paper is used to predict the existence of the limit cycle of the multivariable nonlinear systems.	computer simulation;genetic algorithm;harmonic balance;interaction;limit cycle;nonlinear element;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;powera;system independent data format	Farzan Rashidi;Mehran Rashidi	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-24855-2_6	harmonic balance;mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;nonlinear system;computer science;control theory;mathematics;limit cycle;matrix	EDA	70.11873382201347	9.483383774078844	179568

The existence and uniqueness of the global positive solution are achieved. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functions and using Khasminskii’s theory, we establish appropriate conditions to prove that the stochastic model has a unique stationary distribution and the ergodicity holds. Moreover, sufficient conditions that guarantee the epidemic disease’s extinction are given.	stationary process	Yan Zhang;Kuangang Fan;Shujing Gao;Shihua Chen	2018	Appl. Math.

221e8c2b9f37d2c8ac4df4d0a1dc27bcfad6a1e6	extended conjugate points in the calculus of variations	conjugate point;calculus of variation	This paper concerns a characterization of second-order optimality conditions for the fixedendpoint problem in the calculus of variations. The key new concept is a set S(x) with the property thatS(x) = ∅ if and only if the second variation with respect to x , independently of non-singularity assumptions, is non-negative along admissible variations. We show that, for this set of points, it may be much easier (and never more difficult) to prove its nonemptiness than directly finding variations that make the second variation negative. Earlier Loewen and Zheng, and Zeidan, introduced related sets C1(x) andC2(x), applicable to certain optimal control problems, whose non-emptiness has been established merely as a sufficient condition for the existence of negative second variations. These sets, when reduced to the problem we are considering, are related according to C1(x) ⊂ C2(x) ⊂ S(x). Contrary to the behaviour of S(x), verifying membership of C1(x) or C2(x) may be more difficult than verifying directly if the second-order condition holds. We provide several examples for which it is straightforward to prove that S(x) = ∅, but determining the setsC1(x) or C2(x) may be a very difficult or perhaps even a hopeless task.	calculus of variations;optimal control;verification and validation	Ricardo Berlanga;Javier F.

We also stated some properties of finite sequences of elements of a real normed space and finite sequences of real numbers. In addition we proved some theorems about the convergence of sequences.

Despite its algorithmic origin making its theoretical analysis and formulation very difficult, a few recent works has contributed to its theoretical framework. Herein, the former local mean is formulated in a more convenient way by introducing operators to calculate local upper and lower envelopes. This enables the use of differential calculus and other classical calculations on the new local mean. Based on its more accurate formulation, a partial differential equation (PDE) consistency result is provided to approximate the sifting process iterations, without any envelope interpolation. In addition, a new stopping criterion based on the introduced local mean is proposed. This new criterion is a local measure and resolves the null integral conservative property of the previous derived PDE, which made any signal having a null integral be a PDE-based mode. Moreover, the ? inner model parameter is now linked to the signal intrinsic properties, providing to the latter a physical meaning and making the proposed model keep the auto-adaptive property of the EMD. New decomposition modes are now analytically and fully characterized, and also interpolation free. Finally, properties of the interpolation free PDE model are presented. Results obtained with our proposed approach by explicit computations thanks to the eigendecomposition of the Laplacian operator, and also by numerical resolution of the derived PDE, show noticeable improvements for both stationary and non stationary signals, in comparison to the former EMD algorithm.	interpolation	El-Hadji Samba Diop;Radjesvarane Alexandre;Valérie Perrier	2013	Adv.

With no loss of generality we may assume that it has a generator ∊0 > 1, called the fundamental unit of K. The natural logarithm of ∊0 is called the regulator R of K. This paper considers the following problems: How large, and how small, can R get? And how often? The answer is simple for the problem of how small R can be, but seems to be extremely difficult for the question of how large R can get. In order to investigate this, we conducted several large-scalenumerical experiments, involving the ExtendedRiemann Hypothesis and the Cohen-Lenstra class number heuristics. These experiments provide numerical confirmation for what is currently believed about the magnitude of R.		Michael J. Jacobson;Richard F. Lukes;Hugh C.

31cfcb98243a6db14896b104c9a1d004e5a63598	uniformly bounded sets in quasiperiodically forced dynamical systems		This paper addresses structures of state space in quasiperiodically forced dynamical systems. We develop a theory of ergodic partition of state space in a class of measurepreserving and dissipative flows, which is a natural extension of the existing theory for measure-preserving maps. The ergodic partition result is based on eigenspace at eigenvalue 0 of the associated Koopman operator, which is realized via time-averages of observables, and provides a constructive way to visualize a low-dimensional slice through a high-dimensional invariant set. We apply the result to the systems with a finite number of attractors and show that the time-average of a continuous observable is well-defined and reveals the invariant sets, namely, a finite number of basins of attraction. We provide a characterization of invariant sets in the quasiperiodically forced systems. A theorem on uniform boundedness of the invariant sets is proved. The series of analytical results enables numerical analysis of invariant sets in the quasiperiodically forced systems based on the ergodic partition and time-averages. Using this, we analyze a nonlinear model of complex power grids that represents the short-term swing instability, named the coherent swing instability. We show that our analytical results can be used to understand stability regions in such complex systems.	bibo stability;coherence (physics);complex systems;dissipative system;ergodic theory;ergodicity;instability;koopmans' theorem;map;measure-preserving dynamical system;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;observable;state space	Yoshihiko Susuki;Igor Mezic	2018	CoRR		dynamical systems theory;mathematical analysis;ergodic theory;state space;instability;invariant (mathematics);uniform boundedness;mathematics;attractor;observable	ML	80.94756824754505	4.351099437286142	181179

The generic structure at infinity of such systems is defined and used to solve the disturbance decoupling problem and, above all, to bring a new solvability necessary and sufficient conditions to the row by row decoupling problem by generalized state feedback control laws.

The existence of a modified invariant is also investigated and turns out to be equivalent, up to a conjugation, to the preservation of the exact invariant. A striking corollary is that a symplectic method is formally conjugate to a method that preserves the Hamitonian exactly. Another surprising consequence is that the underlying one-step method of a symmetric multistep scheme is formally conjugate to a symplectic P-series when applied to Newton’s equations of motion.	hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);newton;numerical method;quaternions and spatial rotation;symplectic integrator	Philippe Chartier;Erwan Faou;Ander Murua	2006	Numerische Mathematik	10.1007/s00211-006-0003-8	mathematical analysis;numerical analysis;calculus;mathematics;geometry;algorithm	Comp.	80.74438205403648	13.538154835057425	181433

The paper adds some control function to that model, allowing the controlled growth of LDL, HDL and plaque. Next, the new dual dynamic programming approach for free boundary problem is developed to formulate sufficient optimality conditions for the optimal steering of drugs. Finally an approximate optimality and numerical calculations are presented.

The interface is modeled by a jump either in the value or the derivative of V (x) and, in general, does not correspond to a localized perturbation of the perfectly periodic operator. The periodic potentials on each side of the interface can, moreover, be different. As we show, eigenvalues can only occur in spectral gaps. We pose the eigenvalue problem as a C gluing problem for the fundamental solutions (Bloch functions) of the second order ODEs on each side of the interface. The problem is thus reduced to finding intersections of the ratio functions R± = ψ′ ±(0) ψ±(0) , where ψ± are those Bloch functions that decay on the respective half-lines. These ratio functions are analyzed with the help of the Prüfer transformation. The limit values of R± at band edges depend on the ordering of Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues at gap edges. We show that the ordering can be determined in the first two gaps via variational analysis for potentials satisfying certain monotonicity conditions. Numerical computations of interface eigenvalues are presented to corroborate the analysis.	aharonov–bohm effect;bloch sphere;computation;emoticon;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);matching (graph theory);numerical linear algebra;schrödinger;variational analysis	Tomás Dohnal;Michael Plum;Wolfgang Reichel	2009	SIAM J.

The problem is formulated and solved in a Banach algebra of transfer functions that are Laplace transforms of measures having a finite total variation with respect to some given submultiplicative weight function. In particular, this result can be applied to transfer functions in the Callier-Desoer class, and it seems to be new even for this class. The proofs are closely related to and based on the scalar case solved previously.	distributed computing;interlacing (bitmaps);transfer function;weight function	Olof J.

As an application we present a way to compute the Fisher information matrix of an ARMA process. The computation is based on the fact that this matrix can be decomposed into blocks where each block satisfies a certain Stein equation.	coefficient;computation;fisher information;time series;vandermonde matrix	André Klein;Peter Spreij	2003	SIAM J.

Here we firstly investigate whether this particular extension operator can be replaced by another extension operator. Our main theoretical result states that an important class of extension operators based on interpolating boundary values cannot be used in the construction setting required by Dahmen and Schneider. In the second part of this paper, we investigate and optimize the Hestenes extension operator.

2c9677265b17622ec6471ad6f03ba0b4f2821821	stability and hopf bifurcation analysis on a delayed leslie-gower predator-prey system incorporating a prey refuge	predator prey system;hopf bifurcation;time delay;leslie gower;stability	In this paper, a modified Leslie-Gower predator-prey system with time delays is investigated, where the time delays are regarded as bifurcation parameters. By analyzing the corresponding characteristic equation, the local stability of a positive equilibrium is considered. Moreover, we show that Hopf bifurcations occur when time delay crosses some critical values. By deriving the equation describing the flow on the center manifold, we give the formula for determining the direction of the Hopf bifurcation and the stability of bifurcating periodic solutions. In addition, we also try on the global existence of periodic solutions by using the global Hopf bifurcation result of Wu [J. Wu, Symmetric functional differential equations and neural networks with memory, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 350 (1998) 4799-4838.] for functional differential equations. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the theoretical results and they show that the time delays in the system under consideration can destroy the stability of the system.	bifurcation theory;hopf bifurcation;leslie speaker;lotka–volterra equations;prey	Yongkun Li;Changzhao Li	2013	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2012.10.069	transcritical bifurcation;stability;period-doubling bifurcation;pitchfork bifurcation;biological applications of bifurcation theory;calculus;control theory;mathematics;hopf lemma;bifurcation theory;bogdanov–takens bifurcation;mathematical economics;saddle-node bifurcation;hopf bifurcation;statistics;bifurcation diagram	NLP	78.73267117588898	5.556689878329814	183437

In particular, we consider (i) direct control, (ii) penalized, and (iii) semi-Lagrangian discretization schemes applied to the HJBQVI problem. Scheme (i) takes the form of a Bellman problem involving an operator which is not necessarily contractive. We consider the well-posedness of the Bellman problem and give sufficient conditions for convergence of the corresponding policy iteration. To do so, we use weakly chained diagonally dominant matrices, which give a graph-theoretic characterization of weakly diagonally dominant M-matrices. We compare schemes (i)–(iii) under the following examples: (a) optimal control of the exchange rate, (b) optimal consumption with fixed and proportional transaction costs, and (c) pricing guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits in variable annuities. We find that one should abstain from using scheme (i).	diagonally dominant matrix;discretization;emoticon;graph theory;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;iteration;jacobi method;markov decision process;numerical analysis;optimal control;scheme;semiconductor industry;well-posed problem;whole earth 'lectronic link	P.

This model was considered as a nonlinear competitive system of three initial–boundary value problems for the nonlinear transport equations with non-local integral boundary conditions and discrete time delay (fixed incubation period of infection). It was obtained the explicit recurrent formulae for computing the traveling wave solution of such systemprovided themodel parameters (coefficients of equations and initial values) satisfy the restrictions that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of continuous solution. Using some insignificant simplifications the age-structured SIR model was reduced to the nonlinear autonomous system of delay ODE. It was studied the dimensionless indicators and conditions of existence of trivial disease-free equilibrium, two non-trivial endemic equilibriums for the incurable and curable infection-induced diseases, respectively. By carrying out an analysis of the local asymptotical stability of the solution of such system we obtain the restrictions for the time delay that guarantee the stability of solutions in the neighborhood of equilibriums. The numerous simulations of dynamics of SIR population illustrate the results of theoretical analysis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

2e09af153f1225e0257fbeb105494d8c25e34bb0	dynamics of a system of two simplest oscillators with compactly supported nonlinear feedbacks		In this paper, we consider a singularly perturbed system of two differential equations with delay, simulating two coupled oscillators with a nonlinear feedback. The feedback function is assumed to be compactly supported and piecewise-continuous and it is assumed that its sign is constant. In this paper, we prove the existence of relaxation periodic solutions and make conclusions about their stability. Using a special large-parameter method, we construct asymptotics of all solutions of the considered system under the assumption that the initial-value conditions belong to a certain class. Using this asymptotics, we construct a special mapping principally describing the dynamics of the original model. It is shown that the dynamics changes fundamentally as the coupling coefficient decreases: we have a stable homogeneous periodic solution if the coupling coefficient is on the order of unity and the dynamics become more complex as the coupling coefficient decreases (it is described by a special map). For small values of the coupling, we show that there are values of the parameters such that several different stable relaxation periodic regimes coexist in the original problem.	coefficient;coexist (image);linear programming relaxation;loose coupling;nonlinear system;simulation	A.

It is well known that for all sufficiently small > 0 the system possesses a periodic traveling wave. With aid of computer-assisted rigorous computations, we prove the existence of this periodic orbit in the traveling wave equation for an explicit range ∈ (0, 0.0015]. Our approach is based on a novel method of combination of topological techniques of covering relations and isolating segments, for which we provide a self-contained theory. We show that the range of existence is wide enough, so the upper bound can be reached by standard validated continuation procedures. In particular, for the range ∈ [1.5× 10−4, 0.0015] we perform a rigorous continuation based on covering relations and not specifically tailored to the fast-slow setting. Moreover, we confirm that for = 0.0015 the classical interval Newton-Moore method applied to a sequence of Poincaré maps already succeeds. Techniques described in this paper can be adapted to other fast-slow systems of similar structure.		Aleksander Czechowski;Piotr Zgliczynski	2016	SIAM J.

For constant linear part, it is known that the method allows second-order error bounds independent of the product of the step-size with the frequencies and is therefore a long-time-step method. Most real-world problems are not of that kind and it is important to study more general equations. The analysis in this paper shows that one obtains second-order error bounds even in the case of a time- and/or solution-dependent linear part if the matrix is evaluated at averaged positions.	exponential integrator;time complexity	Volker Grimm	2005	Numerische Mathematik	10.1007/s00211-005-0583-8	independent equation;mathematical analysis;exponential integrator;numerical analysis;calculus;control theory;mathematics;oscillation;quantum mechanics	ML	82.65243966768439	11.792376213436766	185712

One representative behavior of such a complex system can be illustrated by Hopf bifurcation. This paper presents a Hopf bifurcation analysis of a kind of integro-differential equations with unbounded delay. Based on the Hopf bifurcation principle, a set of relationships among system parameters are obtained when a periodic orbit exists in the system. A numerical analysis is applied to solve the integro-differential delay equation. This paper proves the existence of Hopf bifurcation in the corresponding difference equations under the same system parameters as that in the integro-differential delay equations.	bifurcation theory;hopf bifurcation	Lan Zhang;Chengjian Zhang;Dongming Zhao	2011	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2010.11.046	blue sky catastrophe;integro-differential equation;mathematical optimization;transcritical bifurcation;complex systems;mathematical analysis;numerical analysis;period-doubling bifurcation;homoclinic bifurcation;control theory;mathematics;hopf lemma;bifurcation theory;saddle-node bifurcation;differential equation;hopf bifurcation;bifurcation diagram	Theory	79.21787284712859	4.239217017146838	185880

Some historical notes on iterative procedures are followed by a derivation of Euler's formula with the associated error estimate in a new notation which simplifies the error estimate and suggests generalizations. The final section considers the Padé approximants to the “Euler polynomial” and shows how a number of known formulas may be derived from this unified approach.

If an absolute error no greater than eT in the final result is desired, it is necessary to determine what tolerance parameter ~o to assign to the outer routine and what tolerance parameters ~z, to assign for calls to the inner routine. Since it is not known at the outset how many times the inner routine will be called, there is reqmred what is termed an accuracyasstgnment strategy for determining ez,. In this paper two simple accuracy assignment strategms are discussed m detail. It ~s shown that one of them can be unstable if the outer routine is constructed internally in one way (local error control), but that it is quite 5cable ff it is constructed in another way (global error control).

However, the extension of many topological techniques to higher dimensions is filled with roadblocks preventing their application. This article shows how to extend the homotopic lobe dynamics (HLD) technique, previously developed for two-dimensional (2D) maps, to volume-preserving maps of a 3D phase space. Such maps are physically relevant to particle transport by incompressible fluid flows or by magnetic field lines. Specifically, this manuscript shows how to utilize 2D stable and unstable invariant manifolds, intersecting in a heteroclinic tangle, to construct a symbolic representation of the topological dynamics of the map. This symbolic representation can be used to classify system trajectories and to compute topological entropy. We illustrate the salient ideas through a series of examples with increasing complexity. These examples highlight new features of the HLD technique in three dimensions. Ultimately, in the final example, our technique detects a difference between the 2D stretching rate of surfaces and the 1D stretching rate of curves, illustrating the truly 3D nature of our approach.	acoustic lobing;complexity;computational fluid dynamics;control theory;map projection;measure-preserving dynamical system;numerical analysis;topological entropy;trellis quantization	Bryan Maelfeyt;Spencer A.

The subalgebra preserving the observation defined on the model structure is found, thus giving all transformations of the system that preserve its structure. It is shown that this is equivalent to the similarity transformation approach (Evans, Chapman, Chappell, & Godfrey, 2002) for structural identifiability analysis and as such is a method of generating such transformations for this approach. This provides another method for performing structural identifiability analysis on nonlinear state-space models that has the possibility of extension to PDE type models.

Recently, the CPA method was revised by using more advanced triangulations and it was proved that it can compute a CPA Lyapunov function for any nonlinear system possessing an exponentially stable equilibrium. This more advanced triangulation scheme includes a simplicial fan close to the equilibrium of the system, for which the Lyapunov function is computed. In this paper we prove a result that allows for a simpler, more general and more efficient generation of this simplicial fan and thus improves the implementation of the CPA method. Moreover, the simplicial fan subdivision at the origin is also of great importance in methods relying on a conic decomposition of the state-space.	computer fan;conic optimization;cost per action;floor and ceiling functions;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;simplicial homology;state space;subdivision surface;triangulation (geometry)	Peter Giesl;Sigurdur F.

Direct expansions of Y~(x) are used for x small and 0 ~ v _< 1.

We show that there is a boundary triplet associated to the undamped wave equation. This enables us to characterise all boundary conditions for which the undamped wave equation possesses a unique solution non-increasing in the energy. Furthermore, we add boundary inputs and outputs to the system, thus turning it into an impedance conservative boundary control system.		Mikael Kurula;Hans Zwart	2015	Int. J.

The dynam- ical behavior of gene expressions is represented by a system of ordinary dierential equations. We introduce a gene-interaction matrix with some nonlinear entries, in particular, quadratic polynomials of the expression levels to keep the system solvable. The model parameters are determined by using optimization. Then, we provide the time-discrete approxima- tion of our time-continuous model. Finally, from the considered models we derive gene regulatory networks, discuss their qualitative features and provide a basis for analyzing networks with nonlinear connections.	approximation;gene co-expression network;mathematical model	F.

Two models for an age-structured nonlimited population dynamics with maternal care of offspring are presented. One of them deals with a bisexual population and includes a harmonic mean type mating of sexes and females’ pregnancy. The other one describes dynamics of an asexual population. Migration is not taken into account. The existence and uniqueness theorem for the general case of vital rates is proved, the extinction and growth of the population are considered, and a class of the product (separable) solutions is obtained for these two models. The long-time behavior of the asexual population is obtained in the stationary case of vital rates.	care-of address;population dynamics;stationary process	Vladas Skakauskas	2000	Informatica, Lith.

We give a complete geometric characterization of systems that become static feedback linearizable after a one-fold prolongation of a suitably chosen control. They form a particular class of flat systems: they are of differential weight n + 3. We provide a system of first order PDE's to be solved in order to find all minimal flat outputs. We illustrate our results by two examples: the induction motor and the polymerization reactor.	fold (higher-order function);linearizability	Florentina Nicolau;Witold Respondek	2013		10.3182/20130904-3-FR-2041.00188	control engineering;mathematical analysis;control theory;mathematics;flatness	Logic	70.52991813679034	4.878803130538191	189993

We introduce a transition system as semantics of the controlled hybrid system and consider a control specification given by a predicate. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the predicate to be control-invariant and show that there always exists the supremal control-invariant subpredicate for any predicate.
