f51e5dfa027700fec45b1007e68cf4e49a8ce45f	realisation of robot ink deposition on a curved surface	adaptive compensation;robot ink deposition;curved surfaces;robot printing;additive manufacturing;b spline surfaces	In the robot ink deposition system proposed in this paper, an Additive Manufacturing (AM) concept-based method generates an ink deposition path, and the developed adaptive compensation algorithm allows the robot to deposit ink on a curved surface based on B-spline surface theory. This method gives the robot arm more flexibility to print characters or to graph on a curved surface, and it affords the robot system a larger working envelope for ink deposition. A letter-printing experiment was conducted in a laboratory using this method. The results show that writing letters on the ink deposition path generated based on the AM concept is much easier than doing so on paths generated using existing methods, and that the adaptive compensation algorithm for printing letters on a large curved surface is effective.	3d printing;additive model;algorithm;b-spline;ccir system a;chemical vapor deposition;envelope (motion);physical vapor deposition;polygonal modeling;realization (linguistics);robot;robotic arm	Zhiyuan Wang;Renwei Liu;Todd Sparks;Frank Liou	2016	IJCAT	10.1504/IJCAT.2016.074457	control engineering;3d printing;engineering;engineering drawing	Robotics	75.27690190461206	-21.150442904379258	49827

The need of crossing the tower leads to its complex structure, large quality, and high processing cost, thus inappropriate for carrying in complex topography. So this paper provides a cable-climbing robot as climbing robot which is a rod-chain combination that can be installed on the ground and carried easily. The driving force of the cable-climbing robot can automatically adjust as needed and adapt to the cable's diameter. The static and dynamic analysis of the climbing robot shows the driving scheme is reasonable, and the three-dimensional modeling verifies its rationality, too.	cable modem;dimensional modeling;hill climbing;rationality;robot;topography	Guangping Hao;Fanzhu Meng;Hongzhe Li;Zhihong Wang;Zhaonan Zhong	2011	Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Electronic & Mechanical Engineering and Information Technology	10.1109/EMEIT.2011.6023478	structural engineering;control engineering;mobile robot;robot end effector;simulation;articulated robot;chain;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;arm solution;robot control;robot kinematics	Robotics	74.01908875813078	-22.70197376903923	50133

6e42336d458223103c3332131adfd6cfac826faf	development of a two-link planar manipulator with continuously variable transmission mechanism	shafts manipulator dynamics trajectory ellipsoids vectors force;dynamic manipulability ellipsoid two link planar manipulator development continuously variable transmission mechanism cvt mechanism plural linear shaft motors control signal design output force manipulator end point manipulating force ellipsoid;shafts control system synthesis linear motors manipulator kinematics	This paper proposes a novel two-link planar manipulator with continuously variable transmission (CVT) mechanism by means of plural linear shaft motors. In our previous works, we have proposed the parallel-link manipulator with the CVT mechanism which has two orthogonal DOFs. However, its configuration is not useful for a practical field because only one main link can be rotated around two joints like a joystick. In order for this mechanism to be more useful, the two-link planar type manipulator with the CVT is newly modeled and developed. Firstly, the proposed manipulator is modeled, and its control signals are designed. Next, the output force of the end-point of the manipulator is evaluated by using both the Manipulating-Force Ellipsoid and the Dynamic Manipulability Ellipsoid. After that, several fundamental experiments are performed to evaluate the CVT mechanism and show the effectiveness of the proposed manipulator.	experiment;joystick;manipulability ellipsoid;pid;robot;stiffness matrix	Tomofumi Okada;Kenji Tahara	2014	2014 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics	10.1109/AIM.2014.6878147	classical mechanics;control engineering;parallel manipulator;engineering;control theory	Robotics	69.96232247544013	-21.537868806086017	50604
1f416766ae2cc814ba564a1165d9a02fcbf349a7	velocity workspace analysis for multiple arm robot systems	manipulability polytopes;multiple arms;velocity workspace;jacobian matrices;robot systems	In this paper, the analysis of manipulability of robotic systems comprised of multiple cooperating arms is considered. Given bounds on the capabilities of joint actuators for each robot, the purpose of this study is to derive the bounds for task velocity achievable by the system. Since bounds on each joint velocity form a polytope in jointvelocity space and the task space velocity is connected with joint velocity through Jacobian matrices of each robot, the allowable task velocity space, i.e. velocity workspace, for multiple cooperating robot system is also represented as a polytope which is called manipulability polytope throughout this paper. Based on the fact that the boundaries of the manipulability polytope are mapped from the boundaries of allowable joint-velocity space, slack variables are introduced in order to transform given inequality constraint given on joint velocities into a set of normal linear equalities in which the unknowns of the equation are composed of the vertices of manipulability polytope, vectors spanning the null space of the Jacobian matrix, and the slack variables. Either redundant or nonredundant cooperating robot systems can be handled with the proposed technique. Several different application examples including simple SCARAtype robots as well as complex articulated robot manipulators are included, and, under the assumption of firm grip, it will be shown that the calculated manipulability polytope for cooperating robot system is actually the intersection of all the manipulability polytopes of every single robot which is hard to be derived through geometrical manipulation.	algorithm;articulated robot;coat of arms;file spanning;futures studies;jacobian matrix and determinant;kernel (linear algebra);linear algebra;linear equation;mobile robot;scara;simulation;slack variable;social inequality;velocity (software development);workspace	Jihong Lee	2001	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574700003179	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;geometry;robot kinematics	Robotics	69.27661925251306	-21.050611411492547	50610

Traditionally, various local closed-loop control methodologies were proposed based on the two-port network architecture. Main concerns for this type of bi-lateral telemanipulation have been the stable tracking of the transmitted force and position signals. As such, assumptions have been made in regard to no loss of the transmitted information and existence of a fixed time delay between the master robot and the slave environment. However, connectivity through Internet introduces variable time delays with added lost of information. Not until recently, most of the proposed control methodologies have ignored taking advantage of the nature of the Internet protocols and its associated signal processing. For example, the limits of human tactile/force perception on distinguishing temporal changes in force signal can introduce a feasible and practical constraint which can be incorporated in the framework of single processing and in the data communication transport. This paper presents an overview of the literature on user-centered Internet-based tele-operation and proposes a force signal processing framework which can be utilized in such implementation.	broadcast delay;control theory;information;internet protocol suite;lateral thinking;network architecture;remote control;remote manipulator;robot;signal processing;television;two-port network;user-centered design	Shahram Payandeh;Jae-young Lee	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2014.6974553	computer vision;simulation	Robotics	69.28489467783817	-13.286506002221433	50894
8bc5bc3898350d7d2c87fa97a3317f1d2e865a2c	bayesian sparse reconstruction method of compressed sensing in the presence of impulsive noise		The majority of existing recovery algorithms in the framework of compressed sensing are not robust to the impulsive noise. However, the impulsive noise is always present in the actual communication and signal processing system. In this paper, we propose a method named ‘Bayesian sparse reconstruction’ to recover the sparse signal from the measurement vector which is corrupted by the impulsive noise. The Bayesian sparse reconstruction method is composed of five parts, which are the preliminary detection of the location set of impulses, the impulsive noise fast relevance vector machine algorithm, the step of pruning, Bayesian impulse detection algorithm and the maximum a posteriori estimate of the sparse vector. The Bayesian sparse reconstruction method can achieve effective signal recovery in the presence of impulsive noise, depending on the mutual influence of the impulsive noise fast relevance vector machine algorithm, the step of pruning and the Bayesian impulse detection algorithm. Experimental results show that the Bayesian sparse reconstruction method is robust to the impulsive noise and effective in the additive white Gaussian noise environment.	compressed sensing;sparse	Yunyun Ji;Zhen Yang;Wei Li	2013	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-013-9605-4	speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;sparse approximation	HCI	77.43511799784625	-10.250714991541258	50897

The traditional thermostat valve, coolant pump, and clutch-driven radiator fan are upgraded with servomotor actuators. When the system components function harmoniously, desired thermal conditions can be accomplished in a power-efficient manner. In this paper, a comprehensive nonlinear-control architecture is proposed for transient-temperature tracking. An experimental system has been fabricated and assembled which features a variable-position smart valve, variable-speed electric water pump, variable-speed electric radiator fan, engine block, and various sensors. In the configured system, the steam-based heat exchanger emulates the heat generated by the engine's combustion process. Representative numerical and experimental results are discussed to demonstrate the functionality of the thermal-management system in accurately tracking the prescribed temperature profiles and minimizing electrical power consumption.	emulator;experimental system;management system;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;sensor	Mohammad H.

7705fdc9cc9247cf0939d3ba2de0007be9e3cf44	design of repetitive controller based on linear auto disturbance rejection control for active magnetic bearing spindles		The aim of the research is to attenuate the radial periodic vibration of active magnetic bearing (AMB) rotors. In this paper, a controller combining repetitive control (RC) and linear auto disturbance rejection control (LADRC) is proposed for an AMB system. The proposed approach has the added advantage that the design of the two controllers is independent of each other. The LADEC method ensures the system dynamic response, and the RC method is used to remove the periodic disturbance from the rotor vibration. By analyzing the periodic characteristics of radial single degrees-of-freedom rotor unbalanced vibration of a magnetic suspension motor, an imbalance force model of the rotor is established. To verify dynamic and steady performance, stability and periodic interference suppression ability of proposed control system, the rotor with a speed of 10,000 rpm was simulated based on SIMULINK in MATLAB. The simulation results show that the proposed controller has better steady-state performance compared with the traditional LADRC controller.	control system;hard disk drive;interference (communication);matlab;performance;r.o.t.o.r.;radial (radio);rejection sampling;simulation;simulink;steady state;system dynamics;unbalanced circuit;zero suppression	Dapeng Wang;Hao Sun	2017	2017 2nd International Conference on Cybernetics, Robotics and Control (CRC)	10.1109/CRC.2017.37	control theory;magnetic levitation;electromagnetic suspension;rotor (electric);repetitive control;magnetic bearing;control theory;control system;mathematics;vibration	Robotics	70.37374067303995	-12.993285500576233	51822

The object of this paper is “Lanxin”, an unmanned surface vehicle (7.02 m × 2.6 m), which is equipped with a single vector propulsion device. First, the “Lanxin” unmanned surface vehicle and the related field experiments (turning test and zig-zag test) are introduced and experimental data are collected through various sensors. Then, the thrust of the vector thruster is estimated by the empirical formula method. Third, using the hypothesis and simplification, the three degrees of freedom model and the response model of USV are deduced and established, respectively. Fourth, the parameters of the models (three degrees of freedom model, response model and thruster servo model) are obtained by system identification, and we compare the simulated turning test and zig-zag test with the actual data to verify the accuracy of the identification results. Finally, the biggest advantage of this paper is that it combines theory with practice. Based on identified response model, simulation and practical course keeping experiments are carried out to further verify feasibility and correctness of modeling and identification.	abbreviations;approximation error;can bus;computer simulation;conflict (psychology);controllers;correctness (computer science);data acquisition;experiment;extended kalman filter;global positioning system;hall-effect thruster;integrated circuit device component;i²c;level of detail;manuscripts;mathematical model;mathematics;medication event monitoring system;microelectromechanical systems;microsoft foundation class library;newton's method;pid;population parameter;robot kit;sensor;servo device component;state or province of exposure to illness:loc:pt:^patient:nom;system identification;thrust;turing test;universities;unmanned aerial vehicle;verification of theories	Dongdong Mu;Guofeng Wang;Yunsheng Fan;Xiaojie Sun;Bingbing Qiu	2018		10.3390/s18061889	electronic engineering;experimental data;thrust;engineering;correctness;control engineering;servo;field experiment;system identification;propulsion	Robotics	72.40212083885918	-15.280477129528748	52051

Electro-Hydrostatic Actuator (EHA) is a type of a hydraulic actuator with backdrivability. To improve backdrivability of an EHA, reduction of friction, especially static friction is important. This, however, is difficult because most of the hydraulic pumps require sliding contacts between mechanical components. A viscous screw pump is a variation of a viscous pump that transfers mechanical kinetic energy to fluidic kinetic energy with viscous friction of the fluid. Since this class of pumps does not require mechanical contacts between the rotor and the stator, they are pumps with least static friction. In this paper, design and development of a screw pump targeted for use in an electro-hydrostatic actuator to improve the backdrivability of the actuator system is presented. Pressure-Flow discharge performance of the developed pump and backdrivability performance when combined with a vane motor were evaluated.	discharger;electrooculography;mac address;r.o.t.o.r.;robot	Hiroshi Kaminaga;Hirokazu Tanaka;Kazuki Yasuda;Yoshihiko Nakamura	2011	2011 11th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots	10.1109/Humanoids.2011.6100907	hydraulic cylinder;fluid statics;hydraulic pump;electro-hydraulic actuator;kinetic energy;control theory	Robotics	73.35756373320937	-22.768015520134153	52278

The output cross-talk is less than 2% and the parasitic motions of the input points in the other limbs are less than 1.8%, which shows a good decoupling property.	amplifier;classical xy model;coupling (computer programming);crosstalk;displacement mapping;federal enterprise architecture;finite element method;input/output;mathematical optimization;matrix method;prototype;simulation	Longquan Xi;Yangmin Li;Xinhua Zhao	2012	2012 12th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision (ICARCV)	10.1109/ICARCV.2012.6485339	structural engineering;control engineering;hinge;engineering;finite element method;engineering drawing	Robotics	73.28504329531147	-18.73217235100291	52596

In particular, the problem is approached by means of continuous-time system identification using subspace-based methods based on discrete-time input-output data. A method is developed, with the property that the structure of the model resulting from fundamental physical first principles is obtained and the parameter matrices have a clear physical interpretation. The proposed method is subsequently successfully validated in both simulation and using experimental data from a three-axis manipulator. In both cases the identified models exhibit good fit to the input-output data. The results indicate that the proposed method can be useful in the context of model-based control design in, for example, impedance force control for robots and manipulators, but also for modal analysis of mechanical systems.	apache axis;characteristic impedance;experiment;modal logic;robot;simulation;state space;system identification	Bjorn Olofsson;Olof Sornmo;Anders Robertsson;Rolf Johansson	2014	2014 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics	10.1109/AIM.2014.6878100	control engineering;simulation;system identification;engineering;control theory	Robotics	71.71509810885999	-12.027980768218336	52679

This strategy essentially consists of two steps. First, a representative hybrid incremental model of micromachining process is obtained. The final result of this model describes output as a function of two inputs (feed per tooth quadratic and vibration mean quadratic (rms) in the Z axis) and output (surface roughness Ra). Second, the hybrid incremental model is evaluated in real time for predicting the surface roughness. The model is experimentally tested by embedding the computational procedure in a real-time monitoring system of surface roughness. The prototype evaluation shows a success rate in the estimate of surface roughness about 80%. These results are the basement for developing a new generation of embedded systems for monitoring surface roughness of micro components in real time and the further exploitation of the monitoring system at industrial level.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;control system;embedded system;experiment;mathematical model;nonlinear system;optic axis of a crystal;prototype;quantum metrology;real-time clock;sensor	Fernando Castaño;Rodolfo E.

The stability analysis is proposed as a general analysis in the controller's parameter-space under the assumption of two fixed delays, considering one due to the signal and communication processing and one defined as a design delay for the controller. Furthermore, a method for measuring the fragility of the controllers is also proposed.

In the previous researches on the grasp stability, the number of grasped objects is restricted to 1. For efficiency of tasks, multiple objects had better been grasped and manipulated by a robot hand. In order to design stable grasp, grasp stability of multiple objects must be quantitatively evaluated. In case of two grasped objects in two dimensions, the number of parameters of object displacement is 6. However, the displacement of the objects is constrained by each other, because the contact between the objects must be maintained. Independent parameters of the object displacement are provided and then finger displacement is derived. The grasp stability is evaluated from the viewpoint of the potential energy method. From numerical examples, the effect of curvature at contact point between two objects is demonstrated. The effect of this curvature stands for the feature of multiple objects.	displacement mapping;numerical analysis;robot;smart objects	Takayoshi Yamada;Toshinori Ooba;Tomoya Yamamoto;Nobuharu Mimura;Yasuyuki Funahashi	2005	Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570209	robot;control engineering;von neumann stability analysis;two-dimensional space;simulation;cybernetics;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;potential energy;friction;engineering drawing	Robotics	69.67525297903013	-22.255910152110555	52914

While mass and stiffness properties can be simulated with sufficient accuracy, often no suitable damping models are available for the components of machine tools. The commonly used linear damping models are predominantly linear hysteretic or viscous models. However, the linear damping models are often not appropriate to reflect the occurring nonlinear effects in machine tools with the required accuracy. The reason for these nonlinearities are predominantly the friction forces in feed drive components. To resolve these deficits, the friction in feed drive components is comprehensively investigated in this paper, models for friction forces are identified and coupled with a reduced, flexible multi-body system. With the identified friction models the measured friction curves can be reproduced very precisely. The coupled, reduced, flexible multi-body model allows to simulate the nonlinear effects and to predict the dynamic behavior of machine tools with high accuracy. Consequently, a further important step towards accurate virtual simulation of machine tools is made.		Christian Rebelein;Michael F.

Orientated to telemedical applications, this paper proposes a new method that can partially cancel the bias portion, so that the fidelity of haptic feedback is improved. Specifically, the returning wave is augmented by the difference between the velocity of the master and the desired velocity of the slave. The steady-state position tracking is not affected by the modification. The passivity of the augmented teleoperation system can be maintained by tuning the bandwidth of a low-pass filter. Hence, stability is always achievable. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme.	haptic technology;low-pass filter;steady state;velocity (software development)	Yongqiang Ye;Peter Xiaoping Liu	2009	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2009.2016368	control engineering;simulation;low-pass filter;computer science;engineering;control theory;haptic technology;physics	Robotics	69.3795802717667	-13.159948262770108	53217

In this approach, sequences for the desired sampling and actuation times form additional inputs to the discrete-time systems. An analytical evaluation for a class of practically relevant systems is presented that yields discrete-time state-space systems with non-constant coefficients. Because of the non-linearity introduced by the irregular time intervals, a linearising controller is proposed that allows to re-use standard linear controllers. A simulation example demonstrates the feasibility of the presented control approach for a neuro-prosthetic system.	coefficient;discretization;linear time-invariant theory;neuro-fuzzy;nonlinear system;sampling (signal processing);simulation;state space	Christian Klauer;Thomas Schauer	2014	2014 19th International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)	10.1109/MMAR.2014.6957394	control engineering;sampled data systems;real-time computing;lti system theory;engineering;control theory;system analysis;time-invariant system	Robotics	71.57943977429072	-11.05867161151723	53222
74584e4a4c4f725326f6c766bf1b491d91498832	comparison of the observability indices for robot calibration considering joint stiffness parameters		In this paper, comparisons of the 4 observability indices for robot calibration considering joint stiffness parameters are performed for finding the best robot pose set. 4 observability indices such as the minimum singular value index, the inverse condition number index, the product of singular values index and the noise amplification index were discussed and compared with the conventional calibration Jacobian matrix. Here, we propose the joint stiffness included Jacobian to consider robot joint deflection due to the load. Those indices are evaluated and compared in light of the resulting calibration accuracies. Genetic algorithms customized for a simple 2-link planar robot manipulator with a loading in the end-effector are applied to search optimal robot poses where measurement values are used to calibrate both the robot kinematic parameters and joint stiffness parameters. In this process, 4 observability indices, treated as fitness functions respectively, are evaluated and compared through a 2-link robot manipulator calibration simulation. While the kinematic parameters are well calibrated in all of the 4 observability, in joint stiffness included identification, these 4 observabilities perform differently. The noise amplification index identifies joint stiffness more stably and approximately with very small residual errors than others.	robot calibration;stiffness	Jian Zhou;Hee-Jun Kang;Young Shick Ro	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14831-6_50	control theory	Robotics	70.66750687174675	-20.043644548243705	53247

In the manual guided transfer system, it is required to position precisely and quickly by manual operation. However in the transfer system with vibrational elements such as the crane system, it is difficult to position the transfer object by excited the vibration. Therefore, the operational assistance system with both precise positioning and vibration suppression for the manual guided transfer system is proposed in this study. In the manual guided transfer system, the operational force applied to the joystick can be detected by the force sensor located on the base of joystick. The velocity command to the motor for driving the cart is generated based on the detected operational force in the controller. In order to realize the precise positioning and the vibration suppression, the operational assistance system is designed by the virtual resistances and the filtering approach. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is verified by the experiments using the manual guided transfer system with pendulum as vibrational element.	control system;data transfer object;experiment;global positioning system;joystick;precise point positioning;velocity (software development);zero suppression	Yoshiyuki Noda;Daiki Suzuki	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/SMC.2015.222	simulation;vibration;cutoff frequency;friction;control theory;resistance;force	Robotics	72.03525692278305	-18.09416167579121	53261

An inner loop controls the outlet temperature and an outer control loop provides a reference set point, which is based on estimation of the evaporation pressure and suitable reference logic. The pressure is approximated as being linear and proportional to the opening degree of the expansion valve. This gain and the reference logic is based on calculation of the variance in the outlet temperature, which have shown to increase at low superheat. The parameters in the proposed controller structure can automatically be chosen based on two open loop tests. Results from tests on two different refrigeration systems indicate that the proposed controller can control the evaporator superheat to a low level giving close to optimal filling of the evaporator, with only one temperature sensor. No a priori model knowledge was used and it is anticipated that the method is applicable on a wide variety of refrigeration systems.

Although several extensible pneumatic actuators have been proposed in previous research, balancing strength with large strain is still a challenge. We propose an extensible pneumatic actuator with bellows (EPAB) that consists of a rubber tube and a highly packed bellows sleeve. We propose a parametric model of the EPAB that can comprise various bellows and rubber tubes. We measured the basic properties of four actuators with different parameters to verify the proposed model. We conducted evaluation experiments under two conditions: constant length with variable pressure and constant pressure with variable length. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model can roughly predict the measured data. The proposed extensible actuator has an unloaded strain of up to 350% at a pressure of 0.6 MPa.	apache continuum;computer performance;experiment;hysteresis;parametric model;triune continuum paradigm	Taigo Yukisawa;Yasuaki Ishii;Satoshi Nishikawa;Ryuma Niiyama;Yasuo Kuniyoshi	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2017.8324762	parametric model;pascal (unit);control engineering;control theory;actuator;engineering;pneumatic actuator;extensibility;bellows	Robotics	73.17035805566327	-21.947297052368707	53444

To cope with the various change of weight, maintaining the same frequency and convergence time of the behavior important.

An intrinsically safe mechanical system guarantees human safety when electronics or controls fail. However, industry also demands a certain operating velocity. A low inertia is the most important aspect to combine safety with a useful operating velocity, because this will limit the amount of kinetic or potential energy in the system and the required actuation forces. Low‐actuation forces limit the amount of static contact pressure between manipulator and human, a requirement for intrinsic safety. Low energy means that less contact force is required to put the manipulator to a stop in collision, an additional requirement. The goal of this paper is to find the maximum industrially applicable, manipulator mass for which intrinsic mechanical safety is guaranteed.Design/methodology/approach – Observing existing and proposed manipulators in agriculture results in a requi...

At the intelligent control level, first, BTP and VSS soft-sensing models are established, respectively. Next, the BTP mechanical control model and fuzzy controller are designed. The basic automation level contains a distributed control system (DCS), which performs process control including stable tracking control of the strand velocity; and a communication interface, which enables the intelligent controller and the DCS to exchange data on process information. The real-world application results show that the system not only sufficiently suppresses the fluctuation, but also effectively improve the utilization factor of the sintering machine and the quality and quantity of the sinters.	artificial neural network;burn-in;control theory;distributed control system;intelligent control;mathematical optimization;quantum fluctuation;requirement;strand (programming language);velocity (software development)	Chun-sheng Wang;Min Wu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2011.2179663	control engineering;embedded system;stability;computer science;engineering;process control;mathematical model;control theory;distributed parameter system;computational model;statistics;intelligent control;mechanical engineering	Robotics	71.58674838759025	-15.23839231122967	54266

The basic configuration is taken from the worm-like shape of the medicinal leech. It consists of a sequence of hexahedra with damped elastic springs as edges to model the various parts of the musculature. The system is stabilized by the constraint of constant volume either in the whole body or in prescribed compartments. We set up Lagrange's equations of motion with the Lagrange multipliers being the pressure values in the compartments.

In the control system in HDDs, the head assembly was influenced the effect of several disturbances, e.g, RRO, flutter vibration, force disturbance, and so on. At the force disturbance, it caused by wind force, external shock, tension force of Flexible Printed Circuit, and rolling friction around pivot bearing. In these force disturbance, the influence of the rolling friction is large at positioning in minute area. Therefore, controlling the rolling friction is important at short span seeking motion for the high performance trajectory. In this paper, we present a measuring method for the dynamic rolling friction that considering the inertia force of magnetic head. And we propose a 2 DOF controller design to suppress the effect of the dynamic rolling friction. The effects of the proposal method and controller performance are verified by experimental results.	atrial flutter;control system;controllers;digraphs and trigraphs;flexible electronics;friction;pivot device component;printed circuit board;shock;simulation;span distance;systems design;tension;wow and flutter measurement	Motohiro Kawafuku;Masaru Mizoguchi;Makoto Iwasaki	2012	2012 12th IEEE International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control (AMC)	10.1109/AMC.2012.6197101	dynamics;simulation;control system;friction;control theory;flexible electronics;torque;rolling resistance;force;quantum mechanics;rolling;systems design	Robotics	74.26900637968953	-17.96539464055437	54456

This paper focuses on the research of the main shaft device of 2JTP-1.2×0.8 single rope winding hoist and offers transient dynamic analysis when the hoist is under normal operation condition or container jamming accident. Under the normal operation condition, the maximum equivalent stress of roller can be up to 170MPa. The position of the maximum stress is close to the midst of fixed roller shell. The maximum equivalent stress of the main shaft can reach 40MPa, which is at the joint between the main shaft and the two inner side support wheels. When container jamming accident occurs, the equivalent stresses of both roller and main shaft are increasing and after container jamming ends, the equivalent stress restores to its normal value. In this process, the maximum equivalent stress of roller is increased to 129MPa and that of main shaft reaches 174MPa at the moment of wire rope broken.	javascript syntax	Fang Ren;Chunyu Zou;Zhaojian Yang	2018		10.1109/URAI.2018.8441874	jamming;hoist (device);wire rope;control theory;physics;rope	Logic	80.60534306211684	-17.058161052766216	55497

Meanwhile, it is vital that such hands be highly functional, light weight, provide ease of attachment and control for people and have minimum wear and tear. But their cost generally makes them unaffordable to a larger section of people. Hence, this paper focuses on the design of hand, that is cost-effective yet imparts maximum functionality by using simple actuation and using proximity sensors on fingers; replacing generally used Electromyography (EMG) sensors for user controlled grabbing.

Phenomena taking place inside measuring transducers are typically considered applying Type B evaluation. It is evidenced in this work, that transducers included in a closed-loop control system should be treated in a different way because their uncertainty sources propagate through the dynamic system and change their limits of variabilities. Depending on frequencies, the limits may be either similar or lower or even higher. An especially dangerous case takes place when the variability at the output of the plant is greater than at the output of the transducer. In this work, such cases are presented and discussed.	control system;control theory;dynamical system;heart rate variability;propagation of uncertainty;software propagation;transducer	Józef Wiora;Alicja Wiora	2018	2018 23rd International Conference on Methods & Models in Automation & Robotics (MMAR)	10.1109/MMAR.2018.8486028	measured quantity;control engineering;computer science;control theory;measurement uncertainty;noise measurement;propagation of uncertainty;control system;transducer	Robotics	72.68674638380067	-12.09070446043789	56197

While the tracking control accuracy of the piezoelectric actuator is limited due to their inherent hysteretic nonlinearity. This paper describes a mathematical model which could compensate the hysteresis of piezoelectric actuator based on an inverse control in open-loop operation. The basis of the inverse control is formed by a hysteresis mathematical model, which can describe precisely phenomena. The mathematical modeling framework could precisely predict a hysteresis path for arbitrarily assigned input profiles. The new hysteretic model makes use of polar coordinate which has the advantage that the proposed model simplifies the identification procedure of its inverse model. The model can accurately predict the response of hysteretic nonlinearity in piezoelectric ceramic actuators; utilizing a piezoelectric-driven actuator, it is experimentally demonstrated that if the memory units is sufficiently recorded, model response in the prediction of a hysteresis track is significantly improved.	displacement mapping;experiment;gnu nano;hysteresis;mathematical model;nonlinear system;piezoelectricity	Xihua Wang;Changhai Ru;Shuxiang Guo;Wei Wang	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913012	control engineering;open-loop controller;ceramic;electronic engineering;polar coordinate system;hysteresis;inverse problem;mathematical model;control theory;predictive modelling;actuator	Robotics	71.75165059053683	-14.045048555422389	56324
eefa3198d01f7504c753f5463be67d10d82fa2b5	evaluating performance of multivariable vibration isolators: a frequency domain identification approach applied to an industrial avis		Vibration isolation is essential for industrial high-precision systems in suppressing the influence of external disturbances. The aim of this paper is to develop an identification method to estimate the transmissibility matrix for such systems. The transmissibility matrix is a key performance indicator in vibration isolation, but its identification is severely limited by the heavy weight and size of many industrial systems. Two non-parametric system identification methods based on periodic and spectral analysis are compared. It is shown that spectral analysis can benefit from random floor excitations at low frequencies and periodic shaker excitations at high frequencies. Using this method, a transmissibility matrix between 1 and 100 Hz is successfully measured on an industrial active vibration isolation system (AVIS), demonstrating that the proposed method is suitable for identification of these heavy-weight systems.	excite;frequency band;frequency response;opto-isolator;spectral density estimation;spectral leakage;spectrum analyzer;system identification;transmissibility (structural dynamics)	Michiel A.

The model of a weigh feeder cannot be obtained accurately because its dynamic characteristics are time varying and its high frequency vibration modes are not easily identified. In this paper, a weigh feeder is assumed to be a first-order plus integrator system, and a control law consists of a constant feed-forward control input and a feedback loop to obtain a simple control method. The objective of this study is to design a control law to be actually employed in industry. To this end, a control law is designed using proportional gain for control error and steady-state control input. However, the proportional gain must be finely tuned. Hence, it is tuned using a discrete-time extremum-seeking method. In the proposed method, the proportional gain is tuned using an iterative feedback tuning. Therefore, the proposed method has the advantage that the control performance is not deteriorated due to gain fluctuation because the proportional gain is not changed in an experiment. As a result, the proposed control law has a simple structure and its control parameters can be intuitively understood. Consequently, the proposed design method can be easily adopted in industry. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.	control system;feed forward (control);feedback;first-order predicate;iterative method;maxima and minima;numerical method;optimal control;steady state;universal conductance fluctuations	Takao Sato;Nozomu Araki;Yasuo Konishi;Hiroyuki Ishigaki	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	10.1109/CCA.2010.5611106	control engineering;real-time computing;adaptive control;engineering;control theory	Robotics	69.30781402010618	-10.828739579386703	56496

Because all motion screws and constraints screws form a 6-order spatial screw system, given a system of wrenches of 3-order constraints, the corresponding 3-order motion screws are left. According to this idea, we assume the 3-order constraints are orthogonal, so wherever the platform gone, the order of constraints system will never be decreased. Thus, the singularities are avoided successfully. All feasible limbs that can be used for construction of translation platform avoided singularities are enumerated according to the type of constraints and the number of joints making up the limbs. Further, geometrical conditions for parallel manipulators to possess finite translation motion avoided platform singularities are presented. Several novel mechanisms that satisfy design requirements are sketched as examples.	constraint (mathematics);parallel manipulator;requirement	Guo Sheng;FangYue Fa	2004	ICARCV 2004 8th Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision Conference, 2004.	10.1109/ICARCV.2004.1468832	structural engineering;parallel manipulator;computer science;engineering;control theory;engineering drawing;satisfiability	Robotics	69.56957021115299	-20.990677435705948	56838

In this paper, we provide a survey of the model-mediated teleoperation (MMT) approach, which has been developed to guarantee both system stability and transparency in the presence of arbitrary communication delays. This survey focuses on two major parts: 1) the historical development of the MMT approach from the late 1980s to the present and 2) the main challenges facing the design of a reliable MMT system. Along with the discussion of the MMT challenges and the proposed solutions, a series of experiments has been conducted to compare the performance between the existing techniques and to supply data that were missing in the previous studies on the MMT approach.	bilateral sound;experiment;haptic technology;mpeg media transport;user experience	Xiao Xu;Burak Cizmeci;Clemens Schuwerk;Eckehard G.

This paper aims to present a modeling approach for air-fuel ratio following the physical process in multi-cylinder port-injection engines. A linear periodic time-varying model is proposed with single input and single output. The model input is the fuel-injection command which is for an individual cylinder at its corresponding bottom dead center (BDC), and the model output is the sensed fuel-air ratio in the exhaust manifold. Lastly, the effectiveness of the presented model is validated by experiments. Experimental results show that the model output is close to the sensed fuel-air ratio.	binary delta compression;cylinder seal;experiment;flexible-fuel vehicle	Yinhua Liu;Tielong Shen	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)	10.1109/CoASE.2012.6386489	control engineering;internal combustion engine;simulation;exhaust gas recirculation;back-fire;hydrogen fuel enhancement;engineering;secondary air injection;automotive engineering;brake specific fuel consumption;vapor lock;engine knocking;cylinder head;water injection	Robotics	72.87671599150644	-10.822913362089125	57881
9c5ac7ea2651cf99bf02aafe4ab268a343c6e65d	modeling and analysis of micro-spacecraft attitude sensing with gyrowheel	micro spacecraft angular rate sensing;gyrowheel;real time lyapunov linearization;complex quantity;static measurement;dynamic measurement	This paper proposes two kinds of approaches of angular rate sensing for micro-spacecraft with a gyrowheel (GW), which can combine attitude sensing with attitude control into one single device to achieve a compact micro-spacecraft design. In this implementation, during the three-dimensional attitude control torques being produced, two-dimensional spacecraft angular rates can be sensed from the signals of the GW sensors, such as the currents of the torque coils, the tilt angles of the rotor, the motor rotation, etc. This paper focuses on the problems of the angular rate sensing with the GW at large tilt angles of the rotor. For this purpose, a novel real-time linearization approach based on Lyapunov's linearization theory is proposed, and a GW linearized measurement model at arbitrary tilt angles of the rotor is derived. Furthermore, by representing the two-dimensional rotor tilt angles and tilt control torques as complex quantities and separating the twice periodic terms about the motor spin speed, the linearized measurement model at smaller tilt angles of the rotor is given and simplified. According to the respective characteristics, the application schemes of the two measurement models are analyzed from the engineering perspective. Finally, the simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.	actuator device component;angularjs;calibration;gw-basic;gyro;lyapunov fractal;multiplexing;name;prototype;quantity;r.o.t.o.r.;real-time clock;simulation;small;spacecraft design;time-sharing;sensor (device)	Xiaokun Liu;Hui Zhao;Yu Yao;Fenghua He	2016		10.3390/s16081321	control engineering;control moment gyroscope;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	72.90227451169999	-15.045450706484534	58116

The robot consists of two radially deployable compliant ring actuators that are attached to each other along the longitudinal axis of the pipe by a bidirectional linear actuator. The robot imitates the motion of an inchworm. The novel aspect of the compliant ring actuator is a spring-steel compliant mechanism that converts circumferential motion to radial motion of its multiple gripping pads. Circumferential motion to ring actuators is provided by two shape memory alloy (SMA) wires that are guided by insulating rollers. The design of the compliant mechanism is derived from a radially deployable mechanism. A unique feature of the design is that the compliant mechanism provides the necessary kinematic function within the limited annular space around the pipe and serves as the bias spring for the SMA wires. The robot has a control circuit that sequentially activates the SMA wires and the linear actuator; it also controls the crawling speed. The robot has been fabricated, tested, and automated. Its crawling speed is about 45 mm/min, and the weight is about 150 g. It fits within an annular space of a radial span of 15 mm to crawl on a pipe of 60-mm outer diameter.	fits;multistage interconnection networks;optic axis of a crystal;radial (radio);robot;sma*;semiconductor device fabrication;software prototyping	Puneet Singh;G.

In the process of suspension design, ride comfort and handing stability are two conflicting considerations. MR fluid dampers are a new class of devices that more suitable for the requirements of automotive applications, including having very low power requirements. According to different driving conditions and body posture, semi-active suspension based on MR damper can coordinate the body posture angle, and reduce the vibration from suspension pass to vehicle body. This paper deals with theoretical analysis and experiments of MR fluid damper in semi-active suspension system. For the purpose of developing semi-active controller, a detailed vehicle Virtual Prototyping model with steering, frame and semi-active suspensions systems was established by vehicle dynamics simulation software SIMPACK. The co-simulation of ride comfort and handing stability showed that the semi-active suspension designed in this paper was suitable for improving the ride and handing performance simultaneously.	artificial neural network;chassis;co-simulation;control system;experiment;giant magnetoresistance;hysteresis;matlab;network interface controller;phenomenological model;poor posture;requirement;semi-thue system;semiconductor industry;simulation software	Long-ming Gui;Wenku Shi;Wei Liu	2012	2012 9th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/FSKD.2012.6234078	vehicle dynamics;simulation;simulation software;steering;computer science;human factors and ergonomics;vibration control;shock absorber;mathematical model;magnetorheological fluid;artificial neural network	Robotics	73.36757344148614	-18.134367054769825	58791

A differential rotational actuator based on shape memory alloy (SMA) was proposed, which reduced the system's weight and hence improved its portability. The 3D printer was used to produce the exoskeleton structure. Finally, through a series of experiments, feasibility and reliability of the hand exoskeleton system were demonstrated.	3d printing;control system;electromyography;experiment;federal enterprise architecture;feedback;finite element method;linkage (software);mathematical optimization;printer (computing);prototype;sensor;static program analysis	Te Tang;Dingguo Zhang;Tao Xie;Xiangyang Zhu	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2013.6739553	structural engineering;control engineering;gear;engineering;finite element method;coupling;engineering drawing	Robotics	72.52232069033701	-22.49810201384267	59555

To do this, we consider monotonic PI (MPI) control, which is a nonlinear extension of linear proportional-integral (PI) control. The advantage of MPI control is the fact that the normal force of the gripper is prohibited from decreasing during the transition from predominantly proportional control to predominantly integral control as occurs in the case of linear PI control. The performance of the MPI control is compared to linear PI control for a range of controller parameters, and the tradeoff between the maximum normal force and the total slip distance is efficiently captured by Pareto-front analysis. The robustness of MPI is assessed by considering uncertainty in the body mass and friction parameters, as well as the effect of measurement noise and actuator dynamics.	human body weight;non-monotonic logic;nonlinear system;optimal control;pareto efficiency;robot end effector;zero suppression	Anna Prach;John-John Cabibihan;Nitish V.

6320e2f814184d7f98b1bd3d52952a375fc2e365	passivity-based learning control for torque and cadence tracking in functional electrical stimulation (fes) induced cycling		This paper examines torque tracking accomplished by the activation of lower-limb muscles via Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) and cadence regulation by an electric motor. Challenges arise from the fact that skeletal muscles evoke torque via FES in a time-varying, nonlinear, and delayed manner. A desired torque trajectory is constructed based on the crank position and determined by the knee joint torque transfer ratio (i.e., kinematic efficiency of the knee), which varies as a periodic function of the crank angle. To cope with this periodicity, a repetitive learning controller is developed to track the desired periodic torque trajectory by stimulating the muscle groups. Concurrently, a sliding-mode controller is designed for the electric motor to maintain cadence tracking throughout the entire crank cycle. A passivity-based analysis is developed to ensure stability of the torque and cadence closed-loop systems.	computer recycling;crank (person);electrical engineering;feedforward neural network;functional electrical stimulation;nonlinear system;quasiperiodicity;shin megami tensei: persona 3	Victor H.

A 2-FOF nonlinear steering model for the flexible chassis is established based on the “magic formula” tire model and the Ackermann steering theorem at low speed. Also, a new control method based on the fuzzy strategy is proposed for its sideslip angle control. The left front-wheel steering angle is inputted into the simulation of the vehicle, and the left-rear wheel angle is controlled by the fuzzy controller to make the sideslip angle zero. Also, the remaining steering angle of the other two wheels, which meet the Ackermann theorem, are adjusted. Comparisons between simulations of the front-wheel steering, four-wheel, proportional steering and the newly proposed steering indicate that the new control algorithm in this paper is effective.	ackermann function;algorithm;chassis;control theory;correctness (computer science);fuzzy control system;linear model;matlab;nonlinear system;simulation;wheels;yaws	Shujie Song;Jiwei Qu;Yining Li;Wei Zhou;Kangquan Guo	2016	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/JIFS-169178	steering linkage;torque steering;control theory	Robotics	68.94680562639827	-16.979247256304994	60359

We present efficient recursive algorithms to compute the derivatives of the spline joint, as well as geometric algorithms to determine optimal parameters in order to achieve the desired joint motion.

A high performance spring component with wire actuation is employed for two-degree of freedom (DOF) bending joint, and two-DOF tendon drive system is implemented by four pneumatic cylinders. Using a continuum model for the kinematics, a PD controller with static and dynamic compensation is designed for the position control, which shows a good performance at the sufficient working frequency for surgical operations. The forceps manipulator can estimate external forces using a disturbance observer. A link approximation model is introduced to design the observer as the first intuitive approach. The force estimation can be achieved with an accuracy of 0.2 N in the basic straight posture.	approximation;buckling;internet backbone;nickel titanium;performance;poor posture;prototype;triune continuum paradigm	Daisuke Haraguchi;Kotaro Tadano;Kenji Kawashima	2011	2011 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2011.6094603	control engineering;estimation;simulation;pneumatic actuator;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;haptic technology;force;statistics	Robotics	71.48723382648528	-22.39358497003325	60755
e2283c03907038db5319a683408cc42b0ab5facb	sensorless position control of spmlsm based on high-gain observer	initial position;high gain observer;surface permanent magnet linear synchronous motor;sensorless position control	This paper presents a novel sensorless position control for a surface permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (SPMLSM). The position and speed of the SPMLSM drive is obtained through a closed loop observer by only measuring phase voltages and currents. Estimation of speed is done using difference between estimates of the current derivatives in the dq frame, which calculated two different ways: one using a high-gain observer, another using the motor model. Estimation of the mover position is done through integrating the estimation of speed. In addition, an initial position of the SPMLSM is the key to starting smoothly, therefore, an estimation method of initial position for the SPMLSM is also developed in this work. The principle of the estimation is based on low frequency voltage injection. The amplitude and phase of the voltage is controllable. When a rotating voltage vector is injected to the motor at standstill, there is a microinching when the voltage phase is line to the direct axis of the motor. Then the current will decrease due to the back electromotive force. The initial mover position is identified by this change. Sensorless control of a SPMLSM based on the proposed strategy has been investigated by comprehensive computer simulation. The experimental testing results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

54cd8a6c15e31a84f48d25208312cbec91fdf579	topology optimization of frequency dependent viscoelastic structures via a level-set method		Viscoelastic materials follow a liquid-like elastic behavior whose characteristics depend on the ex-citation frequency. Nowadays, these type of materials represent a high interest for vibration damping treatments in the automotive and aeronautic industries, for instance. This work is devoted to the application of the level-set method for topology optimization of viscoelastic structures. We look for the best distribution of viscoelastic material within a reference domain for the design of purely vis-coelastic 3D damping structures and 2D viscoelastic damping treatments. In both cases one desires to maximize the structure capacity to dissipate energy measured here by the modal loss factor of the first vibration mode.		G. Delgado;M.

The micro operator with 6 degrees of freedom is the most accurate part of the system. The micro operator is driven by 6 piezoelectric actuators. Because of the non-linear hysteretic restoring force, the accuracy of the micro operator couldn't get a very high level. Before compensation of the non-linear hysteretic restoring force, to describe the micro operator with a mathematic model is very important. In the paper, the authors build the micro operator's model with Bouc-Wen model. Then with a genetic algorithm the parameters in the mathematic model were identified. At last by experiments the identified parameters were tested and verified.	experiment;genetic algorithm;high-level programming language;hysteresis;nonlinear system;operating system;piezoelectricity;television	Nan Xiao;Shuxiang Guo	2010	2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2010.5648850	control engineering;genetic algorithm;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;mechanical engineering	Robotics	72.83673105360657	-20.273155245421023	61011

The main idea is to use position controllers for both the excavator and the operating device where both control loops output the reference position to the other, i.e., two position controlled systems are placed in a feedback loop with each other. The human operator acts as an input disturbance to the operating device. This approach allows intuitive operation of the machine and gives the operator haptic feedback of the boom position.Internal model control (IMC) is employed to design the position controllers for both the hydraulic manipulator and the operating device. To this end, a simplified design rule for the IMC filter and a novel anti-windup approach for models with pure integrators are proposed.The master-slave control methodology is exemplified on an 18 ton excavator; measurement results are given.	bandwidth (signal processing);control system;excavator (microarchitecture);experiment;feedback;haptic technology;memory controller;phantom reference;workspace	Henning Hayn;Dieter Schwarzmann	2009	2009 Second International Conferences on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions	10.1109/ACHI.2009.43	excavator;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;haptic technology	Robotics	69.39096562746941	-14.838321784400934	61061

This paper proposes a computational saving method to obtain a one-to-one correspondence magnetizing curve without the need for conventional curve-fitting strategies, which require the assumption of explicit analytical curve functions. A detailed comparison between the proposed method and the conventional curve-fitting method has been done. It shows great accuracy improvements of this proposed method. The identification is easy to implement with high precision while maintaining the motor at standstill. No additional sensor devices are needed except the sensors carried by the drive itself. This proposed method is verified by simulation. Further experimental results of this method are utilized in a real control strategy with a 2.2-kW 50-Hz 4-pole induction motor to confirm its validity and feasibility.	control theory;curve fitting;mathematical optimization;one-to-one (data model);sensor;simulation	Kai Wang;Wenxi Yao;Bin Chen;Guangtong Shen;Kevin Lee;Zhengyu Lu	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2014.2354012	control engineering;magnetic flux;electronic engineering;saturation;inductance;control theory;mathematics;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	73.48221532322442	-12.520381257985488	61145

1fe16f51e74180988f9ed1a9f0a03000bf839d8e	framework for online simulation of soft robots with optimization-based inverse model		Soft robotics is an emerging field of robotics which requires computer-aided tools to simulate soft robots and provide models for their control. Until now, no unified software framework covering the different aspects exists. In this paper, we present such a framework from its theoretical foundations up to its implementation on top of SOFA, an open-source framework for deformable online simulation. The framework relies on continuum mechanics for modeling the robotic parts and boundary conditions like actuators or contacts using a unified representation based on Lagrange multipliers. It enables the digital robot to be simulated in its environment using a direct model. The model can also be inverted online using an optimization-based method which allows to control the physical robots in the task space. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, we present various soft robots scenarios including ones where the robot is interacting with its environment.

This scheme works even for multi-loop closed link mechanisms. It is derived by using d'Alembert's principle and obtained without computing the Lagrange multipliers. To account for the constraints, only the Jacobian matrix of the function which represents the passive joint angles in terms of the actuated ones is required. Given a nonredundant actuator system, this allows a unique representation of the constraints, even for a complicated multi-loop closed link mechanism. The scheme is computationally efficient because the computation concerning the Lagrange multipliers is not required. A redundant actuator system is also formulated and utilization of redundancy in actuation is illustrated.	computation;computational complexity theory;jacobian matrix and determinant;lagrange multiplier;redundancy (engineering)	Yoshihiko Nakamura;Modjtaba Ghodoussi	1988		10.1109/ROBOT.1988.12256	jacobian matrix and determinant;robot;control engineering;dynamics;simulation;concurrent computing;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics;tree;redundancy;lagrange multiplier;mechanical system;microelectronics;actuator	Robotics	68.9065396743762	-21.04252455060603	61926

First, it is shown that the hysteretic jump phenomena exist in the rotating speed and the power consumption of the motor due to the whirling motion around the natural frequency. The jump of the rotating speed means that a continuous change of output power in a generator can not be achieved under mechanical resonance. The jump of the power consumption gives a large fluctuation to other rotating electric machines connected to the same power source. Second, we propose a torque-based control method that can suppress the whirling motion by controlling a torque. The control input is determined based on a stability condition for a time-varying system that is represented by a second-order vector differential equation with time-varying coefficient matrices. Stability of the system can be checked by the qualitative characteristics of its coefficient matrices. Finally, the effectiveness of our control method is discussed by both a simulation and an experiment.	coefficient;hysteresis;quantum fluctuation;resonance;simulation;torque	Kaoru Inoue;Shigeru Yamamoto;Toshimitsu Ushio;Takashi Hikihara	2003	IEEE Trans.

The following four factors must be considered when the bucket path is determined: bucket volume (soil capacity in a bucket), reachability (backhoe structure limitation), time efficiency, and soil property. Among them, the soil property is hardly quantified due to the complexity of its mechanical behavior. This paper deals with a neural network model to identify the soil property. Human operator usually determines soil type by sensing its hardness given a specific path and then plans a safe and workable path. The neural network model proposed in this paper outputs the soil type with the force and trajectory inputs. The feasibility of the proposed system is proved through the experiments with a robot equipped with a force sensor.	artificial neural network;excavator (microarchitecture);experiment;leaky bucket;network model;reachability;robot;true quantified boolean formula	Sanghak Lee;Daehie Hong;Hyungju Park;JangHo Bae	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems	10.1109/MFI.2008.4648015	structural engineering;control engineering;simulation;engineering	Robotics	76.4846892857875	-22.937571611406685	62046

The local and remote platform is coupled by delaying position, position-velocity and impedance reflection characteristics of the input interaction forces between human–master and slave–environment. An adaptation law is used locally to estimate uncertain impedance characteristics of the interaction forces between human and master and between slave and remote environment. The estimated parameter of the impedance characteristics of the interaction force between slave and remote environment are then transmitted with delay back to the master manipulator to adjust the parameter of the target impedance at the human operator hand. Adaptive control terms are also used locally to deal with the uncertainty associated with gravity loading of the master and slave manipulator. By choosing Lyapunov–Krasovskii-like functional, we establish the stability and transparency property of the closed loop teleoperator systems under both symmetrical and unsymmetrical time varying delays. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed design for real-time applications. 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.	bilateral filter;characteristic impedance;lyapunov fractal;real-time clock;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications network;telerobotics;velocity (software development)	Shafiqul Islam;Peter Xiaoping Liu;Abdulmotaleb El-Saddik	2014	Inf.

In wall-contacting driving, the vehicle may be damaged by the collision with convexity and concavity of the wall. In this research, a preliminary experiment highlights what kind of convexity and concavity greatly affect the vehicle. Based on those results, this paper proposes a convexity and concavity detection method using geometric feature extraction of wall roughness. To evaluate the performance of the method, experiments have been conducted by using a scale model. The experimental results clarify the feasibility of the detection and the collision avoidance of wall convexity and concavity using the proposed feature values extracted from the distance sensor data.	underground	Hiroyuki Karasawa;Takuro Okubo;Rui Fukui;Masayuki Nakao;Yuichi Kodama	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-50115-4_32	automotive engineering;transport engineering;marine engineering	Vision	77.53108585493143	-21.986260570120724	62303

A number of methods have heen proposed for designing a passive compliance mechanism with a prescribed spatial stifIness or compliance matrix using a parallel or serial connection of elastic devices. If the spatial stiffness or compliance matrix is isotropic, the constituent elastic devices are simple in the sense that they are strictly translational or rotational Nonisotropic stiffness and compliance matrice require the use of elastic screw devices that couple translation and rotation. These screw devices are of a more complicated nature than the simple elastic devices that are sutlicient for the isotropic case. In this article the authors demonstrate how these screw devices can be eliminated by using a hybrid connection of parallel and serial configurations consisting of only simple elastic devices. This method can be used to achieve any prescribed non-isotropic stiffness or compliance matrix.	stiffness matrix	Rodney G. Roberts;Theresa A.

In previous studies, it has shown that, the perturbation observer of sliding mode control with sliding perturbation observer (SMCSPO) can estimate the reaction force acting on the instrument tip. The perturbation is defined as the combination of the uncertainties and nonlinear terms where the major uncertainties arise from the reaction force. However in presence of external dynamics, the vertical instrument inside the body has some effects during operation. Therefore the reaction force estimated by SPO will be a combination of actual reaction force and external disturbances. It is necessary for the surgeon to measure the disturbance effects on the instrument during operation for the sake of safety. This paper studies about dynamic disturbances acting on the instrument using SMCSPO algorithm. A three DOF robot has formed with surgical instrument in RoboticsLab environment. Simulation has shown that SPO of SMCSPO can estimate the actual reaction force quite correctly when the surgical robot is fixed. However, it shows that SPO does not have satisfactory results when the instrument carrying robot's joint are free to move. It has seen that the estimated perturbation of each joint of robot has no relation with each other. Therefore measuring disturbances of the robot joints can be calculated using forward kinematics laws.	algorithm;dynamical system;forward kinematics;hyperlink;nonlinear system;pareto efficiency;robot;simulation	Nahian Rahman;Min-Cheol Lee	2013	2013 10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)	10.1109/URAI.2013.6677420	simulation	Robotics	70.9942706540009	-19.097198229273754	63523

This paper proposes a new technique to model the stator winding of the induction motor in Matlab Simulink® software. This simulation of the induction motor would have the thermal behavior of its stator winding; to study the induction motor temperature estimation using motor parameter-based method. The modified model is used to validate a remote and Sensorless stator winding temperature estimation technique; therefore a thermal protection is obtained for soft-starter-connected to induction motors. The soft-starter is used to inject a DC signal in the induction motor terminal voltage and current. The stator winding resistance/temperature is estimated from DC signal injection by changing the gate drive signals of the Thyristor in the soft starter. The level of the injected DC signal is adjusted by the value of the delay angle. The accuracy of stator winding temperature estimation increased with the increase of DC signal level; however the pulsation of the output torque increased also. The thermal behavior is simulated utilizing a thermal resistor block from the Matlab SimscapeTM software. It is used to replace the fixed resistor value of the induction motor model in the Matlab Simulink. The thermal monitoring scheme has been validated from the simulation results of a 7.5 kW induction motor under various loading conditions."""		T. A. Enany;W. I. Wahba;Mohamed A.

I have also argued that proper use of actuator redundancy can simultaneously increase the workspace, remove singularities, and dramatically improve overall kinematic, structural, and actuator performance, while keeping the complexity low. This paper discusses a prototype shoulder joint more appropriately described as a combinatorial mechanism which exhibits the features.

We explore this area by introducing a 2-degree of freedom (DoF) universal joint module actuated by three reverse Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (rPAMs) and an associated geometric Jacobian-enhanced iterative sliding mode controller. After demonstrating the effectiveness of this controller, we combine two of these modules to form a 4-DoF soft actuated manipulator. To control this modular manipulation system, we propose two controllers: a direct inverse kinematic (IK) controller and an end-effector geometric Jacobian controller. Though both controllers were validated to function effectively, the Jacobian controller was more precise (especially under payload) while the IK controller was more accurate.	inverse kinematics;iterative method;jacobian matrix and determinant;pneumatic artificial muscles;robot end effector	Erik H.

A magnetically driven micro tool (MMT), often embedded inside a microfluidic chip, can be driven by a magnet which can be positioned in micro order accuracy using linear motors. Position errors caused by friction between the micro tool and surface can be modeled. After calibration of the model parameters using encoder data from linear motors, and vision feedback, this model can be used as a controller.

It provides light weight, simple structure, high output force to weight ratio, low cost and so on. Despite of these advantages, there are also challenges in using a PAM actuator, such as the behavior of nonlinearity and high hysteresis. To get optimum design and usage, it is significant to find a good way to model the PAM. In this paper, an experiments based modeling method for pneumatic artificial muscle is proposed. This model is a polynomial model and the form of results is simple. At the same time, the parameters are easy to be obtained. Validation experiments are carried out in this paper. The experimental results show the feasibility and correctness of this method. Meanwhile, its simple structure is convenient for further design of PAM control system.	experiment;pneumatic artificial muscles	Jizhuang Fan;Jun Zhong;Leitao Jiao;Jie Zhao;Yulong Qiu;Wei Zhang	2013		10.1109/ROBIO.2013.6739572	control engineering;simulation;pneumatic actuator;engineering;control system;control theory	Robotics	71.90768259988617	-14.337652290221632	64834

The feeder can keep resonance frequency relatively stable under changing loading. Through the analysis on the working principle and magnetic spring stiffness characteristic of this feeder, the dynamic model was established and the relationship among system resonance frequency, loading and magnetic spring stiffness was obtained. The analysis showed that, as the loading changed, the magnetic spring stiffness changed accordingly, which maintained a trend of stability in the system resonance frequency. A prototype was made for the experiment, and the relationship among the loading, magnetic spring axial clearance and system resonance frequency was obtained. The result showed that, when the loading changes, the resonance frequency and feeding speed tended to be stable, which matched the theoretical analysis. Through comparison with a traditional vibration feeder, within nominal loading, this new feeder has more stable resonance frequency and feeding speed.	mathematical model;piezoelectricity;prototype;resonance;spring framework	Xiaochao Tian;Zhigang Yang;Yong Liu;Yanhu Shen;Song Chen	2014	Micromachines	10.3390/mi5030547	structural engineering;resonance;engineering;nuclear magnetic resonance;physics;mechanical engineering	Robotics	74.18058890237363	-18.37884163617351	64873

However, there exist many undesirable nonlinear problems in tendon-sheath transmission, such as hysteresis, dead zone, backlash, and direction-dependent behavior. Unlike most of the existing literature that focus on the analysis of single-tendon-sheath actuation, this paper proposes a general mathematical double-tendon-sheath transmission model suitable for arbitrary types of load conditions. Experimental setups composed of servo motors, tendon-sheath components, and robot joint are established to test the proposed models and gain insights into the transmission processes through sinusoidal input signal experiments. Based on the transmission models, two open-loop control strategies are developed for the friction and deformation compensation, requiring no feedback from the distal end. With the aim of obtaining the complete model parameters, an offline identification method able to calibrate the transmission model using the sensors mounted at the proximal end is developed. The performance of the proposed control methods is evaluated by torque/position-tracking experiments in different kinds of load conditions. Moreover, the frequency characteristics of the actuation system are analyzed, and the controlled bandwidth is about 10 Hz during operation.	existential quantification;experiment;hysteresis;nonlinear system;online and offline;robot;sensor;servo	Qingcong Wu;Xingsong Wang;Lin Chen;Fengpo Du	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2014.2360062	robot;control engineering;simulation;engineering;friction;mathematical model;control theory;torque;force;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	72.07424089195543	-19.42075935246745	65146

The two are materially different and obey different composition rules. In particular, spatial accelerations behave like true vectors, and conventional accelerations do not. This paper shows that the conventional acceleration of a rigid body is its apparent spatial acceleration in a moving coordinate system. This implies that both vectors describe the same physical phenomenon but in different coordinate systems. It also implies that rigid-body acceleration really is a vector. The paper concludes with some examples showing how 6-D accelerations are used.

Various improvements on the cutting performance can be achieved by using these measurements. The present study explains the design and construction of a cutting force sensor, as well as the implementation of a fuzzy logic controller to obtain a complete system to monitor and control the cutting forces in rough turning operations. The force sensor uses four strain gauges attached on the sides of the tool holder to estimate the cutting forces. The force controller is designed to smoothly adjust the feed rate because a fast change in the feed rate could damage the cutting tool. The maximum cutting force needs to be input manually in this approach, because it will be the reference variable for the fuzzy controller. The maximum force is selected by the operator based on tool conditions, tool temperature, machining conditions, workpiece material, tool material, etc. A balance between the speed required to achieve the reference force and the smooth feed rate change is considered. The simulation results obtained by controlling the cutting force along with the associated machining time improvements are presented in this paper.	canned response;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;industry 4.0;maximum force;real-time clock;simulation;smoothing	Jorge Cubas;Josuet Leoro;Daniel Alberto Reyes Uquillas;Syh-Shiuh Yeh	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2016.7576764	control engineering;machining;engineering;engineering drawing;manufacturing engineering	Robotics	76.76381313857108	-15.217492860378243	65663

Among vector-control drives, indirect rotor-flux-oriented control (IRFOC) type is one of the most popular and tested options. However, it is still a challenging field since several aspects can be improved, such as the low-speed behavior, parameter detuning, and current control. The present scheme includes temperature estimation to correct the deviation in steady state, a new control scheme with skin-effect estimation to improve the transient accuracy, and overcurrent protection to be able to control the stator currents while allowing a good performance. The parameter estimation is carried out using lumped-parameter models, the control scheme is modified and is able to account for static friction, and the overcurrent protection improves the performance allowing transient currents over the rated value. The validity and usefulness of the proposed scheme is experimentally tested on a TMS320C31 digital signal processor (DSP) from the Simulink/Matlab environment.	digital signal processor;estimation theory;experiment;matlab;r.o.t.o.r.;sensor;signal processing;simulink;steady state	Mario J.

021d7f4854b976feb3a44f47736d6d28b8ca84ce	design of virtual stiffness for human operated robot considering external force in safety enhancement		Precise force control and position control is essential for many robotic applications. During unilateral or bilateral object handling remote applications, human operators apply excess forces on the actuators with the intention of better grip and it is possible to damage the handled objects. This paper proposes position control and force control techniques when human applies excess force. The controllers consist of predefined force and equilibrium position which are correspond to remote environmental object safety. The operator applied excess force is modeled as a spring force through a virtual stiffness model. The paper introduces proportional derivative position control loop to conventional virtual stiffness controller. The force control loop and the position control loop references are combined in the common dimension of acceleration to produce current reference to the actuator. The sensorless sensing techniques of disturbance observer and reaction force observer are utilized to disturbance suppression and external force estimation. In the force controller, estimated reaction force is reduced to desired value by introducing virtual force loop between reaction force observer output and reaction force feedback input. The position control is achieved by introducing a scaling factor to reaction force feedback path. The switching between force control and position control is possible with scaling factor value. The performances of proposed methods are compared with conventional method and validity of the proposed methods is verified by simulations and experiments.	actuator device component;bibliographic reference;bilateral filter;control system;controllers;experiment;handling (psychology);haptic technology;image scaling;kind of quantity - equilibrium;offset binary;performance;physical object;robot;simulation;stiffness;test scaling;zero suppression	R.

The advantage of these actuators is the low power input requirements and the high output force they produce. An analytical study is performed to examine the effectiveness of this type of actuators in suppressing the vibrations of a passenger car suspension system. A half-car model including passenger dynamics subjected to road disturbance is used. Two MR dampers attached to the front and back tires are used as actuators; An optimal control scheme is used to control the overall suspension system such that the vibrations of the passenger seats as well as the chassis of the car are greatly reduced or eliminated. The simulation results show that properly controlled MR dampers are effective means for vibration suppression for passenger cars.	chassis;optimal control;requirement;semiconductor industry;simulation;zero suppression	Mansour A.

To this end, two contributions are presented: i) A stable force feedback controller that can cope with inherent PAM nonlinearities is synthesized using the dissipativity theory, for each PAM unit. ii) On top of this force feedback controller, a mathematical formulation is developed to compute reference force inputs that correspond to desired joint torque and joint stiffness inputs, concerning both agonist and antagonist PAMs. This strategy enables us to introduce real-time sensory feedback; torque and stiffness control is addressed by means of PAM force feedback control with guaranteed stability. To validate the proposed control scheme, a series of experiments were conducted on an experimental setup. As the result, the controller exhibited favorable torque and stiffness tracking in real-time, demonstrating that it could meet the performance criteria to power exoskeleton systems.	control theory;experiment;feedback;haptic technology;pneumatic artificial muscles;positive systems;real-time clock;stiffness;torque	Barkan Ugurlu;Paolo Forni;Corinne Doppmann;Jun Morimoto	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7353586	control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;torque;haptic technology;force;servomotor;actuator	Robotics	68.84119165300311	-18.576018941344206	66716

The manipulator is considered, hereby, as a set of six degree-of-freedom manipulators. It is proven that two types of singularities in motion can occur at link positions that are independent and dependent with respect to the trajectory to be executed. The relations between the structure of singularity equations and displacement equations are discussed. The derivation of displacement equations for a manipulator with singularities of the second type is based on the idea of modeling of a manipulator by two open kinematic chains and invariants that may be found for these chains. The inverse kinematic equations and the equations of singularities in motion have been derived using a symbolic computer program which can handle manipulators of general structure (with five, six, and seven degrees-of-freedom). This program is written in the Symbolic Computation Language REDUCE.	displacement mapping	Faydor L. Litvin;V. Parenti Castelli;M. A. Shaheen	1987	J.

A sphere is considered here as a manipulated object. The control law is designed based on integration of voluntary movement and reflex considering the system’s redundancy. The voluntary task of holding the object safely is realized via multi-point impedance control at the four contact points with the object using the contact force information from the sensitive skin. A reflex is introduced as a regulation problem of the direction between the points of end-effectors and elbows to determine the robot system’s posture uniquely and to adapt to external disturbances. The solution of the redundant control is formulated and derived from the optimization point of view for different cases of the output function’s dimensions. Further, desired functions for voluntary movement and reflex are adjusted according to the task situations. The validity of the proposed method is investigated by numerical simulations.	british informatics olympiad;care-of address;characteristic impedance;computer simulation;mathematical optimization;nl (complexity);numerical analysis;optimal control;optimization problem;point of view (computer hardware company);poor posture;robot;sensor;warren abstract machine	Fumihiko Asano;Zhiwei Luo;Masaki Yamakita;Shigeyuki Hosoe	2005	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/156855305774307013	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory;redundancy	Robotics	68.69806826481457	-22.565964725016208	66934

The paper mainly focuses on the development of the cancellation algorithm that brings the user back in the physical workspace of the locomotion interface, and thus generates the feeling of the infinite virtual environment. First, the paper summarizes the kinematics and the dynamics of the locomotion interface, the strategy implemented to lower the apparent inertia of the end-effector and to deal with the swing phase of the gait. Then, the cancellation algorithm that renders the infinite motion within the finite workspace is introduced. Finally, preliminary experiments demonstrate the use of the mechanism to render the described virtual environment, namely level floor, ascending and descending stairs.	algorithm;characteristic impedance;experiment;high impedance;motion planning;rendering (computer graphics);robot end effector;velocity (software development);virtual reality;workspace	Dinh-Son Vu;József Kövecses;Clément Gosselin	2017	2017 IEEE World Haptics Conference (WHC)	10.1109/WHC.2017.7989899	rendering (computer graphics);computer science;control engineering;computer vision;artificial intelligence;stair climbing;gait;motion planning;kinematics;trajectory;virtual machine;stairs	Robotics	73.4163097120269	-23.46310879491794	67397

This raises the question as to whether it is possible to model the response of a subset of sensors based on the response of the remaining sensors without knowledge of the driving input. To address this issue, we develop time-domain sensor-to-sensor models that account for nonzero initial conditions. The sensor-to-sensor model is in the form of a transmissibility operator that is a rational function of the differentiation operator. The development is carried out for both SISO and MIMO transmissibility operators. These time-domain sensor-to-sensor models can be used for diagnostics and output prediction. The traditional concept of input–output modeling distinguishes between inputs that evoke response and outputs that capture the response. In some applications, multiple measurements are available , but the driving inputs that give rise to those outputs may be unknown. This raises the question as to whether it is possible to model the response of a subset of sensors based on the response of the remaining sensors without knowledge of the driving input. Models of this type, which are called transmissibil-ities, are widely used in structural modeling and health monitor-In structural vibration analysis, a transmissibility is a relation between a pair of sensor measurements of the same type, for example, displacements , accelerations, or forces (Da Silva, 2007). While the transmissibility literature is extensive, a common feature is that transmissibilities are modeled in the frequency domain. A transmissibility is not a transfer function in the usual sense, however, since neither sensor captures the input driving the system except in the special case that one of the sensors measures ✩ the driving input. Consequently, a transmissibility does not have a state space realization with physically meaningful states. The goal of the present paper is to develop sensor-to-sensor models that account for nonzero initial conditions and thus are necessarily defined in the time domain. These models, which we call transmissibility operators, are rational functions of the differentiation operator. Accordingly, a transmissibility operator defines a differential equation involving the sensor signals. The internal state of the underlying input–output system loses its meaning within the context of a transmissibility operator. What is essential in defining the transmissibility operator, however, is that it must be independent of both the initial condition and inputs of the underlying system, which is assumed to be time-invariant.

Finite Element (FE) dynamic models may be good candidates apart from the fact that the accuracy of these models is often too limited, since it is almost impossible to fully match with the real structure. Using a FE model updating algorithm the accuracy of a FE model can be significantly improved. In this paper, a Frequency Response Sensitivity (FRS) model updating algorithm is developed that updates the eigenvalues of the stiffness and damping matrix (so-called generic parameters) to update and increase the accuracy of the FE dynamic model. The algorithm is applied on a 2D pinned-sliding beam system.	algorithm;dynamical system;frequency response;mathematical model;peer-to-peer;sensor	M. Dorosti;F. J. M. Heck;Rob H. B.

If adequate sensors were available for pressure measurement in each cylinder, the indicated torque estimation would be easier. Those sensors, however, cannot be utilized generally from cost and installation space viewpoints. Hence, this paper considers an indicated torque estimation method utilizing only the crank-shaft angle information, which can be obtained even for commercial cars, instead of pressure sensors. The use of the crankshaft angle causes a problem that an unexpected vibration contaminating the angle information deteriorates the torque estimation accuracy because vibration frequency is relatively close to the combustion cycle. Thus, the engine torque estimation can be formulated as an observer design under model uncertainty and nonlinearity. In addition, this observer design problem is classified into an unknown input observer design because the engine torque or the combustion pressure as input to the engine system cannot be measured directly. To solve the design problem, this paper proposes the introduction of a nonlinear two-inertia model to catch the unexpected vibration, and an UKF-based I-type disturbance observer to estimate the indicated torque and the system state. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through experiments.	crank (person);cylinder seal;experiment;kalman filter;newton's method;nonlinear system;performance evaluation;sensor;torque	Yuzuru Itoh;Kouji Higashi;Masami Iwase	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6425865	kalman filter;control engineering;damping torque;torque sensor;pressure measurement;engineering;vibration control;automotive engineering;control theory;direct torque control	Robotics	72.63060431197118	-13.784695120265768	69022

15c12a262fdfcf4250353b2e966702ce481c5a54	line-start pm-assisted synchronous motor design, optimization, and tests		Line-start synchronous motors (LSSMs) have been recently introduced in the motor market to meet the new efficiency class requirements. They exhibit high efficiency and power factor compared with induction motors (IMs), but the complex design, manufacture, and high cost due to presence of permanent magnets (PM) limit their widespread use. This paper proposes a new approach for the design of LSSMs, in which an important torque contribution is given by the reluctance torque component. Both steady-state and dynamic capabilities are considered. A stochastic optimization is used to determine the parameters that maximize the synchronous torque. The possibility to apply the recent improvements on the synchronous reluctance machine design to LSSMs is discussed. Experimental measurements are carried out on an LSSM prototype achieved from the optimization. The results are compared with the predictions. Two different PM volumes are tested in the same rotor structure, evaluating their impact on motor performance. From the experimental tests, an overview comparison between the IM and LSSM performance is given.	mathematical induction;mathematical optimization;prototype;r.o.t.o.r.;requirement;steady state;stochastic optimization	Damiano Mingardi;Nicola Bianchi	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2711557	ac motor;control theory;control engineering;synchronous motor;engineering;direct torque control;reluctance motor;switched reluctance motor;induction motor;electric motor;motor soft starter	Robotics	75.73904861734336	-17.95559719723887	69484

The measurement of spring force, either via load cells or via position sensors, conventionally requires additional sensor hardware to be part of or parallel to the kinematic chain. In order to simplify measurement of spring deflection, we exploit the fact that helical spring are in fact solenoid coils, and as such exhibit inductance properties that change strongly with length. We investigate theoretical models for this effect, and we experimentally evaluate the accuracy of such models in predicting spring length from inductance, with and without additional calibrating measurements. Our preliminary results show that a sensing precision as low as 2% can be achieved, indicating that the principle could be suitable for force sensing of compliant actuators.	experiment;kinematic chain;robot;sensor;tesla coil	Joost van der Weijde;Erik Vlasblom;Peter Dobbe;Heike Vallery;Michael Fritschi	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7353745	control engineering;electronic engineering;inductance;engineering;electrical engineering;mathematical model;electromagnetic coil	Robotics	72.94568857064803	-21.831326752707152	69744

We have previously proposed a buoyancy control mechanism using a syringe and a piston inspired by this hypothesis. Since that system had problems, we built a new buoyancy control device with a mechanism that utilizes the elasticity of rubber to handle the volume change. In the new device, peltier elements and a nichrome wire were installed to heat and cool the paraffin wax and induce volume change. We conducted experiments to assess the buoyancy change and confirmed that the device works well. Then, we built a prototype of an underwater vehicle with four of the devices and confirmed that this robot benefited from 1.3-times higher buoyancy change per unit mass of paraffin wax than with the previous mechanism.

The ideal workspace is described as a set of inequalities representing a 3D volume that encloses valid attitudes, whose frontier can be plotted as a 3D surface by using Constructive Solid Geometry and an adaptive polygonization method. The real workspace represents a subset of the ideal one, determined by the presence of joint limits at the spherical joints. These ones arise from the fact that these spherical joints are not ideal, but implemented as spherical plain bearings. However, although it is not straight forward to express these joint limits in an analytical way, it was possible to find an analytical expression to describe the real workspace, represented by additional inequalities that must be met by a desired attitude of the platform.	computation;computer graphics;computer vision;constructive solid geometry;parallel manipulator;robot;sampling (signal processing);social inequality;workspace	Rafael Cisneros Limón;José Luis Vázquez-González;Jose Rafael Mendoza Vazquez	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7353817	parallel manipulator;simulation;solid;mathematics;geometry;engineering drawing	Robotics	70.55520377165182	-20.843760712548974	70170
81f121b16b1ba78f38bcd9df1816d6cd4eda0771	efficiency of a cvt-operated evt experimentally evaluated against half-toroidal and push-belt cvts		This paper describes how an electrical variable transmission (EVT) can be used as an alternative for mechanical continuously variable transmission (CVT) systems. An EVT is an electromagnetic power split device having two mechanical and two electrical ports. The speed ratio between both mechanical ports (rotors) can be varied in a continuously variable way, so that this machine can be used as an electromagnetic alternative for the mechanical push-belt and half-toroidal CVT. Its operating principle is based on splitting the power into an electromagnetic direct path and an electrical path involving two inverters connected back to back. Its potential use as a CVT is investigated by comparing experimental data against toroidal and belt CVT data from literature having comparable power ratings. To this end, measurements are performed on a prototype  $\text{120-kW}$ permanent magnet EVT.	belt machine;experiment;extreme value theory;inverter (logic gate);prototype;toroidal graph	Joachim Druant;Hendrik Vansompel;Frederik De Belie;Peter Sergeant	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2756589	engineering;electromagnetic coil;experimental data;control engineering;gear ratio;continuously variable transmission;torque;magnet;toroid	Robotics	80.84678642313402	-15.230684403303158	70186
fac246564c8017f043c9b11c7a33b2f14c761257	study of phase shift control in high-speed ultrasonic vibration cutting		High-speed ultrasonic vibration cutting (HUVC) applies an ultrasonic vibration to a cutting tool transverse to the cutting direction. The advantage of this method is that the high-speed cutting exceeds the critical cutting speed restrictions of ultrasonic vibration cutting. However, irregular dimple arrays are machined on the work-piece surface, increasing the surface roughness. In this paper, a phase shift control method is proposed, which aims to overlap dimples in a regular pattern to decrease the surface roughness for HUVC. First, this paper investigates the theory of phase shift control to guarantee the surface quality of HUVC. Then, a closed-loop direct digital synthesis (DDS) system is designed to keep the phase shift of the machined dimples stable and controllable. A contrast experiment is conducted to compare the performance of the closed-loop DDS and the open-loop DDS methods in HUVC process. The results show that the closed-loop DDS method can render the dimple phase stable and controllable during the HUVC process. The phase shift value influences the surface roughness. Setting the phase shift to 0.94π with an appropriate feed-rate, the surface roughness is reduced to 0.303, compared to a surface roughness of 0.785 when using the open-loop DDS method.	direct digital synthesizer;transverse wave	Xinggang Jiang;Xiangyu Zhang;Xianbin Zhu;He Sui;Deyuan Zhang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2740827	phase (waves);control theory;machining;engineering;surface roughness;direct digital synthesizer;cutting tool;ultrasonic sensor;vibration	Robotics	76.38901674983255	-14.454774246465906	70235
188557285858ef34ee11a99d13ae90be3b1d7765	implementation and control of a bistable two-wheeled inverted pendulum-type mobile robot		In the past decade, there have been a lot of researches on various models and controllers for two-wheeled inverted pendulum-type mobile robots. Two-wheeled inverted pendulum-type mobile robots are suitable for the service robots working both in the indoor and outdoor environments. In this paper, a bistable two-wheeled mobile robot which can tilt up and down (B-TMR) is designed and implemented. The B-TMR remedies the weak points of two-wheeled inverted pendulum-type mobile robots. The robot body is designed to maintain balancing state and tilted state. Cost efficiency is improved by using a single accelerometer with a Butterworth filter in order to measure inclined angle. To control five motion modes (Mode 1—Balancing; Mode 2—Tilt Up; Mode 3—Tilt Down; Mode 4—Tilted Move; Mode 5 - Balancing Move), a mode-selective controller is proposed. Through various experiments, the proposed hardware and controller are validated.	inverted pendulum;mobile robot	Kwangyik Jung;Byung Kook Kim;Hyun Myung	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-31293-4_14	control theory;simulation;computer science;butterworth filter;inverted pendulum;pid controller;robot;accelerometer;control engineering;mobile robot;cost efficiency	Robotics	71.19330137393307	-17.731105144085255	70475

An FPGA-based control hardware and software architecture with real-time communication is designed to fulfill the requirements of the impedance controller. Modeling of the robot finger with flexible joints and mechanical couplings in the differential gear-box are described in this paper. In order to address the friction due to the complex transmission system and joint coupling, an adaptive model-based friction estimation method is carried out with an extended Kalman filter. The performance of the impedance controller with both adaptive and parameter-fixed friction compensations for the robot hand DLR-HIT II are analyzed and compared in this paper. Furthermore, gravity estimation is implemented with Least Squares technique to address uncertainties in gravity compensation due to the close proximity and complexity of robot hand components. Experimental results prove that accurate position tracking and stable torque/force response can be achieved with the proposed impedance controller with friction compensation on fivefinger dexterous robot hand DLR-HIT II.

The finite element method is employed to investigate structural stiffness, damping, and switching methodology under the use of smart material in tool error attenuation. This work discusses the limitations of using lumped mass modeling in toolpost dynamic control. Transient solution for tool tip displacement is obtained when pulse width modulation (PWM) is used for smart material activation during the compensation of the radial disturbing cutting forces. Accordingly a Fuzzy algorithm is developed to control actuator voltage level toward improved dynamic performance. The required minimum number of PWM cycles in each disturbing force period is investigated to diminish tool error. Time delay of applied voltage during error attenuation is also evaluated. Toolpost static force–displacement diagram as required to predict voltage intensities for error reduction is tested under different dynamic operating conditions.	algorithm	Maki K. Rashid	2005	J.

Our simulation demonstrated that the repetitive motion has presented a more flexible agility to avoid obstacles, and possess better ability to find the appropriate path according to the external forces applied on the tissue during navigation. The motion of the needle can be tracked by comparing the desired deflection with needle position from x-ray images. Point-to-point algorithm is used to achieve real time control of the flexible needle.	algorithm;cybernetics;fibre channel point-to-point;fuzzy logic;normal mode;radiography;robot;simulation	Nader Hamzavi;Chee-Kong Chui;Chee-Cheon Chui;Mohammad Eghtesad;Poulad Moradi;Stephen K.

To emulate a biological joint, a 2-DOF rotary joint actuated by dielectric elastomer (DE) is designed, in which DE acts as muscles. Based on the analysis of the working principle of the joint, a mechanism is presented to increase its angular displacement. The moment produced by the mechanism increases with increasing rotary angle, and is favorable to the increase in angular displacement. Experiments show that the joint can rotate back and forth with 2 DOFs, and the deflection angles around two axes can be heightened to more than 18°, which evaluates the feasibility of the proposed mechanism, while the blocking moment is not influenced. After further improvement, the 2-DOF rotary joint can be used in some bionic robots, such as robot fishes and robot snakes.	angularjs;blocking (computing);dos;displacement mapping;experiment;high-κ dielectric;robot;rotary woofer	Huaming Wang;Hao Guo;Yunguang Luan;Denny Oetomo	2013	2013 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics	10.1109/AIM.2013.6584078	structural engineering;control engineering;articulated robot;engineering;engineering drawing	Robotics	72.35383181194555	-22.903247254743675	71462

A novel approach based on Lyapunov theory for assuring the stability of haptic systems under constant and variable time delays is firstly presented through conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). The description of a 1 DOF test bench, the experimental protocol and results are next included in order to highlight significant effects of the time delays on the stability, especially for variable time delay. The effects of backward finite difference method, first-order low-pass filter and buffer technique are also examined through an experimental stability domain.	broadcast delay;characteristic impedance;finite difference method;first-order predicate;haptic technology;linear matrix inequality;low-pass filter;lyapunov fractal;test bench;virtual reality	Quoc Viet Dang;Antoine Dequidt;Laurent Vermeiren;Michel Dambrine	2014	2014 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics	10.1109/AIM.2014.6878136	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	69.24169431418474	-12.988958043766623	72102

By formulating a musculo-skeletal redundant system which takes into account a nonlinear muscle property and performing numerical simulations, we suggest that the human-like reaching movements can be realized by using only simple task-space feedback scheme together with the internal force effect coming from nonlinear property of muscles without any complex mathematical computation such as an inverse dynamics or some optimal trajectory derivation. Firstly, we introduce both kinematics and dynamics of a three-link serial manipulator with six monoarticular muscles and three biarticular muscles model whose movements are limited within a horizontal plane. Secondly, the nonlinear muscle property coming from a physiological study based on Hill's muscle model, is taken into consideration. This nonlinearity makes it possible to modulate the damping effect in joint-space by considering the internal force generated by the redundant muscles. By utilizing this feature, the end-point converges to the desired point using only simple task-space feedback control scheme, even thought the system owns both the joint and muscle redundancies. Finally, we illustrate numerical simulations to show the effectiveness of the control scheme, and suggest one of the direction to study brain-motor control mechanism of human movements	computation;computer simulation;feedback;inverse dynamics;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;program derivation;robotics;serial manipulator	Kenji Tahara;Zhiwei Luo;Suguru Arimoto	2006	2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2006.281931	computer simulation;control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory;feedback	Robotics	68.78921421960395	-23.07652828360136	72479

From the designer's standpoint, the current endeavor is to conceive efficient vibratory feeders, satisfying constraints of power consumption, vibration transmission and noise emission. Moreover, the interest in the reduction of maintenance cost is always present. In this context, this paper investigates experimentally the concept of vibratory conveying based on the use of piezoelectric materials for motion generation. A small-size prototype of a linear conveyor, in which lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) patches are bonded to the resilient elements, is described. One of the main design goals is that the prototype is intended to be fed directly from the electric network, aiming at avoiding the use of electronic equipment for driving. To comply with this feature and, at the same time, enable to adjust the transport velocity, a mechanical device has been conceived in such a way that the first natural frequency of the conveyor can be changed. It is shown that the transport velocity is determined by the proximity between the excitation frequency and the first natural frequency of the conveyor. The experimental tests performed to characterize the dynamic behavior of the prototype are described and the range of transport velocities is determined.	excitation;experiment;piezoelectricity;prototype;velocity (software development);vibratory angioedema;lead titanate zirconate	Domingos Alves Rade;Emerson Bastos de Albuquerque;Leandro Chaves Figueira;João Carlos Mendes Carvalho	2013		10.3390/s130709174	structural engineering;control engineering;embedded system;transport;electronic engineering;transducer;engineering;electrical engineering;piezoelectricity;automation;vibration;physics	Robotics	82.34938912166945	-15.005241974297046	72726
f9ea77a572124b7a30836ff23934d9115057b161	data-based model-free hysteretic restoring force and mass identification for dynamic systems		Abstract#R##N##R##N#Most of the currently available vibration-based damage detection approaches identify structural damage in the form of decrease in structural stiffness based on extracted eigenparameters and/or their derivates, and the basic hypothesis behind them is the system should be linear and the mass distribution of the system is usually known. Different from the stiffness degradation, the hysteretic restoring force of a dynamic system provides a more informative and direct description on the initiation and development of damage in structures under dynamic loadings and can be employed to quantitatively evaluate the energy dissipation during vibration. In this study, a data-based model-free hysteretic behavior identification approach with incomplete external excitations was proposed for the identification of structural hysteretic restoring force without the prior knowledge of structural mass distribution and the numerical model of the nonlinearity of the structure. The accuracy and feasibility of the approach for both structural mass and hysteretic behavior identification was illustrated: first, via numerical simulation with a lumped-mass multi-degree-of-freedom structure incorporating nonlinear magnetorheological (MR) dampers and a consistent mass plane truss structure incorporating a pseudo-elastic shape memory alloy model to mimic the nonlinearity in dynamic systems. Second, a dynamic test on a four-story frame structure equipped with MR dampers was carried out and the corresponding dynamic response was employed to validate the reliability of the proposed approach for both structural mass and hysteretic behavior identification. The results show that the proposed approach is capable of identifying different types of structural nonlinearity, which numerical model is unknown, with incomplete inputs and unknown mass distribution. The approach provides a promising way for damage detection and monitoring in the form of hysteretic behavior and energy dissipation for engineering structures under dynamic loadings, which should be dealt with as nonlinear systems.	dynamical system;hysteresis	Bin Xu;Jia He;Sami F.

The robot’s end effector is in contact with a compliant surface of unknown stiffness. Two types of control schemes are considered which respectively achieve regulation and tracking of position on the contact surface and force along the direction normal to the surface. The desired position is scaled along the constrained direction so as to fulfill the force control objective; adaptive mechanisms are designed for the two schemes to compute the scaling factor, which depends on the unknown stiffness coefficient of the environment. A number of case studies are developed throughout the paper to illustrate the effectiveness of the force/position control algorithms under nonideal conditions.	algorithm;experiment;image scaling;industrial robot;matthews correlation coefficient;open control architecture;robot end effector	Luigi Villani;Ciro Natale;Bruno Siciliano;Carlos Canudas de Wit	2000	IEEE Trans.

1879054a98b2df476b42d72104b1a823760facf0	effects of input frequency content and signal-to-noise ratio on the parametric estimation of surface emg-torque dynamics	torque;damping;frequency modulation;noise level;electromyography;signal to noise ratio;switches	The dynamic relationship between surface EMG (sEMG) and torque can be estimated from data acquired while subjects voluntarily modulate joint torque. We have shown that for such data, the input (EMG) contains a feedback component from the output (torque) and so accurate estimates of the dynamics require the use of closed-loop identification algorithms. Moreover, this approach has several other limitations since the input is controlled indirectly and so the frequency content and signal-to-noise ratio cannot be controlled. This paper investigates how these factors influence the accuracy of estimates. This was studied using experimental sEMG recorded from healthy human subjects for tasks with different modulation rates. Box-Jenkin (BJ) method was used for identification. Results showed that input frequency content had little effect on estimates of gain and natural frequency but had strong effect on damping factor estimates. It was demonstrated that to accurately estimate the damping factor, the command signal switching rate must be less than 2s. It was also shown that random errors increased with noise level but was limited to 10% of the parameters true value for highest noise level tested. To summarize, simulation study of this work showed that voluntary modulation paradigm can accurately identify sEMG-torque dynamics.	algorithm;b. j. fogg;damping factor;estimated;gain;hepatitis b surface antigens;less than;modulation;noise (electronics);programming paradigm;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;supernumerary maxillary right second molar;surface electromyography	Mahsa A.

In the paper, an intelligent controller based on fuzzy systems is designed for the device to adjust eccentric payloads to level and keep the rope's tension balanced. The controller is composed of two sub-controllers, each of which deals with various situations by choosing different fuzzy rules. As the actuators adopted in the device can only move within a certain range, it is necessary to take their moving ranges into consideration. Actually, each control cycle includes two stages. At the first stage, the controller regulates the payload's diagonal joined with the constrained actuators. At the second stage, the controller adjusts the other diagonal. If the actuators joined with this diagonal are also constrained, the controller mainly regulates the payload's posture. Otherwise, the controller regulates the payload's angle as well as the ropes' tension simultaneously. Finally, the intelligent controller is used to control the four-rope-driven level-adjustment device, and gets satisfying results.	algorithm;brownian motion;control theory;fuzzy control system;fuzzy rule;intelligent control;motion capture;network switch;poor posture	Jianhong Zhang;Jianqiang Yi;Yi Yu	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2009.5420553	control engineering;niobium;payload;simulation;controller;gravity;computer science;engineering;sensor;artificial intelligence;control theory;fuzzy set;fuzzy control system;satisfiability;actuator	Robotics	69.25577481528424	-17.932319319110928	73741

Unlike a dynamic simulation, where the set of elements moves according to the different external forces existing, in kinematic simulation the movement of the whole set depends exclusively on imposing movement on one or more of the bodies according to the degrees of freedom initially possessed by the mechanism.

351584c5ef903d1d83229f57ae029a3c2401fbc3	using taylor series expansions and second-order statistics for blind source separation in post-nonlinear mixtures		In the context of Post-Nonlinear (PNL) mixtures, source separation based on Second-Order Statistics (SOS) is a challenging topic due to the inherent difficulties when dealing with nonlinear transformations. Under the assumption that sources are temporally colored, the existing SOS-inspired methods require the use of Higher-Order Statistics (HOS) as a complement in certain stages of PNL demixing. However, a recent study has shown that the sole use of SOS is sufficient for separation if certain constraints on the separation system are obeyed. In this paper, we propose the use of a PNL separating model based on constrained Taylor series expansions which is able to satisfy the requirements that allow a successful SOS-based source separation. The simulation results corroborate the proposal effectiveness.	blind signal separation;source separation	Denis G.

In these articles the aims are to model constrained-motion tasks, grasping operations and Calibration of robots using “orthogonal complements” in one form or another. Because the basis for these articles is fallacious, they can only be called erroneous except when, serendipitously, a correct result appears through the simplicity or symmetry of the problem; in such cases the articles become dangerously misleading. It is of even greater concern to see the fallacious arguments enshrined in several textbooks on robotics for engineering students. These books contain chapters which explain in detail the meaning and the use of “orthogonal complements. ” Reduced to simplest terms, the fallacy lies in the definition of “orthogonality” applied to instantaneous rigid-body motions, called twists and equally to forced	book;control theory;robot;robotics	Joseph Duffy	1990	J.

8b56d361c6947f079ba5d126e92564c564e4cf5f	electromagnetic losses in synchronous machines during active compensation of unbalanced magnetic pull		Unbalanced magnetic pull (UMP) is typically caused by rotor or stator shape defects, electrical short circuits, eccentric rotor/stator bores, as well as unreasonable pole-slot combinations. It leads to vibration and increases noise and energy losses of the machine. By actively controlling the magnetic fields and forces that arise between the rotor and stator by regulating the rotor field current of separated pole groups, it is possible to cancel it. In this paper, we measure and calculate the currents induced in the damper bars for a synchronous machine test rig under 20% static eccentricity with and without active compensation of UMP. This is done to validate our finite-element calculations. Afterward, we perform loss calculations for a 74-MVA synchronous generator with and without stator parallel circuits. We find that, with active compensation of UMP for an eccentric machine, the damper bar currents and stator parallel circuit circulating currents can be eliminated and the electromagnetic efficiency of the machine that has a static eccentricity fault increases.	byzantine fault tolerance;distance (graph theory);image noise;r.o.t.o.r.;series and parallel circuits;unbalanced line	J.

A helical motor is a linear motor having helical mover and stator that can realize a high thrust force density and high back-drivability. The magnetic levitation control, position control and force control were archived. Additionally, power-saving magnetic levitation by a zero power control was successfully realized. However, a gap response with current-integral type and external-force-feedback type has an undershoot on a force control. This paper proposes a current-integral zero-power control with force feedforward to suppress the undershoot, and compare it with current-integral and external-force-feedback. As a result, on the force control, we confirm the proposed method suppresses the undershoot and improve the transition time compared with the conventional methods.	arabic numeral 0;archive;feedforward neural network;haptic technology;integer (computer science);rise time;thrust	Masato Koyama;Yasutaka Fujimoto	2014	2014 IEEE 13th International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control (AMC)	10.1109/AMC.2014.6823360	control engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory	Robotics	70.79942333238102	-11.869825531725327	75205

A self-updating digital electrical impedance equivalent to that of the piezoelement is suggested in order to overcome the mismatch problem met when considering a static analog electrical impedance as classically used. Then, the design of an observer that performs a thorough separation of the electric current due to the direct piezoelectric effect from the measured electric current is proposed in order to estimate the piezoelectric actuator displacement. The experimental results validate the proposed approach and demonstrate the efficiency of the developed self-sensing circuit and its observer to estimate the displacement of the piezoceramics actuator for long duration measurement of constant step signal.	characteristic impedance;displacement mapping;nominal impedance;piezoelectricity	Jo&#x00EB;l Bafumba Liseli;Jo&#x00EB;l Agnus;Philippe Lutz;Micky Rakotondrabe	2018	IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters	10.1109/LRA.2018.2794514	control engineering;actuator;electrical impedance;piezoelectricity;engineering	Robotics	78.90319618495757	-15.84667869083042	75272

Since the initial position and orientation of a part may be uncertain, the act of loading the part into the fixture must compensate for this uncertainty. Machinists often refer to the 3-2-1 rule: place the part onto 3-point contact with a horizontal support plane, slide the part along this plane into 2-point contact with the fixture, then translate along this edge until a 1-point contact uniquely locates the part. This rule of thumb implicitly assumes both sensing and compliance: applied forces change as contacts are detected. In this paper, the authors geometrically formalize robotic fixture loading as a sensor-based compliant assembly problem and give a complete planning algorithm. They consider the class of modular fixtures that use three locators and one clamp (Brost and Goldberg 1996), and discuss a class of robot commands that cause the part to slide and rotate in the support plane. Sensing is achieved with binary contact sensors on each locator; compliance is achieved with a passive spring-loaded mechanism at the robot and effector. The authors extend the theory of sensor-based compliant motion planning to generalized polygonal C-spaces, and give a complete planning algorithm: it ismore » guaranteed to find a loading plan when one exists and to return a negative report otherwise. The authors report on experiments using the resulting plans. Finally, they use this formalization to prove a sufficient condition for the 3-2-1 rule.« less	algorithm;test fixture	Kyeonah Yu;Kenneth Y. Goldberg	1998	I. J.

1e139e41f0a42917f3eabe4d963817a74622fcde	adaptive nonlinear projective filtering - application to filtering of artifacts in eeg signals		In this work a novel approach to filtering of eyeblink related artifacts from EEG signals is presented. Proposed solution, the Adaptive Nonlinear Projective Filtering (ANPF) algorithm, combines the classic approach to adaptive filtering with algorithms from nonlinear state space projection family. Performance of described method is compared with adaptive filter based on Normalized Least Mean Squares algorithm in terms of median Normalized Mean Squared Error. Data used in conducted research was simulated according to described procedure. Such approach allowed for a reliable comparison and evaluation of algorithm’s signal correction properties. Additionally, a real time modification of ANPF algorithm is proposed and tested. The analysis of sensitivity to changes of parameter values was also performed. Achieved results were tested for statistical significance. According to obtained scores ANPF significantly outperforms referential method during offline processing.	adaptive filter;algorithm;automatic control;computation;computational science;control theory;data mining;downgrade;electroencephalography;group delay and phase delay;least mean squares filter;mean squared error;nonlinear system;online and offline;robotics;significant figures;silesian library;state space	Bartosz Binias;Michal Niezabitowski	2017		10.5220/0006414604400448	projective test;engineering;filter (signal processing);control engineering;electroencephalography;nonlinear system	Visualization	78.89575175706757	-12.484523001485835	75650

Transverse feedback linearization and a parallel transport frame are used to design a path following controller that is suitable for paths that are parametrized as regular threefold continuously differentiable curves. The application of this frame enables the handling of paths with zero curvature and reduces the complexity of the control law. The path following controller is combined with a compliance control concept.

The joint mechanism consists of 2-pitch and 1-roll joint. The back-drivability of the joint mechanism is realized by using a ball-screw and a steel wire rope. When the in-pipe robot with the back-drivable joint mechanism passes through pipeline elements except the miter and the branch, the control of the joint mechanism is not required. In addition, a rescue mechanism is not needed in case of emergency such as the loss of power, communication and control. Besides, the 2-pitch joint of this joint module assists the in-pipe robot to pass through the miter and the branch safely and quickly. Finally, the performance of back-drivable joint module is experimentally validated.	experiment;pipeline (computing);robot	Ho Moon Kim;Seung Ung Yang;Yun-Seok Choi;Hyeong Min Mun;Chan Min Park;Hyoukryeol Choi	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7353907	structural engineering;robot;gear;engineering;artificial intelligence;pipeline transport;torque;forensic engineering;pulley;engineering drawing	Robotics	73.07387682788723	-22.68278119568401	75950

It is a force output type actuator consisting of a heater, a metal hydride container, and bellows. The metal hydride has a unique energy conversion property: thermal energy can be converted into mechanical energy. Therefore, the desorption and absorption of hydrogen can be controlled by heating and cooling the metal hydride and the bellows can be moved by the hydrogen pressure. This servo actuator also has a pressure feedback control system which uses a PID controller to improve the response characteristics. The pressure feedback control system is synthesized by using the model simulation of the controlled system.

5e224061fecf8445ad56d56ee5a89993747196fb	investigation on the optimal properties of semi active control devices with continuous control for equipment isolation		The paper treats the semi active isolation of a single equipment, acceleration sensitive, by means of a variable elastic control device. A numerical study on a single degree of freedom (SDOF) structural model equipped with a continuously variable elastic device subjected to harmonic input is presented. The utilized control algorithm is derived by the Lyapunov method and specialized in order to obtain instantaneous optimality. In order to minimize the dynamic response of interest, i.e. the equipment absolute acceleration, some parameters that define the algorithm and the device are conveniently selected. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the optimal isolation properties of semi active variable stiffness devices with continuous control across the whole frequency spectrum. The performances of the isolated equipment are evaluated in terms of absolute acceleration transmissibility. Semi active continuous control is compared with semi active ON-OFF mode and conventional linear passive control. Results show that it is possible to choose conveniently the parameters regulating semi active continuous control in order to limit the absolute acceleration transmissibility at all the frequencies. In literature from problems concerning vibration isolation, transmissibility is alternatively defined in terms of absolute acceleration or displacement. Here, absolute displacement transmissibility is also estimated. It is observed that in case of semi active control, there are differences between the two transmissibility representations, and they do not lead to analogous results for evaluating the performance of the control system.	algorithm;control system;displacement mapping;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;performance;pointing device;semiconductor industry;spectral density;transmissibility (structural dynamics)	Michela Basili;Maurizio De Angelis	2014	Scalable Computing: Practice and Experience		structural engineering;control engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	72.80802384875	-14.936935987170182	76117

Therefore soft robots, which mean robots with passively (or mechanically) compliant joints, become more and more important. In this work we analyze what Cartesian stiffness at the tool center point one can achieve with a passively compliant, redundant robot with variable joint stiffness. We restrict this work to the special case of uncoupled joint stiffness only, as coupling of joint stiffness seems to be mechanically difficult to realize. Finally we discuss a Cartesian controller, which incorporates the compliance of the joints and ensures the correct stiffness behavior also for high displacements from the desired position.	cartesian closed category;robot;soft robotics;stiffness	Alin Albu-Schäffer;Max Fischer;Günter Schreiber;Florian Schoeppe;Gerd Hirzinger	2004	2004 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) (IEEE Cat.

The main advantage of the dynamics formulation is that it does not require the constraint equations to be linearly independent. Thus, a simulation may proceed even in the presence of redundant constraints or singular configurations, and a controller does not need to change its structure whenever the mechanical system changes its topology or number of degrees of freedom. A motion-control scheme is proposed based on a projected inverse-dynamics scheme which proves to be stable and minimizes the weighted Euclidean norm of the actuation force. The projection-based control scheme is further developed for constrained systems, e.g., parallel manipulators, which have some joints with no actuators (passive joints). This is complemented by the development of constraint force control. A condition on the inertia matrix resulting in a decoupled mechanical system is analytically derived that simplifies the implementation of the force control. Finally, numerical and experimental results obtained from dynamic simulation and control of constrained mechanical systems, based on the proposed inverse and direct dynamics formulations, are documented.	cartesian closed category;constant function;control system;coupling (computer programming);data center;dynamic simulation;euler–lagrange equation;inverse dynamics;jacobian matrix and determinant;kernel (linear algebra);lagrange multiplier;level of detail;matroid rank;maximal set;motion controller;numerical analysis;rank (j programming language);video projector	Farhad Aghili	2005	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2005.851380	control engineering;motion control;dynamic simulation;mathematical optimization;parallel manipulator;stability;projection;control theory;mathematics;linear system;degrees of freedom;inverse dynamics;mechanical system;mechanical engineering	Robotics	68.47028096262189	-20.928061127158262	76391

The hand is specifically designed for the humanoid robot HYDRA, whose 40 joints are driven by back-drivable electro-hydrostatic actuators (EHA). Each designed hand has four fingers with a total of five DOF. Each finger has three joints underactuated by one tendon. Opposition/reposition of the thumb joint is also driven by one tendon. The five tendons are pulled by a miniature linear cluster EHA mounted in the forearm. The cluster EHA consists of a light weight tie-rod cylinder cluster with five pistons, and five low friction trochoid pumps with a crescent separator. Its 300 N nominal tension generates 1.5 Nm joint torque on each of the finger joints. Design of the cylinder and pump, with results of evaluation experiments is shown in this paper. Forearm structure with a mechanism to measure the tendon tension, low friction tendon routing in the forearm, low friction wire guiding link for the wrist, and parallel link wrist driving mechanism with two EHAs are also described.	cylinder seal;cylinder-head-sector;electrooculography;experiment;finger tree;humanoid robot;hydra (chess);mac address;routing;spectral leakage;underactuation	Tianyi Ko;Hiroshi Kaminaga;Yoshihiko Nakamura	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989077	actuator;control engineering;humanoid robot;tendon;underactuation;piston;wrist;torque;engineering;trochoid;structural engineering	Robotics	72.83654675691655	-22.839253669108025	76629

The surface contact is modeled as a linear pressure variation. The quality measure of a grip is taken to be the coefficient of friction needed to keep the held object from slipping between the fingers under applied forces and moments. The lower the coefficient of friction, the better the grip. Incorporation of this evaluation into general grip selection strategy is discussed, and several examples are given.

Based on these principles, we developed a variable stiffness actuator with automatic rigidity/ compliance switching. The actuator contains two motors-one for position control and the other for adjusting the stiffness. The stiffness adjustment motor independently alters stiffness through regulating the distance between the output shaft and the spring sliders. The function of automatic rigidity/compliance switching is realized through turning four electromagnets on or off to make sucker up or down. We set up an experimental platform to verify the automatic switching function for rigid and compliant characteristics. Results showed that the actuator can cover a wide range of stiffness and provide reliable rigidity/compliance switching.	bundle adjustment;interaction;robot;stiffness	Ze Cui;Haiwei Yang;Dong-Hai Qian;Yuqian Cui;Yun Peng	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO 2014)	10.1109/ROBIO.2014.7090351	structural engineering;control engineering;electromagnet;network switch;computer science;engineering;control theory;actuator	Robotics	71.68240069114957	-23.53983241691032	77135

Considering the flexibility, cable configuration is embodied by translation and rotation of cross-section along the centerline. According to the minimum potential energy principle in Elasticity, Kirchhoff equations in the form of Euler angles are gained, which are used to describe spatial flexural configuration of deformable cables. For the specific boundary condition that cables are fixed at both ends, analytical integrals of Euler angles are achieved on the base of kinetic analogy. Furthermore, to deal with the difficulty of getting Cartesian coordinate integrals, a cylindrical system is introduced to describe spatial position of flexural cables on the base of Saint-Venant of Elasticity. Finally, a configuration simulation platform is developed and an experimental system using 3D laser scan technology is founded to do effective verification of the relevant model and algorithm.	3d scanner;algorithm;assembly language;constraint algorithm;digital modeling and fabrication;elasticity (data store);euler;experimental system;gaussian quadrature;gauss–jacobi quadrature;gauss–legendre algorithm;image scanner;kirchhoff's theorem;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;simulation	Hongwang Du;Wei Xiong;Haitao Wang;Zu-wen Wang;Bin Yuan	2013	2013 International Conference on Computer-Aided Design and Computer Graphics	10.1109/CADGraphics.2013.42	mathematical optimization;potential energy;mathematical model;mathematics;geometry;solid modeling;force;integral equation	EDA	72.2389874468427	-20.808674929351817	77759

The motion coordination developed using VHCs is based on a motion generator equation, which is a scalar nonlinear differential equation of second order. It can be considered equivalent in function to a central pattern generator in living organisms. The relative time evolution of the degrees of freedom of a humanoid robot during a typical motion are specified by a set of coordination functions that uniquely define the overall pattern of the motion. This is comparable to a hypothesis on the existence of motion patterns in biomechanics. A robust control is derived based on a transverse linearization along the configuration manifold defined by the coordination functions. It is shown that the derived coordination and control architecture possesses excellent robustness properties. The analysis is performed on an example of a real human motion recorded in test experiments.	central pattern generator;computed tomographic colonography;experiment;generic drugs;humanoid robot;kinesiology;nonlinear system;organism;robust control;transverse wave;turing test;manifold	Stepan Pchelkin;Anton S.

Floor space is expensive and limited and leads to high-bay warehouses also requiring special order picking trucks adapted to impressing heights. During the transportation of pallets and due to the lateral and rotating movements of the fork, oscillations occur in the entire truck which not only limits the working precision but also affect the material and may lead to earlier machine fatigue. This becomes an even bigger problem when lightweight structures are used for economic reasons and active damping becomes urgent for both the truck and the driver's safety. In this paper, a control approach is presented for an order picking truck based on a simplified linear parameter-varying model. Experimental measurements will be used for parameter identification and the evaluation of a first implementation.

The progressive polynomial calibration (PPC) method is a step-by-step compensation algorithm that can fix some of the aforementioned errors by using microprocessors. In this paper, a modified-PPC (M-PPC) method is introduced. It is then shown that the number of calibration points, their selection, and permutation mechanisms can affect the M-PPC method. Therefore, an intelligent algorithm is presented to select appropriate calibration points from the input-output data.

Low energy and power density in current actuation technology, inadequate control schemes and safety of use are leading challenges towards a portable, complementary device. This paper presents the dynamically controlled ankle-foot orthosis (DCO) with regenerative kinetics which seek to incrementally attain portability by solving the energy/power density issue in powered elements by harnessing elastic energy of uniquely tuned mechanical elements and reducing the control problem and increasing safety by introducing compliant elements between the human-machine-environment interfaces.	device configuration overlay;environment variable;kinesiology;kinetics internet protocol;robot;wearable computer	Joseph Hitt;A.

We also analyze the effect of the limited-view aspect on the stability and the efficiency of our tracking approach. Our algorithm is based on the use of the generalized polarization tensors, which can be reconstructed from the multistatic response measurements by solving a linear system. The system has the remarkable property that low order generalized polarization tensors are not affected by the error caused by the instability of higher orders in the presence of measurement noise.

The inaccuracy of the classical robots in the handling of many organic objects such as fruits or eggs in production lines has triggered the necessity for soft body robotics. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid robotic prototype (X-Y soft-bodied peristaltic table) combining soft and hard robotics techniques with cutting-edge design in its physical stature, so as to control its 25 motors and to be autonomous. These 25 motors are capable of generating peristaltic motion in the soft layers of the table surface, thus providing a physical force that transports delicate objects. Two control systems have been developed to validate the industrial potential of a peristaltic XY table. The first system is a dynamic real-time path planning program that has been written to determine the shortest path from an object on the table's surface to a target position selected by the user; the second system is an artificial neural network (ANN) that has been developed to estimate the relationship between the table's actuation pattern and the corresponding surface deformation.	actuation dosing unit;artificial neural network;autonomous robot;body height;classical xy model;control system;egg food product;fruit;handling (psychology);human height;industrial pc;mobility aid;motion planning;physical object;prototype;real-time clock;real-time path planning;robot (device);robotics;short;shortest path problem;sorting;anatomical layer	Ryman Hashem;Brierley Smith;David Browne;Weiliang L.

In this paper we consider the problem of computing both internal and external wrenches in open multiple branches kinematic chains, which are not equipped with joint-level torque sensors, but on the contrary are provided with inertial and tactile sensing, and a set of six-axes Force/Torque Sensors (FTS) distributed within the chain. The proposed method is grounded on the Enhanced Oriented Graph, a graph-representation of the kinematic chain, enriched with the information coming from the different sensors. Under suitable conditions, a maximum of N+1 external wrenches can be estimated from N six-axes FTS. The graph is built dynamically, and internal and external wrenches are consequently updated. Theoretical results have been implemented in a software library (iDyn) released with an open-source license (GPL) as part of the iCub software project. The proposed method has been applied to 32 of the 53 DOF of the iCub humanoid robot.	algorithm;electrooculography;fleet telematics system;humanoid robot;icub;java topology suite (jts);kinematic chain;library (computing);open-source license;open-source software;orientation (graph theory);robotics;sensor;sensor web;software project management	Serena Ivaldi;Matteo Fumagalli;Marco Randazzo;Francesco Nori;Giorgio Metta;Giulio Sandini	2011	2011 11th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots	10.1109/Humanoids.2011.6100813	computer vision;simulation;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;graph theory;graph;tactile sensor;robot kinematics	Robotics	69.53779620067536	-23.342282308974106	79075
ca3b179a8fff14fea72f9fed9b3fd324eb389f60	backstepping based nonlinear control strategy for mmc topology		In this paper, we propose a backstepping based nonlinear control strategy to ensure the transient performances for the Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC), especially under the emergencies like changing load and operating mode. According to the backstepping control technique, the control input is derived from the Lyapunov stability theory and the established mathematical model. Meanwhile, it can be directly transformed to the desired modulation. After then, combined with the capacitor voltage balancing controller and the circulating current controller, the pulse width modulation (PWM) is triggered correspondingly. The simulative results and the experimental results show that the proposed backstepping control offers many merits over the conventional PI control like settling time and control precision under various conditions.	anatomy, regional;capacitor device component;control theory;controllers;converter device component;deny (action);emergencies [disease/finding];equilibrium;lyapunov fractal;midi machine control;mathematical model;memory management controller;mitomycin;nonlinear system;optimal control;oximetry, pulse;performance;pokeweed mitogens;pulse-width modulation;rejection sampling;smoc-1 protein, rat;settling time;simulation;voltage;width	Xiaotong Zhang;Jingjing Huang;Xin Zhang;Xiangqian Tong	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216990	control engineering;control theory;backstepping;pi;settling time;nonlinear control;control theory;lyapunov stability;engineering;modulation;pulse-width modulation	Robotics	70.60698707752317	-11.556425631282469	79464

For state of the art AFMs gains have to be adjusted manually by the operator. The typical operator such as biologist, physicist or material scientist may not have detailed knowledge about control engineering. In order to increase usability and acceptance an easy and intuitive approach is needed. The method presented in this paper is based on the commonly applied manual tuning strategy for AFM-imaging and copies the behavior of an experienced user. By spectral analysis ringing of the feedback loop is detected when feedback gains are increased beyond the stability margins. Increasing gains is stopped when an 1/f stop criteria is reached. The algorithm is successfully tested in simulation and practical AFM topography measurements with different cantilever - sample combinations, demonstrating that auto-tuning can be applied to achieve imaging performance close to ideal settings.	algorithm;atomic-force microscopy;ct scan;control engineering;feedback;pink noise;ringing (signal);self-tuning;shuttle radar topography mission;simulation;spectral density estimation;system dynamics;usability;vii	Dominik Kohl;Thomas Riel;Rudolf Saathof;Jürgen Steininger;Georg Schitter	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7526840	control engineering;engineering;nanotechnology;control theory	Robotics	74.37393539563284	-12.330640481508103	79872
44271a9689223271537b06b67d7136942c89483e	microfluidic circuit dynamics and control for caterpillar-inspired locomotion in a soft robot		Because caterpillars can locomote through complex terrain, caterpillar-inspired soft robots promise safe and reliable access for search, rescue, and exploration. Microfluidic components analogous to electronic components like resistors and capacitors further promise the principled design and fabrication of autonomous soft robots powered by microfluidic circuits. This paper presents a model for caterpillar locomotion using an oscillator network approach, in which the periodic motion of each leg is described by an oscillator, and the collection of all legs forms a network. We use tools from graph theory to model (1) a first-order system consisting of a network of RC oscillators connected to an astable multivibrator circuit serving as a Central Pattern Generator (CPG); and (2) a second-order system consisting of a network of RLC oscillators with a deCentralized Pattern Generator (dCPG) as reference control. For the RC network, we analyze the rate of convergence and the gait number, a metric that characterizes the locomotion gait. For the RLC network, we design feedback laws to stabilize consensus and traveling wave solutions. Numerical modeling and preliminary experimental results show promise for the design and control of locomotion circuitry in a caterpillar-inspired soft robot.	autonomous robot;central pattern generator;chris sawyer's locomotion;circuit design;control theory;electronic circuit;electronic component;experiment;first-order predicate;graph theory;hubbard model;itga9 gene;inspiration function;lifting;microfluidics;multivibrator;numerical method;oscillator (cellular automaton);oscillator device component;power (psychology);rc circuit;rgn gene;rlc circuit;rate of convergence;robot (device);solutions;testbed;replication compartment;travel	Carla Johnson;Giulia Franchi;Derek A.

There exist, however, undesirable nonlinear dynamic properties like backlash, hysteresis, and friction in tendon-sheath transmission. Controlling the distal-end position and force accurately is a very challenging task, since the needed sensors can hardly be placed at the distal end of the system. This paper develops a displacement transmission model of a single-tendon-sheath transmission system based on the force transmission model and proposes a new approach to control the distal-end force and position by inverse transmission without any feedback from the output side. The inverse model is calibrated by offline measurements using the sensors mounted at the proximal end. An experimental setup of single-tendon-sheath actuation is presented, and the improved control performance, with respect to distal-end position and force tracking, is validated by experiments.	displacement mapping;experiment;hysteresis;nonlinear system;online and offline;robot;robotic arm;sensor	Lin Chen;Xingsong Wang;W.

We first derive formula for calculating virtual ankle-joint torque and a performance index of dissipated mechanical energy for a convex foot shape model with general foot shape parameterization. Secondly, using the foot shape determined by a 2nd Bezier curve with which a form can be controlled easily, we calculate a value of the virtual ankle-joint torque and the performance index of dissipated mechanical energy to verify effects of change in foot shape. Furthermore, relationship between the foot shapes and the walking speeds are clarified by a numerical simulation. Finally, we propose a method to design a convex foot shape that attains a desired virtual ankle-joint torque and verify an improvement of the walking speed by a numerical simulation with the foot shape that is designed by the proposed method. We believe that the proposed method will be applied to design effective active ankle-joint torque and/or to design a foot shape for biped robots.	bézier curve;computer simulation;numerical analysis;robot	Hirotake Sasaki;Masaki Yamakita;Fumihiko Asano	2008	2008 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2008.4650907	computer simulation;robot;control engineering;process performance index;simulation;numerical analysis;shape;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;bézier curve;control theory;torque;robot kinematics;foot	Robotics	68.86300072044045	-21.610103476187405	81740

efa09e4e7d2043a4bc5cbd2ebca7992058c6cb0f	real-time curvature estimation of printable soft gripper using electro-conductive yarn		Automatic handling of many types of food materials are required to realize the automation of production of commercially prepared box lunches. A printable soft gripper was developed for food handling which is simple to produce with a 3D printer. However, the sensing ability of the printable soft gripper was not discussed in previous research. In this paper, a novel method for estimating the curvature of a printable soft gripper using electro-conductive yarn is presented. Electro-conductive yarn is a conductive material, and the resistance of strings is changed by stretching. It is less expensive than other sensors that can be used for curvature measurement. Additionally, it is easy to assemble and disassemble by hand. Electro-conductive yarn is applied to a prototype printable soft gripper, and the proposed estimation method is verified experimentally.

An important model parameter, clamped capacitance, is traditionally considered constant and obtained through offline measurements. However, the capacitance value changes with operating conditions such as electric fields, environmental temperatures, and aging. In addition, traditional capacitance measurements are not hysteresis free. In this research, a hysteresis independent real time capacitance measurement technique is proposed. This is achieved by superimposing a high frequency ripple over the normal control voltage signal and comparing the resulting current signal to the voltage ripple. Since the mechanical bandwidth of the actuator is much lower than the ripple voltage, no measurable movement is induced by the measurement technique, and a clamped capacitance is determined. It is demonstrated that the measurement is largely independent of hysteresis and it shows good agreement with an LCR meter. The on-line capacitance measurement is very useful for characterising piezoelectric actuators and for implementing more robust control schemes.	hysteresis;online and offline;piezoelectricity;ripple effect;robust control	Mohammad Islam;Rudolf J.

First, according to the dynamics of motion of a mechanical mass-spring system, mathematical equations that contain a linear viscous friction, a varied elasticity with cross-coupling effect due to mechanical bending, and dynamics of a hysteresis variable is proposed to describe the motion dynamics of the two-axis piezopositioning stage. Next, from the equations, a state-space model in which the applied voltage to the stage is defined as an output of an integrator is derived. On the basis of this state-space model, the integrator-backstepping-based dynamic surface control is proposed. By using the proposed control method to trajectory tracking of the two-axis piezopositioning stage, the dynamic performance, robustness to parameter variations, and trajectory tracking error can be improved. Experimental results of the time responses from the computer-controlled two-axis piezopositioning stage illustrate the validity of the proposed control method for practical applications in trajectory tracking.	algorithm;apache axis;control system;elasticity (data store);hysteresis;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optic axis of a crystal;piezoelectricity;powell's method;state space	Hsin-Jang Shieh;Chia-Hsiang Hsu	2007	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2006.890290	control engineering;electronic engineering;backstepping;hysteresis;engineering;control theory;effective mass;physics	Robotics	71.38072814811495	-14.521513290880645	82226

To address the problem, this paper focuses on the structural synthesis of new 2R3T and 2R2T PMs with high rotational capability. First, two new moving platforms are proposed based on the concepts of decoupled and configurable design. By means of the proposed platforms and Lie group theory, a series of 2R2T and 2R3T PMs are synthesized. Then the inverse kinematics and velocity relationship of one of the synthesized 2R3T PMs are presented. Finally, the rotational capability of the same 2R3T PM is analyzed. The result shows that by means of actuation redundancy, the studied 2R3T PM indeed possesses the high rotational capability about two axes, even though interferences and singularities are taken into consideration.	3d printing;apache axis;condition number;interference (communication);inverse kinematics;parallel computing;robot end effector;triple modular redundancy;velocity (software development)	Congzhe Wang;Yuefa Fang;Hairong Fang	2017	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574715000636	kinematics;simulation;computer science;distributed computing;geometry	HPC	69.90361698191931	-21.07191570761475	82302

An elastoresistive tactile sensor is designed to feel inside the body of the patient. The sensor is thin, flexible, robust, cheap, and has a simple structure. It has 16x16 elements, a spatial resolution of 1 mm and a bandwidth of 78 Hz. Despite a large hysteresis and non-linear behaviour, the sensor is very well suited for a qualitative measurement of the pres-sure distribution, with a high resolution in position, force and time.

To accomplish this, a fundamental capability of reproducing complex mandibular motions of human subjects in a biomimetic manner is required. In this paper, first, the mechanism and experimental setup of the robot are described, followed by five performance criteria proposed for the torque distribution across the robot. Second, the distributed torque is employed as a feedforward to enhance the independent joint control for the tracking of the mandibular movement. The frictional effects are compensated for to further improve the tracking accuracy. Finally, experiments are carried out to evaluate and compare the proposed control algorithms with the robot being commanded to reproduce a real human mandibular motion in free chewing, chewing a silicone gel, and chewing a wooden stick. The results illustrate that the robot is able to emulate complex mandibular motions, the distributed-torque-based joint control significantly enhances the motion tracking accuracy, and the friction compensation can further improve the motion tracking performance.	algorithm;biomimetics;control theory;experiment;feedforward neural network;nonlinear system;parallel manipulator;robot	Chen Cheng;Weiliang L.

BI-EKF algorithm consists of a single EKF algorithm using consecutively two inputs based on two extended IM models developed for the simultaneous estimation of Rr' and Rs. Therefore, from the point of real-time implementation, it requires less memory than previous EKF-based studies exploiting two separate EKF algorithms for the same aim. By using the measured stator phase voltages and currents, the developed estimation algorithm is tested with real-time experiments under challenging variations of Rs , Rr', and tL in a wide speed range; the results obtained from BI-EKF reveal significant improvement in the all estimated states and parameters when compared with those of the single EKFs estimating only Rr' or Rs.	algorithm;bi-directional text;experiment;extended kalman filter;power inverter;r.o.t.o.r.;real-time clock;real-time transcription	Murat Barut;Ridvan Demir;Emrah Zerdali;Remzi Inan	2012	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2011.2178209	control engineering;algorithm design;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;induction motor	Robotics	70.0883631941849	-11.746479156558246	83332

In this paper, we describe the development of an ultrahigh speed robot named FALCON (Fast Load Conveyance), based on a wire driven parallel manipulation system. It achieves peak accelerations of up to 43G and maximum velocities of 13 m/s, even if considerably small DC motors (60W) are used. Due to the use of wires in actuation, the problem of vibration arises. We employ internal force control among wires to reduce the vibration by utilizing nonlinear elasticity from the wire mechanism. Experimental results on point to point control using the prototype system are presented under linear PD feedback, to illustrate the effectiveness of the system.	robot	Sadao Kawamura;Choe Won;S.

babb26bc52e420aae11e4cea4f3ad521e1ba9d68	a simplified method to identify the equivalent joint parameters of holder-tool interface		The clamping length of holder-tool often changes with the machining conditions and is the main factor affecting the stiffness and damping values of holder-tool interface. To avoid the need for repeating the measurements, the previous studies identify the joint stiffness-damping parameters based on genetic algorithm and calculate the joint parameters per unit area of holder-tool interface for response prediction. This paper proposes a simplified method to identify the joint parameters by simplifying the continuous contact interface to contact points in side of the clamping part. The equivalent joint stiffness-damping parameters are calculated by an inverse calculation method along the whole frequency band, which is more efficient than the genetic algorithm. The responses of holder-tool assembly with different clamping length are predicted based on the assumption of linear relationship between the stiffness-damping values and clamping length. At last, the experiment cases were carried out to verify the effective of the simplified method.

Here we present the method of video processing as an experimental technique to study the motion of double pendulum in time domain. We have studied the dependence of the nature of motion of double pendulum broadly classified into chaotic and non-chaotic, on the initial conditions in which the angles θ and Φ acquire values in the full range of -180 to 180 degrees in various combinations. Also, we would be showing that the phenomenon of chaos does not only depend on the energy levels but there are other governing factors also. As for example, in double pendulum, it is the orientation of pendulums.	double pendulum;energy level;initial condition;video processing	Himanshu Jain;Ashish Ranjan;Kshitij Gupta	2013	2013 6th International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology	10.1109/ICETET.2013.50	classical mechanics;control engineering;double inverted pendulum;inverted pendulum;pendulum;spring pendulum;double pendulum;control theory;inertia wheel pendulum;furuta pendulum;kapitza's pendulum;physics	Robotics	73.21384657971585	-14.578705453475479	84203

Consistent relationships between the center frequencies and magnitudes of the vibration modes and the tested fly height, rotation speed, and track position are clearly observed and analyzed. It reveals that the CIVs excite and amplify only the resonance modes of the system. In consequence, the so-called PQ method is adopted to perform the compensator design. As such, the relative contributions to system output from the voice coil motor and lead-zirconium-titanate actuator subsystems can be well assigned in the frequency domain. The remarkable performance of the well-designed compensator is demonstrated by simulation.	civ (rail travel);disk storage;excite;hard disk drive;motion compensation;resonance;servo;simulation;voice coil;whole earth 'lectronic link	Deqing Huang;Venkatakrishnan Venkataramanan;Jian-Xin Xu;The Cat Tuong Huynh	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2013.2284147	control engineering;active vibration control;electronic engineering;engineering;vibration;vibration control;control theory;physics	Robotics	74.45773760266567	-17.691521457741	85108

In this paper, the position estimation is obtained by means of a high-frequency sinusoidal voltage signal injected along the estimated -axis. Several methods proposed in the literature obtain the position estimation by tracking the zero condition of the high-frequency current component. We propose a new approach that also exploits the -axis high-frequency current component and allows working with injected voltage signal of reduced amplitude, thus reducing noise and additional losses. The main contribution of this paper relies in the compensation of the motor end effects due to the finite length of the tubular motor armature. These effects must be taken into account in the motor modeling because they cause an error in the position estimation that varies with the motor position. The modeling of the phenomenon and a proper compensation technique are proposed in this paper. Last, a simplified integral-type controller is used to estimate motor position instead of the commonly adopted proportional-integral controller plus integrator, and this requires a low-effort design. Experiments on a linear tubular PM synchronous-motor prototype are presented to validate the theoretical analysis and evidence the feasibility of the proposed sensorless technique.	armature (computer animation);exploit (computer security);prototype;pulse (signal processing)	Francesco Cupertino;Paolo Giangrande;Gianmario Pellegrino;Luigi Salvatore	2011	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2010.2046577	control engineering;magnet;synchronous motor;electronic engineering;index term;engineering;electrical engineering;high frequency;control theory;armature;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	71.99076956931415	-12.913489561581798	85328

The robot can move very fast and, therefore, the motion is not only dexterous but also very fast. The paper considers, first, a set of control modes that are necessary and sufficient for the implementation of the dexterous motion. Then, a control program is designed for the implementation of the control modes, in which exploitation of the motor back-drivability and compensation of the motor friction, plays a key role. The paper also discusses a teaching program, based upon which an off-line teaching system has been implemented; dexterous tasks such as peg-insertion and side-matching, which are very fast, have been taught by the system successfully.	dd (unix);parallel manipulator	Masaru Uchiyama;Daisuke Sato	2003		10.1007/11008941_4	control engineering;simulation;delta robot;computer science;control theory;robot control;robot kinematics	Robotics	70.84786374993016	-22.27295089807006	85594

The hydraulic buck converter represents a promising concept, which meets these requirements. Part I of this publication has shown that for a convenient control performance a model-based control should be applied. In this paper a flatness-based controller for linear hydraulic motion control with a sub-kilowatt hydraulic buck converter is presented. A simple model-based on an averaging of the switching converter is employed to derive a flatness-based controller combined with a nonlinear observer to estimate all system states only from a position signal. Its performance is studied by simulations and experiments for large ramp type and sinusoidal motions of a heavy mass. Comparison of motion quality and energy consumption are made between the converter and a standard hydraulic proportional drive using a servo-valve instead of the switching converter.

By exploiting its high degrees of freedom, Magneto is able to deform its body shape to squeeze through gaps of 23cm, which is smaller than standard human entry portholes of industrial confined spaces. Its compact foot design of footprint 4cm allows Magneto to walk on narrow beams of thickness less than 5cm, even at varying separation. The inherent high dimensional system design enables the body to be positioned in a wide range of orientations and seamlessly switch a limb function from locomotion to manipulation mode mid-climb. This capability enables access to confined space openings and occluded pockets and navigation through complex 3-D structures previously not demonstrated on legged climbing robots.

The novel SUR employs a spherical hull and equipped with multiple vectored water-jet-based thrusters. This paper focuses on the preliminary design of the novel spherical underwater robot’s structure. Based on the structure, the finite element analysis is used to test the strength of structure and the feasibility of the concept. Meanwhile, the simulation of the robot’s dynamics and kinematics is also finished to verify the stabilisation and validity of the new structure. On the basis of the structural characteristics of the spherical robot, its dynamic model is derived by applying the Lagrange-Routh equations briefly. A 3D model of robot is built by CATIA and finite element method is applied base on the model. Then the model is exported to ADAMS for simulation. The results of simulation by combining MATLAB/Simulink with ADAMS are presented. The simulation results indicate that the proposed virtual prototype system has the capability of simulative demonstration and performance validation, and can provide an innovative approach for AUV graphic simulation.	angularjs;catia;control theory;experiment;finite element method;iteration;matlab;mathematical model;motion planning;numerical analysis;prototype;robot;simulation;simulink	Yaxin Li;Shuxiang Guo;Chunfeng Yue	2015	IJMA	10.1504/IJMA.2015.068449	control engineering;simulation;engineering;robot kinematics;robot calibration;mechanical engineering	Robotics	70.92438738381229	-20.869864045717524	87786
efbe69a34341f910918f56ba60da436030006901	soil mechanical impedance discrimination by a soft tactile sensor for a bioinspired robotic root		Abstract. During the penetration into the soil, plant roots experience mechani-cal impedance changes and come into contact with obstacles which they avoid and circumnavigate during their growth. In this work, we present an experimen-tal analysis of a sensorized artificial tip able to detect obstacles and discriminate between different mechanical impedances in artificial and real soils. The conic-al shaped tip is equipped with a soft capacitive tactile sensor consisting of dif-ferent elastomeric and conductive layers. Experimental results show that the sensor is robust yet sensitive enough to mechanical impedance changes in the experimented soils. Keywords: Soft tactile sensor, sensorized tip, plant root, soil impedance. When a plant root comes into contact with obstacles to its growth, it adopts efficient strategies to circumnavigate the barriers and to direct its growth towards low imped-ance pathways [1]. Therefore, the apex must be able to experience changes in me-chanical impedance related to constraints provided by the soil or soil compaction. In a robotic implementation, the artificial root must be equipped with a sensing system able to detect barriers to growth and to discriminate between different mechanical impedances of the soil [2]. To this aim, we developed a soft capacitive tactile sensor, built from a combination of elastomeric and conductive layers. The sensor was inte-grated in a conical artificial tip made of acrylic resin material by rapid prototyping (Fig. 1D), which shape is conical, as recently suggested for a root apex inspired arte-fact [3]. The sensor (Fig. 1A, 1C) consists of two parallel circular electrodes (5mm diameter, 70μm thickness), made of soft and unstretchable copper/tin coated woven fabrics, and separated by a spin coated silicone elastomeric dielectric film (300μm thickness). Similar materials were proven appropriate for highly sensitive soft tactile sensing [4]. However, in this work an additional layer made of a compliant and robust silicone material (Sugru	nominal impedance;tactile sensor	Chiara Lucarotti;Massimo Totaro;Lucie Viry;Lucia Beccai;Barbara Mazzolai	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-09435-9_45	materials science;structural engineering;ceramic materials;composite material	Robotics	76.2345132883848	-23.065521806962888	87999
4213410750323db31c2ac66efea6a48d3dfc280d	multivariable control systems - an engineering approach	multivariable control system	ion is a key feature of control engineering. To realise that the dynamic behaviour of an aircraft can be represented with the same tools, and even equations, as a distillation column provides a platform to conceive control systems in a generic way. But this common framework for representing the dynamics of different processes does not mean that the particular characteristics of any process are included in the generic model. First, remember that a model is always a partial representation of a process. Second, it is worth remembering that the requirements, constraints, operating conditions and many other circumstances may be very different from one system to another. There are two basic approaches to getting the model of a process. On one hand, if the process is physically available and some experiments can be carried out, its dynamic behaviour can be captured and (partially) represented by a model, using “identification” and “parameter estimation” techniques [84]. On the other hand, if the operation of the process is fully understood and the governing principles are known, a first-principle model can be drawn, although some experiments should be carried out to determine some parameters. A model-based control may be developed and, in this case, the main steps in the design will rest upon the mathematical treatment of the global closedloop model [41].	control engineering;control system;estimation theory;experiment;input/output;linear model;linear system;polynomial;requirement;turing completeness;uncertainty principle	Pedro Albertos;Antonio Sala;Mohammed Chadli	2005	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2005.04.003	control engineering;electronic engineering;networked control system;control theory;mathematics	SE	74.18073274440219	-9.977233091204186	88126

We utilize wave transforms and signal filtering for passivating the delayed-communication channel and passivity/stability conditions are derived using scattering theory based on an end-to-end model of the teleoperation system rather than the communication channel alone. Contrary to a commonly held view, it is proven that the teleoperation system can remain stable when force measurement data of the master and the slave manipulators interactions with the operator and the remote environment are used. Experimental results on a soft-tissue task for a hybrid-type architecture and for round-trip delays of 60 msec and 600 msec show that using slave-side force measurements considerably enhances teleoperation transparency.	bilateral filter;broadcast delay;channel (communications);end-to-end encryption;interaction;point of view (computer hardware company);scattering theory;sensor;two-port network	Arash Aziminejad;Mahdi Tavakoli;Rajnikant V.

40f6965ee12a211f8640e554f3598eb3389919a9	a multi-configuration kinematic model for active drive/steer four-wheel robot structures	four wheel;z turn axis;kinematics;accelerometer;control law;active steer	In this study, a general kinematic control law for automatic multi-configuration of four-wheel active drive/steer robots is proposed. This work presents models of four-wheel drive and steer (4WD4S) robotic systems with all-wheel active drive and steer simultaneously. This kinematic model comprises 12 degrees of freedom (DOFs) in a special design of a mechanical structure for each wheel. The control variables are wheel yaw, wheel roll, and suspension pitch by active/passive damper systems. The pitch angle implies that a wheelu0027s contact point translates its position over time collinear with the robotu0027s lateral sides. The formulation proposed involves the inference of the virtual z-turn axis (robotu0027s body rotation axis) to be used in the control of the robotu0027s posture by at least two acceleration measurements local to the robotu0027s body. The z-turn axis is deduced through a set of linear equations in which the number of equations is equal to the number of acceleration measurements. This research provides two main models for stability conditions. Finally, the results are sustained by different numerical simulations that validate the system with different locomotion configurations.	robot	Edgar Alonzo Martínez-García;Erik Lerín-García;Rafael Torres-Córdoba	2016	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574714002938	control engineering;kinematics;automotive engineering;control theory;accelerometer	Robotics	69.34781106904951	-21.525671851208102	88389

Real soft tissues are nonhomogeneously elastic and uncertainly deformable and hence, during needle motions the planned path changes unknowingly. In this paper, a novel adaptive path planning of bevel-tip needles inside the uncertain brain tissue is presented. The proposed approach is based on minimization of a Lyapanov energy function used as the cost function which consists of 6 partial costs: path length, number of changes in bevel direction, tissue deformation, horizontal and vertical distances of the needle from target and the inverse distance from obstacles. Uncertainty is also modeled using three techniques; random distribution of elasticity, contamination of the brain image with imaging noise and the fuzzfication of obstacles. Uncertainty modeling helps the optimizer generate more reliable paths. The proposed needle path planning is simulated on a 2D modeled tissue on the basis that the needle's tip does not leave the 2D plane, meaning that (although the needle is rotationally flexible), the angle of needle's base and of needle's tip are always equal. Manipulation of needle's base has three possible states: stop in 0 degree (bevel-right), stop in +180 degree (bevel-left) and always spinning the needle's base (bevel-off). The proposed algorithm is designed so that the needle path does not get trapped into local minima and attractors. The main contribution of this work is in defining a novel and effective cost, namely bevel-change cost, in addition to application of a Lyapanov energy function of Hopfield neural network in needle path optimization.	algorithm;artificial neural network;elasticity (cloud computing);hopfield network;image noise;instruction path length;loss function;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;motion planning;robot;simulation;velocity (software development)	Nasser Sadati;Meysam Torabi	2009	2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering	10.1109/CSIE.2009.855	mathematical optimization;simulation;soft tissue;statistics;neuroimaging	Robotics	68.77027718250919	-23.8265210610653	88795

The basic idea of a haptic device is to serve force and/or position reflection to the operator; at the same time that is being used by the human operator to input the required commands. The original mechanical structure of the presented system implies important advantages over other existing devices. The mechanism is a modification of the 6-d.o.f. Gough platform where the linear actuators have been replaced by cable-driven pantographs. Avoiding the use of reduction gears by means of cable transmission allows a wide sensing bandwidth. Some experimental indices comparing the performance of the presented device are presented. The paper shows the geometrical model and the kinematic analysis used on the control algorithms of this interface. The hardware and software architectures used on the system, and the control schemes implemented on a multi-axis board, are detailed. This setup provides an open control architecture that allows the implementation and experimentation of several bilateral control schemes. The integration of the haptic device in a teleoperation simulator is shown. This simulator includes virtual robotic slaves and its dynamic interaction with the virtual environment. Finally, the results obtained in the virtual objects manipulation experiments are shown. A classical force-position bilateral control scheme was used for these experiments.	algorithm;apache axis;bilateral filter;characteristic impedance;experiment;haptic technology;kinematic chain;open control architecture;robot;simulation;six degrees of separation;software architecture;virtual reality	José María Sabater;José Maria Azorín;Rafael Aracil;Roque J.

The addition of vine-like growth to soft continuum robots opens up possibilities for creating deployable structures from compact packages and allowing manipulation and grasping of objects in cluttered or difficult-to-navigate environments. Helical shapes, with constant curvature and torsion, provide a starting point for the shapes and actuation strategies required for such applications. Building on the geometric and static solutions for continuum robot kinematics given constant curvature assumptions, we develop a static model of helical actuation and present the implementation and validation of this model. We also discuss the forces applied by the soft robot when wrapped around an object that deforms the static shape, allowing a quantification of grasping capabilities.	apache continuum;circuit complexity;geometric modeling;pitch (music);resultant;robot;routing;torsion (gastropod);triune continuum paradigm	Laura H.

A single degree of freedom low-mass tail is added to a 77.5 g, 18 cm long VelociRoACH legged robot with protective shell, which gives it the capability to dynamically self-right. Quasi-static analysis of terrestrial self-righting gives design requirements for the tail actuator. Dynamic simulation predicts that terrestrial self-righting is slower than aerial self-righting with a massive tail, but can be achieved without adding significant mass away from the base of leg support. Open-loop experiments on terrain with varying friction and roughness show that VelociRoACH can dynamically self-right using tail contact in as little time as 256 ms. Finally, an autonomous self-righting experiment on an obstacle with multiple step drops demonstrates that the robot can detect inversion and rapidly self-right while walking on challenging terrain.	aerial photography;autonomous robot;dynamic simulation;experiment;requirement;static program analysis;terrain rendering;terrestrial television	Carlos S.

Two sets of crane rails were divided into segments, their planes were adjusted, and the characteristic rail lines were defined. We used their profiles to define the positional and altitude deviations of the rails, the span and height difference between the two rails, and we also verified that they complied with the Eurocode 3 standard. We tested the method on crane rails at the hydroelectric power plant in Krško and the thermal power plant in Brestanica. We used two scanning techniques: """"pure"""" TLS (Riegel VZ-400) and """"hybrid"""" TLS (Leica MS50) scanning. This article's original contribution lies in the detailed presentation of the computations used to define the characteristic lines of the rails without using the numeric procedures from existing software packages. We also analysed the influence of segment length and point density on the rail geometry results, and compared the two laser scanning techniques. We also compared the results obtained by terrestrial laser scanning with the results obtained from the classic polar method, which served as a reference point for its precision."""	computation;crane equipment;laser therapy, low-level;numbers;power plants;ruby on rails;span distance;terrestrial television	Klemen Kregar;Jan Mozina;Tomaz Ambrozic;Dusan Kogoj;Ales Marjetic;Gasper Stebe;Simona Savsek	2017		10.3390/s17071671	electronic engineering;eurocode;computation;simulation;software;laser scanning;engineering;structural engineering;marsaglia polar method	Visualization	77.2836416993087	-17.609294065766584	89301

Three cases are studied: gravity gradient-dominated acceleration, equally-weighted gravity gradient and jitter accelerations, and gravity jitter-dominated acceleration. Results of slosh wave excitation along the liquid-vapor interface induced by gravity gradient-dominated acceleration indicate that the gravity gradient-dominated acceleration is equivalent to the combined effect of a twisting force and torsional moment acting on the spacecraft. The results are clearly seen from left-side up and right-side down oscillations of the bubble in the horizontal cross-section of profiles of rotating dewar for the oscillations driven by gravity gradient-dominated acceleration. Results of slosh wave excitation along the liquid-vapor interface induced by gravity jitter-dominated acceleration indicated equivalence to time-dependent oscillatory forces which push a bubble in the combined bubble motion of down-and-up and leftward-and-rightward as the bubble is rotating with respect to the rotating dewar axis. Fluctuations of fluid forces, torque and moment arm exerted on the dewar wall of the container caused by slosh wave excitations driven by the combined gravity gradient and gravity jitter accelerations are also simulated and investigated.	gradient descent;simulation	R.

ABSTRACT This paper discusses the utility of using simple stiffness and vibrations models, based on the Jacobian matrix of a manipulator and only the rigidity of the actuators, whenever its geometry is optimised. In many works, these simplified models are used to propose optimal design of robots. However, the elasticity of the drive system is often negligible in comparison with the elasticity of the elements, especially in applications where high dynamic performances are needed. Therefore, the use of such a simplified model may lead to the creation of robots with long legs, which will be submitted to large bending and twisting deformations. This paper presents an example of manipulator for which it is preferable to use a complete stiffness or vibration model to obtain the most suitable design and shows that the use of simplified models can lead to mechanisms with poorer rigidity.	elasticity (cloud computing);email;fax;jacobian matrix and determinant;optimal design;parallel manipulator;performance;robot;twisting properties	Sébastien Briot;Anatoly Pashkevich;Damien Chablat	2009	CoRR		structural engineering;control engineering;simulation;engineering	Robotics	71.94181589284361	-21.200119548259334	89714

From the results of dynamic tests, the fundamental frequencies of the Howa brick chimney are estimated to be about 3.06Hz and 2.69Hz in north-south and east-west directions, respectively. The natural modes and damping factors are identified by ARMAV (auto-regressive moving average vectors) model. The numerical model updating based on IEM (inverse eigensensitivity method) is applied to two models with two updating procedures; using only frequencies and both frequencies and mode shapes. The updating results show the mode shapes are very important to obtain the good results for the numerical model updating. From the results of the numerical model updating, the damaged areas are identified; these are found to correspond well to the position of the cracks of the static collapse test.		T. Aoki;D. Sabia;D.

e2a458a02e5f30d20eca3b230904e7b41f07bdce	a new dynamic modeling method to fixed machined joint interface	interfaces;modeling;fractal analysis	The concept of virtual material was developed for the first time when the flexible joint interface may be considered as a virtual material with the same cross area. The virtual material is rigidly connected with two components situated in both sides of flexible joint interface. By adding an element, a complex assembled part including a joint interface could be equaled as a simple component without any joint interface in order to simplify the complicated problem about flexible joint interface. The interaction between normal and tangential characteristics of fixed interface taken into account, a series of exact analytical solutions of elastic modulus, shear modulus, Poisson ratio and density were deduced from virtual material through Hertz contact theory and fractal theory. By using experimental results about a series of test specimens, the exact analytic expressions for virtual material’s parameters were verified in terms of qualitative comparison principle of resembling vibration shapes and quantitative comparison principle of the natural frequencies. The virtual material model vibration shapes are in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The relative errors between the virtual material model natural frequencies and the experimental ones are between -3% and 10%. © (2013) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

3171e9bf3c3a905ca26ff63bc52e01ea130cb2f8	capture dynamics modeling and simulation of the space flexible manipulator		The ground simulation based on the dynamics of the flexible manipulator capture is an important method for researching the docking characteristics. This paper proposed a capture dynamics modeling method, in which the space flexible manipulator was equivalent to a six dimensional spring-damper system. Utilizing the mechanical characteristics of the six dimensional spring-damping system to simulate the flexibility of the space manipulator, and the capture dynamics model was established by applying of the Newton-Euler method. This proposed modeling method considered the flexibility of the manipulator and avoided the complex modeling method of the flexible manipulator with large amount of calculation. The relative motion results between the capture mechanism and the captured mechanism and the stress results of the equivalent spring-damping system were obtained by numerical solution of the capture dynamics model. Then a simulation model was accomplished in the ADAMS software with the same parameters used in the theoretical model to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the capture dynamics model. The proposed capture dynamics model provided a theoretical basis for the ground simulation of the space flexible manipulator capture.	simulation	Simiao Yu;Zhiyong Qu;Shutao Zheng;Junwei Han	2016		10.1007/978-981-10-2663-8_32	control engineering;engineering;manipulator;modeling and simulation	Robotics	72.54838599993793	-19.132274482986986	90267

The membrane generates motion by means of the interaction between a preloading force and the compressive forces between the compliant electrodes surrounding the surface of the polymer. In particular, in this paper the preloading force is generated by a bistable nonlinear spring, which significantly extends the maximum stroke at the cost of a much more nonlinear behavior. To address this challenging problem, in this paper we reformulate the system dynamics in a quasi-LPV framework, and use LMI based optimization to tune a controller ensuring robust performance with respect to such nonlinearities. Since the state variables are not all measurable, we focus on a partial state feedback approach which permits to impose set-point tracking with a desired decay rate specification, overcoming some limitations of standard decay rate design techniques. Several experimental results are performed to validate the proposed approach.	bistability;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;polymer;positioning system;system dynamics	Gianluca Rizzello;David Naso;Biagio Turchiano;Alexander York;Stefan Seelecke	2015	2015 54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2015.7402090	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrode;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;actuator	Robotics	69.72511887345634	-11.134664468326502	90410

This is done by implementing a controller for a flexible robot arm with one degree of freedom on a system consisting of an IBM-AT and four transputers. It is found that a control system with transputers offers a great improvement compared with conventional digital control systems. Transputers can solve the common problem in control practice, Le. having very sophisticted controllers but not being able to implement them because they need too much computing time. However, transputers are not an optimal solution for more sophisticated control systems because of shortcomings in the scheduling mechanism.	control system;robot;robotic arm;scheduling (computing);transputer	A.

582bd5f55afc8f2fe7f5274a947a080f4ceab054	lem characterization of synthetic jet actuators driven by piezoelectric element: a review	lumped element model (lem);synthetic jets (sj);flow control;piezo-driven actuators	In the last decades, Synthetic jet actuators have gained much interest among the flow control techniques due to their short response time, high jet velocity and absence of traditional piping, which matches the requirements of reduced size and low weight. A synthetic jet is generated by the diaphragm oscillation (generally driven by a piezoelectric element) in a relatively small cavity, producing periodic cavity pressure variations associated with cavity volume changes. The pressured air exhausts through an orifice, converting diaphragm electrodynamic energy into jet kinetic energy. This review paper considers the development of various Lumped-Element Models (LEMs) as practical tools to design and manufacture the actuators. LEMs can quickly predict device performances such as the frequency response in terms of diaphragm displacement, cavity pressure and jet velocity, as well as the efficiency of energy conversion of input Joule power into useful kinetic power of air jet. The actuator performance is also analyzed by varying typical geometric parameters such as cavity height and orifice diameter and length, through a suited dimensionless form of the governing equations. A comprehensive and detailed physical modeling aimed to evaluate the device efficiency is introduced, shedding light on the different stages involved in the process. Overall, the influence of the coupling degree of the two oscillators, the diaphragm and the Helmholtz frequency, on the device performance is discussed throughout the paper.	acoustic cryptanalysis;actuator device component;anatomical orifice;approximation algorithm;body cavities;computational fluid dynamics;diameter (qualifier value);diaphragm (acoustics);displacement mapping;fitness approximation;flow control (data);flux qubit;frequency response;gain;joule;kinetics;lexm gene;loss function;lumped element model;multiphase particle-in-cell method;optimization problem;oscillator (cellular automaton);performance;piezoelectricity;principal component analysis;psychologic displacement;quantity;requirement;resonance;response time (technology);solutions;star height;stationary process;synthetic intelligence;velocity (software development);anatomical layer	Matteo Chiatto;Francesco Capuano;Gennaro Coppola;Luigi de Luca	2017		10.3390/s17061216	control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;flow control;mechanical engineering	Robotics	81.70644888404833	-15.022144408563438	91030

The adaptive friction compensator, which uses this modified model guarantees the convergence of the tracking error to a small residual set and at the same time the algorithm can easily be implemented on standard industrial controller architectures. The model clearly distinguishes the low and the high-velocity regimes. Accordingly, at low velocities the adaptive laws in the friction compensator tune only the parameters which characterizes the low-speed friction behavior (Striebeck friction) and at the high-speed regime the adaptive laws modify only the parameters which characterize the high-speed friction behavior (Coulomb and viscous friction terms). An off-line identification method for the friction model parameters is also presented.

An improved encoder based on the same principle is also presented with minor modifications to improve the resolution. Computer simulations and experimental work have shown that a suitable modification of the Vernier concept can result in an encoder that is superior to the existing ones.

However, the significant noise at low frequencies results in large orientation errors as a function of time. Controlled physical rotation of the gyroscope can be used to remove the constant part of the gyro errors and reduce low-frequency noise. As adding motors for this would increase the system cost, it would be advantageous to attach gyros to a rotating platform that is already built in the vehicle. In this paper, we present theory and results for novel navigation systems where an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is attached to the wheel of a ground vehicle. The results show that a low-cost MEMS IMU can provide a very accurate navigation solution using this placement option.	angularjs;bandwidth (signal processing);course (navigation);dead reckoning;gyro;gyroscope;inertial navigation system;instability;microelectromechanical systems;optic axis of a crystal	Jussi Collin	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2345847	control engineering;embedded system;navigation;electronic engineering;gyroscope;engineering;sensor;noise;low frequency;fictitious force;accelerometer;measurement	EDA	74.30331056276952	-21.77098704483125	91857

Prior research has shown that a non-MP (NMP) system can be discretized to an MP system using either a zero-order hold (ZOH) or a square-pulse sample-and-hold input (SHI). This paper investigates the MP characteristics of the discrete-time (DT) system obtained by discretizing a continuous-time single-input single-output NMP system using different SHIs. Two new SHIs (forward and backward triangular) are studied in addition to the square pulse. Numerical simulations were adopted for studying the MP property of the resulting DT system as a function of sample-and-hold parameters. The simulation results show that it is possible to find a smaller sampling period that results in an MP DT system using the proposed SHIs compared with the ZOH. The q-Markov cover system identification with pseudorandom binary signal was then used for a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation study. A resistor-capacitor filter was used to represent the implementation error of the SHI due to unmodeled actuator dynamics. The HIL simulation results show that the proposed SHI scheme is robust to actuator modeling error. The MP properties of the DT systems with three SHIs are compared. The results show that the forward triangle SHI has the best performance due to its robustness to unmodeled actuator dynamics and the capability of retaining the MP property of the discretized system at small sampling periods.	cover system;discretization;duty cycle;hil bus;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;markov chain;minimum phase;non-volatile memory;numerical analysis;numerical integration;numerical linear algebra;pseudorandomness;sample and hold;sampling (signal processing);software studies;system identification;zero-order hold	Yingxu Wang;Rouhollah Jafari;Guoming George Zhu;Ranjan Mukherjee	2016	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2016.2519844	computer simulation;control engineering;pole–zero plot;electronic engineering;digital control;engineering;control theory;feedback;mathematics	Embedded	71.50053245828695	-10.93573617217562	92102

This makes it complicated to control the parallel robots. Therefore, the design of parallel mechanisms with decoupled motions is an important and challenging issue in the parallel robotic field. However, research in this field, including the definition and type synthesis theory, is weak or lacking. In this paper, the reducible correlation between the input and the output of 3-DOF translational mechanisms with decoupled motions is investigated and the definition of this topic is presented. A new parameter named Gf coordinate is propsed for the synthesis of 3-DOF reducible translational mechanisms. The type synthesis theory for this kind of mechanisms is obtained and some reducible mechanisms are synthesized.	grammatical framework;jacobian matrix and determinant;parallel manipulator;robot;the matrix	Feng Gao;Yong Zhang;Weimin Li	2005	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574704000980	pure mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	AI	69.16758084974052	-20.54829007877213	92121

Since they have considerable advantages in comparison with electric drives, it would be desirable to extend their application to dynamic continuous path (CP) control, too. From this point of view these systems have the following specialties: a) the most important phenomena influencing their behavior as, e.g., warming up of the sliding surfaces, are determined by local effects, and cannot be controlled globally; b) the friction forces show discontinuous variation at the zero transition of the piston's velocity that is a locally nonlinearizable nonlinearity. A common proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) controller may generate a noise-like acceleration signal due to feeding back the effects of such fluctuations. Warming up of the working fluid during operation influences these friction properties, too. Dynamic interaction between the system and its environment neither measured nor modeled by the controller is another agent influencing the system's observable behavior. For this purpose a special controller was elaborated. It implements certain adaptivity to compensate the effects of the inaccurate model and the unknown external disturbances, and also contains a nonconventional noise filtering technique to reduce the effect of the fluctuating friction forces. In the paper the control method is described, and then its capabilities are illustrated via simulation results.	adaptive filter;critical point (network science);cylinder seal;cylinder-head-sector;emoticon;external ray;game controller;nonlinear system;observable;pid;point of view (computer hardware company);programming paradigm;rejection sampling;servo;simulation;velocity (software development)	József K.

An effective dispensing method using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) at the end of the dispensing sequence with Artificial Immune System (AIS) automatic dispensing parameter fine tuning capability is proposed by optimizing the components of Dispensing Time and Stopping Time Delay to obtain constant and accurate reading from the precision balance scale. Based on the new dispensing sequence, experimental tests had been carried out using different materials with varying viscosities. The results denote that the combination of both PWM and AIS techniques would minimize the error rate for overshooting while exhibiting better accuracy. These are important in order to overcome the limitations of the conventional volumetric dispensing and manual parameter tuning presently applied in the dispensing system used in the coatings industry.	algorithm;artificial immune system;pulse-width modulation	David F.

5c1c9a8c52372210a78a3b13d9aeb172515f26ff	active and semi-active adaptive control for undamaged and damaged building structures under seismic load		Abstract: During the lifetime of a structural system, many severe events such as earthquakes and strong winds may impact the system and result in potential damage. To mitigate the structural vibration and damage during these extreme events, control devices such as active and semi-active devices have received considerable attention because of their attractive characteristics. Active control devices are adaptable to any change and semi-active devices have the capability of offering the reliability of passive devices and the versatility and adaptability of active devices. In this research, a direct-adaptive-control method is used to control the behavior of an undamaged and a damaged structure using semi-active and active devices. In the adaptive control method, the controlled system is forced to behave like the model system which exhibits the desired behavior. The model of the adaptive control method is defined in a way to optimize the response of the controlled structure. The controller developed using this method can deal with changes that occur in the characteristics of the structure because it can modify its parameters during the control process. A magnetorheological (MR) damper is used as the semi-active device in this study, whereas a hydraulic actuator is utilized as the active device to control the behavior of the structure. The performance of a three-story building from the SAC project for the third generation of the control benchmark problem is studied by performing time–history analyses. The structure is subjected to different earthquakes and controlled by the direct adaptive control method. In the analysis of the structure, some stiffness reduction is assumed as a result of potential damage in the first story of the building. Also, the direct adaptive control strategy is used to optimize the response of the undamaged structure and to mitigate the damage impact on the performance of the controlled structure in the presence of noise for output measurements. The results of adaptive control method are compared with those of other control strategies. It is shown that the performance of the three-story building is improved using the adaptive control method. By assessing the results of different control approaches, it is found that the adaptive control method works more effectively than other methods and semi-active devices can provide reliable results.	semiconductor industry	Maryam Bitaraf;Stefan Hurlebaus;Luciana R.

This paper presents a five-phase permanent magnet brushless motor drive developed for an aircraft flap actuator application. The motor is designed to satisfy the load specifications with one or two phases open or with a phase short circuited, while a failure in the rotor position sensors is remedied through a sensorless strategy.

This paper presents a novel compensation method for commutation torque ripple reduction of Brushless DC motor (BLDC motor) with misaligned Hall sensors. First of all, by comparing phase current stable value with outgoing phase current detected at rising edge of the corresponding Hall signal, Hall sensors delayed or advanced installation is determined. And then, Hall sensors installation error angle can be obtained by deriving the relationship between three phase currents and error angle, which can be compensated by the optimal delayed angle for minimizing commutation torque ripple. At last, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the theories and the feasibility of the proposed method.

Each gate is slidable along the pipe surface and is coupled to a pair of parallel air conduits extending longitudinally along the pipe. The conduits are connected midway between their ends to a common movable pneumatic cylinder which receives therein a piston fixed to the exterior of the pipe. The conduits communicate with opposite ends of the cylinder, and serve as both an air line to the cylinder and an operating linkage which opens and closes the gates and which will not cause damage to the gates in response to differentials of expansion and contraction. A plurality of pipes thus equipped are serially connected to form an irrigation pipeline and the air conduits are interconnected at the pipe joints by flexible hose couplings which may be preset any time during each watering interval. The conduits are pressurized at the end of each interval to change the gates in accordance with a sequential irrigation plan without the necessity of the operator being present to manually open and close the gates.	artificial neural network;neural networks	V.

784cd27ecfdf86658594c0d56fcfb8abe2f99c06	a discrete-time approach to impulse-based adaptive input shaping for motion control without residual vibration	motion control;computacion informatica;cost function;adaptive control;fixed time;grupo de excelencia;input shaping;discrete time;input output;flexible structure vibration;ciencias basicas y experimentales;timing optimization;feedforward control;flexible structure;mechanical systems	Modifying a command or actuation signal by convolving it with a sequence of impulses is a useful technique for eliminating structural vibration in rest-to-rest motion of mechanical systems. This paper describes an adaptive discrete-time version of this approach where amplitude and timing of impulses are tuned during operation to match the system under control. Solutions giving zero residual vibration are formulated in terms of a quadratic cost function and constructed by iterative operations onmeasured sets of input–output data. The versatility of the approach is demonstrated by simulated test cases involving (1) amplitude optimization of impulses with fixed timings, (2) timing optimization of impulses with fixed amplitudes and (3) combined timing and amplitude optimization. The approach ismodel-free and directly applicable to multi-mode systems. Moreover, fast adaptation within a single rest-to-rest maneuver can be achieved. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It can eliminate the sliding friction between pin wheels and gears, and gain high transmission efficiency. The motion status of pin wheels in traditional dual-cycloid gear reducer is analysed in detail. Under the condition of pin wheels’ pure rolling, novel profiles of epicycloid and hypocycloid gears are designed. And then small involute teeth are added on the profiles, in order to constrain the tangential displacement of pin wheels. At last, kinematics simulation and experiment are employed to testify the validity and feasibility of the approach to the pure rolling cycloid gear reducer.	simulation	Yuan Song;Qizheng Liao;Shimin Wei;Lei Guo;Hongzhou Song;Lifeng Zhou	2014	IJMIC	10.1504/IJMIC.2014.060011	structural engineering;engineering;cycloid gear;forensic engineering;engineering drawing	AI	74.41963413232345	-21.137138230460327	95246

On the other hand, the bicycle with toddlers tends to be less-stable when start moving, low-speed biking and abrupt steering because it is hard to steer due to increasing the moment of inertia of the handlebars. Hence this study proposes a power steering system for electrically-assisted bicycles riding with a toddler. The power steering system is designed to allow a rider to steer the handlebars with a toddler as if steer the handlebars without him. The power steering system is mounted on a real bicycle, and its effectiveness is verified through experiments.	computer simulation;experiment;frequency response;numerical analysis;optimal control;steering wheel	Taiki Kowata;Naonari Sato;Masami Iwase	2013	2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2013.6696424	transport;simulation;steering;engineering;automotive engineering;torque steering;transport engineering	Robotics	72.53061574845486	-16.750587350950138	95248

This paper seeks to explore the nature of the contractile limit and the hysteresis observed by researchers during the actuation cycle. Maximum actuator dilation occurs when adjacent braid strands are forced against one another. Within this work this is analyzed mathematically and it is shown that by halving the number of strands used to create the braided shell the actuator’s contractile range can be increased by approximately 7%. This also results in a simultaneous peak contractile force increases of over 16%. These results are verified experimentally. Hysteresis due to friction between braid strands during muscle operation is also explored. The paper will show how consideration of the deformation of the strands allows the contact area and therefore friction to be calculated without the need for experimentally obtained data as in previous research. A mathematical model is produced and verified experimentally.

Many researchers have put a big effort in the design, modelling and control of continuum manipulators inspired by the octopus arm. New mathematical tools could be introduced in the robotics community and new sources of inspiration are needed in order to simplify the use of the continuum manipulator. A geometrical exact approach for direct model and a Jacobian method for the inverse model are implemented for a continuum manipulator driven by cables. The first experimental results show an average tip error of less than 6% of the manipulator length, and a good numerical performance to solve the inverse kinetics model.	triune continuum paradigm	Michele Giorelli;Federico Renda;Andrea Arienti;Marcello Calisti;Matteo Cianchetti;Gabriele Ferri;Cecilia Laschi	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-31525-1_36	continuum mechanics;computer science;artificial intelligence;inverse kinematics;control theory	Robotics	71.23355084090424	-21.884389634787954	95760

In the design of hexaslides for machine tool applications, stiffness as well as its variation within the workspace is important. The stiffness of any parallel kinematic machine and, thus, the accuracy depends on the pose of the tool platform. A stiffness model of a generic hexaslide is developed here considering the flexibilities in both the actuator and the legs of the hexaslide. The methodology adopted is based on the concept of the determination of stiffness of a group of serially connected linear springs. Based on the proposed model, the average stiffness and its variation along and about the Cartesian coordinate axes offered by three typical hexaslides, having the same foot print size, are estimated and compared. Other typical performance indices, i.e. workspace volume, workspace volume index (ratio of workspace volume to machine size), global dexterity index and global stiffness index, are also compared.	inverted index;stiffness;workspace	A.

A primal inner loop controlling the plasma-wall distance is first designed; the Reference Governor device is then tuned to modify, whenever necessary, the reference signals to the inner loop, on the basis of constraints due to voltage saturations on the power supply converters, limitations of currents in the active control coils, minimum clearance between the plasma surface and the vacuum chamber wall, maximum induced magnetic fields and forces on coils. As usual in model predictive paradigms, the reference signal modification is accomplished through an on-line optimization procedure which embodies plasma model forecasts computed along a finite time virtual receding horizon. The ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) tokamak is assumed as the case study. Numerical simulations are carried out on a finite elements nonlinear model taking into account induced currents in the passive structures. The proposed application shows how almost a hundred constraints can be managed on-line by the Reference Governor.	control theory	Massimiliano Mattei;Carmelo Vincenzo Labate;Domenico Famularo	2013	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2012.09.004	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory;nuclear fusion;tokamak;model predictive control	Robotics	73.2461493755751	-12.405593028248086	95855

In terms of a high-frequency force interpolating model, a multirate system with two levels up-sampling is introduced. The first level up-sampling achieves the haptic rendering with 1K Hz and the second level achieves the interpolating algorithm with 10K Hz or higher. Due to the slow velocity of dental training system, the complex virtual tooth surface can be regarded as a series of consecutive virtual tangent planes, in which the interpolating algorithm is designed with virtual wall model. Theoretical analysis proves that the multirate control algorithm can enlarge the range of virtual stiffness and improve the stability. Numerical and experimental results of a three degree-of-freedom haptic device demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	algorithm;broadcast delay;haptic technology;interpolation;numerical method;sampling (signal processing);time complexity;velocity (software development)	Xiaowei Dai;Yuru Zhang;Yonggang Cao;Dangxiao Wang	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-88518-4_4	control engineering;simulation;stability;computer science;engineering;high frequency;control theory;haptic technology;degrees of freedom;statistics	Robotics	68.8228720387708	-13.491788743379734	95926

An electrical resistor with shunt inductor is connected between the electrodes of the piezoelectric transducers, which transformed the vibrating energy into the electrical energy by means of the electromechanical coupling. The electrical equivalent circuit modeling has been developed for an electromechanical coupling system. The circuit parameters are determined by the modal analysis based on the finite element model. Some examinations are demonstrated for a thin plate. It is found that the introduction of the electrical shunt inductor is more effective than the simple electrical resistor termination because the electrical inductance cancels the equivalent shunt capacitance or damped capacitance between the electrodes.	piezoelectricity;transducer	Takao Tsuchiya;Yukio Kagawa	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30585-9_22	equivalent circuit;control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;finite element method;modal analysis;electromechanical coupling coefficient	NLP	80.94144245137849	-14.259635777463531	96818

This method adopts two schemes to improve the computational efficiency. First, it takes the advantage of the following geometric feature of most manipulators: For the first three-degree-of-freedom (DOF) mechanism (positioning mechanism), all the links are moving in a principal plane that is rotating about the base axis with respect to the ground. With this geometry, only three equations of motion per link, two equations for the forces in the principal plane and one equation for the moments which are perpendicular to the principal plane, are needed for the inverse dynamic analysis of the first three-DOF motion. Thus, the number of equations can be reduced to half. Second, this method adopts longitudinal and transverse force components at certain joints in the formulation of equations of motion. This eliminates the need of a simultaneous solution of many equations, which is necessary in conventional Newton-Euler method. Hence, this method is more computationally efficient than the many existing dynamic analysis methods. Two examples, one is closed-chain type and the other is open-chain type, are used as illustrations.	algorithmic efficiency	Shin-Min Song;Yueh-Jaw Lin	1989	J.

7dccd264f90f423a58eb21d75bffa749baee5fe8	novel design and kinematics modeling for delta robot with improved end effector		A improved delta robot with a novel transmission mechanism to reduce abrasion and a new configuration of end effector is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the traditional telescopic chain which employs prismatic pair is replaced by parallel mechanism with four rods hinged. The frication in the connection can be significantly decreased. The motor that drives the telescopic chin is fixed on the base so that the moving platform can reach high speed and high acceleration. As for end effector, it is designed as mechanical claws based on the principle of plane thread. This structure makes it better adapted to multifarious shapes of load. Moreover, the rigidity and the stability of the end effector are distinctly improved. In addition, the analysis of kinematics including inverse kinematics and direct kinematics is conducted on the simplified system. The analytical results are validated by the co-simulation that combines ADAMS with MATLAB. The study of the kinematics is the solid foundation for parameters optimization and further control.	co-simulation;delta robot;inverse kinematics;matlab;mathematical optimization;prototype;robot end effector;simulation	Liang Yan;Delong Liu;Zongxia Jiao	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7793342	control engineering;simulation;engineering;inverse kinematics;control theory	Robotics	71.63656553562215	-21.794000606984746	98449

This paper presents an approach to singularity analysis of the planar 3-RRR parallel manipulator. On the basis of screw theory, the motion/force transmission analysis of the manipulator is first achieved. The singularity is classified into three types: constraint singularity, input transmission singularity, and output transmission singularity, in which the last two ones can be investigated by two indices correspondingly. By using the proposed method, not only can all types of possible singularity configurations and their singular loci be identified, but their physical meanings are also explained in terms of their motion/force transmission performances, which make 3-RRR parallel manipulator more comprehensible.	computer case screws;emoticon;parallel manipulator;performance;singularity project;the singularity;transmissibility (structural dynamics)	Xiang Chen;Fugui Xie;Xin-Jun Liu	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33509-9_24	control engineering;parallel manipulator;computer science;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	69.75668134624334	-20.882391125987205	98714

This causes the system to practice slip mode, incipient slip mode and non-slip mode between object and gripper during the course of motion. It is a common practice among researchers to simplify this multi-phase friction to a single mode motion. This paper investigates the effect of such simplifications made in the dynamic model of Columb friction. Both on the predicted motion of the object and on the grasping force applied to hold the object in non-slip mode. A simple and yet sophisticated control law is also presented which shows good capability of tracking and force control at the same time.	level of detail;mathematical model;optimal control;robot end effector	Habib Ahmadi;Mohammad Jafar Sadigh	2008	2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision	10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795509	robot;control engineering;single-mode optical fiber;simulation;engineering;friction;slip;control theory;force;quantum mechanics	Robotics	74.14340549447299	-20.207778802395712	98767

This mode is especially useful in AFMs with high speed positioning systems with bandwidths of the order of ≈ 1/10 times the natural frequency of the scanning probe. We formulate this problem in an optimal control setting and employ multiobjective optimization techniques to design the regulating controller. Furthermore, we present a method to estimate the tip-sample interaction force and extract the sample topography information from this estimate. The overall scheme facilitates high speed imaging that can potentially exploit fast scanning devices without compromising on the bandwidth and resolution. Simulation results show a regulation bandwidth of 10−15% of the natural frequency of the probe.	atomic-force microscopy;bandwidth (signal processing);block cipher mode of operation;mathematical optimization;optimal control;simulation;topography	Gayathri Mohan;Chibum Lee;Srinivasa M.

Flexible bodies are described in terms of global deformations of a rest shape. The dynamical behavior of these bodies that most closely matches the behavior of ideal continuum bodies is derived, and subsumes the results of earlier Lagrangian dynamics-based models. The dynamics derived for the flexible-body model allows the unification of previous work on flexible body simulation and previous work on nonpenetrating rigid body simulation. The nonpenetration constraints for a system of bodies that contact at multiple points are maintained by analytically calculated contact forces. Frictional effects are also included. An implementation for first- and second-order polynomially deformable bodies is described. The simulation of second-order or higher deformations currently involves a polyhedral boundary approximation for collision detection purposes. >	scope (computer science);simulation	David Baraff;Andrew P.

21d5413a4f4d723923244a7ca9e9a006bc576abe	design, development and implementation of a biomechanical right-hand prosthesis: second stage		This document presents the development of a right-hand biomechanical prosthesis. This artificial limb provides range of motion to a person whose hand has been amputated at the wrist level, allowing them to grab objects through a cylindrical grip, lateral grip, tip grip and twisting of the wrist, helping the patient to perform daily activities like drinking water, holding pens, typing, and holding flat and cylindrical objects. This research is carried out in two phases: during the first phase a prototype was developed that allows for movement of the fingers using a system of links that integrates a micro controller commanded through signals relayed from an optical sensor placed 10 mm from the stump of the patient; in the second phase a prototype that improves the anthropometry and aesthetics of the prosthesis by taking measurements and 3D scanning of a human hand is developed, it also integrates the rotating movement of the wrist using a broached axle and cube system that allows the prosthesis to rotate 360° on its own axis, the battery dimensions are also reduced and it is placed on the back of the prosthesis; to ensure that the forearm is fastened, a low-weight socket is developed to accommodate the rotating system. About 70% of the components are 3D-printed and the remaining 30% are obtained through conventional machining processes. The result is a prosthesis that allows up to 37 sequences, featuring a non-invasive, easy to manipulate control system and a cost of less than 3,000 dollars, lastly, implementation of the prosthesis is done on a right-hand amputee, who manages to control the prosthesis within three months of daily practice.	3d printing;3d scanner;anthropometry;apache axis;control system;decision stump;durability (database systems);lateral computing;lateral thinking;microcontroller;prototype;simulation	Luis Fernando Cajamarca;Jorge Matute;John Calle;Fernando Yunga;Jose Vargas;Fernando Urgiles	2017	2017 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference (GHTC)	10.1109/GHTC.2017.8239283	prosthesis;simulation;microcontroller;rotation;wrist;thumb;range of motion;computer science;axle;control system	Robotics	78.8154712025	-22.012100597083634	99492

Continuous on-line estimation of the remote environment's impedance is performed, and is then used as a local model for haptic display control. Lyapunov stability of the proposed impedance adaptation law is demonstrated. A series of experiments is performed to evaluate the performance of this teleoperation control scheme. Two performance measures are defined to assess transparency and stability of the teleoperator. Simulation results show the superior performance of the proposed adaptive scheme, with respect to direct teleoperation, particularly in terms of increasing the stability margin and of significantly ameliorating transparency in the presence of large time delays. Experimental results, using a phantom omni as the haptic master device, support this conclusion.	broadcast delay;characteristic impedance;elegant degradation;emoticon;experiment;haptic technology;imaging phantom;interaction;lyapunov fractal;online and offline;optimal control;phantom reference;phase margin;simulation;telehaptic;telerobotics	Costas S.

This paper deals with a multiobjective optimization problem which is nonlinear, multimodal, and originally formulated. The previous work, however, had treated the actuator as a blackbox. The system model has been modified by integrating an actuator model into the robotic gripper problem. A generic actuation system (for example, a voice coil actuator) which generates force proportional to the applied voltage is considered. The actuating system is modeled as a stack consisting of the individual actuator elements arranged in series and parallel arrays in four different combinations. With the incorporation of voltage into the problem, which is related to both actuator force and manipulator displacement, the problem becomes more realistic and can be integrated with many real-life gripper simulations. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is used to solve the modified biobjective problem and to optimally find the dimensions of links and the joint angle of a robot gripper. A force voltage relationship can be obtained from each of the nondominated solutions which helps the user to determine the voltage to be applied depending on the application. An innovization study is further carried out to find suitable relationships between the decision variables and the objective functions.	decision theory;displacement mapping;entity–relationship model;evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;multimodal interaction;nonlinear system;optimization problem;parallel computing;pareto efficiency;piezoelectricity;real life;requirement;robot end effector;series and parallel circuits;simulation;voice coil	Rituparna Datta;Shikhar Pradhan;Bishakh Bhattacharya	2016	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems	10.1109/TSMC.2015.2437847	mathematical optimization;linear programming;control theory;mathematics;force;actuator	Robotics	72.73188048076142	-21.023113280693888	100039

The mechanization uses a low friction roller at the end of a two-link manipulator so that primarily the normal force is measured. With the normal force information and joint angle information, the surface normal direction is calculated and a position reference is calculated along the surface tangent. Experimental evaluation shows the algorithm works for a line, a concave arc, and a convex arc. Also, when different force levels are commanded or different controllers are used, the algorithm still performs well. Thus, the algorithm allows a constant force to be applied while following a surface whose shape is not known a priori.	algorithm	David E.

The fundamental idea is to combine small, high power motors with multispeed or continuously variable transmissions such that the effective torque-speed characteristics of the motor are """"spread"""" across a wider output speed range. This has the effect of allowing smaller, high speed motors to also deliver high torque at low speeds. Use of a multispeed transmission allows motor size to be reduced while increasing overall actuator power density in the process. This power density increase can be used to allow a much greater range of electrically-actuated robots to be implemented with distributed actuators and can be used to drastically reduce overall manipulator complexity. This paper discusses the transmission-based actuator concept from a low-level control standpoint, and demonstrates that the """"shifting action"""" of the transmission occurs in a way that is minimally obtrusive to the overall joint servo-control. It is shown that the gear-ratio only changes in situations where high acceleration is desired; the shifting of the transmission happens early in the move, occurs very rapidly, and settles to a final, fixed gear ratio very quickly. For the majority of the move, control objectives are essentially identical to those for available actuators. These results encourage further development of the concept for both robotics and automation applications."""	automation;robotics	T. C. Widner;William R.

8f2c0f032293c7cd0ed09356d3bb14664bc0445b	maximal singularity-free orientation subregions associated with initial parallel manipulator configuration		Reduced workspace is the main parallel robot disadvantage. It is generally due to the robot configuration, mainly the platform orientation constraint, the present work intends to find the maximum sphere within the orientation workspace, i.e., the singularity-free orientation regions. These regions are related to the platform orientation through Roll-Pitch-Yaw angles. Therefore, an optimization genetic algorithm is used to determine the initial platform orientation corresponding to the largest sphere volume. In this algorithm, the geometrical parameters and the direct and inverse singularities are the optimization constraints. The geometrical constraints may be studied using vectorial analysis. The reciprocity property from screw theory is implemented to analyze the direct and inverse kinematic. In this work it is used a methodology to verify the singularity closeness measure associated with direct kinematic. This measure is related to the rate of work done by each leg upon the platform twist. To determine how close is the parallel robot to a direct singularity a index value is proposed. It is considered that the passive joints reachable regions may be limited by a cone, whereby the cone symmetric axis is the same than the passive joint axis. In the optimization problem, the sphere volume, i.e., the maximal angular displacement of the moving platform around any axis is the objective function. Thus, the genetic algorithm individuals explore all feasible regions looking for an optimal solution.	maximal set;parallel manipulator	Luis Garcia;Alexandre Campos	2018	Robotics	10.3390/robotics7030057	gravitational singularity;control engineering;angular displacement;closeness;engineering;kinematics;mathematical optimization;work (physics);parallel manipulator;optimization problem;singularity	Robotics	69.80996651395914	-21.089964963047482	101076

In this paper, a new robot with hybrid joints was designed based on the two kinds of robots mentioned above. First, the connection mode between discrete and continuum joints was analyzed. It was found that when the axis of the discrete joint was vertical to the tangential direction of the continuum one, the robot's motion space could be extended. Second, the driving modes of continuum and discrete joints were introduced, and it was also introduced in detail how the continuum joint was controlled by the external ropes. Then the analysis of the dynamics model and kinematics simulation of the continuum joint was carried out, and it was found: There is effect on the control by gravity, and in the same condition, the tension of ropes is relatively larger with gravity. While the continuum joint can move smoothly without gravity and the effect by gravity does not change over the increase of the degree of elastic rod.	apache continuum;hybrid kernel;obstacle avoidance;optic axis of a crystal;robot;simulation;smoothing;triune continuum paradigm	Wenhuan Qian;Tao Mei;Jianghai Zhao	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2013.6739735	structural engineering;control engineering;motion control;simulation;articulated robot;gravity;engineering;ultimate tensile strength;elasticity;robot kinematics	Robotics	69.47285225516218	-22.023417904144342	101579

The main objective of this work is to suppress vibration at the free end of a single-link rotational robot subjected to a harmonic disturbance located near to the tip of the link The control architecture is made up of two independent control loops; the first loop is employed to control the position of the hub and the second loop is used to attenuate the vibration of the arm. The position control of the hub is achieved through a proportional integral derivative (PID) controller with feedforward gains. The active vibration control (AVC) is achieved implementing a linear parameter varying (LPV) gain-scheduling observer-based state-feedback controller. A pair of piezoelectric patches is used as actuator. The link is considered as a cantilevered beam, and its model is obtained using black box system identification techniques. The AVC loop is considered to be affected by one harmonic disturbance generated by a DC motor and one transient disturbance induced by inertial force from the movement of the rotational joint at the measure point. The arm is subjected to different joint trajectories and to different variations of the frequency of the harmonic disturbance. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the observer-based state-feedback controller for the rejection of unwanted vibration and its capability of increasing the damping of the structure.	black box;control engineering;control theory;dual loop;feedforward neural network;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;pid;piezoelectricity;rejection sampling;robot;scheduling (computing);settling time;system identification;the hub (forum);usb hub;zero suppression	Franklyn Duarte;Pablo Ballesteros;Christian Bohn	2014	2014 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2014.6981563	control engineering;active vibration control;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	68.62837841132297	-14.228736922073258	101658
bcf6a78b723e3d80709e26c91a2e89bddcbc1910	a method for high accuracy heading angle combined with ellipsoid calibration and bp neural network		Magnetometer is widely used to indicate the heading of vehicle by measuring the Earth's magnetic field. In this article, to solve the problem existing in 3D magnetometer, a method is presented for fitting a high precision heading angle. First of all, on the basis of analyzing the sensor working principle and error sources, the error model is established and the compensation algorithms is developed. Then using the ellipsoid fitting method to calibrate the magnetometer and the accelerometer simultaneously. After that, the maximum error of the heading angle of the magnetometer is about 3 degrees. This is due to the non-orthogonal coupling error between the axes of the magnetometer. The BP neural network method is used to fit its nonlinearity error. The results show that the heading angle error is controlled within 0.8 degrees.	algorithm;artificial neural network;course (navigation);ellipsoid method;nonlinear system	Xiewei Xie;Qiaoyuan Chen;Kun Ming;Chen Wang;Yufeng Jin;Guangyi Shi	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Real-time Computing and Robotics (RCAR)	10.1109/RCAR.2017.8311870	calibration;magnetometer;coupling;artificial neural network;ellipsoid;accelerometer;magnetic field;control theory;nonlinear system;physics	Robotics	75.32634241598751	-14.890978706961747	101849

776725a4a9c1c189576188e112834b7060edd66a	ppg-based heart rate estimation using wiener filter, phase vocoder and viterbi decoding		Accurate heart rate (HR) estimation from the photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal during intensive physical exercises is tackled in this paper. Wiener filters are designed to attenuate the influence of motion artifacts. The phase vocoder is used to improve the initial Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based frequency estimation. Additionally, Viterbi decoding is used as a novel post-processing step to find the path through time-frequency state-space plane. The system performance is assessed on a publically available dataset of 23 PPG recordings. The resulting algorithm is designed for scenarios that do not require online HR monitoring (swimming, offline fitness statistics). The resultant system with an error rate of 1.31 beats per minute outperforms all other systems reported to-date in literature and in contrast to existing alternatives requires no parameter to tune at the post-processing stage and operates at a much lower computational cost. The Matlab implementation is provided online.

By combining a modified Lagrange polynomial series solution, based on experimental observations, with Ritz and Ritz–Galerkin methods, the infinite modeling state space of a continuum manipulator is minimized to geometrical position of a handful of physical points (in our case two). As a result, a unified easy to implement vector formalism is proposed for the nonlinear impedance and configuration control. We showed that by considering the mechanical effects of highly elastic axial deformation, the model accuracy is increased up to 6%. The proposed model predicts experimental results with 6%–8% (4–6 mm) mean error for the Ritz–Galerkin method in static cases and 16%–20% (12–14 mm) mean error for the Ritz method in dynamic cases, in planar and general three-dimensional motions. Comparing to five different models in the literature, our approximate solution is shown to be more accurate with the smallest possible number of modeling states and suitable for real-time modeling, observation, and control applications.

5f92de18d4d0c2eded3b153f1fff8936a8b46abc	control of planar spring–mass running through virtual tuning of radial leg damping		Existing research on dynamically capable legged robots, particularly those based on spring–mass models, generally considers improving in isolation either the stability and control accuracy on the rough terrain, or the energetic efficiency in steady state. In this paper, we propose a new method to address both, based on the hierarchical embedding of a simple spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) template model with a tunable radial damping coefficient into a realistic leg structure with series-elastic actuation. Our approach allows using the entire stance phase to inject/remove energy both for transient steps and in steady state, decreasing the maximum necessary actuator power while eliminating wasteful sources of the negative work. In doing so, we preserve the validity of the existing analytic approximations to the underlying SLIP model, propose improvements to increase the predictive accuracy, and construct accurate, model-based controllers that use the tunable damping coefficient of the template model. We provide extensive comparative simulations to establish the energy and power efficiency advantages of our approach, together with the accuracy of model-based gait control methods.	amplitude damping channel;analytic signal;angularjs;approximation algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;coefficient;computation;control theory;inverted pendulum;linear algebra;modulation;performance per watt;radial (radio);radial basis function;requirement;robot;slip (programming language);series and parallel circuits;simulation;steady state;verification and validation	Gorkem Secer;Uluc Saranli	2018	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2018.2830394	fold (higher-order function);steady state;control engineering;actuator;inverted pendulum;control theory;gait;slip (materials science);mathematics;embedding;electrical efficiency	Robotics	73.24059400502031	-13.43546237688322	102150

The initial design, selection of major parameters, and air-gap magnetic flux density are estimated using the analytical model of the machine. The proportion of the Halbach array in the machine is optimized using finite element analysis to obtain a near-trapezoidal flux pattern. The machine is found to provide uniform air-gap flux density along the radius, thus avoiding circulating currents in stator conductors and thereby reducing torque ripple. Furthermore, the design is validated with experimental results on a fabricated machine and is found to suit the design requirements of critical spacecraft applications.	finite element method;r.o.t.o.r.;requirement;ripple effect;the machine	R.

The mechanical linkage provides a sure method of switching the media path from a face-down output mode to a face-up output mode, by directing media to the housing door whenever it is open, thus, allowing, the housing door to become an output tray. The preferred mechanical linkage includes a member pivotally connected to, and extending between, the door and the diverter, in such a way that pivoting the door also pivots the diverter to a lesser degree. The preferred linkage member includes an elongated slot or channel at one end for pivotally and slidably receiving a portion of the diverter, so that the linkage member may pivot and slide relative to the diverter, when the door is being opened and closed, until a point where the linkage member engages the diverter to rotate the diverter the required amount.	information retrieval	Beniamino Di Martino	2009			ontology;information retrieval;linkage (mechanical);computer science;communication channel	AI	82.67505628793434	-20.159273835737757	102304

Because the lunar surface is covered by regolith which implies an irregular and rough terrain, the rover has difficulty in moving. Therefore a new low-pressure wheel is recommended for high mobility performance and low power consumption with a less complex mechanism. A low-pressure wheel can change its contact shape and pressure distribution to account for terrain. The presented measurement is achieved by a new measurement instrument on the wheel, and we presented analysis model is conducted through analysis of terramechanics mobility dynamics of a low-pressure wheel with normal stress. These procedures are valuable for evaluating the longitudinal velocity of the low-pressure wheel on deformable terrain.	destructible environment;lunar lander challenge;rover (the prisoner);scroll wheel;velocity (software development);wheels	Shinichiro Narita;Masatsugu Otsuki;Sachiko Wakabayashi;Shinichiro Nishida	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980585	simulation;geodesy;pressure measurement;low-pressure area;pressure coefficient;stress;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	Robotics	74.54882328581776	-22.93159083644976	102701

The dynamic characteristics of gear box will directly influence the performance of wind turbine system, such as wind power conversion efficiency, weight lighten/power density and so on. This paper introduced the configurations of gear box in wind turbines, and summarized that planetary gear train (PGT) is most widely used gear box. Then, a nonlinear dynamic model coupled torsional translational degree of freedom is presented for a PGT with three planet gears, in consideration of manufacture and assembly errors and gear elastic deformation. By using the dynamic model, a single stage gear box (a PGT) in a wind turbine system is taken as a case study to discuss its dynamic characteristics, such as vibration characteristic, and load sharing characteristic among the planet gears, affected by support stiffness, manufacture and assembly errors. The work will provide a worthy reference for the wind turbine gear box design.	electric power conversion;mathematical model;nonlinear system;planetary scanner	Huimin Dong;Chu Zhang;Delun Wang;Shangkun Xu;Jun Qiu	2017		10.1016/j.procs.2017.05.331	machine learning;artificial intelligence;control engineering;wind power;differential (mechanical device);turbine;computer science;gear train;non-circular gear;energy conversion efficiency;vibration;transmission (mechanics)	HCI	74.76579146113899	-18.596682722533725	103179

In double parallel magnetic suspension, two floators and electromagnets are controlled with a single power amplifier. The feasibility of the zero-power control in double parallel magnetic suspension with mixed polarity is discussed. It is analytically shown that the condition for the system with a zero-power controller to be controllable is independent of the polarity.

The tip steering motion of the catheter is actuated in a tendon-driven manner. Two antagonistic groups of tendon actuation realize the distal tip deflecting with two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) allowing it to reach a considerable large spatial workspace without catheter shaft rotation. However, when modeling such bending deformation, the sequential rotation approach is easily misapplied. We address this problem and introduce a novel and unified modeling methodology based on the concept of simultaneous rotation and the use of Rodrigues' rotation formula. An accurate model is created for robotic catheters and also can be generalized to common multi-tendon-driven continuum manipulators. It is essential in achieving accurate control and improving autonomous execution of command tracking tasks.	autonomous robot;bending - changing basic body position;biconnected component;closure;european union;flip-flop (electronics);matlab;numerous;remote control;shaft device component;tendon structure;triune continuum paradigm;while;workspace	Peng Qi;Hongbin Liu;Lakmal D.

First, an analytical model is outlined to describe the processes involved in producing synchronous torques. This involves the consideration of the motor MMFs interacting with the slot permeances. The results from the implementation of the model are given for several different motor designs to calculate the synchronous torques. These highlight the way that the synchronous torque is a function of the MMF and slotting relationships. Measurement of the synchronous torque is not straightforward; however, a method of assessment is developed in this paper by using a deceleration test and other tests. The test results are fully described in this paper, and they illustrate that even with correct bar/slot combinations and skew, synchronous torques still exist in the machine.	incremental funding methodology;interaction	Peter Scavenius Andersen;David George Dorrell;Niels Christian Weihrauch;Poul Erik Hansen	2008	2008 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/08IAS.2008.29	control engineering;synchronous motor;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory	Embedded	73.53322742312673	-13.537678239127072	105742

Contrary to standard Stewart platforms, an industrial anthropomorphic manipulator offers a considerably larger motion envelope and higher dexterity that let envisage it as a viable and superior alternative. Our work is divided in two papers. In this Part I, we discuss the main challenges in adopting a serial manipulator as motion platform, and thoroughly analyze one key issue: the design of a suitable inverse kinematics scheme for online motion reproduction. Experimental results are proposed to analyze the effectiveness of our approach. Part II [1] will address the design of a motion cueing algorithm tailored to the robot kinematics, and will provide an experimental evaluation on the chosen scenario: closed-loop simulation of a Formula 1 racing car.	algorithm;control system;image scaling;inverse kinematics;kerrison predictor;motion planning;motion simulator;robot;scenario testing;serial manipulator;simulation;smith predictor	Paolo Robuffo Giordano;Carlo Masone;Joachim Tesch;Martin Breidt;Lorenzo Pollini;Heinrich H.

A conventional industrial sewing machine in cooperation with a scara robot manipulator is used for producing straight line seams in single pieces of rectangular fabrics. A force controller based on neural networks is implemented in order to control the robot end-effector motion so as to ensure that a desired tensional force is applied to the fabric throughout the process of the sewing. The force controller scheme is designed and closes the loop outside the standard robot control law. All the necessary algorithms are implemented and executed inside the robot's controller board. The 12-specimens of fabrics, which have been used for the robotized sewing experiment, represent a broad range of fabric types and compositions. The seams produced by the robot are compared with seams that are produced by a human operator under the same sewing machine conditions. The results reveal that the seams produced by the robot are comparable with that produced by the human operator and in few cases better.	network interface controller	Panagiotis N.

Afterwards, the singularities and workspaces are discussed. Then, the Lagrangian method was used to develop the dynamic model considering the interaction between the harvester and water waves. The results indicate that the proposed harvester allows harvesting 13.59% more energy than a conventional heaving system.

A state-space approach is employed for modeling a rotor-flux-oriented IM. The control law is derived by optimization of an objective function that considers the control effort and the difference between the predicted outputs (speed and rotor flux) and the specific references, with predicted outputs calculated using a linearized state-space model. The rotor flux and speed are estimated by using an extended Kalman filter. In this model, the load inertia is unknown, and the external load torque is considered to be a disturbance. Its amplitude is computed with the electromechanical equation or estimated by the Kalman filter. Simulated and experimental results show the good performance of this strategy.	algorithm;electrical load;extended kalman filter;inductive reasoning;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimal control;optimization problem;r.o.t.o.r.;state space	Eudemario Souza de Santana;Edson Bim;Wagner Caradori do Amaral	2008	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2008.2007376	kalman filter;control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;induction motor;vector control	Robotics	71.49171687083827	-12.891389977317358	106234

We consider the distributed robust detection of changes in the parameters of autoregressive (AR) models. Our method is robust on a single sensor level by suppressing the effect of outliers and impulsive noise via a robustified distance metric between a long-term and a short-term AR model. The new distributed change detector works without a fusion center and incorporates a weighting based on signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) information, to ensure that every node will, at least, maintain its single node performance. A Monte-Carlo simulation study is provided which compares the proposed detector to a centralized version, in terms achievable detection rates and mean detection delay. Furthermore, an application example of distributed voice activity detection for a noisy speech signal is given.	autoregressive model;centralized computing;fault detection and isolation;monte carlo method;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;speech segmentation;voice activity detection	Daniel Kalus;Michael Muma;Abdelhak M.

To realize higher performance, the design concept of the device is examined from the following three aspects. First, after the arrangements of the stored tether are categorized, the method of selecting the optimal one is considered to maximize the kinetic energy on the tether. Second, to minimize the resistance caused by the tether, a tapered case for the storage is proposed, expected to mitigate the friction between the tether and the case and to prevent the twist on the tether. Third, the way of anchoring the end of the cast tube is proposed. Finally, experimental results show the validity of the device designed on the proposed concepts, after the device is combined with an unmanned vehicle and a ropeway type robot.	categorization;cylinder seal;cylinder-head-sector;experiment;mobile robot;prototype;uncrewed vehicle;williams tube	Hideyuki Tsukagoshi;Eyri Watari;Kazutaka Fuchigami;Ato Kitagawa	2012	2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2012.6385520	remotely operated underwater vehicle;robot;control engineering;mobile robot;casting;simulation;pneumatic actuator;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;kinetic energy;resistance;force;quantum mechanics;fluid power;mechanical engineering	Robotics	75.80088258619536	-22.620450238016502	106973

This is achieved by reformulating the original method, termed group-SPICE, as a square-root group-LASSO with a suitable regularization level, for which a time-recursive implementation is derived. Using a proximal gradient step for lowering the computational cost, the proposed method may effectively cope with data sequences consisting of both stationary and non-stationary signals, such as transients, and/or amplitude modulated signals.

Control signal line connected to a delay means which vents the control line periodically to shift the liquid control valve to a closed position and to also shift an air control valve connected to the inflatable bladder to permit the bladder to be cyclically inflated and deflated to effect a pumping operation from the container. During deflation the container is refilled with fluid which during a cleaning mode of operation will be cleaning fluid but will be basting fluid during a basting mode of operation. In the basting mode of operation control of the liquid and gas control valve is also maintained by a timer to effect proper cycling of the control valve connected to the bladder and the liquid output line from the container. However, during the basting mode of operation it is necessary for the operator to position a finger over a control vent in the handle of the injector needle in order for the basting cycle to be initiated and in order for the cycle to continue. Thus, optimum control is provided for the operator. However, the timers provided in the pneumatic circuitry are adjustable for effecting the injection of a predetermined quantity of fluid as required for the particular circumstances.	algorithm;international standard book number;springer (tank)	Jordi Petit	2009	Computer Science Review	10.1016/j.cosrev.2009.01.001	computer science	Theory	82.89721569215452	-18.433298475113126	107253

Although the combination of flying and climbing mechanisms in a single platform extracts a weight penalty, it also provides synergies. In particular, a small amount of aerodynamic thrust can substantially improve the reliability of perching and climbing, allowing the platform to maneuver on otherwise risky surfaces.

Magnetic levitation system (MLS), using the electromagnetic force to float, rotate or move a suspended object, is a non-contact operation mode. This mode can effectively reduce the mechanical vibrations, friction and wearing loss caused by contact operation. Furthermore, it can also prolong the equipment's life, reduce maintenance frequency and noise. However, the MLSs possess the characteristics of nonlinear and dynamic properties, so a robust adaptive fuzzy controller (AFC) for magnetic suspension vibrator is proposed in this study. With the help of magnetic suspension vibrator, the electric power wheelchair can steer in a bumpy road and provide more comfortable riding environment for disabled people or patients.	automatic frequency control;embedded system;image noise;nonlinear system;vibrator (electronic)	Kuo-Ho Su;Tun-Hua Chang;Shun-Feng Su	2015	2015 IEEE 12th International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control	10.1109/ICNSC.2015.7116103	control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;noise;automatic frequency control;control theory;irrigation;robustness	Robotics	73.82506690367643	-17.193775314944354	107366

It is mechanically advantageous in terms of ease and cost of manufacture, low use of precision machined parts, power efficiency among the more significant features. However, control of the prototype gantry is not trivial. Inter-axis misalignment, manufacturing imperfections contribute to the difficulty of control. In addition to all the complexities of contemporary dualdrive gantries, our prototype's end-effector is actuated through a force with a fixed line of action. This causes a moment that de-synchronizes the motion of the parallel carriages. Furthermore, contemporary robust control schemes such as sliding mode control can excite hidden modes related to the flexure joints. An output-feedback control scheme that uses both an online parameter adaptation in conjunction with a robust integral signum of error (RISE) gain evolution is proposed. Experimental results show improvement of the proposed controller against a conventional RISE counterpart.	apache axis;excite;feedback;landline;performance per watt;prototype;robot end effector;robust control	Nazir Kamaldin;Si-Lu Chen;Chun Jeng Kong;Chek-Sing Teo;Kok Kiong Tan	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2016.7576940	control engineering;engineering;control theory;engineering drawing	Robotics	70.92757754402281	-18.64767841997782	107655

Recently, we proposed a revolute joint-based 3T1R 4-DOF parallel mechanism having Schonflies motions whose output rotational motion is a roll motion. This work proposes another type of a new 3T1R 4-DOF parallel mechanism having Schonflies motions whose rotational motion is a pitch motion. The position analysis and kinematic modeling for the mechanism are performed, and its workspace size and kinematic characteristic with respect to the kinematic isotropic characteristic are examined. To support high potential of the mechanism for real applications, three different versions are suggested and each motion capability is verified through its simulator.

The robot is modeled as a geometrically exact beam continuously actuated through an active strain law. Once included in the geometric mechanics of locomotion, the approach applies to any hyperredundant or continuous robot that is devoted to manipulation and/or locomotion. Furthermore, by the exploitation of the nature of the resulting model of being a continuous version of the Newton-Euler model of discrete robots, an algorithm is proposed that is capable of computing the internal control torques (and/or forces), as well as the rigid net motions of the robot. In general, this algorithm requires a model of the external forces (responsible for the self-propulsion), but we will see how such a model can be replaced by a kinematic model of a combination of contacts that are related to terrestrial locomotion. Finally, in this case, which we name “kinematic locomotion,” the algorithm is illustrated through many examples directly related to elongated body animals, such as snakes, worms, or caterpillars, and their associated biomimetic artifacts.	algorithm;biomimetics;euler;geometric mechanics;newton;robot;terrestrial television;triune continuum paradigm	Frédéric Boyer;Shaukat Ali;Mathieu Porez	2012	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2011.2171616	computer simulation;biomimetics;robot;control engineering;heuristic;mobile robot;dynamics;kinematics;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;robot locomotion;timoshenko beam theory;geometric mechanics;control theory;strain;internal control;computational model	Robotics	68.7823245891894	-22.876905086523504	107861

In this paper, the discussion is extended into multiple DOF case. First, the ideal responses of master-slave systems are defined. Secondly, new control schemes are proposed for different configuration and for isomorphic configuration arms, respectively.

0c0a9c3b626b0a7926214f081e092652956a5ed0	an approach of topology optimization of multi-rigid-body mechanism	multi rigid body;topology optimization;micro displacement amplifying mechanisms;statically determinate truss	Topology synthesis of multi-rigid-body mechanisms has always been a very important stage in the mechanism design process. In most cases, the topology of the multi-rigid-body mechanism for particular task is obtained by designers’ experience and ingenuity, rather than automatic approach. In this work, an approach of topology optimization of multi-rigid-body mechanisms is investigated. The core process of the approach is an automatic optimization design process. In this approach, we construct kinematics mapping from truss structures to the joint-linked mechanisms, which transforms the topology optimization problem of multi-body system into the truss structure optimization problem. We also develop a new strategy for topology optimization of statically determinate truss, the advantage of which lies in the ability dealing with statically determinate truss topology optimization problem compared to the existing methods. By automatically optimizing the topology of the truss structure, the topology of the multi-rigid-body mechanism is optimized automatically, accordingly. Here, we utilize the investigated approach to design suitable layout for multi-rigid-body micro-displacement amplifying mechanisms (MMAMs) with a large amplification ratio (>50). The layout consists of not only the topology information of the mechanism, but also the dimension parameters of the mechanism. The procedure of the approach is carried out in steps, and a human–computer interaction program has been developed for it. Using the developed program, different MMAMs are achieved. Meanwhile, the direct kinematics analysis of the MMAMs is achieved automatically, the existence of dead point position in the mechanism within movement range is checked and the micro-displacement amplification ratio is calculated out. The computing results are validated by the ADAMS® motion simulation, which proves that the achieved MMAMs fully fulfill the functional requirement. Along with two of the achieved MMAMs, the approach is explained, its functionality is shown, its advantages, limitations, some open problems and future works are discussed.	mathematical optimization;topology optimization	Hao Wang;Weidong Yu;Genliang Chen	2017	Computer-Aided Design	10.1016/j.cad.2016.12.002	structural engineering;topology optimization;simulation;engineering;geometry;engineering drawing;mechanical engineering	EDA	71.63093149677967	-20.760373673335394	108902

8a1e13a771da67fd4d1de06fdb8b4b75f2343868	a novel low velocity robotic penetrator based on ampere force		The subsurface access technology is of great significance to study evolution of stars and probe landing, and the low velocity robotic penetrator (LVRP) is a commonly used detection technique. In this study, a novel LVRP based on ampere force (AFRP) is proposed, which uses the ampere force of the coils located in high intensity magnetic field as the driving force. The AFRP is composed of stator and mover. In the working state, the mover is subjected to a linear reciprocating motion, colliding with the stator, and displacement occurs. Firstly, parametric modeling of AFRP is carried out and the internal magnetic field distribution is analyzed. The results show that the magnetic induction between the two poles can be increased by the relative mounting of the permanent magnets, and the magnetic induction is affected by the gap and the diameter of the permanent magnets. Then, ISIGHT® software is used for integrated optimization, whose purpose is to optimize the design variables and make the output force of each unit reaches the maximum when the casing size of the AFRP is certain. Furthermore, to achieve the optimization design goal that the overall output force is maximum. According to the optimization results, the prototype was developed. The experimental results show that the AFRP operating frequency can be controlled in the range of 1 ~ 10 Hz, the average displacement of each motion cycle is 2 mm. The proposed AFRP can output a larger driving force by changing the current and the number of units. In addition, the AFRP can be used as a novel actuator for robots.	velocity	Jingkai Feng;Jinguo Liu;Feiyu Zhang	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-65298-6_55	parametric model;control theory;ampere;electromagnetic induction;engineering;control engineering;actuator;reciprocating motion;magnet;magnetic field;stator	Robotics	75.34408612400665	-18.409505028794115	109332
83606508eb8db07b2797fa54b8289f4e3e1f8842	generating vibration free rest-to-rest trajectories for configuration dependent dynamic systems via 3-segmented input shaping		Ahstract- This paper presents a new method to generate vibration free rest-to-rest (RTR) trajectories for configuration dependent dynamic systems, such as robots, cranes or machine tools. The new method named 3-Segmented Input Shaping is based on a combination of the widely known Input Shaping method and a new trajectory segmentation strategy for piece wise shaping of the trajectory. The new segmentation strategy facilitates the capability of accounting for variations in system dynamics during motion by shaping acceleration and deceleration profiles with individual frequencies. In this paper the new segmentation strategy is used in combination with the bang-coast-bang (BCB) trajectory. The generated trajectories are described in closed form, hence requires no optimization and thereby provides strong computational performance. The new method is verified by numerical simulations and detailed analysis and shows great potential in vibration-free RTR trajectory generation for systems with configuration dependent dynamics.	bang file;bang-bang robot;c++builder;computation;computer simulation;dynamical system;image scaling;industrial robot;input shaping;mathematical optimization;noise shaping;numerical analysis;optimization problem;polynomial;real-time recovery;system dynamics;velocity (software development);zero suppression	Dan Kielsholm Thomsen;Rune Soe-Knudsen;David Brandt;Ole Balling;Xuping Zhang	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2018.8460865	acceleration;control engineering;dynamical system;computer simulation;control theory;engineering;system dynamics;trajectory;input shaping;machine tool;vibration	Robotics	71.2858672930221	-14.277488088338352	109572

SMA wires are divided into many segments and their thermal states are controlled individually in a binary manner. The Peltier effect is used for heating and cooling individual segments of the SMA. Unlike the traditional way of controlling the wire length by driving a current to the entire SMA wire, the new method controls the binary state (hot or cold) state of each segment. The total displacement is then proportional to the number of the segments having the heated state, i.e. austenite phase. This architecture has three salient features, which would overcome fundamental difficulties of SMA. 1) Although the inherent property of SMA is highly nonlinear and uncertain with a prominent hysteresis, the binary state/phase control does not depend on the complexity of SMA state transition. 2) With use of the Peltier effect thermoelectric devices the response of SMA becomes more controllable, stable, and more accurate compared to the traditional air cooling and electric wire heating. 3) By operating at the heated state, SMA shows considerable load disturbance rejection compared to traditional methods. First, the basic principle and architecture of the segmented SMA actuator system are described. Initial implementation and feasibility tests are then presented, followed by discussion of the experimental results.	air cooling;computer cooling;diagram;displacement mapping;hysteresis;line level;nonlinear system;operating point;rejection sampling;sma*;state transition table;steady state;wire wrap	Brian Selden;Kyu-Jin Cho;H.

IPMC energy consumption model is pretty critical to help improve it. Based on the physical properties of the IPMC material and the hydrodynamic reactive force theory, the energy consumption and accelerating velocity models are proposed. The model shows its precision by comparing with the experimental data. By embedding in the multi-objective compatible control algorithm, the model is applied to the energy-saving control of the IPMC propelled robotic fish. The control result shows the validity of the model and control algorithm.	algorithm;biomimetics;ionic;polymer;robot;simulation;velocity (software development)	Qingsong Hu;Hua Zhou	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2009.5420483	acceleration;robot;control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;propulsion;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;physical property;quantum mechanics;actuator;mechanical engineering	Robotics	75.48749753232643	-22.759259328135073	109862

This model can then be used to design controllers with the goal of achieving a desired shape of the beam. The control scheme can be used for several applications, e.g., vibration control in structures or shape control for high-precision structures like inflatable space reflectors. The starting point of the control design is modeling for control. We do this in the framework of port-Hamiltonian (pH) modeling, which has favorable properties, such as passivity and a Hamiltonian representing the energy and serving as a Lyapunov function, that can be exploited for controller design. An important property of the pH modeling framework is that it facilitates modeling multiphysics systems or systems which consist of several subsystems, where all parts are modeled separately and then can be interconnected easily. This is possible because any interconnection of finite dimensional pH systems yields again a finite dimensional pH system. Hence, the pH framework is useful for our multidomain modeling purpose.	control engineering;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);interconnection;lyapunov fractal;mathematical model;multiphysics;nonlinear system;piezoelectricity	Thomas Voss;Jacquelien M.

3e585d54d27e2c23bcf045cb702f202c23f3f056	forceful manipulation with micro air vehicles		Micro air vehicles (MAVs) are finding use across an expanding range of applications. However, when interacting with the environment, they are limited by the maximum thrust they can produce. Here, we describe FlyCroTugs, a class of robots that adds to the mobility of MAVs the capability of forceful tugging up to 40 times their mass while adhering to a surface. This class of MAVs, which finds inspiration in the prey transportation strategy of wasps, exploits controllable adhesion or microspines to firmly adhere to the ground and then uses a winch to pull heavy objects. The combination of flight and adhesion for tugging creates a class of 100-gram multimodal MAVs that can rapidly traverse cluttered three-dimensional terrain and exert forces that affect human-scale environments. We discuss the energetics and scalability of this approach and demonstrate it for lifting a sensor into a partially collapsed building. We also demonstrate a team of two FlyCroTugs equipped with specialized end effectors for rotating a lever handle and opening a heavy door.		Stefano Mintchev;David L. Christensen;Mark R.

43e7a4a0b74ab8e9b97b1b57d89cde3f29a17eb7	snam: a simulation software on serial manipulators		The solution of kinematics problems for serial manipulators is fundamental for their synthesis, analysis, simulation, and computer control; for this reason, this paper introduces a public domain package and open software called SnAM (Serial n-Axis Manipulators), which is developed under the ADEFID (ADvanced Engineering soFtware for Industrial Development) framework, where the manipulator is conceptualized as a derived class from CRobokin, CMachine and CIpiSModel, which are fundamental ADEFID classes. SnAM has been developed with efficient algorithms in a closed-loop solution to solve direct kinematics, whereas for the case of inverse kinematics, matrix formulation, elimination and numerical methods are implemented. Furthermore, for the architecture definition, the user is able to display a dialog box in which the design parameters are set based on the Denavit–Hartenberg convention with the aid of sliding bars, while the solid model is updated simultaneously showing the actual configuration. Since ADEFID provides tools to graphical interface with embedded control components SnAM adopt them to not only simulate virtually, but also with an adaptive prototype designed for this purpose. Furthermore, SnAM assists the user in tasks related to trajectory planning, collision-avoidance and three-dimension objects scanning.	algorithm;apache axis;computer control company;denavit–hartenberg parameters;embedded system;graphical user interface;inverse kinematics;matrix mechanics;numerical method;online and offline;open-source software;prototype;serial manipulator;simulation software;solid modeling;dialog	Max A.

The predicted forces can be used to model the closed loop behavior of a controller that servoes the joints of the excavator so as to fill the bucket. In this paper, we extend the state of the art in two ways. First, we present a reformulated version of the classical Fundamental Equation of Earthmoving often used to model soil-tool interaction. The new model includes consideration of previously unaccounted phenomena in the interaction of an excavator bucket as it moves through soil. Secondly, given that soil properties can vary even within a work site, we present an on-line method to estimate soil parameters from measured force data. Finally, we show how the predicted resistive force is used to estimate bucket trajec-tories.	approximation error;brute-force search;closed-loop transfer function;coefficient;computation;converge;excavator (microarchitecture);online and offline;randomness;rate of convergence;simulated annealing;xfig	Oscar Luengo;Sanjiv Singh;Howard Cannon	1998		10.1109/IROS.1998.724873	excavator;identification;control engineering;simulation;systems modeling;servo;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;automatic control;control theory;predictive modelling	HCI	72.11750499318845	-15.226001144089006	110908

Moreover, in order to extract the maximum operating capability of the machine with inverter and magnetic saturation, accurate determination of dq-axis inductances over a wide speed range is essential. In this paper, a comparative analysis of three inductance determination methods based on stand-still and moving conditions of the machine is performed. The chosen test methods for measurement and calculation of d- and q-axis inductances are validated experimentally using a laboratory interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (IPMSM) prototype. Merits and demerits of these methods are thereafter analyzed comprehensively in terms of complexity of the methodology implemented, accuracy of parameters determined taking into account effects due to harmonics and temperature, scope and applicability of each of the test methods.	blocked rotor test;complexity;experiment;extended validation certificate;load testing;optic axis of a crystal;power inverter;prototype;qualitative comparative analysis;r.o.t.o.r.

This framework is used to reduce the number of state variables of a turbocharged Diesel engine by sequentially omitting the pressure dynamics, the turbocharger inertia, and the thermal dynamics. By comparison to a dynamic simulation using the resulting optimal control inputs, the effects of neglecting these dynamics are assessed. A physics-based combustion model is used in combination with an extended mean-value model for the air path, and a segment of 295s of the World-Harmonized Transient Cycle is considered. The methodology bridges the gap between stationary engine calibration and dynamic optimisation. It reveals which control signals can be represented by lookup maps. For the remaining dynamic control paths, optimal feedforward maps are obtained. Furthermore, the results indicate suitable feedback variables and provide optimal reference maps.	automatic identification and data capture;control flow;control system;diesel;dynamic problem (algorithms);dynamic simulation;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;lookup table;mimo;map;mathematical optimization;microsoft outlook for mac;numerical partial differential equations;optimal control;stationary process	Jonas Asprion;Oscar Chinellato;Christopher H.

a9ca0fe0677453d10970932eacf829eb2fa31f6e	adaptive synchronization tracking control of dual-driving feed system for gantry-type machine tool		The dual-driving feed system is widely used in highspeed/high-precision CNC machine tools due to its high rigidity. However, when the column moves along the beam, the load parameters of the dual-driving two axes will change, which results in non-synchronous error and affects the machining accuracy. For this problem, an adaptive synchronization tracking control (ASTC) strategy of dual-driving feed system for gantry-type machine tool is proposed. In this control frame, active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) evaluates and compensates the influence of the internal and external disturbances, realizing the decoupling control of the dual-driving feed system. Besides, the equivalent load masses of the dual-driving two axes can be obtained according to the position of the column on the beam, and the ASTC automatically tunes the controller gains of each axis according to the corresponding load mass. The simulation results show that the proposed ASTC has better tracking performance and dual-driving synchronization performance.	adaptive scalable texture compression;apache axis;control theory;controllers;coupling (computer programming);deny (action);dual;game controller;gantry;genus axis;muscle rigidity;rejection sampling;simulation	Chengyong Zhang;Yaolong Chen	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216500	machining;control engineering;beam (structure);engineering;control theory;machine tool;transfer function;numerical control;synchronization;control theory	Robotics	68.49985917825599	-14.44057267502851	112055

The proposed manipulator hand consists of two series modules, i.e., an upper and lower modules. Each of them consists of a parallel kinematics chain with a glass pipette (1 mm diameter and 3–10 cm length) tapered to a very sharp end as an end-effector. It is driven by three piezo-electric actuated prismatic joints in each of the three legs of the parallel kinematics chain. Each leg of the kinematics chain has the prismatic–revolute–spherical joint structure. As the length of the glass pipette end-effector is decreased, the resolution and accuracy of the micro–nano manipulator hand is increased. For long lengths of the glass pipette end-effector, this manipulator works as a micro manipulator and for short lengths it works as a nano manipulator. A novel closed-form solution for the problem of inverse kinematics is obtained. Based on this solution, a simulation program has been developed to optimally choose the design parameters of each module so that the manipulator will have a maximum workspace volume. A computeraided design model based on optimal parameters is built and investigated to check its workspace volume. Experimental work has been carried out for the purpose of calibration. Also, the system hardware setup of the hybrid two-fingered micro–nano manipulator hand and its practical Jacobian inverse matrices are presented.  Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden and The Robotics Society of Japan, 2008	3d modeling;computer-aided design;gnu nano;inverse kinematics;jacobian matrix and determinant;mathematical optimization;nv network;optimal design;piezoelectricity;prototype;robot end effector;robotics;simulation;workspace	Ahmed A.

However, robot may lose functionality under radiation environments because of the radiation induced damage and degrading of robot components, particularly the potential damage on harmonic drives is not yet well studied. We started by modelling the transmission and nonlinear features of harmonic drive dynamically, made analysis and assumptions on how the harmonic drive could probably degrade in the assumed radiation environments, and used a new ‘elastic-slide-free-motion’ testing method on the harmonic drive gearhead by characterising its elastic-slide behaviour before and after X-ray irradiation experiment. The testing results indicated that harmonic drives are resistant to environment irradiation in short-period operations.	elegant degradation;humanoid robot;mathematical model;nonlinear system	Shimeng Li;Jie Qiu;Yuan F.

In order to achieve maximum forces with minimum cost and minimum space, a multiobjective optimization of the novel planar motor is carried out. In order to reduce the computational resources required for finite-element (FE) analyses, a fast but accurate analytical tool is developed, based on expressions of the flux density of the permanent-magnet array, which are derived from the scalar magnetic potential method. The validity and accuracy is verified by 3-D FE results. Based on the force formulas and the multiobjective function derived from the analytical models, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to optimize the dimensions of the planar motor. The design and optimization of the planar motor is validated with experimental results, measured on a built prototype, thus proving the validity of the analytical tools.	air gap (networking);algorithm;computational resource;finite element method;mathematical optimization;maximum force;multi-objective optimization;multitier architecture;nonlinear system;particle swarm optimization;potential method;prototype;time complexity	Liang Guo;He Zhang;Michael Galea;Jing Li;Christopher Gerada	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2522389	control engineering;magnetic flux;electronic engineering;magnetization;engineering;electrical engineering;magnetic levitation;electromagnetic coil;force;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	81.25213743745091	-14.369832948654818	112649

Causes of plant-wide disturbances include non-linear limit cycles in control loops, controller interactions and tuning problems. Once oscilattions are detected, knowledge about cause and effect in control loops is fundamental for identifying the root causes. In [1], a method for calculating transfer entropy was proposed using five tuning parameters that were constant in all calculations. In this paper, two of these parameters were computed for each pair of variables, resulting in better conclusions about cause and effect relationships amongst the signals. The usefulness of our proposal is demonstrated through simulations and application to an industrial case.	causality;coefficient;computer simulation;control flow;cross-correlation;embedded system;interaction;limit cycle;nonlinear system;simulation;software propagation;transfer entropy	Vinicius M.

968f830c923434bb3b7340ad7adb8a633d5c8d52	dynamic characterisation of the head-media interface in hard disk drives using novel sensor systems	doctorate;data transfer failure computer engineering sound solid state physics	Hard disk drives function perfectly satisfactorily when used in a stable environment, but in certain applications they are subjected to shock and vibration. During the work reported in this thesis it has been found that when typical hard disk drives are subjected lo vibration, data transfer failure is found to be significant at frequencies between 440Hz and 700Hz, at an extreme, failing at only Ig o f sinusoidal vibration. These failures can largely be attributed to two key components: the suspension arm and the hard disk. At non-critical frequencies o f vibration the typical hard disk drive can reliably transfer data whilst subjected to as much as 45g. When transferring data to the drive controller, the drive's operations are controlled and monitored using BIOS commands. Examining the embedded error signals proved that the drive predominantly failed due lo tracking errors. Novel piezo-electric sensors have been developed to measure unobtrusively suspension arm and disk motion, the results from which show the disk to be the most significant failure mechanism, with its First mode o f resonance at around 440Hz. The suspension arm movement has been found to be greatest at IkHz. Extensive modelling o f the flexure o f the disk, clamped and undamped, has been undertaken using finite element analysis. The theoretical modelling strongly reinforces the empirical results presented in this thesis. I f suspension arm movement is not directly coupled with disk movement then a Hying height variation is created. This, together with tracking variations, leads to data transfer corruption. This has been found to occur at IkHz and 2kHz. A n optical system has been developed and characterised for a novel and inexpensive fiying height measurement system using compact disc player technology.	bios;disk controller;disk storage;embedded system;failure cause;finite element method;hard disk drive;piezoelectricity;resonance;sensor;star height;system of measurement;while	Glen Alan Tunstall	2002			control engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;mechanical engineering	Robotics	79.16742798267153	-16.426345148078422	112905

The conveyor consists of a flat rigid plate with three translational degrees of freedom that performs oscillations in all three cardinal directions. This leads to a non-zero horizontal frictional force if an object is placed on top of the manipulator surface. On the experimental setup, this force causes the object to move at speeds up to 0.35 m/s. A model of the physical effects leading to the transportation is given. The calculated transportation velocity is compared to the velocity measured on the experimental setup. The operation principle encourages the creation of an array-like setup consisting of many small manipulator surfaces. Every one of them is capable of passing an object to one of the adjacent manipulators. By operating these manipulators in parallel, a large number of objects can be moved simultaneously, resulting in much lower accelerations and no collisions of the handling devices.		Peter U.

920e66b55c87054d6911684157c0ed10a3319166	structure-based dynamic characteristics of planar linkages including platform-type robots		A comparative study of kinematic chains and their inversions at the conceptual stage of design is expected to help the designer in selecting the best possible chain and inversion for the specified task. To accomplish this, the designer should be able to read the characteristics of the chains based on their topology. It is only necessary to associate logically certain characteristics, weaknesses, and strengths of a chain to perform a task with the structure of the chain and then generalize. Based on this belief, work has been reported earlier to assess the ability of a chain to reveal some of the characteristics, such as structural error, performance, static, and kinematic behavior. In this study, an effort was made to model a chain as a system of dynamically equivalent lumped masses, interconnected, and then, through energy considerations, show that the distance between ground link and joint masses can be taken as the criterion to compare the chains from the viewpoint of balancing and their expected dynamic behavior. The concepts developed are applied to planar in-parallel robots, which are gaining in importance.  1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.	computer performance;inversion (discrete mathematics);john d. wiley;kinematic chain;parallel manipulator;planar graph;robot	A.

bab1d31a1f97b5b8dabcdfa093eb22c252b64d97	adaptive impedance control for docking of space robotic arm based on its end force/torque sensor		Aiming at space transposition using Space Robotic Arm (SRA), flexible docking between SRA’s end effecter (EE) and grapple fixture (GF) is the most important for space tasks. To avoid position errors leading to large contact force between EE and GF in the docking process, an adaptive impedance control method is proposed in this paper. PID feedforward with adaptive parameters is added into the impedance controller, and the force error function is used to deduce the adaptive parameters according to Lyapunov stability theory, which makes the force error decrease automatically during the connection process. Simulation proves that the adaptive impedance strategy gets better force control effect than the traditional impedance algorithm. Finally the SRA EE/GF connection experiments were conducted respectively based on traditional and adaptive impedance control strategy. The results showed that the adaptive impedance control strategy can achieve better control effect than the traditional strategy.	nominal impedance;robotic arm	Gangfeng Liu;Changle Li;Caiwei Song;Mingyi Wang;Jie Zhao	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-48036-7_52	control engineering;robotic arm;control theory	Robotics	70.60628870623296	-17.347515656202408	114852

On real highways, however, the performance of the ABS-equipped car has been disappointing. The poor braking performance with ABS has resulted from the questionable design of the human-machine interface for the brake system. The goal of this study is to design brake systems that provide more intuitive brake control and proper braking-performance information for the driver. In this study automotive brake systems are modeled as a type of master-slave telemanipulator. Human force-displacement interaction at the brake pedal has a strong effect on braking performance. As a preliminary study in brake-system design, the characteristics of human leg motion and its underlying motor-control scheme are studied through experiments and simulations, and a model of braking motion by the driver's leg is developed. This paper proposes novel brake systems based on two new aspects. First, the mechanical impedance characteristics of the leg action of the driver are taken into consideration in designing the brake systems. Second, the brake systems provide the driver with kinesthetic feedback of braking conditions or performance. The effectiveness of the proposed designs in a combined driver-vehicle system is investigated using driving simulation.	characteristic impedance;control unit;coupling (computer programming);displacement mapping;driving simulator;electronic component;experiment;impedance matching;kinesiology;motion capture;remote manipulator;robot;simulation;systems design;telerobotics;transducer;user interface	Shinsuk Park;Thomas B.

In particular, the high frequency component of the contact force, which is very important for the haptic perception of stiff surfaces, is typically filtered out. In this paper, a solution to this problem is proposed which is based on the idea to separate different frequency bands in the force reflection signal and consequently apply the projection-based principle to the low-frequency component, while reflecting the high-frequency component directly. It is shown that, for bilateral teleoperators with irregular communication delays, stability can always be achieved by implementing the above described force reflection scheme, if the cut-off frequency of the complementary filters is sufficiently high and a certain weighting coefficient in the force reflection algorithm is sufficiently low. Experimental results demonstrate that substantial simultaneous improvement of stability and transparency is achieved using the proposed method.	algorithm;bilateral filter;coefficient;frequency band;haptic technology;steady state;telerobotics	Amir Takhmar;Ilia G.

It is possible to construct a unique dynamic model in a given frequency range for a rate-dependent hysteresis system using the selected compound frequency as the training set of LS-SVM, which guarantees an outstanding generalization ability of frequency. The precision of the model attributes to the improved strategy of parameter regulation of kernel parameter and penalty factor, which is also address in the paper.

Feedback linearization transforms the nonlinear dynamics of the USV into a linear system. VSC rejects the effects of modeling imperfections and environmental disturbances. The position and orientation of the USV are measured by a visual motion capture system. The combination of accurate measurement and VSC allows trajectory tracking errors to be kept small as is verified in the experimental results.

The friction influence matrix and the expressions of type I/II errors are deduced, which indicate the effect of joint-friction upon precision of measurement. Then, the graphs of type I/II errors of the parallel 6-axis force sensor under different external forces and frictional coefficient are plotted and the rule how the joint- friction affect the measuring precision is analyzed.

07a81752c6fac5fb182f55807d1673af9330375a	an efficient locomotion strategy for six-strut tensegrity robots		Tensegrity is a balanced mechanical structure composed of a set of rigid members that are connected by elastic tensile members. Tensegrity-like robots have received significant attention for its light-weight, robustness and deployability. However, the locomotion control of a tensegrity robot is still a challenging problem due to the complex nonlinear coupling among the struts and cables. In this paper, a straightforward, easy to implement compare-and-search based strategy for six-strut tensegrity robot is proposed to achieve continuous rolling toward given targets without developing step-wise locomotion policies for different adjacent relationship separately. To validate the proposed strategy, simulation experiments have been performed. Results show that the strategy works well on rough terrains and it is robust to external disturbances. In particular, the proposed strategy allows the robot to escape from the trap by jumping in certain situations. A physical prototype robot is also built based on the proposed strategy.	amazon elastic block store;apache struts;experiment;list of code lyoko episodes;nonlinear system;prototype;robot;rough set;simulation	Yongjia Zhao;Suiping Zhou;Changhong Lin;Daiwei Li	2017	2017 13th IEEE International Conference on Control & Automation (ICCA)	10.1109/ICCA.2017.8003096	control theory;control engineering;robustness (computer science);jumping;robot locomotion;engineering;mobile robot;robot control;robot kinematics;kinematics;tensegrity	Robotics	71.70447228316382	-23.357344304799792	116614

To avoid leakages in these pipelines, efficient robotic pipe inspections are required, and to this date, various types of in-pipe robots have been developed. Some of them can select their path at a T-branch at the expense of additional actuators. However, fewer actuators are better in terms of size reduction, energy conservation, production cost, and maintenance. To reduce the number of actuators, a screw drive mechanism with only one actuator has been developed for propelling an in-pipe robot through straight pipes and elbow pipes. Based on this screw drive mechanism, in this paper, we develop a novel robot that uses only two motors and can select pathways. The robot has three locomotion modes: screw driving, steering, and rolling modes. These modes enable the robot to navigate not only through straight pipes but also elbow pipes and T-branches. We performed experiments to verify the validity of the proposed mechanism.	branch (computer science);experiment;gene regulatory network;named pipe;pipeline (unix);pipeline (computing);robot;straight skeleton	Taiki Nishimura;Atsushi Kakogawa;Shugen Ma	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)	10.1109/CoASE.2012.6386388	structural engineering;control engineering;engineering;engineering drawing	Robotics	73.0237339793811	-22.515989873960034	116961

Recently there has been an increasing interest in using adhesive materials for that purpose. For example, a climbing robot using hot melt adhesives (HMAs) has demonstrated advantages in high attachment strength, reasonable operation costs, and applicability to different surfaces. Despite the advantages, there still remain several problems related to the attachment and detachment operations, which prevent this approach from being used in a broader range of applications. Among others, one of the main problems lies in the fact that the adhesive characteristics of this material were not fully understood fin the context of robotic climbing locomotion. As a result, the previous robot often could not achieve expected locomotion performances and “contaminated” the environment with HMAs left behind. In order to improve the locomotion performances, this paper focuses on attachment and detachment operations in robot climbing with HMAs. By systematically analyzing the adhesive property and bonding strength of HMAs to different materials, we propose a novel detachment mechanism that substantially improves climbing performances without HMA traces.	attachments;autonomous robot;clamping (graphics);hill climbing;hot spare;maxima and minima;performance;tracing (software)	Liyu Wang;Fabian Neuschaefer;Remo Bernet;Fumiya Iida	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2012.6224955	structural engineering;simulation;engineering;bond strength;adhesive;engineering drawing;quantum mechanics;foot	Robotics	74.46798303238064	-23.428709023772466	116999

The EVT analyzed in this paper is a rotating field electrical machine having two concentric rotors. On the outer rotor, permanent magnets (PMs) are combined with a dc-field winding, being the first implementation of its kind. The magnetic field in the machine as well as the electromagnetic torque on both rotors are a function of the q- and d-axis currents of the stator and inner rotor, as well as the dc-field current. To describe and fully understand this multiple-input multiple-output machine, this paper gives an overview of the influence of the different current inputs on the flux linkage and torque on both rotors. Focus is given to the hybrid excitation in the d-axis by combining the dc-field current and the alternating currents. This has the advantage compared to other EVT topologies that unwanted stator torque can be avoided without stator d-axis current flux weakening. Results of the analysis are presented by means of the torque to current characteristics of a double rotor PM-assisted EVT, as well as the torque to current ratios. The machine characteristics are finally experimentally verified on a prototype machine.	experiment;extreme value theory;linkage (software);mimo;optic axis of a crystal;prototype;r.o.t.o.r.

The first one is the spoke type, while the second one has V-shape magnets embedded in the rotor. The structures and features of both motors are presented and the optimal designs are performed. The electromagnetic performances, such as dq-axis inductances, torque, flux weakening, and partial demagnetization, are investigated and compared. In order to calculate the dq-axis inductances accurately and segregate the torque components, the frozen-permeability method is adopted. Additionally, a method to obtain the maximum flux-weakening speed is introduced. Moreover, the partial demagnetization performances of both motors are evaluated under no-load, on-load, overload, and short-circuit conditions. Also, the fault-tolerant capacities of both motors are compared. Finally, both motors are built for exemplification. The analysis is confirmed by experimental results.	embedded system;exemplification;fault tolerance;fault-tolerant computer system;optic axis of a crystal;optimal design;performance;r.o.t.o.r.

The process is applied to the whole system including the passive structure, the piezoelectric transducers, the electrical interfaces and the controller. An efficient optimization algorithm based on an interval computation method is used. The authors' general objective is to include and develop an early optimization step in the systemic design process of a smart structure. For this purpose, an analytic mathematical model is built, which describes the analytic equations of motion of the main controlled natural mode shape of the micro-isolator. Basically, the method is applicable to a large scale of systems if an analytic description is developed. As case study, the controller and the passive structure are simultaneously optimized so as to obtain a compromise between transmissibility, control energy level and beam strength.

The parallelogram crawler modules are adopted to maintain the anterior-posterior symmetry of forward and backward movements, and a simple differential mechanism based on a pair of spur gears is installed to provide underactuated mechanisms. A central base unit connects each crawler module through foldable pantograph mechanisms.

In this paper, an effective mixing approach is proposed and implemented by using an electrical chaoization. Namely, a permanent-magnet DC motor, which acts as the agitator, is electrically chaoized by time-delay feedback control. It is identified that there are three adjustable control parameters: the torque parameter which induces chaotic motion, the speed parameter which adjusts the motion boundary, and the time-delay parameter which tunes the refreshing rate. Both computer simulation and experimental results are given to verify the proposed chaoization. Finally, realistic mixing of an acid-base solution is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed chaotic mixing.		S. Ye;K. T.

Thrust forces calculated by this model demonstrate the idea that by relocating the paddle shaft eccentrically from its wheel center, the rotating paddles will generate vectored thrust force for swimming.

b2f7e74e97199c9180009420cd342ff12bb25106	fabrication of highly articulated miniature snake robot structures using in-mold assembly of compliant joints		Snake inspired robots have promising applications in minimally invasive surgery. However one of the most significant challenges, which presents itself as a roadblock to large scale exploitation of this technology, is the high manufacturing costs associated with fabricating highly articulated miniature structures. We present a method to fabricate such highly articu- lated miniature snake robots using a modular mold design. This design com- bines the benefits of in-mold assembly and insert molding to fabricate highly articulating miniature structures. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the modular mold design for making snake robot chains. This paper also discusses a mathematical framework which can be used to opti- mize the size of the compliant links and thereby the overall cross section of the snake robot chain that can be manufactured using the modular mold design.	robot	Arvind Ananthanarayanan;Felix Bussemer;Satyandra K.

It has also been shown that applying a nonlinear treatment on the output voltage of the piezoelectric material can significantly enhance the performance of the device. This process consists of inverting the piezoelectric voltage when the displacement is maximum, which therefore requires a way of synchronization. In practical applications, however, a delay may happen between the inversion and the actual occurrence of an extremum. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of such a delay on the microgenerator performance and therefore to predict the power output that can be expected under real circumstances. Theoretical analysis validated through experimental measurements shows that the effect may not be the same for positive or negative delays. It is also demonstrated that the effect is not significant as long as the delay is small. The acceptable delay range also increases as the electromechanical system becomes more coupled and/or less damped. Under such configuration, the output power can even be slightly increased as the delay permits controlling the tradeoff between energy extraction and damping effect.	displacement mapping;maxima and minima;nonlinear system;piezoelectricity;synchronization (computer science);transducer	Mickaël Lallart;Yi-Chieh Wu;Daniel Guyomar	2012	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2011.2148675	frequency modulation;damping;control engineering;synchronization;electronic engineering;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;engineering;vibration;control theory;force;energy harvesting;energy transformation;physics	EDA	79.00315209191668	-15.693587942681567	119472

The printing system consists of two rollers for pressing and carrying a metal plate onto which an engraved inked plate is placed. When the driving mechanism is operated, the pressure exerted by the rollers, also called contact pressure, allows the engraved image to be transferred into paper, thereby obtaining the final image. With the aim of ensuring the quality of the result, in terms of good and even transfer of ink, the contact pressure must be uniform. Nowadays, the strategies utilized to measure the pressure are implemented off-line, i.e., when the press machines are shut down for maintenance, which poses limitations. This paper proposes a novel sensor system aimed at monitoring the pressure exerted by the rollers on the engraved plate while chalcographic printer is operating, i.e., on-line. The purpose is two-fold: firstly, real-time monitoring reduces the number of breakdown repairs required, reduces machine downtime and reduces the number of low-quality engravings, which increases productivity and revenues; and secondly, the on-line monitoring and register of the process parameters allows the printing process to be reproducible even with changes in the environmental conditions or other factors such as the wear of the parts that constitute the mechanical system and a change in the dimensions of the printing materials. The proposed system consists of a strain gauge-based load cell and conditioning electronics to sense and treat the signals.	automatic number plate recognition;carrying;conditioning (psychology);cylinder seal;dimensions;disintegration (morphologic abnormality);downtime;electroplating;ink (substance);online and offline;printer (computing);printer device component;printing;prototype;real-time clock;sensor;surgical repair;physical hard work	José Antonio Jiménez;Francisco Javier Meca;Enrique Santiso;Pedro Martín	2017		10.3390/s17092029	load cell;strain gauge;electronics;electronic engineering;engineering;downtime;mechanical system;engraving;computer hardware;engineering drawing	Robotics	78.35152732315444	-20.969904133719105	119673

This article describes the fuzzy modeling and simulation for intelligent control to regulate the opening area of expansion valve for better and stable refrigerant flow even in the presence of operating condition change. Fuzzy logic control of expansion valve can make a quick response to the abrupt changes of operating parameters in VCRS. The expansion valve opening trend depending upon differential pressure across it (delP) and refrigerant mass flow rate is analyzed with fuzzy modeling using ANFIS. Differential pressures in the range of 3-7 bar are sustained across the valve. Flow rates up to 0.15 kg/sec for the refrigerant R-134a have been demonstrated. The performance of the model is evaluated by comparing the predicted results with the standard mathematical model.	intelligent control;simulation	Jagdev Singh;Nirmal Singh;J. K.

Depending on the application, the different models available are more or less suitable. Available static friction models are typically considered to be dependent only on relative speed of interacting surfaces. However, it is known that friction can be affected by other factors than speed. In this paper, static friction in robot joints is studied with respect to changes in joint angle, load torque and temperature. The effects of these variables are analyzed by means of experiments on a standard industrial robot. Justified by their significance, load torque and temperature are included in an extended static friction model. The proposed model is validated in a wide operating range, reducing the average error a factor of 6 when compared to a standard static friction model.	algorithm;complex dynamics;experiment;industrial robot;interaction;mathematical model;nonlinear system;robotic arm;sensor;test bench;velocity (software development)	André Carvalho Bittencourt;Erik Wernholt;Shiva Sander-Tavallaey;Torgny Brogårdh	2010	2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2010.5650358	identification;control engineering;stiction;computer science;engineering;friction torque;friction;mathematical model;temperature control;torque;manufacturing engineering;technology;mechanical engineering	Robotics	72.72272574998836	-19.42021083920328	119934

A discrete-time back electromotive force (EMF) voltage estimation method is developed to overcome several high-speed position sensing issues, including the voltage error due to the digital-to-analog conversion, inductive cross-coupling, and deviation between the estimated EMF and actual EMF resulting from the digital implementation. To overcome these problems, an observer-based EMF estimation is proposed with three implementation considerations. They are 1) a discrete-time dq current observer to remove the inductive cross-coupling effect for the EMF estimation, 2) a delay model to compensate the voltage error, and 3) a discretized model to estimate the sampled EMF in the discrete-time. A high-speed PM machine is experimentally evaluated to verify all proposed sensorless drive methods.	digital-to-analog converter;discretization;eclipse modeling framework;experiment;multistage interconnection networks	Shih-Chin Yang;Guan-Ren Chen	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2652364	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;sensor;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;statistics	EDA	70.11242285193467	-11.601030602240392	120092

In this work, particular interest is focused on the application of these two techniques to comb-drive actuators, where a parametric study is carried out to optimize the design parameters of a lateral Electrostatic comb-drive actuator. In this case, the thickness, gab size, applied driving voltage and the number of Comb fingers are varied. The two meshing techniques applied are commonly known as, the Exposed Face Meshing method (EFM), and the Volume Refining Meshing (VRM) method. On one hand, the EFM algorithm permits the independent refinement of the electrostatic and the mechanical meshes while keeping full compatibility between the two meshed domains. On the other hand, the VRM method requires both, the electrostatic and the mechanical meshes, to be refined together at the same time; which result in a large problem size for complex structures with high aspect ratio. While the VRM method requires meshing of air gaps between the conductors, the EFM method uses the boundary element technique to map and calculate the electrostatic forces on the surfaces of the structure conductors, which eliminates the need to mesh the air gaps between the conductors, which is proved to be more efficient. In the current work, a calibration tool that can be used to enhance the efficiency of FE results produced by the VRM technique is developed. In this process, the results obtained from both meshing techniques of the parametrically studied comb-drive are used to train a Feedforward Backpropagation Neural Network. This network is constructed using the FE results obtained from the (EFM) as the training target or output. The result obtained from the (VRM) technique is then fed as input to the network, which can then be calibrated using the EFM results.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;artificial neural network;backpropagation;boundary element method;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;finite element method;gab;lateral thinking;microelectromechanical systems;numerical analysis;optimizing compiler;refinement (computing);thickness (graph theory);voltage regulator module	Hesham Ahmed;Walied A.

Particularly, the derived forward-position analysis is applicable to the mechanisms in which three passive joints are constrained to move parallel to the moving plate. Its kinematic and dynamic characteristics are investigated via isotropic index of the Jacobian matrix and isotropic index of the output effective inertia matrix, respectively. From this investigation, it is found that the mechanism has fairly uniform kinematic/dynamic characteristics throughout its workspace. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed 3-PPSP-type mechanism, a prototype is designed, implemented, and tested experimentally under various operating conditions. A simple PID controller is applied to the system, and its joint positions are servo-controlled. The controlled system showed a good trajectory performance. Noting that a more advanced controller requiring a forwardand/or reverse-position solution can be applied to the system in real time, it can be contended that the manipulator is a candidate for the high-precision manipulator.

d8beaf989ff1564e52729cf0f5d0c3c9ba6dd1e6	a dual-winding fault-tolerant motor drive system based on the redundancy bridge arm		In order to adapt to the single power supply system of an aircraft, this paper proposes and investigates a novel dual-winding fault-tolerant (DF) motor drive system based on the redundancy bridge arm for aerospace applications. The proposed DF motor offers the advantages of magnetic isolation, physics isolation, thermal isolation, and small cogging torque ripple, inhibiting the short-circuit current and high fault tolerance. The proposed DF motor drive can adapt to the single power supply system of the aircraft, reduce the drive cost, and reduce the number of independent power sources and power switches. In addition, it can improve the power density, the reliability, and the utilization rate of the drive. At the same time, the drive system has stronger fault-tolerant ability, and it can achieve the fault-tolerant control for a one-phase-winding fault or a multiphase-winding fault. To realize the short-circuit fault diagnosis performance, the diagnosis and processing method of the short-circuit fault has been investigated. Then, to realize the short-circuit fault-tolerant performance, a novel space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM) fault-tolerant control strategy based on the short-circuit fault diagnosis and processing method is proposed. Finally, the performances of the DF motor drive have been verified by experiments. The research results verify the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed DF motor drive system based on the redundancy bridge arm and the SVPWM fault-tolerant control strategy.	arm architecture;control theory;direction finding;experiment;fault tolerance;network switch;performance;power supply;pulse-width modulation;ripple effect	Xuefeng Jiang;Qiang Li;Wenxin Huang;Ruiwu Cao	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2018.2833023	control engineering;utilization rate;power density;redundancy (engineering);cogging torque;ripple;motor drive;fault tolerance;engineering;control theory;modulation	Robotics	75.60329662503875	-17.500113765391525	120405

This system provides for additional stability and safety by performing active roll and pitch control during cornering and braking. Furthermore, elimination of the road irregularities is possible, hence, passenger drive comfort is increased. Based upon measurements, static and dynamic specifications of the actuator are derived. The electromagnetic suspension is installed on a quarter-car test setup, and the improved performance using roll control is measured and compared with a commercial passive system. An alternative design using a slotless external-magnet tubular actuator is proposed which fulfills the thermal and volume specifications.		Bart L. J. Gysen;Jeroen L. G. Janssen;Johannes J. H.

This paper describes essential servo control requirements for the servo track writing that can support high number of tracks per inch (TPI). Servo systems for conventional servo track writing, media level servo track writing and self servo track writing are reviewed. A hybrid servo for media level servo track writing using a two-stage configuration is proposed and experimentally verified. Experimental results show that the proposed method can minimize the effects of all relative vibrations existing between the head and the media and hence increase the track density from 142 kTPI to 362 kTPI.	experiment;hard disk drive;requirement;servo;true performance index	Jingliang Zhang;Branislav Hredzak;Chunling Du;Guoxiao Guo	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	10.1109/CCA.2007.4389217	control engineering;computer hardware;engineering;control theory	SE	74.0735705323946	-15.719262651545911	120903

However, it is difficult for the linear inchworm drive to run in crooked narrow pathways, because its rigid body actuator reduces the flexibility of the scope camera and becomes immovable when the scope camera is curved. There are many crooked narrow pathways inside collapsed houses and under rubble. ASC's search range could be vastly expanded if ASC can run in such environments. In this paper, we developed a flexible linear actuator, which has the bellows structure and the hollow structure, for ASC in order to solve these problems. The actuator was able to generate large force more than 6 N from 60 kPa of applied pressure even if it was curved at 200 mm bending radius. Moreover, we developed a flexible linear inchworm drive using this actuator. The flexible linear inchworm drive keeps the running characteristics on the various road surfaces of the conventional linear inchworm drive. The minimum width of 80 deg crooked pathway that the flexible linear inchworm drive could run through was 60 mm, which was one-thirds narrower than that of the conventional inchworm drive.	cylinder seal;experiment;gene regulatory network;prototype;rescue robot;ti advanced scientific computer	Kazuhito Wakana;Michihisa Ishikura;Masashi Konyo;Satoshi Tadokoro	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2012.6225124	structural engineering;control engineering;mobile robot;rigid body;disaster;bending;simulation;pneumatic actuator;engineering;vibration;friction;force;actuator	Robotics	75.2378079581711	-23.247469871832738	121062
72499c1d71e3a064aa2812789e0d48da28184ae4	a rapid measurement system for transmission efficiency of automotive powertrain	reverse dragging system;automotive powertrain;transmission efficiency	The current annual inspection of automotives is non-disassembly detection. It can merely measure the power output of automotive chassis, and get inaccurate results. There are few cumbersome and low precision methods for measuring the power output of the engine, and it is difficult to obtain transmission efficiency of automotive powertrain. A new measuring system is developed by adding reverse dragging system on the basis of the present chassis dynamometer. The system can be used for swift testing of power output of the engine at a particular speed and efficient calculation of the transmission efficiency of automotive powertrain without disassembly. Calibration test is experimented on the force cell. The results show that the proposed system is theoretically correct and practically usable.	cell (microprocessor);chassis;disassembler;drag and drop;swift (programming language)	Ai-Guo OuYang;Chagen Luo;Xiao-ling Dong	2012	Intelligent Automation & Soft Computing	10.1080/10798587.2012.10643260	embedded system	EDA	80.20010616601941	-12.951730782730273	121338

The method starts from a single-master/single-slave force-velocity control architecture, where the lumped two-port master-slave network is split into a distributed system of two multi-port master and slave networks. Additional masters and slaves can be introduced by adding similar multi-port networks that are connected to a simple sharing protocol that exchanges kinesthetic feedback among them. Modular stability analysis of each master or slave network, regardless of the underlying sharing paradigm, is conducted using the notion of absolute k-stability (AKS). The entire system network is stable if each master and slave multi-port network is AKS. Position correspondence can be obtained by adding a novel auxiliary coordinating controller that preserves the AKS of the master and slave networks. The stability and kinesthetic performance of the proposed control system are analyzed numerically and experimentally for a dual-master/single-slave telerobotic system.	broadcast delay;control system;controllers;distributed computing;dual;experiment;gyrator;interaction;interconnection;kind of quantity - equilibrium;least absolute deviations;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerous;programming paradigm;robot;robot (device);time complexity;velocity (software development)	Kamran Razi;Keyvan Hashtrudi-Zaad	2014	IEEE Transactions on Haptics	10.1109/TOH.2014.2330619	telerobotics;control engineering;communications protocol;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;robot kinematics	Robotics	68.52179831514928	-14.017006107665265	121474

Also, an innovative method based on the geometry of the manipulator is presented for solving the forward position problem of the manipulator. The presented method provides a framework for the future research to solve the forward position problem of the other fully spherical PMs (for examples 3(UPS)-S and 3(RSS)-S). In the proposed method, two coupled trigonometric equations are obtained by utilizing the geometry of the manipulator and Rodrigues’ rotation formula. Using Bezout’s elimination technique, the two coupled equations lead to a polynomial of degree eight. We show that the polynomial is minimal and optimal. Furthermore, the other method is proposed for selecting an admissible solution of the forward position problem. This algorithm is required to control modeling and dynamic simulations.	algorithm;parallel manipulator;polynomial;simulation;super paper mario	Javad Enferadi;Amir Shahi	2015	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574715000752	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	69.37676109103083	-20.295053508993977	121651

It is well known that the stiffness of virtual environments is limited by quantization, discretization, and amplifier bandwidth effects. In this paper we propose a novel control architecture that, rather than canceling motor electrical dynamics, uses them to achieve better performances. First we recognize that the inductance L provides a natural sensor-less stiff behavior at high frequencies. Second, electrical resistance R serves as the basis of a wave transform that, performed through an analog circuit, allows to build a more stable interface with virtual environments, achieving robustness to servo delays and discretization. Encoder feedback and digital control loop are required only to provide parametric robustness at low frequencies.

Doing so postpones the introduction of coordinates until after the expressions for the relevant Jacobians have been derived. This approach simplifies the derivation while also providing the solution to the general case in 3D, including motion over rolling terrain. Angular velocity remains explicit rather than encoded as the time derivative of a rotation matrix. The equations are derived and can be implemented recursively using a single equation that applies to all cases. Acceleration kinematics are uniquely derivable in reasonable effort. The recursive formulation also leads to efficient computer implementations that reflect the modularity of real mechanisms.	kinematic chain;mobile robot;recursion (computer science);software propagation	Alonzo Kelly;Neal Seegmiller	2015	I.

OAs is intended to decrease the frequency and duration of apneas, hypopneas, respiratory efforts related arousals (RERAs) and snoring events. Oral appliances (OAs) are devices intended to protrude and help stabilize the mandible mechanically during the night in order to reduce the collapsibility of the upper airway during sleep. A custom OA is fabricated using digital or physical impressions and models of an individual patient's oral structures. It is made of biocompatible materials and engages both the maxillary and mandibular arches. The perfect OA has not yet been designed. For these reasons, the objective of this paper is to present a new customizable and adjustable chairside OA. The device integrates the best characteristics of the previous designs and minimizes inconveniences and possible side effects. The design prerequisites were: effectiveness treatment of OSA and snoring, easy assembly and titration, safety, comfortable and not bulky, good retention, low cost, durable, easy cleaning and adaptable to the shape of adult dental arch.	oral and maxillofacial radiology;plasma cleaning;point of view (computer hardware company);side effect (computer science);sleep mode	Nadiezhda Montelongo Garcia;Fernando Blaya Haro;Emilio Lechosa Urquijo;Enrique Soriano Heras;Roberto D'Amato	2018		10.1145/3284179.3284250		HCI	81.21451600705024	-23.098282276996077	121898

From measurements taken at the Port of Felixstowe it has been observed that the peculiar geometrical characteristics of the hoisting mechanism causes the power demand to increase with the container height in constant speed conditions. By using information extracted from the crane's schematics and trigonometry it has been possible to calculate the potential energy increase given the weight and vertical position of the container. In addition, the torque load on the hoist motor and the vertical speed of the mass have been calculated, allowing for the modelling of the hoist motor power consumption when lifting containers with constant rotational speed.	information;javascript syntax;lambda lifting;rubber duck debugging;schematic	Stefano Pietrosanti;William Holderbaum;Victor M.

In this paper a new approach for kinematic calibration of PKM is presented that has been developed and successfully tested on a hexapod at the IWM Dresden. The approach particularly respects the concept of simple design that aims at a cost-effective and economic over-all solution. Aspects of calibration that are in many cases not explicitly accounted for are considered. A simple and robust double-ball-bar (DBB) is used for data acquisition while continuously moving the platform on a specific trajectory in 6 degrees of freedom (dof). The measuring trajectory is optimized to ensure the identifiability of kinematic parameters, respecting their sensitivity and orthogonality in the workspace. Parameter identification is based on Genetic algorithms with customized genetic operators as well as real and simulated measurements. A significant rise of motion accuracy was obtained in the whole workspace.	kinematic chain	Knut Großmann;Bernd Kauschinger;Szabolcs Szatmári	2008	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-008-0092-6	control engineering;simulation;genetic algorithm;cost-effectiveness analysis;computer science;genetic operator;control theory;degrees of freedom;data acquisition;robot calibration	HCI	70.52582232316215	-20.080422166691204	122372

When a flexible manipulator is set to an environmental constraint, force control is necessary to be implemented to complete the task. In this work, we apply a concise position/force control scheme to a spatial flexible manipulator, using lumped-parameter modeling. The equations of motion, including elastic deflection and contact force, have been obtained based on Hamilton's principle. Force control has been realized, both in simulation and experimentally. A comparison between those results is also presented.

The software package named AREEM (Automatic Robot Error Equation Modeler) utilizes MACSYMA, a LISP-based artificial intelligence language, to output scalar algebraic equations representing the positioning error correction in world coordinates for N degree-of-freedom robots. The motivation of this work is trifold: (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing a well-established algebraic manipulation code for robot error compensation, simulation and modeling purposes; (2) to provide a base for investigating the performance and accuracy of numerous robot geometrical error compensation models; (3) to represent output results in a concise form eliminating completely the manual derivation process. When such computer generated outputs are fed to a simulation program, saving in computational time for error estimation is realized. At present, AREEM incorporates three kinematic error models based on the Denavit-Hartenberg representation (DH) and a non-DH representation. The AREEM program is user-friendly, interactively menu-driven, and has been tested on numerous robots. The worst case takes 174.80 seconds to generate error model equations in world coordinates for the PUMA 600 robot, which is insignificant compared to the time required for accurate manual derivation.	robot	Naren Vira;Edward Tunstel	1989		10.1016/0921-8890(91)90023-E	kinematics;symbolic computation;calibration;simulation;systems modeling;flowchart;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;robotics;algorithm	Robotics	70.10262797486345	-19.08806426212701	122894

An USM has the capability of generating a resistant torque against an external one even under power-off which is well known as self-locking characteristic and conveniently utilized to save energy while maintaining rotor position. The goal of the paper is to relax the self-locking characteristic and to widely change it between lock and free states. In order to achieve this, we newly propose the two d.o.f. PWM control, in which OFF command is included in addition to CW and CCW commands. By applying this, we can also control the torque of USM in open loop without using any complicated circuit. In this paper, we first demonstrate the basic structure of the two d.o.f PWM control, and then show several experimental results to verify the effectiveness of the scheme proposed.

Also, the development of the power assisted device has been done to support the nursing care work for the elderly. The purpose of our study is to develop a flexible displacement sensor and bending sensor which can measure the movement of human body, flexible actuator or flexible joint of the robot by mounting on the surface of them. The developed string type flexible displacement sensor (FDS for short) consists of two fixed electrodes, a slide electrode and a nylon string coated with carbon (NSCC for short). It works as a flexible potentiometer by sliding the slide electrode along NSCC. We confirmed that the proposed sensor worked well by carrying out the position control of a McKibben artificial muscle with the tested sensor. We also proposed the flexible bending sensor that can measure the bending angle for various bending directions such as the movement of flexible joint of robot. The sensor consists of four tested FDSs, a coil spring and two plastic covers. The NSCCs are installed through the coil spring. We investigated the relation between bending angle and output voltages from four FDSs both experimentally and theoretically. As a result, we confirmed that the proposed sensor can work well and the proposed analytical model can predict well the bending angle and bending direction.	displacement mapping;experiment;family computer disk system;pneumatic artificial muscles;potentiometer;robot;sensor;string (computer science);wearable technology	Shujiro Dohta;Tetsuya Akagi;Hiroaki Kuno;Iku Hamamoto	2008	2008 15th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice	10.1504/IJISTA.2010.030192	control engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;robotics;geriatrics;mobile computing;engineering drawing;actuator	Robotics	77.16580916471946	-21.113163307354707	123032

Preload can be controlled in order to prevent backlash during the manipulator motion. Such control is based on the inverse dynamics. The general solution of the inverse dynamics of redundantly actuated parallel manipulators is given. For the special case of simple overactuation an explicit solution is derived in terms of a single preload parameter. With this formulation a computational efficient open-loop preload control is developed and applied to the elimination of backlash. Its simplicity makes it applicable in real-time applications.

d2ac85d5560260dbd1c4a3bbe37f911a1e371c6e	3d-printed flexure-based finger joints for anthropomorphic hands		Flexure-based finger joints for prosthetic hands have been studied, but until now they lack stiffness and load bearing capacity. In this paper we present a design which combines large range of motion, stiffness and load bearing capacity, with an overload protection mechanism. Several planar and non-planar hinge topologies are studied to determine load capacity over the range of motion. Optimized topologies are compared, in 30 degrees deflected state, in terms of stresses by deflection and grasping forces. Additionally, support stiffnesses were computed for all hinges in the whole range of motion (45 degrees). The Hole Cross Hinge presented the best performance over the range of motion with a grasping force up to 15 N while deflected 30 degrees. A new concept, the Angle Three-Flexure Cross Hinge, provides outstanding performance for deflections from 17.5 up to 30 degrees with a 20 N maximum grasping force when fully deflected. Experimental verification of the support stiffness over the range of motion shows some additional compliances, but the stiffness trend of the printed hinge is in line with the model. The presented joints power grasping capability outperform current state flexure-base hands and are comparable to commercial non-flexure-based prosthetic hands. In the event of excessive loads, an overload protection mechanism is in place to protect the flexure- hinges.		L. Garcia;M. Naves;D. M.

The aim is to develop a controller to carry the tip point to any given destination. The design is based on the inspirations derived from optimal behaviors of the leg. The optimal trajectories are obtained by using optimization methods utilizing “numerical gradient” and “optimal control” successively. Separate fuzzy controllers are designed for each actuator. In writing the rules each actuator is considered to be an independent agent of the leg system. The protraction motion is divided into two epochs. For each epoch different controller systems are designed to switch from one to the other in between.	epoch (reference date);fuzzy concept;gradient descent;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimal control;robot leg	Mustafa Suphi Erden;Kemal Leblebicioglu	2004			control engineering;open-loop controller;simulation;computer science;control theory	Robotics	68.8526231463289	-17.17517576053457	123212

In this paper, we study the problem of uniformly coating objects of arbitrary shape in the context of self-organizing programmable matter, i.e., programmable matter which consists of simple computational elements called particles that can establish and release bonds and can actively move in a self-organized way. Particles are anonymous, have constant-size memory, and utilize only local interactions in order to coat an object. We continue the study of our universal coating algorithm by focusing on its runtime analysis, showing that our algorithm terminates within a linear number of rounds with high probability. We also present a matching linear lower bound that holds with high probability. We use this lower bound to show a linear lower bound on the competitive gap between fully local coating algorithms and coating algorithms that rely on global information, which implies that our algorithm is also optimal in a competitive sense. Simulation results show that the competitive ratio of our algorithm may be better than linear in practice.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;bridging (networking);competitive analysis (online algorithm);computation;interaction;interference (communication);organizing (structure);particle system;programmable matter;self-organization;self-stabilization;simulation;structural integrity and failure;with high probability	Zahra Derakhshandeh;Robert Gmyr;Alexandra Porter;Andréa W.

In this work, a set of robust stationarity tests that are based on a sphericity statistic test (SST) in the frequency domain is proposed. Different possible approaches are investigated and compared to existing robust and non-robust stationarity tests in terms of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). In addition to extensive simulations, a real-world data example of a malfunctioning window regulator motor, for which the dominant frequencies show a modulating character that results in a non-stationary signal, is investigated. Both for simulated and real-world data, the proposed methods significantly outperform existing approaches.	receiver operating characteristic;signal processing;simulation;stationary process;stochastic process;window function	Jack Dagdagan;Michael Muma;Abdelhak M.

The design, simulation and levitation experiment are presented in detail. The device is composed of three parts: planar coil electro magnetic (EM) as lower stator, permanent magnetic (PM) as rotor and capacitance plate as lower stator. The levitation force versus displacement is analyzed by Ansys software and the air damping coefficient is also calculated. A dynamic model of levitation control is build to select control parameter and explain the experimental measurement. The stiffness versus frequency is analyzed. Experimental results of initial levitation, square wave response and sine wave sweep frequency response are presented and discussed. Preliminary measurements indicate that the response time for initial levitation is 0.2s, and the control current is 0.17A when the levitation height is 1mm. The quick-response performance is in agreement with the dynamic simulation by Matlab/Simulink. From sweep frequency experiment, it can be seen that when the levitation height is 1mm, the resonant frequency is 27.34Hz. The relationship between minimum detectable mass and frequency has been got. At last, the prospective MEMS design is proposed, which is applicable for the cancer cell weight detection.	coefficient;control system;control theory;digital signal processing;displacement mapping;finite element method;frequency response;lateral computing;lateral thinking;matlab;mathematical model;microelectromechanical systems;pid;printed circuit board;prospective search;r.o.t.o.r.;resonance;response time (technology);simulation;simulink;star height;step response	Qijun Xiao;Chaoyin Liu;Shengyong Li;Hungsun Son;Jinjun Guo	2012	2012 12th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision (ICARCV)	10.1109/ICARCV.2012.6485314	damping;control engineering;levitation;magnet;electronic engineering;electromagnet;electromagnetic suspension;engineering;electrical engineering;electrodynamic suspension;magnetic levitation;inductrack;quantum mechanics	Robotics	76.79547198259635	-19.43247417433259	123644

One major consideration for virtual construction is the simulation of the operation of construction equipment for a construction project. This research specifically focuses on developing a mathematical model to support the simulation and visualization of cranes, the most critical equipment in terms of project controls. This model is composed of two submodels—a kinematics model and a dynamic model. The kinematics model is to present the crane components controlled by the operators. The dynamic model is to present the dynamic behavior in suspended system (including the cable and rigging object), which cannot be controlled directly by the operators. To verify the feasibility of these methods, a computer program that simulates and visualizes detailed crane activities was developed.

79c2047bd0f3b45cdd41288ee6fa9aae4bdd5bb9	modeling of novel compound tendon-sheath artificial muscle inspired by hill muscle model		Various types of artificial muscles have been developed in recent years. Nevertheless, they are not well suited to robot applications due to the defects of their mechanical properties, such as small output, limited shrinkage, and slow response. Moreover, portable designs are difficult to realize because of the special power-source requirement. For the shortcomings above, the paper presents a motor-driven tendon-sheath artificial muscle inspired by Hill muscle model. The series and parallel elastic elements both made up of linear springs are applied on the tendon-sheath actuation system. Consequently, the tendon-sheath artificial muscle is created with a compliant structure, variable elasticity, and high power transmission capacity. Next, a compound tendon-sheath artificial muscle transmission system similar to the form of antagonist muscles is modeled based on the static Coulomb friction model. The transmission model with a sinusoidal input is simulated and analyzed in detail. And experiments are performed to validate our transmission model. The model shows high accuracy in predicting the system output. At the frequency of 1 Hz, the fidelity of output torque is 92.3% and the output displacement is 94.2%. Moreover, the maximum output force of the tendon-sheath artificial muscle with 0.8 mm tendon (under the safety factor of 4) can reach 80 N.	displacement mapping;elasticity (data store);experiment	Qi Zhang;Xingsong Wang;Mengqian Tian;Xiaopeng Shen;Qingcong Wu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2784377	control theory;artificial muscle;power transmission;tendon sheath;control engineering;hill's muscle model;engineering;transmission system;actuator;torque;transmission (mechanics)	Robotics	73.41092941030043	-22.057495751257672	123870

Four movers are mounted with same phase angles. There are nine legs, including eight independent legs and one common leg. All legs have same normal voltage but different normal currents. The normal current of the common leg is four times the normal current of the independent leg. Compared with axle-control topology, three legs are reduced in the non-symmetrical topology. As a result, the system complexity is simplified and the system reliability is enhanced. This paper also proposes the control method for the non-symmetrical PMLMTS.

0ab0537cf6f61d6760cd4f6881f95f4c7bc030a1	position control method of a non-contacting conveyance system for steel strip	position control	Abstract: Electromagnetic application system to improve the surface quality of steel strip is getting popular because customers demand better surface quality of steel strip. To realize such a requirement, non-contact conveyance methods by means of air floater and electromagnetic levitation and propulsion were considered. However, air floating method is not easy to control of the position of steel strip since the system is highly nonlinear. And thus, the application of a magnetic levitation and propulsion to steel strip conveyance is suitable. Sensors measuring positions of steel strip also need to be non-contact in order to maintain noncontact and simple characteristics of the system. This paper proposes the method of the spatial position estimation of steel plate without using sensors. This method simplifies non-contact conveyance system and cuts down expenses of the system. Spatial positions of steel strip can be estimated by currents supplied for electromagnet to maintain a fixed air gap. Estimated positions are then fed back into the control system to do position control. Computer simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the suitability of the proposed system performance and concept.	air gap (networking);computer simulation;control system;nonlinear system;sensor	Yeongseob Kueon;Hyoung Jin Yoon;Yoon Su Baek	2008			computer science	Robotics	74.63957615205238	-19.587496111019334	123916

This mechanical configuration allows for finger-gaiting while also retaining the passive adaptability and other capabilities of the underactuated finger pairs. As a result, the hand, requiring only four actuators, is capable of a unique set of dexterous manipulation primitives, including finger-gaiting and precision manipulation, while retaining the robust, adaptive precision and power grasping behavior of underactuated hands. The low-cost, compact design is built with rapid-prototyping techniques and off-the-shelf components, enabling quick and inexpensive fabrication that can be produced using even desktop FDM 3D printers.	3d printing;desktop computer;finite difference method;optic axis of a crystal;rapid prototyping;underactuation	Raymond R.

Running, legged robots have presented challenges in the area of electric machinery in particular. In addition to the low-speed, high-torque, low-mass requirements on the machines, the act of running results in an unconventional drive cycle that consists of brief periods of high torque followed by long stretches of minimal torque requirement, a performance envelope that is not matched by commercially-available machines. An optimized motor would dissipate the minimum possible power over the given drive cycle, lowering temperatures and potentially reducing required battery mass or extending range. These performance requirements have motivated faster modeling techniques to enable optimization of designs for these unconventional applications. This thesis presents a novel, fast modeling method for permanent magnet synchronous machines consisting of a hybrid model comprising an explicit Maxwell solution and a Flux Tube solution. The Maxwell solution is performed for the rotor and airgap of the machine, where geometries are simple and materials are homogeneous. The stator, with its geometric complexities and non-linear materials, is modeled with a lumped-parameter model based on flux tubes. The two models are then stitched together, forced to be self-consistent with boundary conditions, and allowed to converge. This captures effects such as cogging torque as well as saturation of the core materials. The method is approximately four orders of magnitude faster than a reference finite element program (0.01 s versus 100 s) for the same accuracy. The modeling method is implemented for two topologies of surface-mount permanent-magnet machines, an internal-rotor machine and an external-rotor machine. It is then used to optimize machine design to a given drive cycle, including effects of core loss. A machine is built to demonstrate the validity of the model and optimization method and test results match predictions of instantaneous torque to within 5% at the worst point. Cogging torque is another aspect of performance that is important to machines for robotics and other applications. These pulsations in torque caused by magnet alignment with geometric features in the stator result in undesired vibrations and		Matthew G.

To address the resultant storage issues, manufacturers have tried to increase storage capacity by narrowing the track pitch of digital storage media.[1] Considering all these factors, a high-precision tracking control system is required for optical discs. In this study, this paper develop and implement a feedforward control system using an trajectory command prediction mechanism to effectively suppress periodic components by field-programmable gate array (FPGA). This paper proposes a zero-phase error-tracking feedforward control system[2], [3] that considers the delay time component. This paper design and implement the propose control system for a test system, the ODU-1000 for Blu-ray, which is implanted in a digital signal processor (DSP). The results show that there is increased delay time because of the calculation time. In the configuration of the control system, this paper implement both feedback and feedforward control systems using a FPGA. The control system realizes high-speed control operation as a hardware controller. Experimental results obtain confirm that the propose system is practical and effective.	blu-ray;control system;controller (computing);digital recording;digital signal processor;elegant degradation;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;resultant;sampling (signal processing);signal processing	Keisuke Yoshida;Takahiro Ohashi;Kiyoshi Ohishi;Toshimasa Miyazaki	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2015.7222683	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	68.80630853025916	-11.080352729093734	125318

Today, in addition to CAD/CAM, there are tools for model derivation, control design and implementation. There are also tools for exporting models to a control design environment, as well as from control design to implementation (rapid prototyping tools). It is however, still difficult to combine these tools, especially when working with large systems (i.e. a lot of signals and parameters). We have therefore combined, interfaced and augmented some of these tools into a method that bridges the gaps between automatic model derivation and control implementation. Analytically derived functions (from Maple) are used for control design, simulation, visualization, evaluation (MATLAB) and implementation (Real-Time Workshop and xPC Target). The method and tools are illustrated by application to a four-legged robot in both simulation and reality. Generality is also examplified by applying the method to a simulated SCARA robot.	computer-aided design;matlab;maple;rapid prototyping;real-time transcription;robot;scara;simulation	Christian Ridderström;Johan Ingvast;Jan Wikander	2001		10.1109/ROBOT.2001.932794	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;data visualization;manufacturing engineering;computer-aided manufacturing	Robotics	71.46980859690743	-19.632548324457424	125384

Obviously, the term nonlinear system is too broad, and one is interested in subclasses of nonlinear systems with at least two properties. These classes should cover real world problems, and there should exist controller design methods, powerful enough to admit a systematic design of the closed loop with certain properties. Now, classical Hamiltonian systems have a rich mathematical structure, which has been extended such that dissipative effects and inputs, outputs, or better ports, are included in this class. This contribution starts with a Hamiltonian description of linear time invariant lumped parameter systems to motivate the introduction of certain mathematical ideas, which will be exploited in the nonlinear case afterwards. After that the approach will be extended to the distributed parameter case. Finally, the applicability of the presented methods is shown with the help of a piezoelectric elastic structure.	hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);mathematical model;nonlinear system	Kurt Schlacher	2008	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/j.matcom.2008.02.011	mathematical optimization;nonlinear control;nonlinear system;control theory;mathematics;distributed parameter system;physics	ML	75.05928693384543	-10.007221887343022	125692

90062126df5139e659f03b816eea95c5fd77060b	compensation of thermo-dependent machine tool deformations due to spindle load: investigation of the optimal transfer function in consideration of rough machining		The thermal behavior of a machine tool is an important indicator for the grade of production accuracy and indirectly for the market success. The load-dependent temperature distribution and the resulting deformation of the machine tool are influenced by a variety of design and thermo-technical parameters. The main spindle of a machine tool is, without any doubt, the major heat source within the machine structure. The object of the scientific investigation presented in this article is the development of an approach to robust compensation of thermo-dependent machine tool deformations due to spindle load in consideration of rough machining. The focus of the work concentrates on the identification of the model with the highest compensation performance. The underlying concept for the compensation of thermo-dependent machine tool deformations is the indirect approach by using the speed and the effective power of the main spindle for the calculation of the Tool Center Point (TCP) displacement. The presented modeling approach requires the knowledge of the TCP displacement in X-, Yand Z-direction depending on the speed and the effective power of the main spindle. As a tool for modeling the thermo-dependent behavior of a milling machine, a load test rig for repeatable, defined long-term loading of the main spindle has been developed. It simulates the cutting force depending on the spindle speed and the torque and applies load to the main spindle. The spindle speed and the spindle effective power can be taken directly from the numerical control of the machine tool. An important advantage of the presented compensation method is the fact that it does not require any external sensors. The displacement of the TCP has to be measured, but only during modeling. The relationship between the speed/power of the main spindle as a cause and the displacement of the TCP in X-, Yand Z-direction as an effect can be determined by a transfer function. This paper compares the compensation results depending on the transfer function and identifies the model with the best compensation performance. The validation of the compensation method is executed by using the example of two different speed and power spectra of the main spindle.	broadcast delay;displacement mapping;distortion;hard disk drive;load testing;numerical analysis;sensor;spectral density;transfer function	Christian Brecher;Adam Wissmann	2011	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-011-0311-4	control engineering;engineering;forensic engineering;engineering drawing	Robotics	77.37414140815496	-14.756079738248745	125749

Capability of measuring biogenic substances using this method has been proved. Variable phase filter has a piezoelectric actuator which has the stroke of 30μm. However, it is not enough for mid-infrared application. Smooth Impact drive mechanism with longer stroke was used here. However, smooth control is challengeable.

To realize the development of a flapping micro aerial vehicle, it is essential to study real insects' flight. In particular, the sophisticated structure of the wing contains many helpful hints for the solution of the efficiency. However, to solve the fluid–structure interaction problem between wing deformation and the surrounding airflow has been quite difficult, and the study of the ultimately light wing has been inhibited. We analyzed this problem using a novel numerical simulation — finite element analysis based on the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian method, which can treat the interactive behavior accurately. A comparison of wing deformations and surrounding airflows for 13 wing models, actuated in the same way as is hovering by a real dragonfly and having one-third to 23 times the Young's modulus of a real dragonfly wing, indicated that the real wing positioned on the lower border of the zone where the flight efficiency ...	aerial photography;stiffness	Masaki Hamamoto;Yoshiji Ohta;Keita Hara;Toshiaki Hisada	2010	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/016918610X493642	computer simulation;structural engineering;simulation;aerospace engineering;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;finite element method	Robotics	74.96697206286177	-23.902660716678405	126161

Sepehri Assistant Professor Department of Mechanical Engineering T h e University of Manitoba Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3T-2N2, Canada Abstract This paper presents a method for motion control of a class of heavy-duty hydraulic machines in a resolved teleoperation mode. A model-based sensor-based algorithm is proposed which is applied in conjunction wi th the closed-loop components.

The scheme incorporates a logic system which, according t o the states relevant to the machine task, decides on the minimum port ion of the hydraulic model to be used. Inclusion of this algori thm eliminates most of the effects of loading, coupled actuation and single joint power limitations, which allows easier implementation of the closed-loop part.

A calibration index is introduced, based on the mobility equation, that considers sensed and unsensed joints and single and multiple loops and expresses the surplus of measurements over degrees of freedom at each pose. Past work using open-loop calibration, closed-loop calibration, and screw axis measurement is classified according to this calibration index. Numerical issues are surveyed, including task variable scaling, parameter variable scaling, rank determination, pose selection, and input noise handling.	apache axis;closing (morphology);image scaling;robot;system of measurement	John M.

The Itakura-Saito divergence NMF (Gaussian NMF) is justified for this purpose under an assumption that the complex spectra of source signals and those of the mixture signal are complex Gaussian distributed (the additiv-ity of power spectra holds). In fact, however, the source spectra are often heavy-tailed distributed. When the source spectra are complex Cauchy distributed, for example, the mixture spectra are also complex Cauchy distributed (the additivity of amplitude spectra holds). Using the complex t distribution that includes the complex Gaussian and Cauchy distributions as its special cases, we propose t-NMF as a unified extension of Gaussian NMF and Cauchy NMF. Furthermore, we propose the corresponding variant of positive semidefinite tensor factorization based on multivariate complex t distributions (t-PSDTF). The experimental results showed that while t-NMF and t-PSDTF were comparative to Gaussian counterparts in terms of peak performance, they worked much better on average because they are insensitive to initialization and tend to avoid local optima.	itakura–saito distance;local optimum;non-negative matrix factorization;source separation	Kazuyoshi Yoshii;Katsutoshi Itoyama;Masataka Goto	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7471635	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;computer science;machine learning;student's t-distribution;mathematics;non-negative matrix factorization;statistics	ML	79.76395039543637	-10.851232550861345	126851
15c33dceddf39a13fccf797f6dbaec1e3715d545	robot force/torque control in assembly tasks		Force/ torque control of robot manipulators has been quite intensively investigated during the last decades and it becomes more and more important in manufacturing tasks. However, most of industrial robots are predominantly position-controlled. In this article we will show examples to perform challenging assembling or disassembling tasks by manipulators using standard commercial robot controllers. This fact reduces the possibilities of force/torque control with respect to controller structures and parameters. Two experiments were chosen to demonstrate force controlled robot assembly. First task is to mount a nut on a thread bolt by a single robot using hybrid position/force control. In the second task two cooperating robots assemble the screw fitting using force/torque control. In this work the tasks are divided into some subtasks. For every scenario the convenient controller structure and the controller parameters have to be found out. The example tasks are successfully verified by practical experiments and the corresponding results are presented.	advanced process control;algorithm;assembly language;computer case screws;experiment;industrial robot;mathematical optimization;x86	Alexander Winkler;Jozef Suchy	2013		10.3182/20130619-3-RU-3018.00161	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory;robot control	Robotics	70.91736740937093	-20.467570910029654	127108

In PCCI, the combustion event begins without a direct combustion trigger in contrast to traditional spark-ignited gasoline engines and direct-injected diesel engines. The lack of a direct combustion trigger necessitates the usage of model-based controls to provide robust control of the combustion phasing. The nonlinear relationships between the control inputs and the combustion system response often limit the effectiveness of traditional, non-model-based controllers. Accurate knowledge of the system states and inputs is required for implementation of an effective nonlinear controller. A nonlinear controller is developed and implemented to control the engine combustion timing during diesel PCCI operation by targeting desired values of the in-cylinder oxygen concentration, pressure, and temperature during early fuel injection.	computer-aided design;control theory;cylinder-head-sector;diesel;disk controller;experiment;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;robust control;system on a chip	Lyle E.

765420d0607dbde6b93f3d3c3ca840c881e23b9d	a hybrid control approach for powered parafoil combining active disturbance rejection control and unbalanced load compensation		Powered parafoil is a kind of low-speed unmanned air vehicle and is widely used in aerospace applications. However, the wind interference and the unbalanced load on the actuators of its horizontal controller extremely reduce the control effect and the disturbance rejection ability of the trajectory tracking. In order to solve these problems, a hybrid control approach for powered parafoil based on active disturbance rejection control is proposed. In this control approach, distinguished from other existing ones, the horizontal controller consists of the inner and outer loops. The outer loop is applied to accurately control the flight direction and offset the wind disturbance of the whole system. Meanwhile, the inner loop is designed to offer higher control precision and dynamically compensate the unbalanced load on the actuators of the horizontal controller. In order to verify the control approach, the model of the powered parafoil is improved by the model of rudders and flap deflection.

Forward and inverse kinematics of a finger, which is an open-chain manipulator with four degrees of freedom (DoF), is discussed. Forward kinematics are solved using the transformations in form of exponential of twist between the adjacent link frames to obtain the configuration of the fingertip frame T relative to the base frame S. For inverse kinematics, an algorithm is proposed to get the angle of rotation of the articulation, which is close to the palm, and Paden-Kahan sub problems are used to obtain the angles of rotation of the other articulations. The models of five fingers are integrated into a complete hand and the co-simulation results using Adams and Matlab confirm the feasibility and efficiency.	algorithm;anomaly detection at multiple scales;biconnected component;catia;co-simulation;computer case screws;forward kinematics;inverse kinematics;matlab;mathematical model;propagation of uncertainty;simulation;symbolic computation;time complexity;transformation matrix;velocity (software development);workspace	Youwei Dong;Hieu Phan;Ahmed Rahmani	2015	IJCSA		screw theory;machine learning;artificial intelligence;computer science;inverse kinematics;control theory;manipulator;kinematics;forward kinematics;exponential function;angle of rotation	Robotics	69.33156250226037	-20.27127505036082	129341

The MLR has versatile modes of locomotion, such as biped walking, quadruped walking, brachiation and ladder climbing. The transition is a challenging motion, because the environmental boundaries change and the robot has to switch the form of its locomotion depending on its surroundings, situations and purposes. The robot supports itself with three end-effectors that maintain its stability, while one hand transfers from a rung on the vertical ladder to a new rung behind the robot for brachiation. A closed kinematic chain is formed by the robot links and the ladder. In this case, if the number of position-controlled active joints is greater than the number of the chain’s degrees of freedom, an internal stress appears because of unavoidable position errors. The huge internal stress may lead some motors to become overloaded. Since the safety of each motor is very important for a serial-link robot, a load-allocation algorithm is proposed to balance the loads of the joint motors. The algorithm is verified through experiments. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden and The Robotics Society of Japan, 2012	3d modeling;algorithm;experiment;function overloading;hill climbing;kinematic chain;lu decomposition;learning to rank;load balancing (computing);nl (complexity);nv network;poor posture;robot;robotics;serial communication;unbalanced circuit	Zhiguo Lu;Tadayoshi Aoyama;Kousuke Sekiyama;Yasuhisa Hasegawa;Toshio Fukuda	2012	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/156855312X633101	control engineering;simulation;engineering;transition;control theory;degrees of freedom	Robotics	71.77156409598557	-22.093417570988525	129465

It is planned to be used for the inspection of complex shaped environments in power plant components, as they can be found in the housings of large generators, steam chests or pipe systems. After a detailed discussion of previous designs and their main limitations, we present a new vehicle concept that rolls on magnetic hexagonal cam-discs. In preliminary experiments we show that inner and outer transition can be passed with such magnetic cam-discs very easily. Where a normal magnetic wheel would get stuck, this new design just passes. This observation and its impact on robot design are analyzed more detailed by using a 2D mechanical calculation model. This analysis leads to the finding that a robot rolling on such cam-discs instead of classic magnetic wheels can be realized much simpler than previous designs – using traction on only the front shafts, no rubber cover on the cam-discs (higher robustness on rusty surfaces) and no additional mechanisms such as additional wheels in the structure, dual magneticwheels or even additional actuators for actively reducing the unwanted adhesion force in inner transitions. After successful tests with a preliminary prototype with only one traction unit, the paper concludes with the realization and tests of the final prototype (also including a second unit for steering and a camera mock-up), a comparison towards our previous design and an outlook to future improvements and enhancements.	experiment;microsoft outlook for mac;mock object;prototype;robot;steam;traction teampage;wheels	Wolfgang Fischer;Gilles Caprari;Roland Siegwart;Roland Moser	2010			control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	75.13128633403728	-22.20333639372173	129818

Robot’s mechanism design consists of two essential parts: tubes to lead a core and mechanical controlling parts to correspond movements. Our robot gets its motivation force by displacing the spherical movable mass known as core in curvy manners inside certain pipes. This simulation investigates by explaining the mechanical and structural features of the robot for creating hydraulic-base actuation via force and momentum analysis. Next, we categorize difficult and integrated 2D motions to omit unstable equilibrium points through derived nonlinear dynamics. We propose an algorithmic position control in forward direction that creates hybrid model as solution for motion planning problem in spherical robot. By deriving nonlinear dynamics of the spherical robot and implementing designed motion planning, we show how RollRoller can be efficient in high speed movements in comparison to the other pendulum-driven models. Then, we validate the results of this position control obtained by nonlinear dynamics via Adams/view simulation which uses the imported solid model of RollRoller. Lastly, We have a look to the circular maneuver of this robot by the same simulator.	ball project;categorization;closed system;control theory;dynamical system;fastest;mobile robot;motion planning;nonlinear system;requirement;shingled magnetic recording;simulation;solid modeling;velocity (software development)	Seyed Amir Tafrishi;Sandor M.

Joint strain derived torque servoing is found to provide the best overall robust force control performance. Experimental results of the robust hard-on-hard contact achieved with the novel force controller implementation based on joint torque sensing are provided. Conclusions are drawn on the force control performance achievable on a geared robot given the joint servoing technique. >		Paul Elosegui;Ron W. Daniel;Paul M.

d75ad12072046db4f72cbfaa4ab7cc004f6c6395	advanced parallel robot with extended rsur kinematic for a circulating working principle		Parallel robots are manipulators who use closed kinematic loops to create a movement at the Tool Center Point (TCP). Due to this kind of kinematic loops, it causes the mechanism to have high stiffness, high ratio of load to self-weight and low inertia, even though it will have good repeatability and high dynamics. A very well-known example of a parallel manipulator is the Delta Robot which is commonly used in the pick and place industry. Delta Robots are known to normally use a pivoting working principle for the actuating upper arms, meaning, its design does not make it possible for the upper arm actuators to make a complete revolution. This paper introduces a new type of an advanced Delta Robot with extended RSUR kinematic which allows a complete revolution of the actuators what will lead to the advantages of storing rotational energy in cycles comparatively like a flywheel what is a machine element that stores rotational energy. The extended kinematic torque curve of actuators therefore runs more smoothly and thus the payload by same cycle time increases. The following work will introduce the kinematic model description of such an advanced Delta Robot that is working with a circulating working principle, and discuss several simulation results of such a kinematic to prove the efficiency of the circulating working principle. Furthermore, a comparison with a real Delta Robot hardware and the advanced Delta Robot simulation model is introduced.	parallel manipulator	Stefan Tobias Albrecht;Hailin Huang;Bing Li	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-65292-4_35	control theory;delta robot;control engineering;engineering;smt placement equipment;torque;inertia;kinematics;robot kinematics;parallel manipulator;flywheel	Robotics	71.96129829520194	-21.572987475514054	130792

Starting from the analysis of the human lower limbs, we figure out that 6 DOF per leg are fundamental for a correct walking motion and can be adopted in a mechanical design of a humanoid robot. A close investigation of the joints leads us to a novel modular mechanical design, with a parallel architecture mechanism characterized by and high degree of interchangeable components. The robot is using twelve high performance hollow shaft electrical actuators acting in pairs in a parallel manner, a remote compact and transparent actuation with zero-backlash cable transmissions, 2 DOF differential joints between each segment of the limb and a light-weight carbon fiber skeleton modeling and mimic the anatomy of the human legs. The modular 2 DOF cable differential joint has been implemented at the hip, knee and ankle level. Using our approach, actuation is more transparent (back-drivable, with low inertia) and will allow SHERPA to interact with the environment more smoothly which leads to better walking ability.	diagram;humanoid robot;lambda lifting;optical fiber;parallel computing;prototype;smoothing;structural integrity and failure	Ionut Mihai Constantin Olaru;Sébastien Krut;François Pierrot	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354425	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	72.41334174374025	-23.24691863528425	131329

Their construction provides better performance and reliability than DC drives. But there is also one significant disadvantage -actual rotor position knowledge is necessary to control the drive even in the case when only speed control is required. A position sensor has to be used increasing the drive cost. Algorithms for rotor position and speed estimation from electrical quantities have been developed by many authors. This paper presents PMSM observability analysis to be able to define conditions under which it is possible to compute rotor speed and position.	algorithm;r.o.t.o.r.

Upon the sensor detecting an emergency, such as a collision, the sensor produces a signal that is sent to the door lock releasing mechanism. The door lock releasing mechanism then unlocks the door lock mechanism. The sensor may also trigger disconnection of the battery from the automobileu0027s electrical circuitry and interruption of the fuel line from the fuel tank to the engine. The emergency sensor may alternatively include a temperature or smoke sensor.	binary prefix	Hans-Jürgen Bürckert	2007	KI		automotive engineering;lock (computer science);collision;battery (electricity);fuel tank;fuel line;airbag deployment;automotive industry;computer science	Crypto	81.82794440514307	-19.208909039574223	131492

The controllability and observability around the upright equilibrium point (UEP) are investigated. Specific properties of the mechanical parameters are extracted to demonstrate that when there are two adjacent active links, the robot is linearly controllable and observable at the UEP, regardless of its mechanical parameters. When there are no active links adjacent to each other, a sufficient and necessary condition is established to ensure the controllability and observability at the UEP. This paper provides insights into the linear controllability and observability of an n-link planar robot for different actuator-sensor configurations.	observable;robot	Yuqing Hao;Zhisheng Duan	2016	2016 12th IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation (ICCA)	10.1109/ICCA.2016.7505276	control engineering;mathematical optimization;observability;controllability;engineering;control theory;mathematics;symmetric matrix;actuator	Robotics	68.50376415078661	-16.36657541668394	131570

The twisted string actuation system is particularly suitable for very compact and light-weight robotic devices, like artificial limbs and exoskeletons, since it allows the implementation of powerful tendon-based driving systems, based on small-size DC motors characterized by high speed, low torque and very limited inertia. One of the major limitations of this actuation system is by now related to the fact that the string should not be in contact with any obstacle, because this contact will alter the twisting angle propagation along the string and, eventually, completely stop the string twisting. This design constraint imposes a straight path between the motor and the linear load attached to the other string end. After the presentation of the basic properties of the twisted string actuation system, the model of the twisted string in contact with a sliding surface is discussed. The behavior of the system has been then experimentally verified and discussed. A preliminary evaluation of control strategies for compensating the side effects generated by the contact of the twisted string with the sliding surface is also presented.	design closure;experiment;interaction;pid;robot;robotic arm;simulation;software propagation;twisted	Gianluca Palli;Mohssen Hosseini;Claudio Melchiorri	2016	2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2016.7759064	robot;control engineering;simulation;engineering;friction;mathematical model;control theory;torque;force;actuator	Robotics	73.43721973133941	-23.142340009637422	131698

The proposed observer is suitable for the realization of a torque control with minimum torque ripple. In order to implement the observer, the EMF generated by the motor is first obtained experimentally offline. After that, it is approximated by a Fourier series in order to develop the model to be used in the online estimation. From the estimated EMF, rotor position and speed are calculated using the relationship between the EMF and the rotor variables. The proposal is validated with experimental results.	approximation algorithm;control theory;experiment;nonlinear system;online and offline;prototype;r.o.t.o.r.;ripple effect;waveform	Cristian H.

A KUKA youBot ® mobile manipulator was sensorized using 7 FlexiForce® piezo-resistive sensors, attached to the surface of the manipulator arm. ROS transfers frame and Kinematics libraries transferred interaction pushing forces measured by the sensors to velocity commands to the robot. These results transformations were verified using a derived Denavit-Hartenberg table. Resulting robot movement is always parallel to the axis of detected forces, regardless of orientation of the sensors relative to the mobile manipulator's base, or the number of sensors detecting forces. Verification of this behavior was conducted during two separate experiments. This system and behavior will be used in future physical human-robot interaction research to perform assistive tasks.	denavit–hartenberg parameters;experiment;human–robot interaction;library (computing);mobile manipulator;open-source robotics;open-source software;optic axis of a crystal;piezoelectricity;robot;sensor;velocity (software development)	Joe Sanford;Isura Ranatunga;Dan O.

35eb099e6a0e44063dab43d5849423efdd920d23	nonlinear state-space modelling of the kinematics of an oscillating circular cylinder in a fluid flow		The flow-induced vibration of bluff bodies is an important problem of many marine, civil, or mechanical engineers. In the design phase of such structures, it is vital to obtain good predictions of the fluid forces acting on the structure. Current methods rely on computational fluid dynamic simulations (CFD), with a too high computational cost to be effectively used in the design phase or for control applications. Alternative methods use heuristic mathematical models of the fluid forces, but these lack the accuracy (they often assume the system to be linear) or flexibility to be useful over a wide operating range. In this work we show that it is possible to build an accurate, flexible and low-computational-cost mathematical model using nonlinear system identification techniques. This model is data driven: it is trained over a user-defined region of interest using data obtained from experiments or simulations, or both. Here we use a Van der Pol oscillator as well as CFD simulations of an oscillating circular cylinder to generate the training data. Then a discrete-time polynomial nonlinear state-space model is fit to the data. This model relates the oscillation of the cylinder to the force that the fluid exerts on the cylinder. The model is finally validated over a wide range of oscillation frequencies and amplitudes, both inside and outside the so-called lock-in region. We show that forces simulated by the model are in good agreement with the data obtained from CFD.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;cylinder seal;cylinder-head-sector;experiment;heuristic;mathematical model;nonlinear system identification;polynomial;region of interest;simulation;state space;van der pol oscillator	Jan Decuyper;Tim De Troyer;Mark Runacres;Koen Tiels;Johan Schoukens	2018	CoRR	10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.04.048	classical mechanics;potential flow around a circular cylinder	Robotics	72.68710084044905	-15.038817497063736	131995

Most of the researches in this field have been dedicated to rigid body grasping and only few of them have considered the case of deformable objects. Nevertheless, robotized grasping of deformable objects has many potential applications in various areas including bio-medical processing, food processing industry, service robotics, robotized surgery, etc. In this paper we address the problem of the grasping of 3D deformable object using a multi-fingered robotic hand. The deformable object behavior is modeled by using a non-linear isotropic mass-spring system. In order to deal with the interactions between the manipulated body and the robotic hand fingers, a contact model is proposed. It is based on force calculations between the hemispherical finger tips and each facet of the meshed contact surfaces. The initial fingers' configuration is defined so that a force closure grasping is obtained, which eliminates any relative Euclidean motion of the manipulated object, meanwhile, a grasping criterion is optimized. Several grasping criteria are evaluated along a pick and place operation on the deformable object.	british informatics olympiad;interaction;newton;nonlinear system;polyhedron;robot;robotics;smt placement equipment;time-scale calculus	Lazher Zaidi;Belhassen-Chedli Bouzgarrou;Laurent Sabourin;Youcef Mezouar	2014	2014 23rd International Conference on Robotics in Alpe-Adria-Danube Region (RAAD)	10.1109/RAAD.2014.7002259	control engineering;computer vision;simulation;engineering	Robotics	69.82443929710715	-21.66633973185365	132111

To obtain such robustness properties and maintain human-like performance, strength, workspace and size especially in the upper body, an elastic backbone approach is presented and discussed. Compared to the human spine stabilized by ligaments, intervertebral discs and muscles, we use a continuum mechanism based on silicone and tendons for actuation. The work presents the development of such a mechanism, that could be either used as neck or torso, but concentrates on the cervical part (neck). To prove functionality of the proposed concept, a planar setup was designed and experimental data regarding motion capabilities, robustness and dynamics are presented. With that knowledge, a modular multiple DOF prototype is built which can easily be equipped with different tendon routing and elastic continuum shapes. The results of that final setup will help the mechanical designer to choose the suitable solution for the robotic spine and provides a test bed to develop control strategies for such types of mechanisms.	amazon elastic block store;apache continuum;elastic net regularization;experiment;humanoid robot;internet backbone;normal (geometry);prototype;robustness (computer science);routing;testbed;triune continuum paradigm;workspace	Jens Reinecke;Bastian Deutschmann;David Fehrenbach	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487672	structural engineering;simulation;engineering;mechanical engineering	Robotics	71.94211528969761	-22.665796684452527	132127

As an extended version, robust GMPHD filter, also known as the λ-GMPHD filter, was subsequently proposed to handle unknown clutter rate. In this letter, we use a Partially Uniform Birth (PUB) model for target births and present the λ-PUB-GMPHD filter, which accommodates tracking scenarios where targets can appear anywhere in the surveillance region and clutter rate is unknown. However, analysis of the λ-PUB-GMPHD filter demonstrates that clutter cardinality is underestimated due to the presence of PUB model and the cardinality bias of clutter is susceptible to spontaneous target birth rate. Hence, we propose adaptive birth rate technique for the λ-PUB-GMPHD filter to initialize new tracks quickly and simultaneously avoid severe cardinality bias. Simulations are present to verify the λ-PUB-GMPHD filter with proposed adaptive birth rate technique.	clutter;computer simulation;numerical linear algebra;spontaneous order	Liang Ma;Ping Wang;Kai Xue;Duyong Kim	2014	The 2014 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS 2014)	10.1109/ICCAIS.2014.7020556	speech recognition;control theory;constant false alarm rate;statistics	Robotics	77.10709154170615	-10.357191802842072	132159

It considers the interaction between its mechanical and electrical parts. The mechanical part was established using FAST (which is an abbreviation of Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence). In the electrical part, the predictive direct torque control method is used to control the PMSG using a two-level voltage source inverter, which performs three switching operations in a sampling period to control accurately the electrical torque and amplitude of the stator flux. This control strategy enables the PMSG to be controlled with a very low sampling frequency. Currently, most relevant works model the mechanical and electrical parts of a wind turbine separately. In this work, both systems are discussed in detail and integrated into a complete model of a PMSG-based wind turbine system.	bending stiffness;control theory;flux qubit;interaction;microwave;power inverter;quantum fluctuation;ripple effect;sampling (signal processing);simulation;stress–strain analysis;turbulence;voltage source	Shih-Yu Yang;Yuan-Kang Wu;Huei-Jeng Lin;Wei-Jen Lee	2015	2015 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2015.7356791	control engineering;electronic engineering;permanent magnet synchronous generator;engineering;control theory;direct torque control	Robotics	73.08673808464275	-13.361761499041284	132249

We have since built an SDA system based on magneto-rheological fluid (MR) damper. In this paper, the dynamics property of SDA system based on the MR fluid damper (SMRDA) is investigated. The effect of the extra dynamics introduced by the MR fluid damper is revealed by comparing the SMRDA with the SDA system based on a linear Newtonian viscous damper (SNVDA). To linearize the constitutive property of the MR fluid damper, a modified Bingham model is proposed. A force feedback control loop is implemented after the linearization. An experimental SMRDA is built to illustrate the performance of the SDA system.

In order to speed up the functioning of the AFM for high speed imaging, a resonant controller with an integral action has been applied in the both x and y axis of the PTS for damping the resonant mode of the scanner and improve the tracking performance. The overall closed-loop system with this scheme has higher bandwidth with improved gain and phase margin than the existing PI controller. It can reduce the cross coupling of the scanner and allows faster scanning. To measure the performance improvement of the proposed scheme a comparison has been made between the proposed controller scanned image and the existing AFM PI controller scanned image.	analogue electronics;atomic-force microscopy;bode plot;care-of address;image scanner;optic axis of a crystal;phase margin;piezoelectricity;resonance;transfer function	Sajal K.

It is often estimated using a Kalman filter (KF) under the assumption that the statistical properties of the system and measurement errors are known. Otherwise, the SOC estimation error may be large or even divergent. In this paper, without the requirement of the known statistical properties, a SOC estimation method is proposed using an H∞ observer, which can still guarantee the SOC estimation accuracy in the worst statistical error case. Under the conditions of different currents and temperatures, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in the laboratory and field environments. With the comparison of the proposed method and the KF-based one, the experimental results show that the proposed method can still provide accurate SOC estimation when there exist inexact or unknown statistical properties of the errors. The proposed method has been applied successfully to the robot for inspecting the running 500-kV extra high voltage power transmission lines.	existential quantification;kalman filter;mobile robot;state of charge;transmission line	Fei Zhang;Guangjun Liu;Lijin Fang;Hongguang Wang	2012	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2011.2159691	kalman filter;control engineering;mobile robot;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;statistics	Robotics	72.79671794897024	-13.332991809986698	132771

The design exploits a compliant mechanical structure that enables piezoelectric forces to be amplified and transmitted to “legs” that propel the robot through a lift and pull scheme. The lift and pull design contrasts with typical slip/stick approaches that assume the inertia effects of the robot will allow the robot to slip on a smooth surface. By eliminating the slipping assumption, the potential surfaces that the proposed robot can traverse is significantly extended. Discussions are provided regarding the proposed locomotion method, kinematic modeling and system constraints, mechanical optimization, and control of the meso-scale robot.	displacement mapping;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;mesoscopic physics;mobile robot;pmr446;pierce oscillator;piezoelectricity;process architecture;propel;prototype;traverse	V.

The experimental set-up is very non-linear and very difficult to control properly. This paper describes the control of this mechatronic system’s interaction with its environment, controlling both its position and the force exerted against it. The classic position/force control techniques hybrid control and impedance control have been adapted to pneumatic muscles and applied to the experimental set-up developed. An alternative solution is also proposed whereby force or torque control is based on the calculation made by an estimator instead of on direct measurement by a sensor. The article presents a detailed analysis of the force and torque estimator used to close the control loops in the two position/force control schemes. Finally, the article concludes by presenting the experimental results obtained and the most outstanding conclusions of the study as a whole.	algorithm;characteristic impedance;mechatronics;nonlinear system;pneumatic artificial muscles;powered exoskeleton;robot	Aron Pujana-Arrese;Kepa Bastegieta;Anjel Mendizabal;Ramon Prestamero;Joseba Landaluze	2009			computer science	Robotics	72.42656887804299	-21.71996490043683	132902

The R+iSpace denotes `Reconfigurable Intelligent Space', and it can solve the problem of device's spatial constraint that the conventional iSpace has. The R+iSpace employs the mobile module (MoMo) to solve the problem. The MoMo is a kind of wall climbing robot, and the device is mounted on the MoMo. Thus, the R+iSpace can solve the problem by the rearranging of devices with MoMos. The previous MoMos use the screw-nut mechanism to stick on the fields that are the modified walls and ceilings for the MoMo's movement. This mechanism was employed to eliminate the energy consumption while the MoMo maintains current posture. However, the previous prototype MoMos have a problem of the moving speed and the stability of motion. The latest prototype MoMo employs a pin-lock mechanism to stick on the fields. This mechanism makes the mechanical structure simply. To verify that the latest prototype MoMo satisfies necessary conditions of the R+iSpace, two experiments were performed. In this paper, the mechanical structure of latest prototype MoMo and the results of the experiments are described in detail.	experiment;futures studies;hill climbing;poor posture;prototype;response time (technology);robot	JongSeung Park;Joo-Ho Lee	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2015.7222513	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	71.92208107359907	-23.14222446845718	133130

e84cee4ccc72d5214850b32a809cfa28284078a0	integrating mimic joints into dynamics algorithms: exemplified by the hybrid recupera exoskeleton		The design of various robots in industrial and academic contexts integrates closed loops to improve the mechanical stiffness in comparison with purely serial or tree-type topologies. In particular, planar kinematic loops as parallelograms or double parallelograms are employed in such hybrid robots. Since these systems are geometrically overconstrained in the group of spatial Euclidean motions, the computational performance and numerical accuracy of any model-based dynamics software is negatively affected. This paper introduces a novel method to avoid these numerical issues for any hybrid system with loops that can be characterized by the concept of linear mimic joints: these are passive joints which depend on an active joint in a closed loop in a linear manner. With the proposed approach, the loop closure functions are automatically composed from the robot description file and integrated into the analytical equations for solving the forward and the inverse dynamics problems. The paper illustrates the application of this method for a novel shoulder mechanism containing a planar six bar mechanism that has been designed for the Recupera whole-body exoskeleton.	algorithm;c++;computation;control theory;hybrid system;inverse dynamics;mathematical model;numerical analysis;robot;type system	Shivesh Kumar;Marc Simnofske;Bertold Bongardt;Andreas Müller;Frank Kirchner	2017		10.1145/3132446.3134891	machine learning;hybrid system;parallelogram;system dynamics;computer science;control engineering;euclidean geometry;kinematics;inverse dynamics;network topology;artificial intelligence	Robotics	69.19201217865604	-21.034030495866816	133372

This technique combines the benefits of compliant bodies from soft robotic actuators with the simplicity of direct coupling to electric motors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique by creating linear actuators, a four degree-of-freedom robotic platform, and a soft robotic gripper. We compare the soft robotic gripper against a state of the art pneumatic soft gripper, finding similar grasping performance in a significantly smaller and more energy-efficient package.

This module is basically constituted by an elastic diabolo, which mimics the vertebral bodies and the intervertebral disc, joining two metallic setsquares - the two consecutive vertebrae. Two actuators realize the actuation of the module and are oriented parallel to the main axis of the diabolo. This simple compliant model allowed us to construct a demonstrator that will be used to measure the incidence of active and passive movements of the model. From the knowledge of these results we will design a new compliant system in place of the elastic diabolo whose characteristics will be adequate to the convenient properties of the spine that could be included in humanoid machines.	apache axis;humanoid robot;incidence matrix	Christian Cibert;Vincent Hugel	2012	2012 IEEE RO-MAN: The 21st IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication	10.1109/ROMAN.2012.6343722	simulation;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;actuator	Robotics	72.21864940663403	-23.835681746325264	133578
c75d7d2c2dbd570cd3713794d7bc2579660911b9	an experimental study of passive dynamic walking	passive dynamic walking;gait pattern;biped;active control	A two-straight-legged walking mechanism with flat feet is designed and built to study the passive dynamic gait. It is shown that the mechanism having flat feet can exhibit passive dynamic walking as those with curved feet, but the walking efficiency is significantly lower. It is also shown that the balancing mass and its orientation are etfective for controlling side-to-side rocking and yaw, which have significant effects on steady walking. The effects of various parameters on the gait patterns are also studied. lt is shown that changes in the ramp angle have the most dominant effect on the gait pattern as compared with the changes in the hip mass, ramp surface friction and size of the flat feet. More specifically, as the ramp angle increases, the step length increases while the range of the side-to side rocking angle decreases and the step length dictates the walking speed and the gravitational power Another finding, is that adding a hip mass improves the walking efficiency by allowing the mechanism to walk on a flatter ramp. This research enables us to gain a better understanding of the mechanics of walking. Such an understanding will have a direct impact on better design of prostheses and on the active control aspects of bipedal robots.	design pattern;experiment;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;robot;yaws	Quansheng Wu;N.

The Nucor Steel Corporation bar mill, located in Marion Ohio, relies heavily on manual work force in its highway products division. A highly manual process introduces many safety hazards as well as inefficiencies and inconsistencies. One hazardous position is the bundling of heavy sign posts, which are manually raked into bundles before being manually banded, and workers are at risk for overuse injuries. Moreover, the sign posts are randomly positioned within a bundle, and hence the disorganized bundle is much larger than an organized stack of the same count. Disorganized bundles also hinder further automation processes downstream the production line, such as banding and powder coating the sign posts. This paper offers a robotic stacker solution utilizing Fanuc robot manipulators, custom-built end-effectors, and programmable logic controller (PLC) integrated with human machine interface (HMI) that will result in smaller and organized stacks as compared with the current disorganized bundles, and the removal of a worker from the hazardous position in the process. Organized stacks will also allow for further downstream automation processes. This research project is to be executed at Michigan Technological University and is sponsored by Nucor Steel Corporation.	chaos theory;colour banding;downstream (software development);lempel–ziv–stac;programmable logic device;randomness;repetitive strain;robot;safety engineering;solution stack;stacking;user interface	L.

The least squares concept is used to introduce terminology for the minimal linear combinations (MLCs) of the system parameters that define a set of linear combinations of the system parameters. The number of elements of the set is minimal, yet the set still completely determines the system. Furthermore, it is shown that the problem of finding a set of MLCs of a manipulator can be simplified to that of finding two individual sets of MLCs that determine the entries of the inertia matrix and the gravity load. Although the approach is applied to the inertia constants of composite bodies to obtain a set of MLCs identical to an earlier one, the result is newly interpreted in the least squares sense. The approach itself is a new method for finding the identifiable parameters of a manipulator, and it yields some new insight into the manipulator dynamics. The crucial feature is that a set of MLCs found by using the present approach is guaranteed to be identifiable. The earlier approaches always require an identification method to verify the results. An equivalence theorem is also presented that rigorously states the equivalence between the different sets of minimal parameters. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.		Shir-Kuan Lin	1994	J.

With a nonlinear suspension model, more accurate responses can be obtained compared to a traditional linear quarter-car suspension system model. The presented nonlinear two-dimensional mathematical model for the MacPherson suspension system is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and validated by comparing it to an Adams/View multibody model with three simulation cases, one for kinematic analysis and two for dynamic analysis. The results are expressed as normalized RMS deviation values between the outputs of the two models. Most outputs of the two models go hand in hand, and the greatest difference is in the camber angle values derived from simplified linearization in the mathematical model.	computer simulation;matlab;mathematical model;nonlinear acoustics;nonlinear system;simulink	Atte Rankinen;Enso Ikonen;Toni Liedes	2018	2018 14th IEEE/ASME International Conference on Mechatronic and Embedded Systems and Applications (MESA)	10.1109/MESA.2018.8449167	vehicle dynamics;camber angle;nonlinear system;active suspension;control theory;suspension (vehicle);kinematics;mathematics;linearization	Robotics	72.12323516521691	-15.624044833144179	135015

In contrast to standard motion platforms based on linear actuators, a mechanism with actuator design inspired from anthropological kinematic structure offers a relatively larger motion envelope and higher dexterity making it a viable motion platform for micromanipulations. The design consists of a motion plate connected through only revolute hinges for the passive joints, and three legs located at the base as the active elements. In this hybrid kinematic structure, each leg is connected to the top (motion) plate through three revolute hinges and to the bottom (fixed) plate through a single revolute joint forming a closed-loop kinematic chain. The paper describes the mathematical modeling of the proposed design and demonstrates its simulation model using SimMechanics and xPC Target for real-time simulations and visualization of the motion cues.	kinematic chain;mathematical model;motion simulator;real-time clock;serial manipulator;simulation	Umar Asif;Javaid Iqbal	2011	IJIMR	10.4018/ijimr.2011070101	control engineering;simulation;revolute joint;engineering;control theory	Robotics	71.04921463114364	-22.961469864999064	135542
d95474075adb4252fde7af9efdbafc39b892ecf5	optimal control of a distributed parameter system with applications to beam vibrations using piezoelectric actuators		Abstract   This paper addresses the issue of the active vibration control of the transverse modes in a flexible elastic systems. The control is implemented by discrete sets of piezoelectric actuators that apply the optimal forces. The performance index is a time-dependent quadratic functional of state variables and their time derivatives, and control forces which are determined by minimizing the objective functional subject to a penalty term on the control functions. A combination of Galerkin and variational approaches are employed to determine the control forces in the time domain explicitly in terms of coupled amplitudes and velocities. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to a physical problem controlled by piezoelectric patch actuators.	optimal control;piezoelectricity	Ismail Kucuk;Ibrahim Sadek;Yalcin Yilmaz	2014	J.

This control algorithm is based on the estimation of rotor speed and angular position starting from the back electromotive force space-vector determination without voltage sensors by using the reference voltages given by the current controllers instead of the actual ones. This choice obviously introduces some errors that must be vanished by means of a compensating function. The novelties of the proposed estimation algorithm are the position-estimation equation and the process of compensation of the inverter phase lag that also suggests the final mathematical form of the estimation. The mathematical structure of the estimation guarantees a high degree of robustness against parameter variation as shown by the sensitivity analysis reported in this paper. Experimental verifications of the proposed sensorless-control system have been made with the aid of a flexible test bench for brushless motor electrical drives. The test results presented in this paper show the validity of the proposed low-cost sensorless-control algorithm and, above all, underline the high dynamic performances of the sensorless-control system also with a reduced equipment.	algorithm;angularjs;control system;experiment;mathematical structure;performance;power inverter;r.o.t.o.r.;sensor;test bench	Fabio Genduso;Rosario Miceli;Cosimo Rando;Giuseppe Ricco Galluzzo	2010	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2034182	control engineering;magnet;synchronous motor;electronic engineering;transducer;engineering;control theory;estimation theory;system testing;sensitivity analysis;physics;electric potential;quantum mechanics	Robotics	72.64120654749115	-13.583782199471756	135963

In this method, the circulating drilling fluid, which takes cuttings out of the well, is released at the surface through a controlled choke. This choke is used for active control of the fluid pressure in the well. The corresponding automatic control system keeps the pressure at the bottom of the well at a specified set-point despite various disturbances. One of such disturbances, vertical motion of the drill string, causes severe pressure fluctuations which need to be actively attenuated. In this paper we present two different disturbance rejection strategies based on discretized partial differential equations for the well hydraulic system. The performance of the controllers is shown through simulations both under idealized conditions as well as by simulations on a high fidelity drilling simulator.	automatic control;control system;discretization;full scale;music player daemon;pipe rolls;rejection sampling;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Ingar Skyberg Landet;Alexey Pavlov;Ole Morten Aamo;Hessam Mahdianfar	2012	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2012.2204751	control engineering;engineering;control theory;mathematics;geotechnical engineering;partial differential equation;physics	Robotics	70.26067829697625	-13.705203178007595	136055

The newly designed sliding mode controller is composed of the velocity segment and the position segment. Global sliding mode control is used in the velocity segment so that the velocity along the sliding surface can exponentially accelerate from 0 to a constant velocity determined by the given position. Integral sliding mode control is adopted in the position segment to improve the position accuracy. In order to reduce the chattering and enhance the robustness of the system, the fuzzy inference is introduced to obtain the switching control laws.

On the basis of this input, the control unit automatically prepares a processing program which decides on the amounts and directions of movement of the tool rest longitudinally and transversely from a reference point which is inherent in the machine and controls the movement in accordance therewith so as to automatically machine the workpiece to the predetermined shape and dimensions. A desired final processing shape may be designated by using function keys on the operating panel bearing words in everyday or conversational language, whereupon the control unit automatically decides what is the data necessary for the particular machining that should be put in and then it turns on guide lamps corresponding to the decided data successively in the order in which the data should be put in, so as to guide the operator. Thus, it is only necessary for the operator to put in specific numerical values by means of ten-keys under the guidance.		Selma C. Etter	2001	J.

dd73f97e2602e761befc83d8f0344eded1d82350	cyclic torque imbalance detection in gasoline engines using second order sliding mode		Engine torque imbalance is a wide-ranging problem, caused due to the variance of combustion mixture in the engine cylinder. It is desired to generate uniform output torque by the engine cylinder in successive combustion cycles. Any impediment in it causes cyclic torque imbalance which generates non-smooth output power and excessive stress in the engine components. Torque imbalance affects engine performance as it increases engine exhaust emissions and reduces fuel efficiency. In this research work, detection of cyclic torque imbalance is carried out by employing a second order sliding mode observer, based on the First Principle based Engine Model. Net piston force is treated as unknown input to torque production subsystem of the model and it is estimated using the proposed observer. Torque imbalance is simulated by varying the mass of fuel injected per cycle. Simulation results illustrated the efficacy of the proposed method to detect cyclic torque imbalance.	cycle (graph theory);cyclic gmp;cylinder seal;emission - male genitalia finding;engine exhaust;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;sample variance;simulation;torque;negative regulation of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel activity	R.

cbb42168ae17a6962f29b2ccc029795abdf6cb19	motor shaft vibrations may have a negative effect on ability to implement a stiff haptic wall		A one degree of freedom experimental test bed is used to investigate the effects of elastic vibration in haptic devices. Strong angular vibration occurs at the motor rotor due to elastic deformation in the shaft. These vibrations occur due to large discontinuities in the virtual environment such as stiff contact which is common in haptics. Also looked at was the effect of these vibrations on stability and control. It was found that the vibrations may negatively affect the stability of the haptic device by introducing large measurement errors to the controller. The experiments investigated using different types of damping in controller feedback. Adding damping to the system whilst these elastic vibrations are present can successfully damp the system, but also tend to increase the magnitude of vibrations sometimes resulting in greater instability. Finally, a second non co-located encoder was used to try to eliminate measurement error from the system due to vibration. It was found that by simply placing the encoder closer to the link where the angle is being measured, error due to rotational flex in the shaft is eliminated. This yielded the greatest improvement in controller performance, nearly eliminating the presence of the vibrations and their effects.	haptic technology	Louis Swaidani;Luke Steele;William S.

It holds promise of combining low emission levels with high efficiency. However, as ignition timing in HCCI operation lacks direct actuation and is highly sensitive to operating conditions and disturbances, robust closed-loop control is necessary. To facilitate control design and allow for porting of both models and the resulting controllers between different engines, physics-based mathematical models of HCCI are of interest. This paper presents work on a physical model of HCCI including cylinder wall temperature and evaluates predictive controllers based on linearizations of the model. The model was derived using first principles and formulated on a cycle-to-cycle basis. The resulting model was of second order with two inputs and two outputs. Measurement data including cylinder wall temperature measurements was used for calibration and validation of the model. Predictive control of the combustion phasing was then evaluated experimentally using ethanol as fuel. The control signals were the intake temperature and the inlet valve closing timing. The control performance was evaluated in terms of response time and steady-state output variance. Multi-cylinder control experiments were also carried out.	closing (morphology);control theory;cycle basis;cylinder seal;cylinder-head-sector;experiment;mathematical model;operating point;response time (technology);steady state;thermal management of high-power leds	Anders Widd;Kent Ekholm;Per Tunestal;Rolf Johansson	2012	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2011.2128871	control engineering;engineering;automotive engineering;control theory;predictive modelling;model predictive control;physics	Embedded	72.97864853694998	-10.863132091241821	137631

This paper proposes an aircraft bleed air temperature control system, aiming at minimizing the ram air usage to reduce drag and fuel consumption while maintaining fast temperature control response. To achieve both of the objectives, a new control system configuration is developed to control both ram air and bypass flows in such a way that the bypass bleed air flow is automatically controlled at a small level that is just sufficient to maintain fast regulation of the flow temperature at the load. Analytical equations describing the system dynamics and linearized model are derived and utilized in the overall bleed air temperature control design and analysis. PI control and optimal output feedback are investigated. Computer simulations and experiments have been conducted, and the proposed control system is shown to be effective in reducing ram air usage and maintaining fast temperature control response in the meantime.	block cipher mode of operation;computer cooling;computer simulation;control system;control theory;experiment;feedback;random-access memory;requirement;response time (technology);system configuration;system dynamics	Lan Shang;Guangjun Liu;Peter Hodal	2010	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2009.2021647	turbofan;control engineering;simulation;systems modeling;optimal control;temperature;engineering;control system;linear model;airflow;drag;temperature control;control theory;feedback;fuel efficiency;system dynamics;derivation;air cooling	Robotics	72.59652694849431	-10.2719594141823	137650

Due to this redundancy, a given task can be completed by multiple arm configurations, and there is no unique mathematical solution to the inverse kinematics. The redundancy of a wearable robotic system (exoskeleton) that interacts with the human is expected to be resolved in the same way as that of the human arm. A unique solution to the system's redundancy was introduced by combining both kinematic and dynamic criteria. The redundancy of the arm is expressed mathematically by defining the swivel angle: the rotation angle of the plane including the upper and lower arm around a virtual axis connecting the shoulder and wrist joints which are fixed in space. Two different swivel angles were generated based on kinematic and dynamic constraints. The kinematic criterion is to maximize the projection of the longest principle axis of the manipulability ellipsoid for the human arm on the vector connecting the wrist and the virtual target on the head region. The dynamic criterion is to minimize the mechanical work done in the joint space for each two consecutive points along the task space trajectory. These two criteria were then combined linearly with different weight factors for estimating the swivel angle. Post processing of experimental data collected with a motion capturing system indicated that by using the proposed synthesis of redundancy resolution criteria, the error between the predicted swivel angle and the actual swivel angle adopted by the motor control system was less then five degrees. This result outperformed the prediction based on a single criteria.	apache axis;coefficient;computational complexity theory;control system;equation solving;genetic algorithm;inverse kinematics;manipulability ellipsoid;motion capture;redundancy (engineering);robot;wearable computer	Hyunchul Kim;Zhi Li;Dejan Milutinovic;Jacob Rosen	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2012.6224830	control engineering;motor control;dynamics;kinematics;motion capture;simulation;robotic arm;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;inverse kinematics;control theory;degrees of freedom;redundancy;robot kinematics	Robotics	68.66613447484356	-23.385640601166205	137949

In this paper a new method is presented to estimate clamp force based on other sensory information. The proposed estimator fuses the outputs of two models to optimise the root mean square error (RMSE) of estimation. Experimental results show that the estimator can accurately track the true clamp force for high speed cases as demanded by anti-lock braking system (ABS) controls. A training strategy has been used to ensure that the estimator can successfully adapt to frictional variations within the reduction gearing.

To fabricate such precise devices, not only stages position but also stages attitude needs to be controlled rapidly and precisely. In this paper, an experimental 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) high-precision stage with a novel 6-DOF air bearing called “gravity canceller” is designed and fabricated. The 6-DOF stage consists of a fine stage and a coarse stage. The gravity canceller compensates for the fine stage's gravity and supports the fine stage without friction. This structure enables us to reduce heat which is generated close to the fine stage. For a 6-DOF control problem, attitude control is as important as translational control. Rotational motion, however, has nonlinearity and coupling arising from dynamics and kinematics which could degrade the attitude control performance. Therefore, in our past paper, our research group proposed a multi-input multi-output nonlinear feedforward attitude controller to compensate such problems. Experiments were performed to verify the effectiveness of the attitude controller by using the new experimental 6-DOF stage.	feedforward neural network;induced gravity;integrated circuit;liquid-crystal display;nonlinear system	Wataru Ohnishi;Hiroshi Fujimoto;Koichi Sakata;Kazuhiro Suzuki;Kazuaki Saiki	2014	2014 American Control Conference	10.1109/ACC.2014.6859023	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	71.13380061208146	-14.275165842347684	138536

Using the three prismatic joints, the proposed manipulator has a truss type base structure and the moving plate is located on the truss type base. This type of manipulator could sustain larger stress concentrations compared to conventional parallel manipulators. The research objective is to develop a truss body parallel manipulator which has 3 degrees of freedom while retaining the advantages of high stiffness and compact size characteristics of parallel manipulators.

Previous work to regulate forces and torques generated by flapping wings has focused on controlling wing trajectory. An alternative approach uses underactuated mechanisms with tuned dynamics to passively regulate these forces and torques. The resulting `mechanically intelligentu0027 devices execute wing trajectory corrections to realize desired body forces and torques without the intervention of an active controller.rnrnThis article describes an insect-scale flapping wing mechanism consisting of a single piezoelectric actuator, an underactuated transmission, and passively rotating wings. Wing stroke velocities are passively modulated to eliminate net airframe roll torque. A theoretical model predicts lift generating wing trajectories and quantifies the passive reduction in roll torque. An experimental structure provides an at-scale demonstration of passive torque regulation.		Pratheev Sreetharan;Robert J.

3eb196019dc17c6aa60e2997e6683ebdab31d49a	a hybrid controller for purity control of a pressure swing adsorption process		A hybrid controller is proposed for Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) processes. Since the process is described by a set of Partial Differential Algebraic Equations (PDAE's), first a Local Reduced Order Model (LROM) for the process is developed and then it is formalized as a hybrid system. A controller is designed for purity control of the process in the presence of external disturbances, by determining the maximal safe set of the LROM. Hybrid backward reachability analysis is performed for this purpose. The controller is designed and applied to a two-bed, six-step PSA process whose dynamical behavior is simulated by a full-order principle-based model of the process. Excellent performance of the controller is obtained.	algorithmic efficiency;dynamical system;hybrid system;maximal set;numerical analysis;partial differential algebraic equation;polar surface area;pure function;purification of quantum state;reachability;simulation;swing (java)	Mohammad Fakhroleslam;Shohreh Fatemi;Ramin Bozorgmehry Boozarjomehry;Elena De Santis;Maria Domenica Di Benedetto;Giordano Pola	2017	2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2017.8263996	control theory;process control;boundary value problem;control theory;hybrid system;partial derivative;computer science;adsorption;algebraic equation;pressure swing adsorption	Embedded	75.84722670087983	-10.10724852371155	138798

Solutions suggested by previous studies have mainly focused on the concept of stiffness variation, its design and verification, and the explosive actions of variable stiffness joint actuators. This paper proposes a variable stiffness actuator that features a leaf spring as the elastic element and a pair of disks with two Archimedes spiral grooves as the stiffness adjusting mechanism, maintaining  $\phi 114\,\,\text {mm}\times 130$  mm overall dimensions and a full range (i.e., 127–2095 Nm/rad) of stiffness variation driven by a 7.2-W motor and, therefore, creating a competitive advantage in both compactness and energy saving capacity. The proposed actuator is intended as a dynamics model to predict the exact kicking speed under any given initial conditions of joint stiffness, kicking time, and load mass and for uses in the joints of industrial and/or service robots that frequently involve explosive actions.	initial condition;robot;stiffness	Wei Wang;Yanwei Zhao;Yangmin Li	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2864100	joint stiffness;torque;system dynamics;actuator;archimedean spiral;stiffness;leaf spring;computer science;distributed computing;control theory	Robotics	68.98381186374236	-22.809324010672007	138948

However, the standard admittance controller has several limitations. First, the passivity can be guaranteed by finding a set of control parameters that makes the admittance function positive real. However, this approach cannot be applied to multi degrees-of-freedom robot because it requires transfer function analysis. Second, standard admittance controller is not suitable when the system is exposed to unexpected environmental interaction (of which interaction force is not measured) due to the wall sticking effect. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an admittance controller of which structure can be constructed by feedback interconnection of passive subsystems.

The core sources of information available to the robot system are human input, sensor data and model data. However most programming systems only connect one or two of these information sources to generate robot programs. The presented programming concept featuring hand-guided robot operation for intuitive robot instruction, use of workpiece CAD-models to retrieve nominal model information and a triangulation sensor for detection of workpiece contours features combination of all three sources of information and promises efficient robot programing for deburring applications in SME production.

However, the nonlinearity and the temperature characteristic of the inclinometer always result in large measurement error. In order to improve its measurement accuracy, the research on compensating the nonlinear error and the temperature drift error based on BP neural network is presented in this paper. The characteristic of the inclinometer is studied by experiment at first and then its inverse model is built using BP neural network and trained with an amount of experimental data; finally the trained model is used to compensate the measurement error. The experimental results verify that the proposed compensation method can improve the measurement accuracy of the inclinometer greatly by correcting the nonlinearity and eliminating the influence of temperature.	artificial neural network	Xiangwen Wen;Haiyang Cai;Minghua Pan;Guoli Zhu	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-10817-4_46	control engineering;electronic engineering;inclinometer;computer science;inverse problem;engineering;control theory;artificial neural network;observational error	ML	75.45634308882173	-14.865171453372374	139608
0f52e0137cd46778d0c18ecbef62e8c48a5589be	helicopter modelling and study of the accelerated rotor		Abstract This work presents a helicopter dynamic model that captures the fuselage vibrations for an accelerated main rotor. Some rotor parameters are modified with the purpose of study their impact on the rotorcraft. Being this, a tool that allows to predict vibrations on the helicopter. The rotorcraft model has been built up by using VehicleSim, software specialized in modelling mechanical systems composed by rigid bodies. The rotors are articulated, the main rotor takes into account flap, lag and feather degrees of freedom for each of the equispaced blades and their dynamic couplings. The dynamic performance and the control action are embedded in a single code, thereby VehicleSim does not require external connection to other software package. This generates some advantages such as to reduce the compilation time. The control methodology makes use of PID controllers (Proportional, Integral, Derivative), which allows to use VehicleSim commands exclusively. The state space matrices have been obtained in order to analysis the uncoupled main rotor flap and lag modes. The detection of vibrations from the offset flap hinge as well as the lag hinge are not straightforward tasks and this helicopter model provides an accurate tool to study these. A short time Fourier transform processing is used to analysis the vibrations and these have shown to agree with the expected behaviour.	r.o.t.o.r.	S.

The main contributions are in the area of the elastostatic parameters identification. In contrast to other works, the considered approach takes into account elastic properties of both links and joint. Particular attention is paid to generation of the complete and irreducible stiffness model that is suitable for the identification. To solve the problem, physical and algebraic model reduction methods are proposed. They are based on taking into account the physical properties of the manipulator elements and structure of the corresponding observation matrix. The advantages of the developed approach are illustrated by an application example that deals with elastostatic calibration of an industrial robot.	ambiguous name resolution;description number;industrial robot;irreducibility;linear algebra;pa-risc;semiconductor industry;stiffness;stiffness matrix	Alexandr Klimchik;Stéphane Caro;Benoît Furet;Anatoly Pashkevich	2014	2014 11th International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics (ICINCO)	10.5220/0005098701920202	control engineering;mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics;robot calibration	Robotics	69.63364363799367	-20.501167135437974	140562

This paper evaluates the square-wave injection voltage at different frequencies for the design of an interior permanent-magnet (PM) machine sensorless drive. It is shown that more flux saturation on high-frequency (HF) d-axis inductance occurs than the saturation on q-axis inductance due to the magnetic relaxation. The HF saliency ratio (Lqhf/Ldhf) is increased by increasing the injection frequency.

Since the event detection problem is a continuous, real-time process which has nonlinear mathematical representations, a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) is utilized. In this algorithm, a jump Markov linear Gaussian system (JMLGS) is defined where changes (i.e., jumps) in the state-space system and measurement equations are due to the occurrences and losses of events within the measurement noise. The RBPF obtains optimal estimates of the possible seismic events by individually weighting and subsequently summing a bank of Kalman filters (KFs). These KFs are specified and updated by samples drawn from a Markov chain distribution which defines the probability of the individual dynamical systems which compose the JMLGS. In addition, a hidden Markov model filter is utilized within the RBPF filter formulation so that real-time estimates of the phase of the seismic event can be obtained. The filter is demonstrated to provide up to an 80-fold improvement in the SNR when processing simulated seismic data with Gauss-Markov measurement noise.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;dynamical system;hidden markov model;kalman filter;markov chain;nonlinear system;ps-algol;particle filter;random seed;real-time clock;real-time web;regular expression;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;state space;utility functions on indivisible goods;wavelet	Erick Baziw	2005	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2005.852711	kalman filter;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;hidden markov model;statistics	ML	77.10791913803484	-12.291545585308919	140840

The algorithm relies on knowledge from human haptic perception in order to reduce the number of packets transmitted without compromising transparency. Several distance metrics are also discussed to best examine the acuity of human perception in detecting haptic distortion when data reduction is performed in 6-DoF settings. A validation of the proposed haptic data reduction technique is performed under normal network conditions as well as in the presence of network-induced time delay and packet loss. Statistical significance tests (using Friedman's nonparametric ANOVA, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) were carried out to determine the appropriate multivariate human haptic perceptual thresholds (force, torque, orientation, etc.) required to minimize the number of packets transmitted while preserving the immersiveness of the 6-DoF telehaptic environment. It was observed that the suggested algorithm can significantly reduce haptic data traffic with little or no influence on the quality of haptic-enabled telepresence interaction.	algorithm;broadcast delay;distortion;haptic technology;network packet;sensor;telehaptic	Nizar Sakr;Nicolas D.

e906e9e20dd73156f787230ed78d77545929390d	determination of constraint forces for an offshore crane on a moving base		In this paper we propose an efficient method for calculating the forces of constraints in an open-chain multibody system, like a robot mounted on a vehicle with 6 degrees of freedom. The dynamical model is based on Kane's equation of motion, where screw theory is used to calculate the projection matrices from the link twists of the multibody system. This leads to a general modeling procedure relying on screw transformations that is presented in the paper. The procedure for determination of the constraint forces is given as an extension of the dynamical model and can be implemented after the equations of motion have been formulated and solved. We implement the described method for the specific case of a vessel with a heavy crane, and provide the simulation results. The method provides a basis for future work on the detailed modeling of friction in the joints of serial link mechanisms, and on the evaluation of potential fatigue consequences of different control solutions.	algorithm;computer case screws;control system;dynamical system;mathematical optimization;robot;serial communication;simulation	Andrej Cibicik;Olav Egeland	2018	2018 5th International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)	10.1109/CoDIT.2018.8394867	equations of motion;submarine pipeline;screw theory;matrix (mathematics);control theory;degrees of freedom (mechanics);multibody system;serial communication;mathematics	Robotics	69.69748536968831	-20.345730471730455	141024

First, requirements of SEA are illustrated. And six different types of elastic elements (e.g. the discoid element, the cylindrical) are analyzed using the design of experiment (DOE) method. And then, a discoid elastic element with larger flexibility is developed. Based on this, an integrated SEA containing the position sensors and the torque sensor is developed. And a 7-degree-of-freedom humanoid arm with joint flexibilities is designed. Finally, experiments of SEA demonstrate the approximation of the stiffness between the desired SEA and the prototype.	approximation algorithm;coat of arms;design of experiments;experiment;humanoid robot;prototype;requirement;rotary woofer;sensor	Xijian Huo;Yanfeng Xia;Yiwei Liu;Li Jiang;Hong Liu	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO 2014)	10.1109/ROBIO.2014.7090684	structural engineering;robot;control engineering;engineering;artificial intelligence;finite element method;torque;stress;actuator;mechanical engineering	Robotics	71.91349062957164	-21.360111029585077	141060

The coupled kinematics of the tendons, however, cause such controllers to exhibit a transient coupling in their response. This problem can be resolved by alternatively framing the controllers in the joint-space of the manipulator. This work presents a joint-space torque control law that demonstrates both a decoupled and significantly faster response than an equivalent tendon-space formulation. The law also demonstrates greater speed and robustness than comparable PI controllers. In addition, a tension distribution algorithm is presented here to allocate forces from the joints to the tendons. It allocates the tensions so that they satisfy both an upper and lower bound, and it does so without requiring linear programming or open-ended iterations. The control law and tension distribution algorithm are implemented on the robotic hand of Robonaut-2.	algorithm;cobham's thesis;coupling (computer programming);emitter-coupled logic;framing (world wide web);iteration;linear programming;nonlinear gameplay;optimal control;real-time clock;robonaut;robot;robustness (computer science);sensor	Muhammad E.

This paper proposes an effective postprocessing solution to the problems of temperature drift and synchronous measuring error for the axial displacement sensor in a 10-kW magnetically suspended motor. The proposed configuration of the axial displacement sensor consists of three probes: one pair is used to eliminate the synchronous measuring error, and the third probe is employed for the consideration of temperature drift. First, the generating mechanism of the synchronous measuring error caused by the improper assemble is presented, and an operational amplifier is proposed to obtain an accurate position of the axial center by adjusting the weights of sensing signals from one pair of probes. Then the scheme of temperature compensation using an auxiliary probe is presented. In order to obtain accurately the characteristics of temperature drift at the operating point, the detailed procedure is given to determine the temperature-drift ratio. Finally, the terms related to temperature drift and synchronous error in the final output of the displacement sensor are both eliminated. Experimental results on a magnetically suspended motor test rig show the effectiveness of the proposed solution.	coefficient;displacement mapping;operating point;operational amplifier;r.o.t.o.r.;sensor	Shiqiang Zheng;Yingguang Wang;Hongliang Ren	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2015.2511165	control engineering;electronic engineering;temperature measurement;engineering;control theory;magnetic levitation;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	78.47817803364718	-17.11684815550106	141309

The constraints may involve different types of contacts between the parts, as well as certain assembly dimensions. This paper presents a uniform representation for assembly constraints that applies to a wide variety of constraint relations given in the literature. A systematic procedure for constraint reduction is also given: if two parts or subassemblies are related by multiple constraints, the constraint reduction procedure computes a single net constraint having the same effect. Three broad applications of the constraint representation and constraint reduction methods to problems in assembly modeling and tolerancing are discussed.	assembly language;assembly modelling;reduction (complexity)	Joshua U.

In order to avoid numerous parameter studies in evaluating its performance, the prediction model plays an important role. As fish's swimming includes the kinematic of its own body and the hydrodynamic interaction with the surrounding fluid, it is difficult to formulate a precise mathematical model by purely analytical approaches. This paper offers a semi-empirical method to model the performance of a BCF (body and/or caudal fin) biomimetic fish robot. By using a dimensional statistical method, a semi-empirical model for predicting the thrust force generated by a BCF oscillation swimming mode is derived. This model shows good prediction capability. The predicted results are in good agreement with the experiment data. Therefore, the proposed modeling method can be used to solve the engineering problem concerned without a complex theory derivation.	biomimetics;mathematical model;robot;semiconductor industry;thrust;velocity (software development)	H.

We report on our newly developed two-fingered robotic hand with soft and thin skin. This hand is basically controlled by a position-based control algorithm. However, it can realize desired grasping force due to the soft skin while maintaining stability of the system. For an experimental validation of this concept, we conducted following the three kinds of manipulation tasks: manipulating of a cubic object, opening and closing of a bottle cap, and turning of a crank. These results show that this two-fingered hand can perform various manipulation tasks of objects in three dimensional space.	algorithm;closing (morphology);crank (person);cubic function;robot	Tsuneo Yoshikawa;Masanao Koeda;Haruki Fukuchi;Atsushi Hirakawa	2006		10.1007/978-3-540-77457-0_5	three-dimensional space;computer vision;robot end effector;cartesian coordinate robot;robot control;robot calibration	Robotics	70.86345711400483	-23.381965436667805	142117

This joint mechanism, which is called a loosely coupled mechanism, includes a viscoelastic object and soft actuators in place of the cartilage and muscles of a human arm. To confirm motion of the link using one length sensor, we constructed a prototype of the mechanism in two-dimensional (2D) space. Based on this prototype, we constructed a 3D loosely coupled mechanism with length sensors, and we were able to control two projecting angles of the 3D prototype. In addition, we propose an appropriate method of measurement to reduce errors in measurement due to the length sensors. Using this method, we found that, for each projecting plane, the errors were less than 1.0 deg in our 3D prototype.	3d television;coat of arms;loose coupling;mathematical model;prototype;robot;sensor	Mizuho Shibata;Takahiro Yoshimura;Shinichi Hirai	2007	2007 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2007.4399093	projective plane;control engineering;three-dimensional space;simulation;engineering;sensor;humanoid robot;control theory	Robotics	70.08631831566511	-22.675519382571732	142297

The dynamic models included all of the nonlinear terms in the equations of motion. The three-dimensional motion consisted of body torsion about the biped vertical axis. A walking gait was defined with a combination of linear and quadratic con straint equations that defined the biped joint motion. The gait was a dynamic walking gait that did not depend on a predefined location for the foot to land. Four gait variations were studied on the differ ent ground surfaces. The ground surfaces were rigid and included sinusoidal, randomized, and chaotic terrain. It was found that the gait had the potential to be used as a basic gait for locomotion over a wide variety of surfaces. There were certain gait features, such as the phasing of the knee constraint and the body torsional mo tion, that could be used to enhance the biped system's stability and efficiency. The impor...

The design process involves application of many engineering areas and various approaches are possible. Computer programs are available in different engineering areas. Engineers define systems and inputs, and user-friendly programs establish mathematical models, solve them and give simulation outputs. In this study, SolidWorks is used for solid modeling and assembly, CosmosMotion is used for rigid body dynamics, CosmosWorks is used for finite element vibration and strength analyses, and Adlink module is used for actuator control. The integration of the design process is achieved with a main program developed in Visual Basic, which uses the application programming interface (API) capabilities. The procedure is applied to a hexapod robot. The robot has been produced to develop and test the procedure. CosmosMotion results are verified by the analytical results obtained from the dynamic equations of the hexapod. Besides known kinematic workspace definition of robots, kinetic and rigidity workspace concepts are introduced. Mechatronic systems can be designed and evaluated easily and effectively by using the design process developed in this work.	mechatronics;simulation	Murat Akdag;Hira Karagülle;Levent Malgaca	2012	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/j.matcom.2011.12.002	simulation;hexapod;robotics	Robotics	71.5001974999151	-20.078815949555356	143641
69bb6ca718b92d7eafc233c2add285ae159bf337	a new calibration method for a directly driven 3prr positioning system	calibration method;ultrasonic linear motor;3;p;rr positioning system;parallel mechanism	Calibration is one of the most important works for the parallel manipulator. The manufacturing and assembling errors will modify the designed parameters of the parallel mechanism, leading to the positioning errors. Calibration is an effective method for improving the accuracy of the parallel mechanism. It is vital to identify the parameters and calibrate the system aiming at improving the positioning accuracy. In order to build an object stage of the micro/nano operation system, a 3 degree-of-freedoms (DOFS) parallel mechanism has been designed and constructed, with combination of legs of the PRR type (the underline of the P represent the actuated joint), P and R representing prismatic and revolute pairs respectively (3PRR). Due to the space constraint, this 3PRR mechanism is built without the end-effector feedback, and must be calibrated for high accuracy positioning. The error model of the 3PRR mechanism has been derived and analyzed, and the error distribution mappings of the 3PRR mechanism are obtained. The calibration method based on the error model is investigated. Since some parameters are difficult to be identified by using the decoupling error model, the assistant measurements are proposed and utilized to compensate for this calibration method. Numerical simulations and experiments are carried out. The simulation results show that it is not enough to calibrate this system by using the calibration method based on error model only, and the experimental results demonstrate that the combined assistant measurements will achieve a better effect for calibration.	positioning system	Jiasi Mo;Zhicheng Qiu;Lei Zeng;Xianmin Zhang	2017	Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems	10.1007/s10846-016-0403-7	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	72.31805369728983	-20.22080646071037	143756

A three degree-of-freedom 3-DOF spherical parallel manipulator consists of two Ž . tetrahedrons pyramids . The base tetrahedron is fixed while the moving tetrahedron is rotating at the joint apex of the two tetrahedrons. This article studies the forward kinematics to a special 3-DOF spherical parallel manipulator, where the three apical angles of the moving tetrahedron are equal to their counterparts in the base tetrahedron, respectively. The final result of the forward kinematics to this parallel manipulator is a univariate quartic polynomial equation, which has a direct algebraic solution.

The goal is to reduce the effect of harmonic disturbances with known time-varying frequencies acting on a system. As a test bed, a thin flexible aluminum cantilevered beam with two symmetrically bonded piezoelectric actuators is used. The harmonic excitation is generated by two DC motors each of them with an unbalanced mass. A discrete-time model is obtained through black-box system identification methods. The control algorithm design is based on a plant description with a disturbance model as a linear parameter varying (LPV) system in linear fractional transformation (LFT) form. This results in a gain-scheduled controller where the harmonic disturbance frequencies are the scheduling variables. The experimental real-time results show the effectiveness of the controller and its capability to suppress time-varying harmonic disturbances, whose frequencies are measured directly from the DC motors. The design method leads to a controller that stabilizes the closed-loop system even for arbitrarily fast changes in the disturbance frequencies. In the real-time experiment, the controller suppresses a disturbance consisting of two independent harmonics with frequencies that vary over a range of 15 Hz.	adaptive filter;algorithm design;approximation algorithm;black box;control system;discretization;distortion;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;heuristic;interpolation;layer four traceroute;piezoelectricity;real-time clock;rejection sampling;robot;sampling (signal processing);schedule;scheduling (computing);system identification;systems design;testbed;unbalanced circuit	Franklyn Duarte;Pablo Ballesteros;Xinyu Shu;Christian Bohn	2013	2013 American Control Conference		cantilever;control engineering;electronic engineering;stability;engineering;dc motor;vibration control;control theory;linear system;total harmonic distortion;statistics	Robotics	70.0527424394295	-12.484114675535855	143876

The inverse Prandtl-Ishlinskii was first formulated and applied for compensation of hysteresis nonlinearities of a piezoelectric actuator. The theoretical formula was afterwards employed to construct an H∞ feedback control. The controller was calculated and applied to the piezoelectric actuator with the inverse feedforward model. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the controller and the benefits that the theoretical formula of the inverse compensation can contribute.	control theory;experiment;feedback;feedforward neural network;game controller;hysteresis;piezoelectricity;positioning system	Micky Rakotondrabe;Omar Aljanaideh;Mohammad Al Janaideh	2015	2015 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2015.7171133	control engineering;electronic engineering;adaptive control;hysteresis;engineering;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	71.23074946547247	-13.291618054261265	143880

2c9d8fc7864248e1c6ab84347e595b57f33454f6	linear and rotational microhydraulic actuators driven by electrowetting		Microhydraulic actuators offer a new way to convert electrical power to mechanical power on a microscale with an unmatched combination of power density and efficiency. Actuators work by combining surface tension force contributions from a large number of droplets distorted by electrowetting electrodes. This paper reports on the behavior of microgram-scale linear and rotational microhydraulic actuators with output force/weight ratios of 5500, cycle frequencies of 4 kilohertz, <1-micrometer movement precision, and accelerations of 3 kilometers/second2. The power density and the efficiency of the actuators were characterized by simultaneously measuring the mechanical work performed and the electrical power applied. Maximum output power density was 0.93 kilowatt/kilogram, comparable with the best electric motors. At maximum power, the actuator was 60% efficient, but efficiencies were as high as 83% at lower power. Rotational actuators demonstrated a torque density of 79 newton meters/kilogram, substantially more than electric motors of comparable diameter. Scaling the droplet pitch from 100 to 48 micrometers increased power density from 0.27 to 0.93 kilowatt/kilogram, validating the quadratic scaling of actuator power.	2.5d;electric power conversion;electrowetting;image scaling;maximum power transfer theorem;newton;pitch (music)	Eric Holihan	2018	Science Robotics	10.1126/scirobotics.aat5643	newton metre;power density;actuator;electric power;electric motor;electronic engineering;work (physics);watt;materials science;torque density	Robotics	80.64944721235776	-15.381362777193829	144328

The control law combines an enhanced PD feedback with nonlinear differentiator to derive high-quality velocity signal to control gross motion of the beam, and a vibration control by PZT actuators bonded on the surface of the beam. The significance of the proposed method are threefold: i) The enhanced PD control is a non-model based control, and appears to be more robust against the noise; ii) The linear velocity in contrast the angular velocity is used in the PZT actuator control, a signal which is easily available; iii) A unique solution is provided for examination of actuator placement, based on the analysis of mode shape functions.

Such grasps could ideally support complex multi-contact motions, such as ladder climbing, or manipulation of complex tools, with energy efficiency. For this purpose, we propose a solution by designing a smart self-locking underactuated mechanism mounted in parallel to actuators to be triggered automatically when the desired grasp is achieved. This design leverages adjustable power distribution between the gripper and the brake through a differential gear. The advantages of adaptive, firm grasping, and energy-saving capabilities of our gripper are experimentally demonstrated by a prototype gripper.	activating function;experiment;hill climbing;humanoid robot;lock (computer science);mechatronics;poor posture;prototype;robot end effector;underactuation	Jui Hsu;Eiichi Yoshida;Kensuke Harada;Abderrahmane Kheddar	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2017.8014086	simulation;humanoid robot;control engineering;differential (mechanical device);control theory;grippers;actuator;torque;underactuation;computer science;grasp;brake	Robotics	72.48311628712051	-23.293574792030967	145608

In addition, the motion simulation based on SolidWorks/Motion is carried out, which acquires intuitive and typical motion coupler curves of the five-bar PKM, and verifies the correctness of the kinematic analysis formula. At the end, a five-bar PKM experimental setup has been developed to test the numerical analysis, comparing with the simulation results. These results show that the influence factors of the mechanism and control system design should be focused on the complex automatic system.	3d projection;acoustic coupler;control system;correctness (computer science);motion simulator;numerical analysis;simulation;solidworks;systems design;workspace	Zhili Hou;Ruiqin Li;Wenge Wu;Huibin Qin	2015	2015 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)	10.1109/ICCAIS.2015.7338718	kinematic chain;acceleration;control engineering;kinematic pair;kinematics;simulation;gear;engineering;trajectory;inverse kinematics;kinematic diagram;mathematical model;coupling;engineering drawing	Robotics	70.26177201044096	-20.58826041596473	145935
9eac4d22233a09e54ee48fb5d009062104870098	design of computer experiments applied to modeling of compliant mechanisms for real-time control		This article discusses the use of design of computer experiments (DOCE) (i.e., experiments run with a computer model to find how a set of inputs affects a set of outputs) to obtain a force–displacement meta-model (i.e., a mathematical equation that summarizes and aids in analyzing the input–output data of a DOCE) of compliant mechanisms (CMs). The procedure discussed produces a force–displacement meta-model, or closed analytic vector function, that aims to control CMs in real-time. In our work, the factorial and space-filling DOCE meta-model of CMs is supported by finite element analysis (FEA). The protocol discussed is used to model the HexFlex mechanism functioning under quasi-static conditions. The HexFlex is a parallel CM for nano-manipulation that allows six degrees of freedom (x, y, z, θ x , θ y , θ z ) of its moving platform. In the multi-linear model fit of the HexFlex, the products or interactions proved to be negligible, yielding a linear model (i.e., linear in the inputs) for the operating range. The accuracy of the meta-model was calculated by conducting a set of computer experiments with random uniform distribution of the input forces. Three error criteria were recorded comparing the meta-model prediction with respect to the results of the FEA experiments by determining: (1) maximum of the absolute value of the error, (2) relative error, and (3) root mean square error. The maximum errors of our model are lower than high-precision manufacturing tolerances and are also lower than those reported by other researchers who have tried to fit meta-models to the HexFlex mechanism.	approximation error;computer experiment;computer simulation;displacement mapping;federal enterprise architecture;finite element method;gnu nano;input/output;interaction;linear model;max;mean squared error;metamodeling;new product development;numerical weather prediction;operating point;polynomial;real-time clock;real-time transcription;six degrees of separation;transfer function	Diego A.

However, the use of a gear reduction high enough to discount Coriolis and centripetal components yields additional non-desired dynamics, which are friction, backlash and elasticity. In such cases, simplifying robot dynamics without considering the effect of gear dynamics leads to unavoidable errors. In order to make dynamic equations reflect the reality of the physical system, it is of paramount importance to model the most significant effects acting on the system. Robot dynamics could then be analyzed and related to trajectory parameters for motion-control purposes. In this paper, a method to derive the dynamics of a robot leg as a function of leg-trajectory parameters is proposed. The method experimentally finds the simplified equations of motion that reflect the reality of the physical system. The resulting model is an accurate and simple representation of the system dynamics, taking into account the most relevant dynamics affecting the system. The simplification of the model allows it to be used in a real-time dynamic-control system.	control system;elasticity (data store);experiment;level of detail;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;robot leg;system dynamics;time-scale calculus	Elena Garcia;José A.

In 4-channel bilateral control systems, operational force becomes unnecessary force for haptic sense transmission. Under time-delay, it is known that this force becomes larger than the force without time-delay. In this paper, it is shown that new force, communicative operational force, is generated in time-delayed 4-channel bilateral control, and a method for calculating the force is proposed. Furthermore, well-known conventional time-delay compensation methods, 3-channel bilateral control and CDOB, are interpreted from the view of communicative operational force. The validity of the proposed method is verified by some experiments.	bilateral filter;control system;experiment	Yoshiki Ohno;Nobuto Yoshimura;Kouhei Ohnishi	2014	IECON 2014 - 40th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2014.7049224	frequency modulation;control system;electrical impedance;haptic technology;force	Robotics	69.27403836403768	-13.551154261183926	147285

This paper presents an intuitive method for altering a vehicle's handling characteristics by augmenting the driver's steering command with full vehicle state feedback. The vehicle can be made more or less responsive depending on the driver's preference and particular operating conditions. Achieving a smooth, continuous change in handling quality requires both accurate state estimation and well-controlled steering inputs from the steer-by-wire system. Accurate estimates of vehicle states are available from a combination of global positioning system (GPS) and inertial navigation system (INS) sensor measurements. By canceling the effects of steering system dynamics and tire disturbance forces, the steer-by-wire system is able to track commanded steer angle with minimal error. Experimental results verify that with precise steering control and accurate state information, the handling modification is exactly equivalent to changing the front tire cornering stiffness.	global positioning system;inertial navigation system;probabilistic turing machine;stiffness matrix;system dynamics	Paul Yih;J.

However, these approaches are too conservative for keeping the system passivity or for estimating the amount of virtually constant time delay. These conservative approaches result in too much degradation of maneuverability from the constant time delay situations. We propose a novel control scheme that is also based on wave variables, but minimizes the performance degradation due to the fluctuation of the communication time delay. The proposed method is simple and easy to implement. We conducted some simulation studies with a one DOF system. Simulation results show the validity of the proposed scheme.	bilateral filter;bilateral sound	Yasuyoshi Yokokohji;Takashi Imaida;Tsuneo Yoshikawa	1999		10.1109/IROS.1999.811748	telerobotics;control engineering;minimisation;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;elmore delay;control theory;statistics	EDA	68.41540091851921	-12.960735365196058	148429
437643191ac813f3edca280355f24fad5ac28ab0	the offset model of a hexapod robot and the effect of the offset parameter		Generally, it is claimed that hexapod walking robots are superior to others. However, in some conditions hexapod suffers from stability problems. To solve the problem of stability, this paper proposes a new gait model of hexapod robot named offset model and also investigates the effects of morphological factor of hexapod robots on their locomotion. A comparison between the offset model and general model of hexapod robot is also included. The stability margin and error margin are used to indicate the stability of a hexapod robot, as it walks with different gaits in arbitrary directions. Two hexapod gaits are compared, which are the diametrical gait and the paired metachronal gait. The former is an artificial gait and the latter is a natural gait. The authors conclude that that the stability of a hexapod robot with the diametrical gait can be enhanced by increasing the offset parameter.

Ozguner and Tsai (1984) then inventoried the FTL (Follow-the-leader) gait. Yang and Kim (1998) investigated a fault tolerant gait for a hexapod robot to be stable and functional even when one leg is broken. Afterward, Yang (2009) combined the adaptive gait and the FTL gait to improve the fault tolerant gait. One of the gaits mentioned in this paper (the diametrical gait) is extended from the fault tolerant gait. The robot swings a pair of legs at the same time in this gait, as shown in Figure 1(a). Readers interested in more details about diametrical and paired metachronal gait can find them in in Mostafa et al. (2011). Wilson (1966) observed gaits of the hexapod for the slow wave gait, the ripple gait, and the tripod gait. The paired metachronal gait discussed in this research is the ripple gait. The hexapod robot swings a pair of legs at a time during the movement with the paired metachronal gait. The group of legs is shown in Figure 1(b). McGhee and Frank (1987) proposed the slow wave gait of the quadruped robot moving along the straight line. They divided the leaving and contact of legs to the ground into two states and discussed the best swinging sequence of the legs, the control of gait, and the algorithm for the stability of gait. The main focus of this study is to develop an offset model of hexapod robot and assess the effect of offset parameter. We investigate two offset models hexapod gait (diametrical gait and paired metachronal gait) and their stability margin. The Offset Model of Hexapod Robots Before delving into details, an explanation of the six-legged robot model is appropriate. More details about hexapod robot of this study can be found in Mostafa et al. (2010) and Mostafa et al. (2011). Figure 1 illustrates the offset model of hexapod robots used in this paper. The general model which means D=0 in Figure 1 has been used frequently in the research and analysis of the hexapod robot gait. P and Q define the size of the allocated reachable region of a leg, and U is the width of the body. In this paper, we simply let P=Q=U=1. The mass of the legs is small, and the CG (denoted as a star) is at the centroid of the body. Yang and Kim (1998) proposed the fault tolerant gait with this model and indicated that Figure 1.

The kinematics of such a robot also having coplanar spherical joints has previously been studied as a rigid subassembly of a Stewart-Gough platform, which has been denoted a line-plane component. Here, we investigate how to move the leg attachments in the base and the platform without altering the robot's singularity locus. By introducing the so-called 3-D space of leg attachments, we prove that there are only three general topologies for the singularity locus corresponding to the families of quartically, cubically, and quadratically solvable 5-SPU robots. The members of the last family have only four assembly modes, which are obtained by solving two quadratic equations. Two practical features of these quadratically solvable robots are the large manipulability within each connected component and the fact that, for a fixed orientation of the tool, the singularity locus reduces to a plane.

09c16c125634b9ddba260bef7c6bad3456b863c1	vibration suppression of a flexible-joint robot based on parameter identification and fuzzy pid control		In order to eliminate the influence of the joint torsional vibration on the system operation accuracy, the parameter identification and the elastic torsional vibration control of a flexible-joint robot are studied. Firstly, the flexible-joint robot system is equivalent to a rotor dynamic system, in which the mass block and the torsion spring are used to simulate the system inertia link and elasticity link, for establishing the system dynamic model, and the experimental prototype is constructed. Then, based on the mechanism method, the global electromechanical-coupling dynamic model of the flexible-joint robot system is constructed to clear and define the mapping relationship between the driving voltage of the DC motor and the rotational speed of joint I and joint II. Furthermore, in view of the contradiction between the system response speed and the system overshoot in the vibration suppression effect of the conventional PID controller, a fuzzy PID controller, whose parameters are determined by the different requirements in the vibration control process, is designed to adjust the driving voltage of the DC motor for attenuating the system torsional vibration. Finally, simulation and control experiments are carried out and the results show that the designed fuzzy PID controller can effectively suppress the elastic torsional vibration of the flexible-joint robot system with synchronization optimization of control accuracy and dynamic quality.	controllers;dynamical system;elasticity (cloud computing);experiment;interference (communication);mathematical model;mathematical optimization;normal statistical distribution;overshoot (signal);pid;population parameter;prototype;r.o.t.o.r.;requirement;robot;rule (guideline);simulation;system dynamics;torsion (gastropod);zero suppression;voltage	Ji Ju;Yongrui Zhao;Chunliang Zhang;Y.

7df48af87b3be94d80b93e7dc485fa86bfeea5d0	indirect measurement of rotor dynamic imbalance for control moment gyroscopes via gimbal disturbance observer	control moment gyros;disturbance observer;gimbal servo system;rotor imbalance	The high-precision speed control of gimbal servo systems is the key to generating high-precision torque for control moment gyroscopes (CMGs) in spacecrafts. However, the control performance of gimbal servo systems may be degraded significantly by disturbances, especially a dynamic imbalance disturbance with the same frequency as the high-speed rotor. For assembled CMGs, it is very difficult to measure the rotor imbalance directly by using a dynamic balancing machine. In this paper, a gimbal disturbance observer is proposed to estimate the dynamic imbalance of the rotor assembled in the CMG. First, a third-order dynamical system is established to describe the disturbance dynamics of the gimbal servo system, in which the rotor dynamic imbalance torque along the gimbal axis and the other disturbances are modeled to be periodic and bounded, respectively. Then, the gimbal disturbance observer is designed for the third-order dynamical system by using the total disturbance as a virtual measurement. Since the virtual measurement is derived from the inverse dynamics of the gimbal servo system, the information of the rotor dynamic imbalance can be obtained indirectly only using the measurements of gimbal speed and three-phase currents. Semi-physical experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the observer by using a CMG simulator.	apache axis;axis vertebra;cask gene;conflict (psychology);description;dynamical system;equilibrium;experiment;gimbal lock;inverse dynamics;natural science disciplines;r.o.t.o.r.;semiconductor industry;servo device component;simulation;simulators;spacecraft;tacrine	Liya Huang;Zhong Wu;Kan Wang	2018		10.3390/s18061873	observer (quantum physics);gimbal;electronic engineering;engineering;rotor (electric);control theory;gyroscope	Robotics	69.68429731641973	-14.473618949996014	149133

We first present the “orthogonal-wheels” concept and the two major wheel assemblies on which these platforms are based. We then describe how a combination of these assemblies with appropriate control can be used to generate an omnidirectional capability for mobile robot platforms. Several alternative designs are considered, and their respective characteristics with respect to rotational and translational motion control are discussed. The design and control of a prototype platform developed to test and demonstrate the proposed concepts is then described, and experimental results illustrating the full omnidirectionality of the platform with decoupled rotational and translational degrees of freedom are presented.	mobile robot;prototype;wheels	François G.

Due to the non-rigid work pieces and variations in the material characteristics, sensor-based control has to be used to accomplish the sewing operation. This paper presents a strategy for velocity synchronization and corner matching in an automated sewing cell based on two industrial manipulators and a sewing machine. A hybrid force/motion control scheme is adopted using feedback from force/torque sensors for tension control and optical sensors to control the seam position. The strategy is based on switching between force control and displacement control using a leader/follower coordination scheme. This addresses the problem of corner mismatch occurring when two independent force controllers are used for controlling the two robots. Experiments verify that the proposed method gives a satisfactory corner matching, which is crucial for the presented sewing case.	control theory;corner case;displacement mapping;experiment;material handling;robot;robot end effector;sensor;velocity (software development)	Johannes Schrimpf;Magnus Bjerkeng;Geir Mathisen	2014	2014 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2014.6943196	topology;engineering;geometry;engineering drawing	Robotics	71.8044163081328	-22.902679788690342	150373

The blade portion of the connector includes a pair of spaced apart parallel slots. To accommodate different styles of wiper arm ends, two longitudinally spaced pins are provided on the blade. One of the two pins is used with an arm end having two parallel spaced tabs with forwardly facing pin slots and the other pin is used with an arm end having two parallel spaced tabs, forwardly facing pin slots and rearwardly spaced guide portions. Both of the last named two arm ends have structure for retaining the blade on the arm end even when the blade and arm are lifted from the windshield. In an additional embodiment, one of the two pins is removable to accommodate attachment of the side pin of a side pin style connector. Since the arm is secured to the blade along two transversely spaced planes, the chances of rollover of the blade relative to the arm is minimized.	complex systems	Henrik Nolmark	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-71976-2_2	geography;knowledge management;socioeconomics;management science	Vision	82.66608721457354	-20.587710219973808	150470

Their differences mainly focus on different stator-rotor tooth number and winding structures: two layers of windings and single layer of windings for 12/8 or 8/6 BSRM. Their driving principles are just the same: driving current and radial force current are regulated to generate torque and radial force separately. The main difference is the loading of two currents on one single layer of windings or on two separate layers of windings. Further analysis proves that single layer winding structure has more advantages, for example simpler motor and winding structure. Based on the above researches, one 8/6 BSRM with simpler single layer of winding structure has been developed furthermore. Its main characteristic is that the total winding number of motor is decreased from eight to six, which is only two more than four windings of a normal 8/6 SRM. Only six converters are demanded to achieve levitation operation. Its special driving theory and speed regulation technique of the motor by applying three phase windings have been introduced. To testify the new idea, theoretical analysis and practical test have been finished for one test motor. One initial speed of 5000 r/min of levitation operation has been achieved.	multistage interconnection networks;r.o.t.o.r.;radial (radio);radial basis function;system reference manual	Li Chen;Wilfried Hofmann	2012	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2011.2163289	winding number;control engineering;switched reluctance motor;electrical engineering;mathematical model;control theory;magnetic levitation;torque;electromagnetic coil;force;physics;quantum mechanics;torque motor	Vision	73.964300680287	-18.450046603552416	151040
d7e287f55c2609d0c3237aef7bc84d35f0cf0123	simulating flapping wing mechanisms inspired by the manduca sexta hawkmoth		Several flapping wing mechanisms have been designed from studying the Manduca sexta hawkmoth. Simulations of these mechanisms have advanced our understanding of the multiple underlying and interconnected (coupled) mechanical principles at work. Kinematic models are created and indicate that a Scotch yoke inspired mechanism more closely mimics the wing-tip motions observed in M. sexta as compared to a slider-crank type mechanism. Subsequently, a kinetic simulation of the Scotch yoke actuator is developed utilizing Lagrange multipliers and solving the system of equations with a Runge-Kutta Fehlberg numerical method. Inspired by analysis of the M. sexta hawkmoth thorax muscles, spring-like components are introduced into this system that engage as the wings enter stroke reversal and disengage prior to midstroke. Results of the kinetic simulation indicate areas in which improvements can be made to reduce energy losses due to friction. These simulations serve as a tool for tuning the components of the multibody dynamic system and therefore aid in future designs of the flapping wing mechanism. Establishing the mechanism and associated power requirements is a prerequisite to the development of a fully functional flight-worthy hawkmoth inspired drone.		Kenneth C.

The transverse vibration of the string is controlled by hydraulic touch-rolls located at the right end of the string. The mathematical model of the system, which consists of a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) describing the dynamics of the moving string and an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the actuator dynamics, is derived by using Hamilton's principle for translating continua. The transfer function of the proposed boundary controller is a nonproper but PR function. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of output disturbance is proved.	hamilton's principle;mathematical model;transfer function;transverse wave;zero suppression	Kyung-Jinn Yang;Keum Shik Hong;Fumitoshi Matsuno	2005	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2005.860252	control engineering;mathematical analysis;hyperbolic partial differential equation;control theory;mathematics;transfer function;semigroup;partial differential equation	Vision	71.56729553427674	-10.296635035371596	151267

This paper presents the control of a specific ohmic RF MEMS switches under three different actuation modes, a tailored pulse optimization method based on Taguchi’s technique (voltage mode actuation control), resistive damping (charge mode actuation control) and finally the Hybrid actuation mode, which is a combination of the tailored pulse, the resistive damping and Taguchi’s optimization technique. Coventorware simulations indicate that under optimized Tailored pulse and Hybrid actuation modes, the impact velocity is reduced by around 90%, the initial impact force by around 75% and the maximum bouncing displacement during the release phase by around 95%, while the switching speed is increased by around 20% compared with the step pulse control mode. The resistive damping control mode is inappropriate for this type of switch and only partial improvement during the pull-down phase has been achieved. 2 Finally, a comparison between Hybrid and optimized tailored modes shows that Hybrid actuation mode excels with better switching characteristics and most importantly offers immunity to manufacturing and operation tolerances.	displacement mapping;failure cause;mathematical optimization;microelectromechanical systems;network switch;radio frequency;resonance;simulation;small-bias sample space;switching time;taguchi methods;velocity (software development);whole earth 'lectronic link	Michalis Spasos;Rajagopal Nilavalan	2011	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2011.08.005	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	78.96402104011527	-15.447393164394285	151342

Disaster response robots are expected to be capable of both mobility, e.g., entering narrow spaces over very rough unstable ground, and workability, e.g., conducting complex debris-demolition work. However, conventional disaster response robots are specialized in either mobility or workability. Moreover, strategies to independently enhance the capability of crawlers for mobility and arms for workability will increase the robot size and weight. To balance environmental applicability with the mobility and workability, OCTOPUS is equipped with a mutual complementary strategy between its arms and crawlers. The four arms conduct complex tasks while ensuring stabilization when climbing steps. The four crawlers translate rough terrain while avoiding toppling over when conducting demolition work. OCTOPUS is hydraulic driven and teleoperated by two operators. To evaluate the performance of OCTOPUS, we conducted preliminary experiments involving climbing high steps and removing attached objects by using the four arms. The results showed that OCTOPUS completed the two tasks by adequately coordinating its four arms and four crawlers and improvement in operability needs.	coat of arms;control theory;experiment;intelligent control;operability;operating system;prototype;robot;rough set;web crawler	Mitsuhiro Kamezaki;Hiroyuki Ishii;Tatsuzo Ishida;Masatoshi Seki;Ken Ichiryu;Yo Kobayashi;Kenji Hashimoto;Shigeki Sugano;Atsuo Takanishi;Masakatsu G.

The analysis procedure implements both group theory based criterion and reciprocal screw theory. The analysis shows that such mechanism allows rectilinear motion with full-cycle mobility. Further, unlike the Sarrus Linkage, which is overconstrained, this 7-R linkage is non-overconstrained. This property makes the Sarrus Linkage-like mechanism more robust to manufacturing errors. Simulation has shown that even with large manufacturing errors, such mechanism is still able to realize desired rectilinear motion. One possible application for this mechanism is a durable automotive suspension.	apache axis;closed-loop transfer function;design rationale;displacement mapping;linkage (software);motion simulator;regular grid;simulation;type inference	Yu Zhao;Tiemin Li;Xiaowen Yu;Xiaoqiang Tang;Liping Wang	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2013.6631166	control engineering;hinge;engineering;control theory;coupling;group theory;engineering drawing	Robotics	70.2218513738384	-21.1668464984101	152163

However the traditional strength reduction method does not take into account the difference of decay rate of cohesion and internal friction angle in the dam slope failure process. Besides, this method discounts the strength parameters of all elements. This paper adopts different reduction factors for material strength parameters, such as slope cohesion and internal friction angle. Based on the yield approach index (YAI) criterion, this paper adjusts the reduction region gradually and puts forward the double safety factor and the dynamic local strength reduction method for the dam slope stability analysis. A case study with a typical example shows that this method can better reflect the decay rate difference of cohesion and internal friction angle in the dam slope failure, further it can provide better simulation for the slope failure processes.

To stay competitive in this 21st century global industrialisation, companies must possess a new control strategy to design manufacturing systems to rapidly respond to demand changes as well as to launch new products efficiently. In this paper, a novel method to model multistage feedback control manufacturing systems is demonstrated using the Block Diagram (BD) representation and Transfer Functions (TFs) of control theory. The task of translating causal loop diagrams and stock-and-flow diagrams from system dynamics into BD and TF mathematical descriptions will be discussed in detail. Transient-response system parameters such as undamped natural frequency and damping ratio are introduced to determine other key dynamic system characteristics of multistage feedback-control manufacturing systems.	multistage amplifier	N.

In this paper we introduce the concept of a new modular anthropomorphic robot hand and describe our current work on its realization. Due to its modular architecture of a hand which shall be easily customizable to different applications ranging from handling systems for household helpers to robust finger grippers in factory automation. To drive the fingers, a servohydraulic approach for power transmission is used. Dedicated micro hydraulic cylinders are integrated in the finger segments to actuate the joints. They are driven by a position controlled piston pump. Due to the use of a PTFE enhanced surface coating, slip stick effects and friction are significantly reduced. Our prototype has shown, that the fingers are very robust and even water resistant. The low level control of the robot hand will be done by a reconfigurable system on chip, making future changes of the hardware's functionality possible without changing any printed circuits boards.	apache axis;automation;control system;cylinder seal;printed circuit board;printing;processor design;prototype;reconfigurable computing;record sealing;robot;robotics;robustness (computer science);slip (programming language);servo;system on a chip;tactile sensor	Karsten Weiss;Heinz Wörn	2004	4th IEEE/RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots, 2004.	10.1109/ICHR.2004.1442114	chip;system on a chip;embedded system;simulation;piston;power transmission;computer science;printed circuit board	Robotics	73.31227782999457	-22.220304073434015	153315

First, according to the dynamics of a mechanical mass-spring system, we establish mathematical equations that contain linear viscous frictions and varied elasticities with cross-coupling effects due to mechanical bending. In system identification, the real-coded genetic algorithm (RGA) method is employed to find the optimized parameters, and the dynamic responses of numerical simulations and experimental results are compared. On the basis of the state-space model, the ABC is proposed to track trajectories and impose on the dynamic performance, robustness of parameter variations, and trajectory-tracking errors. The comparisons between numerical simulations and experimental results illustrate the validity of the proposed ABC method for practical applications in contour tracking and also show the performances in reducing the cross-coupling effects.	apache axis;contour line;control system;genetic algorithm;hysteresis;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;performance;simulation;state space;system identification	Rong-Fong Fung;Wang-Chi Lin	2010	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2008.2009528	control engineering;simulation;genetic algorithm;adaptive control;backstepping;computer science;engineering;control system;control theory;mathematics;effective mass	Robotics	71.27661591936881	-14.804676903627032	153909

Rather than pinching these objects between the fingertips of a hand, a miniature hand is embedded recursively on the end of a finger, enabling a power grasp on a smaller scale. The mechanics of designing such a gripper to operate without adding additional tendons are analyzed within the framework of underactuated elastic mechanisms. A simplified robot hand is demonstrated having a recursive gripper, and the process of picking up a pen and writing using a multi-scale grasp is demonstrated.	embedded system;recursion;robot end effector	Lael Odhner;Chad Walker;Aaron M.

In particular, parallel manipulators with fewer than six degrees of freedom have recently attracted researchers’ attention, as their employ may prove valuable in those applications in which a higher mobility is uncalled-for. The attention of this paper is focused on translational parallel mechanisms (TPMs), that is on parallel mechanisms whose output link (platform) is provided with a pure translational motion with respect to the frame. It deals with the general problem of the topological synthesis and classification of TPMs and it investigates both their constraint and direct singularities. In particular, it identifies for the first time special families of fully-isotropic mechanisms. Such manipulators exhibit outstanding properties, as they are free from singularities and show a constant orthogonal Jacobian matrix throughout their workspace. As a consequence, both the direct and the inverse position problems are linear and the kinematic analysis proves straightforward.

Its design concept, details of the new hardware and basic experimental results are presented. The robot is designed so that it does not interfere with the user's normal walking and supports a 30-kg payload in addition to its own weight of 20 kg. The robot has a total of 14 joints; among them six flexion/extension joints are powered. Pneumatic artificial muscles are combined with small high-response servo motors for the hip and knee joints, and arranged antagonistically at the hip and ankle joints to provide passive stability and variable stiffness. The preliminary experimental results on position and torque control demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms, sensors and control systems are effective, and hybrid drive is promising for torque-controllable, high-speed, backdrivable, mobile (but non-power-autonomous) exoskeleton robots.	autonomous robot;control system;hybrid drive;lopes (exoskeleton);pneumatic artificial muscles;sensor;servo	Sang-Ho Hyon;Takuya Hayashi;Atsutoshi Yagi;Tomoyuki Noda;Jun Morimoto	2013	2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2013.6697024	control engineering;simulation;articulated robot;stability;engineering;control theory;servomotor;statistics	Robotics	70.67298898529414	-23.846007533642233	154166

It was found that substantial aerodynamic damping is produced by flapping wings through a passive mechanism termed “flapping countertorque” during fast yaw turns. We expand this study to include the aerodynamic damping that is produced by flapping wings during body translations and rotations with respect to all its six principal axes-roll, pitch, yaw, forward/backward, sideways, and heave. Analytical models were derived by the use of a quasi-steady aerodynamic model and blade-element analysis by the incorporation of the effective changes of wing kinematics that are caused by body motion. We found that aerodynamic damping, in all these cases, is linearly dependent on the body translational and angular velocities and increases with wing-stroke amplitude and frequency. Based on these analytical models, we calculated the stability derivatives that are associated with the linearized flight dynamics at hover and derived a complete 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) dynamic model. The model was then used to estimate the flight dynamics and stability of four different species of flying insects as case studies. The analytical model that is developed in this paper is important to study the flight dynamics and passive stability of flying animals, as well as to develop flapping-wing micro air vehicles (MAVs) with stable and maneuverable flight, which is achieved through passive dynamic stability and active flight control.	angularjs;mathematical model;yaws	Bo Cheng;Xinyan Deng	2011	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2011.2156170	biomimetics;damping;control engineering;dynamics;kinematics;von neumann stability analysis;vehicle dynamics;stability;aerodynamics;angular velocity;aerospace engineering;engineering;aeronautics;flight dynamics;torque;aerodynamic force;robotics;wing;flight dynamics;force	Robotics	69.50071900802321	-18.282843625508935	154347
69498214e33ec10432363b6414137a3866876dc2	haptic signal processing for human-robot collaboration system using moving average filter		Many researchers have discussed the possibilities of developing tele-operated robot systems by transferring force and position data through online network. Despite many approaches have been reported, the quality of haptic processing is still limited by insufficient bandwidth due to a large amount of information. This paper presents a novel signal processing for a haptic human-robot collaboration system using moving average filter. The moving average filter is used to calculate the haptic data points by creating series of averages of different subsets of the full data set of force and position. This method is optimal for reducing random noise while maintaining a sharp response. The effectiveness of proposed haptic processing is verified by a set of experiments. The results demonstrate the satisfactory noise compensation and a lower bandwidth is required for data transmission.	aortic valve insufficiency;bilateral filter;biologic preservation;chorea;data point;experiment;finite impulse response;haptic device component;haptic technology;kinesiology;movement;noise (electronics);robot;signal processing;television	Chowarit Mitsantisuk;Busara Piriyanont;Kiyoshi Ohishi	2018	2018 IEEE 15th International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control (AMC)	10.1109/AMC.2019.8371175	simulation;control engineering;moving average;robot;data point;haptic technology;data transmission;signal processing;computer science;bandwidth (signal processing);human–robot interaction	Robotics	75.8556394092755	-12.8318375004642	154376

The finger pad geometry and mechanical properties are especially important for within-hand dexterous manipulation, and human finger usage patterns suggest extending robotic finger pad usage onto side surfaces could enable a wider range of manipulation motion. In this work, we propose a novel finger pad design that combines a ridged stiff inner structure with air gaps and a flexible outer skin to facilitate both grasp stability and versatile usage of the finger surface. The air gaps enable objects to displace the outer skin and stably settle between two adjacent ridges. During manipulation, the ridges can also serve as predictable pivot points. Experimental results comparing three ridged finger designs to a conventional solid core design show that the ridged designs consistently outperform the reference solid core design for all objects, in terms of the ability to stably manipulate objects through a large motion range without ejection (losing grip on the object). Designs with larger spaces between ridges performed better overall than designs with closer spacing, showing that larger “wells” allow objects to more stably settle into the space between ridges. We anticipate the novel finger pad designs and the analysis of their behavior will inform future robotic hand designs, especially designs which aim to incorporate side finger usage.	finger tree;robot	Ian M.

We have continued the development of a room-temperature version to test the feasibility of simultaneous force and velocity measurements. Preliminary measurements of the voltage-velocity ratio have been carried out with a reproducibility of the order of 1 part in 104. The coil suspension has been improved to reduce the undesired coil movement in the 5 degrees of freedom different from a perfectly vertical movement. Further work on the current source has reduced its long-term drift to a few parts in 109 per minute with a satisfactory short-term stability. A technique needed to separate the voltage induced in the coil from the voltage drop due to the current flow based on the use of a second noninductive coil has been tested. The second coil is now being integrated into the apparatus. Work has started on the geometrical and magnetic characterizations of a large precision solenoid that will become the reference for the magnetic field alignment. The collaboration with a university on the fabrication of our magnetic circuit is being continued. This paper briefly outlines the main ideas of the BIPM watt balance and reports the progress to date.	approximation error;current source;displacement mapping;expect;servo;tesla coil;velocity (software development)	Alain Picard;Hao Fang;Adrien Kiss;Estefania de Mirandés;Michael Stock;Chiharu Urano	2008	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2008.2009913	electronic engineering;magnetic field;electrical engineering;nuclear magnetic resonance;physics;quantum mechanics	Visualization	79.85885866296898	-17.598213863989248	154921
934bdd5378d56c2b4d5b9eb97b40b4a969fe9b05	fast iron losses model of stator taking into account the flux weakening mode for the optimal sizing of high speed permanent internal magnet synchronous machine	iron losses;fast model;high speed application;control laws	The optimal design of electrical machines is an important issue in automotive industry in order to reduce cost and volume of the actuator and improve its performances. In this context, the use of compact machines with high power density is preferred and consequently high speed machines where field weakening is required. In addition, a really optimal design requires to dispose sufficiently accurate models of main physical phenomena involved in electromechanical conversion. This models need to be sufficiently fast in order to be suitable with optimization process. An important limitation in the use of internal permanent magnet synchronous machine with distributed windings is temperatures insides the machine especially in the windings and thus the internal losses. At high speed with field weakening operation, iron losses, sensitive to flux densities variation in iron, could be really high because of the high electrical frequency linked to rotor speed and sharp variation of flux density waveforms inside the iron in stator due to the field weakening operation. This study, for the electric machine design, is based on the first harmonic hypothesis, i.e., without harmonic currents. An original and mathematical model has been developed and provides fast and accurate estimation of iron losses particularly in field weakening operation even with machine supplied by sinusoidal currents as described in this paper. It uses a polynomial form of iron losses in function of fundamental electrical frequency and take into account the flux density waveforms in yoke and teeth by use of nonlinear iron coefficients linked to id –iq currents. This paper will present the complete method calculating the iron coefficients from a nonlinear magnetic nodal network of the machine. A detailed study of local flux density waveform and harmonic content in yoke and teeth will be provided for two particular operating points: at maximal power without field weakening and at maximal power at maximal speed. These two points require accurate estimation in an optimal design of electrical machine. In addition, the local iron coefficients in teeth and yoke per volume unit will be provided in order to study the local evolution of iron losses in field weakening operation. It will show that iron losses do not follow the same evolution in the yoke and the teeth by the fact that the flux density distribution in teeth is more sensitive to the field weakening.

The controller is derived based on an energy-preserving strategy and it actually preserves mechanical energy at touchdown. Interestingly, zero dynamics of decoupling controller (dynamics about a pair of controlled legs) is found to be stable. Combining the simple attitude controller at stance phase generates stable periodic running gaits of arbitral period.

The system is potentially capable of sharing the workspace with human workers, assuming the use in a cell manufacturing system. We propose a new 3-DOF gripper mechanism with two fingers which symmetrically move in parallel and each finger has a 2-DOF fingertip of a cylindrical shape. We also develop a lightweight arm with a weight compensation mechanism which is composed of a non-circular pulley and a spring to minimize required actuator torque. After verification of basic performance, the hand-arm system successfully performs a pick-and-place task for a discoid object from horizontal placement to vertical placement and vice versa. We demonstrate continuous 100 times pick-and-place operations without failure where its cycle time almost equals to a human worker.	performance;prototype;robot end effector;smt placement equipment;workspace	Gen Endo;Hiroya Yamada;Shigeo Hirose	2010	2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2010.5654010	robot;control engineering;simulation;cycle time variation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;pulley;engineering drawing;actuator	Robotics	72.02181626365365	-23.074717894853222	155939

Control formulations have been proposed for specific mechanisms and some researchers have tried to build unified frameworks for general robot control. This paper reports an extension of the differential drive mechanism that we call the Heterogeneous Differential Drive. Bridging the gap between differential drive mechanisms and skid-steered mechanisms, the heterogeneous differential drive permits the modular combination of different types of actuators with different capabilities under one unified framework. It is a step toward a unified framework for actuators we call Heterogeneous Drive Mechanisms that permits reconfigurable mechanisms with homogeneous or heterogeneous components. The heterogeneous differential drive is a theoretical class of vehicles that lies in the gray area between pure differential drive vehicles and pure skid steered vehicles, yet represents either at the extremes. The heterogeneous differential drive also provides the basis for our preliminary development of the heterogeneous drive. This paper develops the kinematic model of the heterogeneous differential drive from the kinematic model of the differential drive formulation and describes an example mechanism.	bridging (networking);reconfigurability;robot control;self-reconfiguring modular robot;unified framework	Richard M.

8b4f7114f0b20590e7c1ee805c7ef0735ae07cd3	an energy-casimir approach to underwater vehicle depth and heading regulation in short crested waves		Conventional underwater vehicle models neglect wave excitation forces and free surface effects, since the vessel is most often deeply submerged where these effects are negligible. For near-surface operations, wave excitation forces significantly affect vessel motion. This paper focuses on depth and heading regulation for a fully actuated underwater vehicle operating in the wave-affected zone. We first construct a non-canonical Hamiltonian model for the nominal system dynamics. We then employ the energy-Casimir method to construct a control law, together with a Lyapunov function, which renders the desired motion asymptotically stable. Finally, using a disturbance model developed in an earlier work, we study the effects of the Froude-Krylov excitation forces on the closed-loop system response.	blood vessel tissue;controllers;course (navigation);deny (action);excitation;francis;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);krylov subspace;lyapunov fractal;optimal control;rejection sampling;rendering (computer graphics);system dynamics	Thomas Battista;Seyong Jung;Craig A.

6b440361c475670383896421243843a0a54773a4	functional design of elloboat, a tracked vehicle for launching and beaching of watercrafts and small boats		This paper discusses the mechanical architecture of Elloboat, an unmanned Tracked Vehicle (TV) for launching and beaching of watercrafts and small boats (up to a length of 3.5 meters). The mechanical architecture of Elloboat comprises a central saddle connected to two lateral tracks by parallelogram linkages, which may be driven by linear or rotary actuators to lift/lower the payload. The TV is able to pick the boat form a support, to travel along the beach and to perform launching while almost completely submerged. On the contrary, during beaching, the boat is relieved from the water and then transported to storage. The Elloboat mechanical architecture is redundantly constrained and actuated. In the following, after a detailed description of the device, the TV kinematic and static behaviours according to different actuation schemes are discussed on the basis of a mobility analysis and then by multibody simulations, with rigid and flexible models of joints.	3d film;computation;finite element method;functional design;lateral thinking;load balancing (computing);randomness;rotary woofer;simulation;uncrewed vehicle;unmanned aerial vehicle	Giovanni Ottonello;Giovanni Berselli;Luca E.

ce7bb3739599397ed66d351dabebe07b9758a2ee	a closed loop inverse kinematics solver intended for offline calculation optimized with ga		This paper presents a simple approach to building a robotic control system. Instead of a conventional control system which solves the inverse kinematics in real-time as the robot moves, an alternative approach where the inverse kinematics is calculated ahead of time is presented. This approach reduces the complexity and code necessary for the control system. Robot control systems are usually implemented in low level programming language. This new approach enables the use of high level programming for the complex inverse kinematics problem. For our approach, we implement a program to solve the inverse kinematics, called the Inverse Kinematics Solver (IKS), in Java, with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to load a file with desired end effector poses and edit the configuration of the robot using the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention. The program uses the closed-loop inverse kinematics (CLIK) algorithm to solve the inverse kinematics problem. As an example, the IKS was set up to solve the kinematics for a custom built serial link robot. The kinematics for the custom robot is presented, and an example of input and output files is also presented. Additionally, the gain of the loop in the IKS is optimized using a GA, resulting in almost a 50% decrease in computational time.	algorithm;computation;control system;denavit–hartenberg parameters;graphical user interface;high-level programming language;input/output;inverse kinematics;java;low-level programming language;online and offline;real-time clock;robot control;robot end effector;serial communication;software release life cycle;solver;time complexity	Emil Bjorlykhaug	2018	Robotics	10.3390/robotics7010007	control engineering;kinematics;robot;robot control;input/output;inverse kinematics;engineering;algorithm;control system;solver;robot end effector	Robotics	70.94773919033588	-19.427990452172097	157541
4930f07627eddd30b45a2447ded8527fc6ff191e	optimal design of synchronous reluctance machines		Electric machines are optimized to the extent of their magnetic configuration and manufacturability. Thanks to recent advances in development of composite material (SMC), 3-D printing, and programmable magnets, manufacturing capabilities have changed dramatically. Introducing of cloud computing and impressive computational resources has opened new opportunities in virtual prototyping in a multi-physics environment. These enabling technologies present a potential for a transformative approach in optimal design, evaluation, and manufacturing of the next generation of electric machines and adjustable speed drives. This paper proposes a new design approach applied to optimal design of synchronous reluctance machines. The proposed technique removes all the conventional constraints posed by traditional designs of classic magnetic configurations and only keeps a minimum airgap length and shaft diameter as the boundary conditions. The fabric of the rotor is based on a mesh whose elements can be air or SMC. A genetic algorithm is used for optimal placement of rotor configuration.	3d printing;airgap (microelectronics);cloud computing;computation (action);computational resource;design for manufacturability;diameter (qualifier value);genetic algorithm;intrinsic drive;magnet <device>;next-generation network;numerous;optimal design;printing, three-dimensional;r.o.t.o.r.;reluctance;shaft device component;subrhabdomeral cisterna	Morgan Kiani;Emine Bostanci;Babak Fahimi	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216638	control engineering;genetic algorithm;optimal design;virtual prototyping;boundary value problem;rotor (electric);engineering;cloud computing;magnetic reluctance;design for manufacturability	Robotics	77.38184238468861	-22.832684402047395	157832

We show in this paper that by appropriately designing multi-articular elastic actuators for biped robots in a manner inspired by human biomechanics, these tasks can be favorably expressed in a set of coordinates, in which the system is elastically decoupled. In these coordinates, the robot can be easily controlled by a set of simple and independent control laws. By exploiting the natural dynamics of the specially designed robot, the proposed controller requires only minimal model knowledge (mainly in terms of kinematic and static parameters) and is therefore robust to model uncertainties. It requires only state measurements and no measurement or model based computation of higher order state derivatives. Moreover, since the system is operated at a frequency dictated by the natural resonance, the running gait is energy efficient and resembles to a large extent natural human motion. Simulations validate the concept and demonstrate the independence of the approach from the knowledge of dynamics parameters.	apache axis;computation;computer simulation;control variable (programming);kinesiology;limit cycle;mathematical morphology;neutral monism;nonlinear system;norm (social);resonance;robot;system dynamics	Dominic Lakatos;Christian Rode;André Seyfarth;Alin Albu-Schäffer	2014	2014 IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots	10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2014.7041475	simulation;aerodynamics;control theory;statistic;foot;actuator	Robotics	69.17458753430383	-23.363564099897925	157871

The linear time-invariant (LTI) formulation copes with the redundant features and provides a simple framework for controller design. The proposed linear quadratic (LQ) method can deal with the redundant features, which is important because the previous LQ methods are not applicable to redundant systems. Moreover, this LQ method gives flexibility for performance improvement instead of the very limited design parameters provided by the generalized inverse and task function controllers. Validity of the LTI model and effectiveness and flexibility of the LQ optimal controller are evaluated by real-time experiments on a PUMA 560 manipulator.

This paper focuses on the structural shakiness of the non overconstrained TPM. Such a structural shakiness is due to the unavoidable lack of rigidity of the real bodies, which leads to uncheckable orientation changes of the moving platform of a TPM. Using algebraic properties of displacement subsets and, especially, displacement Lie subgroup theory, we show that the structural shakiness of the non overconstrained TPM is inherently determined by the structural type of its limb chains. A structural shakiness index (SSI) for a non overconstrained TPM is introduced. When the set of feasible displacements of the end body of a 5-degree-of-freedom (DOFs) limb chain contains two infinities of parallel axes of rotation, we have SSI = 2; when the displacement set of the end body of a 5-DOF limb chain contains only one infinity of parallel axes of rotation, we have SSI = 1. It is proven that non over con stained TPMs constructed with limb chains with SSI = 1 are much less prone to orientation changes than those constructed with limb chains with SSI = 2. Based on the SSI, we enumerate limb kinematic chains and construct 21 non overconstrained TPMs with less shakiness.	direct tpms;displacement mapping;enumerated type;kinematic chain;linear algebra;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;structural type system;trusted platform module	Qinchuan Li;Jacques Marie Hervé	2009	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2008.2006869	robot end effector;topology;mechatronics;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;geometry;group theory;engineering drawing	Robotics	69.78406308162825	-20.573860099328915	158287
b662b04468d46a891fff776f53a78af55ccf074e	artificial system inspired by climbing mechanism of galium aparine fabricated via 3d laser lithography		In this work, we present an artificial dry adhesive system inspired by the leaf-climbing mechanisms in Galium aparine. Among the different species of climbing plants, G. aparine shows a unique capability of adhesion to a wide range of roughness and stiffness objects, mainly via its leaves, using microscopic hooks for the physical interlocking. The adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) leaf surfaces differ significantly in attachment properties, which depend on the direction of the applied force (ratchet-like mechanism). In order to mimic this adhesive behavior, we designed artificial abaxial and adaxial leaf hooks by extracting the morphological parameters from the natural structures. We fabricated artificial hooks at different scales (1:1, 1:2, 1:4) using Direct Laser Lithography (DLL), a technique that allows a rapid prototyping of 3D microstructures. The adhesion of the artificial systems was tested on a polyester tissue substrate, obtaining adhesive forces comparable or higher than the natural counterpart. This biomimetic approach can open new opportunities to understand nature through artificial investigations and lead to several applications in the fields of robotics and space technology.	3d printing	Isabella Fiorello;Omar Tricinci;Anand Kumar Mishra;Francesca Tramacere;Carlo Filippeschi;Barbara Mazzolai	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-95972-6_18	galium;maskless lithography;adhesion;surface finish;microstructure;biomimetics;adhesive;climbing;composite material;materials science	HCI	75.6875549105674	-23.41500663518868	158478
873d4ccf26765d4d25ec139699746e1964d2e171	design process for adaptronic machine tools	design process;grinding machine;adaptronic;machine tool	A consistent goal in machine tool construction is to enhance the accuracy while increasing productivity. These two design parameters are negatively coupled. Increasing the machine dynamic is realized by increasing the engine power or with a lightweight design. As the engine power grows, so do the forces generated, which then lead to static deformations and excite the structure, leading to vibrations. Within the scope of this paper, the adaptronic framework has been adapted to machine tools. The development of such an adaptronic machine tool is no trivial task, as it requires an extensive knowledge overhead across a number of different scientific fields. Though these fields are interrelated, a methodical approach which takes advantage of a standard component is presented. This approach allows the interdisciplinary knowledge barriers to be overcome.	3d modeling;apply;excite;modal logic;overhead (computing)	Marc Simnofske;Annika Raatz;Jürgen Hesselbach	2009	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-009-0178-9	simulation;design process;engineering;machine tool;engineering drawing;mechanical engineering	SE	74.12487879768663	-23.632091965505822	158519

Concerning the problem, this article will establish a mathematical model of infrared gas sensor and make a deep analysis and experiment on the premise of considering the environmental temperature effect. In the meantime, putting forward two algorithm models on the basis of least square method and least square method, and making a comparison and verification trough the experiment. The experimental results show that the temperature compensation model of cubic spline interpolation is better fit the experimental data and smoother than the temperature compensation model of least square method. According to the design of infrared gas sensor mechanism, the errors in infrared gas sensor measurement caused by temperature effect have been solved effectively, and the real-time compensation to infrared gas sensor has achieved.	algorithm;cubic hermite spline;cubic function;existential quantification;interference (communication);mathematical model;real-time clock;spline interpolation	Lei Cheng;Hongyu Chen;Qiuyue Yu;Meng Da Wu;Xin Wang	2017	2017 2nd International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM)	10.1109/ICARM.2017.8273181	experimental data;spline interpolation;infrared;interference (wave propagation);physics;least squares;control theory	Robotics	75.65957330203793	-14.828468010545791	158601

In such applications, wired power supply system is useful for extension of task period instead of using on-board battery. In this case, the UAV requires to properly manipulate the power supply cable without inducing any accident, especially collision between the cable itself and environment. This paper addresses collision/obstacle avoidance flight including a cable hanged by UAVs. To accomplish this task, this paper proposes a shape estimation method of a cable using Catenary curve without using tension sensor. The cable is assumed to be flexible, but does not have elasticity. The fundamental flight experiments are carried out to verify the proposed method.	aerial photography;elasticity (data store);experiment;obstacle avoidance;on-board data handling;power supply;robot;shape context;unmanned aerial vehicle;vii	Satoko Abiko;Atsushi Kuno;Shota Narasaki;Atsushi Oosedo;Shohei Kokubun;Masaru Uchiyama	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2017.8324729	control engineering;collision;engineering;elasticity (economics);robot;catenary;obstacle avoidance	Robotics	74.98958464391697	-22.486098838104517	158769

In order to design afinite-dimensional controller, a finite-dimensional model of the system is needed. The con trol problem of a flexible beam is a typical example. The general practice in obtaining a finite-dimensional model is to use modal approximation for distributed flexibility, retain a finite number of modes, and truncate the rest. In this approx imation, the appropriate selection of the mode shape func tions and the number of modes is not clearly known. Mostly standard pinned-free and clamped-free mode shapes are used for the flexible beam model, retaining only two or three modes and truncating the rest. The actual system, on the other hand, is infinite-dimensional, and the modes describing its flexible behavior under feedback control would be neither pinned-free nor clamped-free boundary condition modes.

Feed-forward (FF) artificial neural network (ANN) models are employed for building soft-sensors able to predict the 28-day compressive strength and the modulus of elasticity of sandcrete materials. To this end, a new normalization technique for the pre-processing of data is proposed. The comparison of the derived results with the available experimental data demonstrates the capability of FF ANNs to predict with pinpoint accuracy the mechanical properties of sandcrete materials. Furthermore, the proposed normalization technique has been proven effective and robust compared to other normalization techniques available in the literature.	artificial neural network;compressive strength;elastic modulus;elasticity (data store);estimated;mercury:mcnt:pt:feed:qn;modulus robot;preprocessor;robustness (computer science);sensor (device)	Panagiotis G.

Perfect inverses are derived for all non-singular sub-matrices. The proposed algorithm is extremely fast. A total inverse requires 54 flops for PUMA and 43 for SCARA.

The proposed method starts by decomposing a planar redundant manipulator into a series of local planar arms that are either 2-link or 3-link manipulator modules, and connecting the conjunction points between them with virtual links. The manipulator then can be handled by a simple virtual link system, which may be conveniently divided into non-singular and singular cases depending on its configuration. When the virtual link system is no longer effective due to a singular configuration, the displacement of the end-effector is then allocated to virtual links according to a displacement distribution criterion. A dexterity index called the “configuration index” distinguishes the non-singular and singular cases. The concept of virtual link is shown by computer simulations to be simple and effective for the inverse kinematics of a planar hyper-redundant manipulator with a discrete model. In particular, it can be applied to solving the inverse kinematics of a SCARA-type spatial redundant manipulator whose redundancy is included in its planar mechanism. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.	inverse kinematics	Won Jee Chung;Youngil Youm;Wan Kyun Chung	1994	J.

For that, a new electrical circuit scheme that permits charge amplification is first proposed to match the different electrodes combination of the 2-DOF actuator. Then, a new bivariable observer that precisely estimates the displacements is calculated and implemented experimentally in a cascade with the electrical circuit to complete the self-sensing. The experimental tests and results verification with external sensors revealed that the measured displacements given by the developed self-sensing measurement technique derive better than a micron of precision which well fits to micromanipulation applications.

We apply performance analysis techniques that decompose the driving point impedance frequency response into effective stiffness, inertia, and damping and discuss device behaviors as rendering reverts to hardware dynamics with increasing frequency. SEA has previously been discussed in terms of stiffness limitations due to stability; here we discuss a frequency limit for haptic rendering with both architectures, and discuss differing high-frequency behaviors to consider when selecting a device architecture. Theoretical conclusions are accompanied by experimental frequency response data and a perceptual experiment using a reconfigurable haptic device.	characteristic impedance;frequency response;haptic technology;network synthesis filters;stiffness;virtual reality	Emma Treadway;Yi Yang;R.

Please cite only the published version using the reference above. Abstract: In a variety of fields, system inversion is often required in order to determine inputs from measured or for desired outputs. However, inverse systems are often non-proper in the sense that they require differentiators in their realisation. This leads to numerical difficulties associated with the computer implementation of their mathematical models. To overcome these problems, approximate inversion also referred to as filtered inversion is proposed for systems modelled by bond graphs. Generic configurations of right and left filtered inverse bond graph models are proposed with dynamic structural conditions on the filters so that the resulting composite bond graph represents a proper system suitable for effective numerical implementations.	approximation algorithm;mathematical model;numerical analysis	Roger Fotsu Ngwompo	2012	J.

When the crawler moves in a rough environment, collision between mechanism and environment inevitably occurs. This under-actuated crawler can absorb the impact energy that should be transmitted to the actuator. A modular concept for the crawler is proposed for enlarging its use in robot systems and mechanical design of a modular crawler is conducted. Using this crawler module, a four-crawler-driven robot is realized by easily assembling. Experiments are conducted to verify the proposed concept and mechanical design. A single crawler module can well perform the proposed three locomotion modes. The four-crawler-driven robot has good adaptability to the environment which can get over obstacles both passively and actively.	experiment;planetary scanner;robot;web crawler	Qiquan Quan;Shugen Ma	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354146	robot;control engineering;mechanism design;embedded system;simulation;gear;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;pulley	Robotics	71.801441154438	-23.340017778013245	160148

By using high compliant series elastic actuators, the motions of joint and motor are decoupled, which allows the exploitation of natural dynamics. Depending on the cost function, this exploitation varies. Energy is injected at different points of time, the amplitude of actuator action changes significantly, and the optimal gear ratios differ by a factor of two. Variations are, however, comparable over a wide range of hopping heights and running velocities. Purely force-based cost functions prove to be ill-suited for such non-conservative systems, and it is shown that thermal electrical losses, in contrast to common belief, do not dominate energy expenditure. The numerical results are corroborated by detailed analytical considerations which give general insights into optimal excitation with electric actuators.	frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hopper;loss function;numerical analysis;optimal control;robot	C.

The method can eliminate large fluctuations in the identified results which are commonly existed in the present identification techniques. With the state-space formulation and the least square error method, the objective function is established between measured and identified system responses. Introducing the Newmark integration, a discrete equation of motion is deduced based on the system displacement, velocity and acceleration response. Then Bellman’s Principle of Optimality is used for the minimization of the objective function to estimate the excitation forces; finally the dynamic programming method of identification formulations is deduced. Trigonometric function excitation and normal stochastic excitation are applied for the simulation study. Satisfactory results are achieved even when the measurement noise is taken into the measurement system responses.	dynamic programming	Tao Zhu;Shou-ne Xiao;Guang-wu Yang	2014	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2014.03.008	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;optimal substructure;control theory;mathematics;newmark-beta method	ML	73.41499621630953	-11.745113210786108	160697
56ea81cef457ccaa69a7f45c1137dbbb5d486d99	optimization of the kinematic model for biomimetic robotic fish with rigid headshaking mitigation		Biomimetic robotic fish is a new type of underwater robot with many superior characteristics such as high movement speed, high motion efficiency, high energy efficiency, and so on. However, the traditional kinematic model for biomimetic robotic fish has many shortcomings which limit their movement speed, such as the rigid shakes of the fish’s head when it swims, which is caused by neglecting the influences of manufacturing process on the model. In order to mitigate the rigid headshaking, a revised kinematic model is proposed by introducing an offset of the joints rotation center. The proposed kinematic equations are well simulated in a MATLAB environment, and the numerical results illustrate the advantage of the new kinematic model. Finally, experimental results generated from a three-joint biomimetic robotic fish with the proposed model show that the fish’s head shaking is effectively restrained, and therefore the swimming speed is significantly improved.	biomimetics;curve fitting;matlab;numerical analysis;prototype;robot;robotics;simulation;velocity (software development)	Baodong Lou;Yujie Ni;Minghe Mao;Ping Wang;Yu Cong	2017	Robotics	10.3390/robotics6040030	simulation;robot;control engineering;matlab;efficient energy use;headshaking;engineering;kinematics;offset (computer science);high-motion;underwater	Robotics	72.0430694883862	-20.463702725740863	160882

The inverse kinematic problem results in a system of equations describing the joint velocities as functions of the object's translational and angular velocities. In both cases it is assumed that the positions of the contact points are known. Also, by robot is meant an articulated mechanical hand affIXed to the distal end of a robotic arm. Abstract Dexterous manipulation refers to the skillful execution of object reorienting and repositioning maneuvers, especially when performed by an articulated mechanical hand. Kinematic analyses of dexterous manipulation are limited by their omission of contact forces. In this paper, Peshkin's minimum power principle [15] for quasi-static systems is used to combine force and kinematic relationships into a nonlinear mathematical program called the forward object motion problem. Given the joint velocities of the robot's hand and arm, the solution of the forward object motion problem predicts not only the velocity of the object (as done by kinematic analyses), but also the contact forces. In kinematic analyses one must guess as to the nature of all contact interactions (i.e. sliding, rolling or separating). The solution of the forward object motion problem definitively determines these interactions and the contact forces as a byproduct of determining the velocity of the manipulated object. 1.1.

It is specially designed to be used in distributed control systems with PID controllers. The study considers three cases of TITO control systems: decentralized control, centralized control with decoupler and centralized control with four PID. In them, the allowable region in the control signal space is transformed into an allowable region in the signal space of PID controllers. In this way, PID controllers are able to keep their integral term at a proper value when actuator saturates.

Levant's differentiator is a sliding mode control theory-based real-time differentiation algorithm proposed as a velocity estimator. The application of the technique allows stable implementation of higher stiffness virtual walls as compared to using the common finite difference method (FDM) cascaded with low-pass filters for velocity estimation. A single degree-of-freedom (DOF) linear haptic device is used as a test bed and an automated virtual wall hitting task is implemented to experimentally demonstrate that it is possible to extend the impedance-width (or Z-width) of a haptic interface via Levant's differentiator.	algorithm;characteristic impedance;control theory;differentiator;encoder;experiment;feedback;finite difference method;haptic technology;ibm notes;low-pass filter;real-time clock;testbed;velocity (software development)	Vinay Chawda;Ozkan Celik;Marcia Kilchenman O'Malley	2011	2011 IEEE World Haptics Conference	10.1109/WHC.2011.5945520	control engineering;electronic engineering;low-pass filter;computer science;engineering;finite difference method;artificial intelligence;control theory;haptic technology	Robotics	69.5436559180721	-14.602667261240658	161488

The central contribution of this work is the use of the Finite Element Method (FEM), computed in real-time, in the control algorithm. The FEM based simulation computes the nonlinear deformations of the robots at interactive rates. The model is completed by Lagrange multipliers at the actuation zones and at the end-effector position. A reduced compliance matrix is built in order to deal with the necessary inversion of the model. Then, an iterative algorithm uses this compliance matrix to find the contribution of the actuators (force and/or position) that will deform the structure so that the terminal end of the robot follows a given position. Additional constraints, like rigid or deformable obstacles, or the internal characteristics of the actuators are integrated in the control algorithm. We illustrate our method using simulated examples of both serial and parallel structures and we validate it on a real 3D soft robot made of silicone.	algorithm;experiment;finite element method;gauss–seidel method;iterative method;lagrange multiplier;motion capture;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;real-time clock;robot end effector;simulation;solver;sparse matrix	Christian Duriez	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2013.6631138	robot;control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;finite element method;control theory;iterative method;mixed finite element method;deformation;actuator	Robotics	70.33155510768589	-21.603709223954045	161927

The control problem is formulated as a multi-objective constrained optimization. The objective function is a metric which quantifies the detection and discrimination capacity of the human operator. The constraints are position tracking accuracy and absolute stability of the scaled teleoperation. Two popular control architectures, i.e., the position-position and the force-position control architectures are considered in this paper. The method of limits is employed in this paper to conduct the psychophysical experiments and evaluation. Results show that the developed control scheme is more effective in increasing the detection and discrimination capacity of human subjects as compared to the traditional transparency-optimized control laws.	constrained optimization;experiment;image scaling;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem	Hyoung Il Son;Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee;Hoeryong Jung;Doo Yong Lee	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509368	telerobotics;control engineering;constrained optimization;simulation;optimal control;computer science;engineering;electrical impedance;control theory;force	Robotics	68.80710493981421	-17.967974717788866	161963

This paper proposes an augmented wave-variable-based approach that can partially cancel the bias portion and improve the fidelity of force feedback significantly. In this approach, the returning wave is augmented by the velocities of the both sides of the communication channel. The steady-state position tracking is not affected by the modification. Passivity of the new teleoperation scheme can be obtained by tuning the bandwidth of a low-pass filter. Hence stability is always achievable.

Through laboratory-scale testing, SNL discovered that oscillation damping could be achieved by constant acceleration and deceleration timed to the natural frequency of the payload. ORNL then demonstrated a practical implementation using a full-scale crane and a 900-lb payload. The ORNL implementation has been identified as a specific case of a more generalized control technique, developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), to dampen vibration. The generalized approach has the promise of allowing more flexible constraints on the control hardware utilized and the acceleration profiles required. This paper redevelops the implementation of the ORNL full-scale application in terms of the generalized theory and presents concepts for an application to industrial cranes controlled by ac induction motors.

b33851b216ddd34c01a3bfa59a92547bbce3d3a9	design, control, and experimentation of internally-actuated rovers for the exploration of low-gravity planetary bodies		In this paper we discuss the design, control, and experimentation of internally-actuated rovers for the exploration of low-gravity (micro-g to milli-g) planetary bodies, such as asteroids, comets, or small moons. The actuation of the rover relies on spinning three internal flywheels, which allows all subsystems to be packaged in one sealed enclosure and enables the platform to be minimalistic, thereby reducing its cost. By controlling flywheels’ spin rate, the rover is capable of achieving large surface coverage by attitude-controlled hops, fine mobility by tumbling, and coarse instrument pointing by changing orientation relative to the ground. We discuss the dynamics of such rovers, their control, and key design features (e.g., flywheel design and orientation, geometry of external spikes, and system engineering aspects). The theoretical analysis is validated on a first-of-a-kind 6 degree-offreedom (DoF) microgravity test bed, which consists of a 3 DoF gimbal attached to an actively controlled gantry crane.

Known as continuum reconfigurable incisionless surgical parallel (CRISP) robots, these devices provide access to the human body through needle-sized entry points, yet can be configured into trusslike structures capable of dexterous movement and large force application. They can also be reconfigured as needed during a surgical procedure. Since CRISP robots are elastic, they will deform when subjected to external forces or other perturbations. In this letter, we explore how to combine sensor information with mechanics-based models for CRISP robots to estimate their shapes under applied loads. The end result is a shape sensing framework for CRISP robots that will enable future research on control under applied loads, autonomous motion, force sensing, and other robot behaviors.	autonomous robot;behavior;computer retrieval of information on scientific projects database;cross industry standard process for data mining;mechanics;operative surgical procedures;parallel manipulator;robot (device);triune continuum paradigm	Patrick L.

5ad2e0a78c5d838b2cfc3135705c254ccdb4afc5	3-dof planar parallel-wire driven robot with an active balancer and its model-based adaptive control		ABSTRACTThis paper has proposed a parallel-wire driven robot (PWDR) with an active balancer, which is notably useful for such applications as ceiling maintenance and object conveyance near a ceiling in a factory. Because this robot is an under-actuated system, the uncertainty of the inertial parameters of the load strongly affects the resultant motion and reduces the control accuracy because of the dynamics interference. However, to date, the dynamics of this robot has not been thoroughly elucidated. Thus, this study analyzes the dynamics of a PWDR that controls three degree-of-freedom using two wires and an active balancer. Moreover, based on the dynamic analysis, a model-based adaptive controller for the parameter uncertainty of a load is proposed, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation.	robot	Hitoshi Kino;T.

The criterion to be minimized is the quadratic error between the measured actual motor force/torque and the simulated one.

Previous studies have indicated that abrupt changes in motion profiles are sources of system vibration and are directly connected to performance such as degraded efficiency and decreased machine's lifetime. Therefore, efforts to generate smoother motion profiles based on various functions such as polynomial and trigonometric functions are ongoing. However, a comprehensive analytical comparison of previous studies has not been performed. In this study, the relationship between the design of the motion profiles and their characteristics is analyzed in Laplace domain with well-defined comparison tools that are frequently employed in input shaping technique. From the analysis, the characteristics of each motion profile and the tradeoffs between the cost and benefit of generating smoother movement can be explained.	embedded system;input shaping;noise shaping;polynomial	Chang-Wan Ha;Dongwook Lee	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2726959	engineering;linear motion;control theory;acceleration;control engineering;laplace transform;polynomial;input shaping;trigonometric functions;vibration	Visualization	73.11280440734888	-14.084041138257378	163744

In this paper, we discuss design criteria for a general master arm and present a new orthogonal type of master arm based on a pair of pantograph mechanisms that we have developed. This master arm is light in weight and compact, and the ergonomic switch layout on the grip was determined according to operational ease of use. The dynamic characteristics of this mechanism have been evaluated using generalized inertia tensor ellipsoids and good maneuverability has been confirmed in basic experiments.	coat of arms;experiment;human factors and ergonomics;master/slave (technology);switch;usability;user interface	Nobuto Matsuhira;Hiroyuki Bamba;Makoto Asakura	1993	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/156855394X00202	control engineering;design;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;manipulator;control theory;robotics;engineering drawing;mechanical engineering	HCI	71.68205573125248	-22.088278336984125	164081
212c49473e000fb2b44d3927d755711d93279af4	passive transparency compensation for bilateral teleoperators with communication delays		One of the main challenges in the realization of time-delayed bilateral teleoperators is the stable adaptation of transparency when the remote environmental dynamics are time-varying. In this paper, we propose a bilateral control strategy that passively adjusts the transparency of the system when the slave robot transitions between two different environments. The proposed controller exploits the effect that the wave impedance (a design parameter of the passivity-based scattering transformation) has on transparency without comprising closed-loop stability, regardless of time-varying communication delays. To properly adjust transparency, the control scheme smoothly switches the wave impedance parameter between a low value, ideal for freemotion, and a sufficiently large value, suited for hard-contact tasks.We show that, by adopting this strategy, the transmitted impedance to the operator approximates more closely the environmental impedance value. Furthermore, we theoretically provemaster-slave position coordination and force tracking under different scenarios. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.	bilateral filter;characteristic impedance;control theory;network switch;simulation;smoothing	Erick J.

We use a simplified drift model and changing but appropriate model parameters to implement this algorithm. The model of MEMS gyroscope temperature drift is constructed mostly on the basis of the temperature sensitivity of the gyroscope. As the state variables of a strong tracking Kalman filter (STKF), the parameters of the temperature drift model can be calculated to adapt to the environment under the support of the compass. These parameters change intelligently with the environment to maintain the precision of the MEMS gyroscope in the changing temperature. The heading error is less than 0.6° in the static temperature experiment, and also is kept in the range from 5° to -2° in the dynamic outdoor experiment. This demonstrates that the proposed algorithm exhibits strong adaptability to a changing temperature, and performs significantly better than KF and MLR to compensate the temperature drift of a gyroscope and eliminate the influence of temperature variation.	adaptive algorithm;bias genus;course (navigation);downtime;estimated;exhibits as topic;gyroscope;high- and low-level;inertial navigation system;interference (communication);kalman filter;learning to rank;less than;medication event monitoring system;micro-electrical-mechanical systems;microelectromechanical systems	Yibo Feng;Xisheng Li;Xiaojuan Zhang	2015		10.3390/s150511222	control engineering;text mining;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;vibrating structure gyroscope;bias;nanotechnology;control theory;compass	AI	73.32650230704759	-13.947509916955434	164440

The optimal harmonics of different orders for maximum torque is mathematically derived and validated by the finite element (FE) method in this paper. The output torque of the five-phase machine with sinusoidal shape can be improved by 12.5% by injecting the optimal third harmonic. Meanwhile, 3.2% further more torque improvement can be obtained with the optimal third and fifth harmonics injected. However, the output torque barely change with the seventh harmonic injection. The torque ripple of the machines with shaped PMs is much lower than the machines with conventional tile PM. The electromagnetic performance for all the machines including back electromotive force, average torque, torque ripple, etc., are compared.

The biarticular actuation mechanism is inspired from the musculoskeletal structure of animals and is utilized in the controller design, as well as the mechanism design. For an effective and convenient expression of the equation of motion, the rotating coordinate system is adopted unlike the conventional robotic manipulators, the dynamics of which are obtained in the fixed coordinate system. It is proved in this paper that the biarticular actuation mechanism makes the control of the end-effector easier, more robust, and more intuitive than typical actuation mechanisms. Based on the derived equation of motion of a robotic manipulator in the rotating coordinate system, a disturbance-observer-based controller is proposed for realization of the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model, which is a common model of human lower extremities but has seldom been realized in practice. The proposed methods are all verified by simulation studies in this paper.	algorithm;british informatics olympiad;coat of arms;inverted pendulum;robot end effector;simulation;time-scale calculus	Sehoon Oh;Kyoungchul Kong	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2014.6906627	control engineering;parallel manipulator;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	68.80201564147158	-22.3478559814386	164792
392d866dbdfccc082ee08b828d6e5c5a8b2eba9c	speech enhancement using maximum a-posteriori and gaussian mixture models for speech and noise periodogram estimation	maximum a posteriori map;speech enhancement;gaussian mixture model gmm;wiener filter	We use Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) to model Periodograms of speech and noise.A method to find the proper size of GMMs is discussed.We propose a Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) Periodogram estimation using GMMs.The GMMs are used to enhance the noisy speech using Wiener filter. In speech enhancement, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) can be used to model the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the Periodograms of speech and different noise types. These GMMs are created by applying the Estimate Maximization (EM) algorithm on large datasets of speech and different noise type Periodograms and hence classify them into a small number of clusters whose centroid Periodograms are the mean vectors of the GMMs. These GMMs are used to realize the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) estimation of the speech and noise Periodograms present in a noisy speech observation. To realize the MAP estimation, use of a constrained optimization algorithm is proposed in which relatively good enhancement results with high processing times are attained. Due to the use of constraints in the optimization algorithm, incorrect estimation results may arise due to possible local maxima. A simple analytic MAP algorithm is proposed to attain global maximums in lower calculation times. With the new method the complicated MAP formula is simplified as much as possible to find the maxima, through solving a set of equations and not through conventional numerical methods used in optimization. This method results in excellent speech enhancement with a relatively short processing time.	estimation theory;mixture model;spectral density estimation;speech enhancement	Sarang Chehrehsa;Tom J.

We present a method for controlling a tendon-driven continuum manipulator by means of specifying the shape configuration. The basis for control is a linear beam configuration model that transforms beam configuration to tendon displacement by modeling internal loads of the compliant system. An essential aspect of this model is the inclusion of both the mechanical and geometrical coupling among serial articulating sections. Important capabilities of this model are the general forward kinematics and the decoupled inverse kinematics that allow for independent control of multiple sections. Tracking results are presented for a cardiac catheter with two articulating sections.	configuration interaction;displacement mapping;forward kinematics;inverse kinematics;robot;triune continuum paradigm	David B.

Twist Drive is one of transmission system which is consisted a pair of strings and rotary motor. This transmission system converts torque into a pulling force by using the pair of strings twisted on each other. However, it cannot realize pushing motion. Therefore the Twist Drive needs to be combined with an other actuation system for the realization of pushing motion. The problem is solved by tendon drive using Twist Drive system in this paper. High-precision control is achieved by modal-space disturbance observer. Modal-space disturbance observer is designed to realize the acceleration based control. It also compensates the modal interference. Furthermore work space observer is able to estimate the force in the work space without any force sensors. The proposed method was applied to rotational angle control and torque control of the tendon driven rotary actuator. The effect of the proposal is verified through experiments.	actuation dosing unit;actuator device component;angularjs;experiment;interference (communication);modal logic;rotary system;rotary woofer;steady state;tendon structure;twisted;sensor (device)	Seiji Uozumi;Koyo Yu;Nobuto Yoshimura;Kouhei Ohnishi	2014	2014 IEEE 13th International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control (AMC)	10.1109/AMC.2014.6823327	control engineering;engineering;control theory;mechanical engineering	Robotics	72.00762110922965	-18.879153755844886	164949
0c93cfdfb137c4e6103e97bd8849a28797f1f696	the input-to-state stable (iss) approach for stabilizing haptic interaction with virtual environments	haptic interfaces;stability criteria;asymptotic stability;impedance;hysteresis;numerical stability	Passivity has been a major criterion for designing a stable haptic interface due to its numerous advantages. However, passivity-based controllers have suffered from the design conservatism of the passivity criterion, particularly when users want to increase the maximum apparent impedance. Based on the input-to-state stable (ISS) criterion and an analogy between haptic interfaces and systems with hysteresis, this paper proposes a control framework that is less conservative than passivity-based controllers. The proposed ISS approach allows a non-predetermined finite amount of output energy to be extracted from the system. Therefore, the proposed method can increase the maximum apparent impedance compared with passivity-based approaches. The focus of this paper is on how the proposed approach is designed to satisfy the input-to-state stability criterion in real time without prior knowledge of the system. This paper also extends the primary single-port ISS approach to a two-port ISS approach for multiple-degree-of-freedom generalization. The experimental and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed ISS approach is able to stabilize a higher impedance range than the time-domain passivity approach. The experimental results also confirm that the proposed approach provides higher actual apparent impedance to the operator compared with the energy-bounding and force-bounding approaches.	characteristic impedance;control theory;haptic technology;hysteresis;numerical analysis	Aghil Jafari;Muhammad Nabeel;Jee-Hwan Ryu	2017	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2017.2676127	control engineering;control theory;mathematics;passivity;haptic technology;stability criterion;hysteresis;analogy;numerical stability;electrical impedance;exponential stability	Robotics	69.21339016625944	-12.76757108203758	165071

The robot can change its workspaces by coupling and decoupling of a platform and two or more 2R open kinematic chains with second joints unactuated (limb). The platform should be light and therefore no additional actuators are used for recon gurations. We have already shown that uncertainty singular con gurations are appropriate for coupling of two limbs. This paper describes positive and negative aspects of the uncertainty singularity for coupling and decoupling. In addtion, decoupling needs to be carried out with more care than coupling. It must be considered to assure the safety of a decoupled limb and to prevent unexpected decoupling of other limbs. We propose feasible coupling and decoupling con gurations for the proposed self-recongurable planar parallel robot. We also introduce our real robot and show its coupling mechanism, which is designed to be easy to couple and hard to decouple. Experiments are carried out to verify recon gurations to change workspaces.	coupling (computer programming);experiment;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;parallel manipulator;self-reconfiguring modular robot;singular value decomposition;workspace	Jin-Kyu Choi;Osamu Mori;Toshiya Tsukiai;Toru Omata	2004	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/156855304322753290	control engineering;parallel manipulator;mechanism;engineering;control reconfiguration;control theory;coupling;engineering drawing;mechanical engineering	Robotics	70.53851095368451	-23.050857525993997	165103

Subsequently, the fault state, which involves making a hole in the rubber tube of the PAM, and the normal state were classified by using a support vector machine (SVM) based on the change in model parameters. Furthermore, a few model parameters that can characterize the state of the PAM were extracted in terms of generalization performance. The results can be applied to other systems, such as hydraulic systems of a construction machine, and used to improve control performance by designing control systems to alleviate the influence of changing dynamics.	classification;control system;experiment;extraction;generalization (psychology);movement;nonlinear system;pneumatic artificial muscles;potassium aggravated myotonia;steady state;support vector machine	Takahiro Ishikawa;Kiminao Kogiso;Kenichi Hamamoto	2018	2018 IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA)	10.1109/CCTA.2018.8511330	artificial muscle;support vector machine;steady state;control engineering;nonlinear system;computer science;pneumatic artificial muscles;hydraulic machinery;control system	Robotics	76.87324599481806	-13.429742617105425	165253

The friction of two components, i.e. a brush-less DC motor and a harmonic drive gear (HD) is investigated in order to build an accurate dynamic model of the main actuator of the arms of the humanoid David namely the DLR Floating Spring Joint (FSJ). A dedicated testbed is built to precisely identify input and output torques, temperatures, positions, and elasticities of the investigated components at a controlled environment temperature. Extensive test series are performed in the full velocity operating range in a temperature interval from 24 to 50 °C. The nonlinear influences of velocity and temperature are identified to be dominant effects. It is proposed how to include these nonlinear velocity and temperature dependencies into a static and a dynamic friction model, e.g. LuGre. Dynamic models of the motor and HD are built with the proposed method and experimentally evaluated. The new models are compared to friction models with linear dependencies and show a significant improvement of correspondence with reality.	artificial neural network;cambridge structural database;chirp;coat of arms;dynamic language runtime;electrical load;experiment;input/output;mathematical model;nonlinear system;refinement (computing);robot;sensor;simulation;testbed;velocity (software development)	Sebastian Wolf;Maged Iskandar	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2018.8460613	viscosity;control theory;harmonic drive;torque;dynamical friction;control engineering;actuator;nonlinear system;input/output;engineering;dc motor	Robotics	72.53833037070245	-19.615941908037545	165331

16bb15df9686d074572a894ac5d9455fe42ddd92	signal estimation under random time-warpings and nonlinear signal alignment		While signal estimation under random amplitudes, phase shifts, and additive noise is studied frequently, the problem of estimating a deterministic signal under random time-warpings has been relatively unexplored. We present a novel framework for estimating the unknown signal that utilizes the action of the warping group to form an equivalence relation between signals. First, we derive an estimator for the equivalence class of the unknown signal using the notion of Karcher mean on the quotient space of equivalence classes. This step requires the use of Fisher-Rao Riemannian metric and a square-root representation of signals to enable computations of distances and means under this metric. Then, we define a notion of the center of a class and show that the center of the estimated class is a consistent estimator of the underlying unknown signal. This estimation algorithm has many applications: (1) registration/alignment of functional data, (2) separation of phase/amplitude components of functional data, (3) joint demodulation and carrier estimation, and (4) sparse modeling of functional data. Here we demonstrate only (1) and (2): Given signals are temporally aligned using nonlinear warpings and, thus, separated into their phase and amplitude components. The proposed method for signal alignment is shown to have state of the art performance using Berkeley growth, handwritten signatures, and neuroscience spike train data.	action potential;additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;computation;distance (graph theory);electronic signature;estimation theory;nonlinear system;sparse matrix;spatial variability;turing completeness;utility functions on indivisible goods	Sebastian Kurtek;Anuj Srivastava;Wei Wu	2011			mathematical optimization;machine learning;mathematics;statistics	ML	77.74905717591149	-10.432506661664446	165596

bbeafef4b52b2d5930dc78786b406dc7ce2ac209	an enhanced wave-variable based four-channel bilateral teleoperation control design		Good transparency performance (including position tracking and force feedback) is an important issue for teleoperation control design. The four-channel control approach, which is based on the impedance matching, is effective to achieve the good transparency performance of teleoperation system. However, the shortcoming of this approach is the ignorance of time delay in the communication channel and thus deteriorating the system’s stability. Some passivity based control approaches (e.g., wave variable transform) are developed to guarantee the system’s stability under time delay, and have been tried to apply into four-channel control design, but the transparency performance may decrease since the traditional wave-variable may suffer some performance limitations (e.g., wave reflection). Thus, simultaneously realizing the stability and good transparency performance for four channel teleoperation system remains a challenging issue. In this paper, an enhanced wave-variable based four-channel control design is developed for bilateral teleoperation system to guarantee stability and further improve transparency performance. The time-delay compensator by the modified wave transform and the local force feedback are provided to compensate the distortion by reducing wave reflection. The simulation under time-varying delays is carried out, and the results show the obvious improvement of the proposed approach to achieve good transparency performance compared to the previous four-channel control designs.	bilateral filter;broadcast delay;channel (communications);distortion;haptic technology;impedance matching;simulation;telecommuting	Fanghao Huang;Zheng Chen;Jason Jianjun Gu	2018	2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Control and Automation (ICCA)	10.1109/ICCA.2018.8444286	control engineering;passivity;control theory;engineering;transparency (graphic);distortion;impedance matching;teleoperation;communication channel;reflection (physics)	Robotics	68.99493074790959	-12.790021486360661	166032
40509bf897e37387dfccb03bcee01aa8df31708c	research developments in vibration control of structures using passive tuned mass dampers	earthquake;passive response control;structures;tuned mass dampers;wind	A state-of-the-art review on the response control of structures mainly using the passive tuned mass damper(s) (TMD/s) is presented. The review essentially focuses on the response control of windand earthquake-excited structures and covers theoretical backgrounds of the TMD and research developments therein. To put the TMD within a proper frame of reference, the study begins with a qualitative description and comparison of passive control systems for protecting structures subjected to wind-imparted forces and forces induced due to earthquake ground motions. A detailed literature review of the TMD is then provided with reference to both, the theoretical and experimental researches. Specifically, the review focuses on descriptions of the dynamic behavior and distinguishing features of various systems, viz. single TMD (STMD), multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMDs), and spatially distributed MTMDs (dMTMD) which have been theoretically developed and experimentally tested both at the component level and through small-scale structural models. The review clearly demonstrates that the TMDs have a potential for improving the wind and seismic behaviors of prototype civil structures. In addition, the review shows that the MTMDs and d-MTMDs are relatively more effective and robust, as reported. The paper shows the scope of future research in development of time and frequency domain analyses of structures installed with the d-MTMDs duly considering uncertainties in the structural parameters and forcing functions. In addition, the consideration of nonlinearity in structural material and geometry is recommended for assessment of the performance of the STMD, MTMDs, or d-MTMDs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Hard magnets are arranged in a novel 120deg offset configuration, allowing for in-situ magnetization. The new configuration makes the use of hard magnets feasible in batch fabrication, and hard magnets allow for the use of a uniform external field for application of magnetic torque. A sequential planner was developed to calculate layout and magnet orientations for given assemblies, based on this new magnet configuration. We describe the new magnet configuration, experimentally test the configuration, and present a planner that generates a planar layout and magnet orientations.	algorithm;complexity;convex function;experiment;planner;self-assembly	Evan Shechter;Arjun Arumbakkam;P.

98fa54abdd58e79f5ed3f765cb00c0de97f45b79	improved multitarget tracking in clutter using bearings-only measurements	gaussian mixture measurements-cardinality probability hypothesis density;bearings-only;measurement nonlinearity;measurement-origin-uncertainty;multitarget tracking	Multitarget tracking in clutter using bearings-only measurements is a challenging problem. In this paper, a performance improved nonlinear filter is proposed on the basis of the Random Finite Set (RFS) theory and is named as Gaussian mixture measurements-based cardinality probability hypothesis density (GMMbCPHD) filter. The GMMbCPHD filter enables to address two main issues: measurement-origin-uncertainty and measurement nonlinearity, which constitutes the key problems in bearings-only multitarget tracking in clutter. For the measurement-origin-uncertainty issue, the proposed filter estimates the intensity of RFS of multiple targets as well as propagates the posterior cardinality distribution. For the measurement-origin-nonlinearity issue, the GMMbCPHD approximates the measurement likelihood function using a Gaussian mixture rather than a single Gaussian distribution as used in extended Kalman filter (EKF). The superiority of the proposed GMMbCPHD are validated by comparing with several state-of-the-art algorithms via intensive simulation studies.	adult fanconi syndrome;approximation algorithm;bearing device component;cardinality;clutter;conceptualization (information science);conflict (psychology);estimated;extended kalman filter;finite element analysis;google map maker;large;likelihood functions;name;natural science disciplines;nonlinear system;normal statistical distribution;racepinephrine;remote file sharing;simulation;benefit;mixture	Yifang Shi;Mengfan Xue;Yuemin Ding;Dongliang Peng	2018		10.3390/s18061772	electronic engineering;engineering;control engineering;clutter;bearing (mechanical)	AI	77.5275248546322	-11.790509146738904	167057

The influence of control precision on self-calibration and coarse alignment of the rotational inertial navigation system (RINS) is analyzed. The model of the control system is established and simulated. Then the control mode is applied on RINS. The results of simulation and experiments show that the precision of locking control method designed in this paper outperforms the previous scheme and the self-calibration effect of RINS has significantly improved.	control system;control theory;encoder;experiment;fibre optic gyroscope;gyro;image resolution;inertial navigation system;institute of electronics, information and communication engineers;lock (computer science);optical fiber;photoelectric effect;real-time clock;requirement;simulation	Chao Zhang;Lei Wang;Jingjuan Zhang;Zengjun Liu	2016	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.13.20160841	control engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;fibre optic gyroscope;inertial navigation system;physics;rate gyro	Robotics	69.81940464351163	-14.321458346971415	167463

For this purpose, a vehicle finite element (FE) model was established and validated by the acceleration curve of the back seat in 100% front impact and 40% offset impact. According to the RCAR rule, the simulation at low-speed impact of 16km/h was carried out to evaluate the crashworthiness of the car. Based on the simulation results, a crash-box was designed and the parameter study was carried out to improve the energy absorption of bumper and crash box by using the orthogonal experiment design and the overall balance method.

A pair of spaced apart hinges are mounted to a rigid support adjacent the pool. A hinge arm is pivotally mounted in each hinge for pivoting about a pivot axis. Each arm is capable of rotation through a predetermined angle of rotation from a plane that is substantiallay normal to the pivot axis. Each hinge arm includes a clamp within which a rigid planar hoop that circumscribes the pool is secured. The hinge arm has an axis and the clamp has an axis oriented a predetermined clamp angle away from the axis of the arm. A panel spanning the central interior area of the hoop is secured to the hoop. The clamp angle and the angle of rotation in combination allow for adjustment of the hoop in the clamp in accordance with the shape of said hoop and the presence and elevation of the pool coping such that when the panel covers the pool, the hoop lies in a horizontal plane. A resilient seal is attached to the one side of the panel for forming an air-tight seal with the panel such that when the panel covers the pool, the resilient seal contacts the surface area surrounding the pool for providing a substantially air-tight seal between the pool and the region enclosed by the cover.	intelligent agent	Wen-Bin Yu;James H.

d568329af6eead80f2671bbef9649430cbdc56e1	practical limitations of wave variable controllers in teleoperation	telerobotics;force feedback;robot control	Wave variable controllers can make a force reflecting teleoperator insensitive to communication time delays by encoding information before transmission. They are based on passivity and assume no information about the delays or the environment. However, like most robotic control systems, they model the master and slave devices as passive inertias and ignore amplifier and sensor dynamics. We review these modeling assumptions and show that non-idealities of the mechanisms, actuators, and sensors can violate passivity and impose practical limitations on the wave based controllers. We propose a method for quantifying this activeness and dissipating the corresponding energy to restore passivity.	amplifier;bandwidth (signal processing);bounce address;cpu power dissipation;characteristic impedance;control system;haptic technology;inner loop;norm (social);robot;sensor;telerobotics;vii	Niel A.

The design of the spring parameter will affect the region of the stable grasp. This paper presents a metric to design the spring stiffness to keep the tradeoff between the adaption of objects and ability of stable grasp. Firstly, the relationship between the spring stiffness and stable region is qualified and visualized according to grasp-state plane together with the spring stiffness’s delimiter between regimes. Then, a quantitative way by analytical equations and graphs is proposed to evaluate the grasp stabilization with respect to spring stiffness. Finally, applications of designing the optimal spring stiffness by giving the particular conditions are presented to validate the efficiency of the proposed method.	underactuation	Jing Cui;Shaobo Yan;Jian Hu;Zhongyi Chu	2018	Robotics and Autonomous Systems	10.1016/j.robot.2018.01.001	computer vision;underactuation;computer science;actuator;artificial intelligence;control theory;stiffness;delimiter;graph;grasp	Robotics	70.0709352984216	-22.572216224072687	169203

1a3f8fb8121710455a526456c2cac2626cd4ddb3	an optimization procedure to reconstruct the automobile ingress movement		To simulate the automobile ingress movement, joint angles are needed. The joint angles are computed from the experimental data issued from an optoelectronic motion capture system. As these systems are often corrupted by problems related either to the system or to the experimentation, the computed angles are biased. Lempereur et al. (2003) proposed an optimization procedure to remedy to this problem. However, their method gives good results only on the end effectors’ trajectories, while the other bodies’ trajectories are not considered by their method. That degrades the positions of these parts and causes their eventual collisions with the vehicle’s parts. On the other hand the corrected angles present some vibrations causing unrealistic simulation. In this paper we present a multi objective optimization based procedure to correct the joint articulation angles in automobile ingress movement. Our method minimizes the distance between all reconstructed trajectories with the real ones at each step of time. Our method follows a compromise between all trajectories of the model. Our method gives better global results. Correction of the joint angles allows a realistic simulation.	biconnected component;mathematical optimization;motion capture;shadow volume;simulation	Mohand Ouidir Ait El Menceur;Philippe Pudlo;François Xavier Lepoutre;Philippe Gorce	2008			voltage;control theory;engineering;transformer;resonance;perpendicular;piezoelectricity;acoustics;cylinder;lateral surface;vibration	Robotics	79.28568540239318	-14.712635453561191	169275

The particular problem which is addressed is the control of a single flexible link planar manipulator. An extremely simple control strategy is derived by treating the effects of compliance as an uncertain torque about which no a priori knowledge is assumed other than a bound. However, because the torque is modeled as an uncertainty, we must perform computer-aided validation of our design using a finite-element model for our manipulator. Hitherto, the finite- element package ANSYS has been widely used as a modeling/analysis tool for flexible structures. However, developments in the ANSYS (version 4.3 and later) allow the interfacing of external programs with the analysis package, thereby enabling closed- loop control strategies to be tested.

Taking this kind of robot as an example, some new methods for robot module modeling and reconfiguration modeling are figured out, according to which a reconfigurable robot of any configuration can set up a dynamical model for itself automatically. By analyzing the velocities, forces and torques of each module, the dynamical functions of the robot are established, using the Newton-Euler method.

The analysis of the control stability is given and the ultimate boundedness of the speed tracking error is proved. The control scheme is experimentally tested on a commercial PMSM drive. Reported experimental evidence shows that the proposed solution produces good speed trajectory tracking performance and it is robust in the presence of disturbances affecting the system.	differentiator;encoder;experiment;robust control;synchronous programming language	Maria Letizia Corradini;Gianluca Ippoliti;Sauro Longhi;Giuseppe Orlando	2012	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2011.2158035	robust control;electric motor;control engineering;synchronous motor;discrete time and continuous time;electronic engineering;sliding mode control;engineering;electrical engineering;digital signal processing;bismuth;control theory;torque;robustness	Robotics	68.358984701916	-10.841157297664033	170260

The manipulator possesses both a nearly decoupled motion and a simple structure, which is featured with parallel-kinematic architecture, flexure hinge-based joints, and piezoelectric actuation. Based on pseudo-rigid-body (PRB) simplification approach, the mathematical models predicting kinematics, statics, and dynamics of the XY stage have been obtained, which are verified by the finite-element analysis (FEA) and then integrated into dimension optimization via the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Moreover, a prototype of the micromanipulator is fabricated and calibrated using a microscope vision system, and visual servo control employing a modified PD controller is implemented for the accuracy improvement. The experiments discover that a workspace size of 260 mum times 260 mum with a 2-D positioning accuracy and repeatability around 0.73 and 1.02 mum, respectively, can be achieved by the micromanipulator.	classical xy model;control system;experiment;federal enterprise architecture;feedback;finite element method;level of detail;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;optimal design;particle swarm optimization;performance;phase-shift oscillator;piezoelectricity;prototype;repeatability;requirement;resonance;robot end effector;sampling (signal processing);semiconductor device fabrication;sensor;servo;velocity (software development);visual servoing;workspace;x–y plotter	Qingsong Xu;Yangmin Li;N.

Firstly, the mechanical sensitivity and the shock response of the micro-gyroscope are theoretically analyzed. In the mechanical design, a novel lever coupling mechanism is proposed to change the modal order and to improve the frequency separation. The micro-gyroscope with the lever coupling mechanism optimizes the drive mode order, increasing the in-phase mode frequency to be much larger than the anti-phase one. Shock analysis results show that the micro-gyroscope structure with the designed lever coupling mechanism can notably reduce the magnitudes of the shock response and cut down the stress produced in the shock process compared with the traditional elastic coupled one. Simulations reveal that the shock resistance along the drive direction is greatly increased. Consequently, the lever coupling mechanism can change the gyroscope's modal order and improve the frequency separation by structurally offering a higher stiffness difference ratio. The shock resistance along the driving direction is tremendously enhanced without loss of the mechanical sensitivity.	computer simulation;dual;gyroscope;large;modal logic;shock;silicon	Yang Gao;Hongsheng Li;Libin Huang;Hui Sun	2017		10.3390/s17050995	structural engineering;control engineering;engineering;nanotechnology;microelectromechanical systems;forensic engineering	HCI	78.74521462439033	-15.716920268702088	171024

However, dynamic coupling between joints as well as non-linear effects become more prominent than in traditional robots with reducers. Another critical issue is that the robot becomes more sensitive to the change of load. In this paper, we develop a design method for a control system for reducing the influence of dynamic coupling and load sensitivity on direct-drive robots. For the design of the control system, we use a root locus that takes inertia as a parameter. A positive current feedback scheme is proposed in the implementation. A problem in the application of the method to a brushless DC motor is also considered. Finally, the method is implemented on a 2-DOF planar direct-drive robot with brushless DC motors as actuators. Then the validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments.	control system;experiment;locus;nonlinear system;robot	Young-Tark Kim;Hidekatsu Tokumaru	1991	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/156855391X00386	control engineering;inertia;engineering;control system;electrical engineering;control theory;robotics	Robotics	71.48615891985717	-16.833454680703834	171368

289d6831d97e9b045dce1ddba5ad625f08806b7a	semiactive-passive structural vibration control strategy for adjacent structures under seismic excitation		The objective of this paper is to study a structural vibration control strategy for seismic protection of multi-structure systems that combines interstructure passive damping elements with local feedback control systems implemented in the substructures. These local feedback control systems are independently designed and operated, and use semiactive devices with limited actuation capacity as force actuators. The combined action of local semiactive feedback control systems and passive interstructure links can produce an appropriate reduction in the substructures' vibrational response and, simultaneously, provides additional protection against interstructure collisions. The proposed semiactive–passive control strategy is remarkably robust against large external disturbances and failures of the local feedback control systems, and also has a number of particular characteristics that can be specially relevant in practical implementations: low cost and power requirements, design and implementation flexibility, and conceptual simplicity. Due to the complexity of a general multi-structure system, a particular two-building system has been chosen to present the main ideas.	control theory	Francisco Palacios-Quiñonero;Josep Rubió-Massegú;Josep M.

Based on structure parameters from static experiments, a finite element model of the flap was created within MSC Patran software. Normal modal analysis and linear flutter analysis were carried out firstly. V –g and V –f curves were obtained to determine the critical flutter speeds with and without the actuation mechanism. Structural mass, damping, stiffness, and aerodynamic matrixes were printed with DMAP language to form an aeroelastic equation in modal coordinate. The freeplay nonlinearity between disks attached to the curved beams and wing skins was considered in the aeroelastic analysis. An unsteady aerodynamic influence coefficients matrix was calculated by Roger’s approximation. The nonlinear aeroelastic equation in modal coordinate was solved by an iterative program written with MATLAB software. Based on the reduced-order aeroelastic model, the effect of freeplay on aeroelastic responses was investigated. Numerical results show that the freeplay nonlinearity may reduce critical flutter speed, leading to supercritical Hopf bifurcation.	approximation;audio system measurements;bifurcation theory;coefficient;digital media access protocol;digraphs and trigraphs;experiment;finite element method;hopf bifurcation;iterative method;limit cycle;matlab;modal logic;morphing;nl-complete;nastran;nonlinear system;numerical aperture;numerical method;printing;wow and flutter measurement	Daochun Li;Shijun Guo;Yuanyuan He;Jinwu Xiang	2012	I.

An improved scheme for implementation of Unity Magnitude - Zero Vibration (UM-ZV) and Zero Vibration (ZV) shapers to shape the input signal in rising and falling edges is designed which enables an operator to move the gantry crane without problem with motion-induced sway. Simulation studies show that the proposed scheme resulted in lower overall sway for rail and trolley of the crane as compared to conventional shapers designed using gain-delay elements for payload sway reduction.

7a897a075de32a2c6118df237067e24420a0aeeb	optimal fail-safe motion using dynamic brake for lorentz-actuated afm		Many high-precision motion systems are positioning their mover close to the sample or target with a risk of collision in a failure. In order to prevent damage, this paper proposes a fail-safe system particularly for systems using flexure-guided Lorentz (voice coil) actuators. In this paper, an atomic force microscope (AFM) is used for demonstration. The flexures are deformed during AFM imaging such that the mover with the probe can be withdrawn from the sample by turning off the actuators in a failure. To realize fast withdrawing motion without a sensor for the protection of the probe and sample, this paper also proposes to use the dynamic braking of the Lorentz actuators. For an ideal braking force for fast settling, an optimal dynamic braking resistance is derived to minimize the 2-norm of the mover motion. Because the resulting optimal resistance is negative, it is implemented by an operational amplifier. The experiments demonstrate that the optimal dynamic braking reduces the settling time of the mover by 86.7 %, and the fail-safe operation is completed only within 54 ms.	atomic-force microscopy;coil device component;experiment;fail-safe system device component;flexure;microscope device component;microscopy, atomic force;operational amplifier;safety engineering;scanning probe microscopes (device);settling time;voice coil;collision	Shingo Ito;Georg Schitter	2018	2018 IEEE 15th International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control (AMC)	10.1109/AMC.2019.8371139	collision;actuator;voice coil;lorentz transformation;operational amplifier;dynamic braking;settling time;control theory;fail-safe;computer science	Robotics	74.3988839679192	-19.28305300265615	172219

A five-bar finger mechanism driven by redundant actuators is given as an illustrative example. It is shown that judicial choice of the location of one redundant actuator greatly enhances the load handling capacity of the system, when compared to those of minimum actuation and more than two redundant actuation, Also, methodologies for stiffness and motion frequency modulations via redundant actuation are investigated in this work. Internal load distribution associated with the stiffness and motion frequency modulations is further discussed. Specifically, the motion frequency of the system is modulated by employing inertial and the spring-like impedance properties created by internal loading. The motion frequency as well as the amplitude of oscillation can be actively adjusted during the motion, and the equilibrium position about which the vibration occurs can also be arbitrarily changed during the motion. Furthermore, using the stiffness modulation capability, a point-to-point motion can be accomplished by a progressive movement of equilibrium posture, which is termed as a virtual trajectory. To show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, several simulation results are illustrated.	algorithm;characteristic impedance;load balancing (computing);point-to-point protocol;poor posture;pulse-width modulation;simulation	Byung-Ju Yi;Sang-Rok Oh;Il Hong Suh	1999	IEEE Trans.

The structure of the proposed system is based on a resonance ratio control system and a feedback signal of the reaction force response. In this paper, the gain of a pseudo derivation is designed as the feedback gain. From the results of the designed gains, the feedback gain Kf is a negative value. Hence, the resonance ratio control system becomes equivalent to a state feedback. For the stability of the proposed I-PD force control system based on the acceleration control system and a state feedback, a new analysis method is required. This paper analyzes an open-loop of the proposed system considering the bandwidth of the observer. The results of an analysis show that an observer with a wide bandwidth is required. Therefore, the parameters of proposed system using the instantaneous state observer are designed based on the coefficient diagram method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by performing numerical simulations based on the model of an industrial robot arm. The results show that the proposed method is effective for the stable force control of an industrial robot arm.	afmid gene;bandwidth (signal processing);coefficient diagram method;control system;feedback;industrial robot;numerical analysis;parkinson disease;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;resonance;robotic arm;simulation	Akinori Yabuki;Kiyoshi Ohishi;Toshimasa Miyazaki;Yuki Yokokura	2016	2016 IEEE 14th International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control (AMC)	10.1109/AMC.2016.7496333	full state feedback;control engineering;simulation;sliding mode control;engineering;control theory;state observer;feed forward;separation principle	Robotics	69.98752202111399	-13.44530736254841	172387

A method of synthesising a velocity demand signal as a function of crank position (i.e. cam function) is demonstrated for a prototype mechanism and drive system. The method aims to minimise the peak to peak actuation torque requirements in order to minimise the vibration of the mechanism. First of all, experimental results are utilised to identify the drive system parameters. A dynamic simulation package is used to model the nonlinear dynamics of the mechanism. The model based synthesis of velocity reference cam functions is performed at increasing mechanism actuation speeds. The performance of the system using the proposed velocity demand cam function is compared with the conventional constant speed reference case at different running speeds.	crank (person);demand signal;dynamic simulation;nonlinear system;prototype;requirement;velocity (software development)	Robert M.

In this paper, we present a simple, yet a systematic appoach to obtain singularity contours for a class of five-bar planar parallel manipulators which are based on five rigid links and five single degree of freedom joints – revolute and prismatic joints. The determinants of the manipulator Jacobian matrices are evaluated in terms of joint inputs for a specified set of geometric parameters, and the contours of the determinants at 0.0 plane which are the singularity contours in joint space are generated for the three types of singularities reported in the literature. The proposed approach/algorithm is simple and systematic, and the resulting equations are easy to solve on a computer. The singularity contours for all the class are presented in order to demonstrate the method. It is concluded that the proposed method is useful in trajectory planning and design of five-bar planar parallel manipulators in order to improve their dexterity and workspace.

REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Equine gait analysis has focused on 2D analysis in the sagittal plane, while descriptions of 3D kinetics and ground reaction force could provide more information on the Equine gait analysis. HYPOTHESIS OR OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize the 3D torques and powers of the forelimb joints at trotting. METHODS: Eight sound horses were used in the study. A full 3D torque and power for elbow, carpus, fetlock, pastern and coffin joints of right forelimb in horses at trot were obtained by calculating the inverse kinetics of simplified link segmental model. RESULTS: Over two third of energy (70%) generated by all joints come from stance phase, and most of energy generated was by elbow joint both in stance (77%) and sway (88%) phases. Energy absorbed by all joints during stance (40%) and sway (60%) phases respectively is not a big difference. During stance phase, all most two third of energy (65%) absorbed was by fetlock joint, while over two third of energy (74%) absorbed was by carpus joint during sway phase. CONCLUSIONS & CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study presents a full 3D kinetic analysis of the relative motion of the humerus, radius, cannon, pastern and coffin segments of the forelimb at the trot. The results could provide for a more sensitive measure for kinetic analysis.	gait analysis;joint conference on digital libraries;kinetics internet protocol;relevance	Hilary M Clayton;D. H.

Conventional design method is that one or more actuated joints included in one limb and other joints are passive, then the coefficients of these passive joints baffled the analysis process of inverse/forward kinematics solutions. In this paper, the limb forms of parallel manipulators are classified to two kinds, one is called constraint limb and the other is called actuated limb, that is, the function of constraint limb only provided constraint for parallel manipulator and determine the kinetic characteristic for parallel manipulator, and the function of actuated limb only provided drive for parallel manipulator. The actuated limbs are composed by UCU, SPS and so on. By this novel structural design method, kinematic analyses of parallel manipulators are simpler than conventional design method.

In Part I, the wrench polytope concept is presented and wrench performance indices are introduced for planar parallel manipulators (PPMs). In Part II, the concept of wrench capabilities is extended to redundant manipulators and the wrench workspace of different PPMs is analyzed. The end-effector of a PPM is subject to the interaction of forces and moments. Wrench capabilities represent the maximum forces and moments that can be applied or sustained by the manipulator. The wrench capabilities of PPMs are determined by a linear mapping of the actuator output capabilities from the joint space to the task space. The analysis is based upon properly adjusting the actuator outputs to their extreme capabilities. The linear mapping results in a wrench polytope. It is shown that for non-redundant PPMs, one actuator output capability constrains the maximum wrench that can be applied (or sustained) with a plane in the wrench space yielding a facet of the polytope. Herein, the determination of wrench performance indices is presented without the expensive task of generating polytopes. Six study cases are presented and performance indices are derived for each study case.		Flavio Firmani;Alp Zibil;Scott B. Nokleby;Ron P.

The mathematical foundation behind the concentric structure model was described in detail and a special software to construct the unique structures was developed. The constructed model is based on a unified mathematical model and possesses structural extensionality, which could facilitate the further optimization. The artificial bone model with certain porosity and different concentric fiber structures could be constructed and visualized in the special software.

However, vibration problems are caused by the high speed and heavy duty of the palletizers at the same time. In this paper, we propose a mathematical method to illustrate how the palletizer will react to its moving speed and bearing duty. We analyze the normal force condition of each arm, identify the weak links in the palletizer arm system and establish a dynamic statics model of the palletizer arms in the normal direction. The normal displacement of the end-effector is calculated based on superposition principle and principle of virtual work. The results show that less normal displacement is introduced by strengthening the weak link while reinforcing other links contributes little to vibration relief. Additionally, proper trajectory planning of the motion in the waist joint can help to reduce the normal displacement. The model provides a powerful theoretical basis for the design of key components of a high speed heavy duty palletizer as well.	coat of arms;displacement mapping;matlab;normal (geometry);robot end effector;superposition principle;virtual work	Hang Dong;Ming Cong;Ligang Wen;Guangsheng Du;Yi Liu	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2015.7418983	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	68.67165310852465	-21.568039802623893	174675

These features require regular inspection, which is costly and exposes workers to risk. Because such walls are ferromagnetic, they can be monitored by robots with permanent magnets, and many wall-climbing robots have been developed. However, stable movement of such robots is prevented by their small contact area. Previously, we have developed a traveling wave type omnidirectional mobile robot that uses the locomotion mechanism of a snail. This robot travels omnidirectionally and achieves stable movement through its large contact area. We expect that this locomotion mechanism is suitable for wall climbing. In this paper, we have equipped our traveling wave type omnidirectional robot with a permanent magnetic adhesion mechanism, enabling it to climb walls. In locomotion experiments, we confirm that the robot can move omnidirectionally on a horizontal surface (0°), a wall (90°), and a ceiling (180°).	experiment;feedback;hill climbing;mobile robot;odometry;sensor	Tetsuhide Go;Tatsuya Osawa;Teruyoshi Ogawa;Taro Nakamura	2014	2014 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics	10.1109/AIM.2014.6878211	control engineering;simulation;engineering;electrical engineering	Robotics	75.0180547359374	-22.62790801506599	174781

8b0a04c447b2442068722c60d4c02d5714d4802b	characteristics analysis on speed time series with empirical mode decomposition as vehicle driving towards an intersection		In this paper, we explore the characteristics of vehicle speed time series which described the processes that a driver finishing a specific driving task with different driving operations. Three types of vehicle driving behavior like driving towards an intersection for turn-left, driving for turn-right, and driving for go-straight are designed as a set of real vehicle driving experiments to be carried out on an urban road. Similar to the expected, the collected speed time series of all driving behavior types tend to be non-linear and non-stationary. Therefore, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is introduced to analyze the characteristic values of speed time series intrinsic mode functions (IMF) and residues. After decomposing, there are 4 levels of IMF with a residue exist existed in the speed time series of turn-left driving behavior, as well as 3 levels in turn-right and 5 levels in go-straight. All the first level IMF of three types of vehicle driving behavior have relatively high frequencies which could be regarded as systematic errors of vehicle speed sensors. As the decomposition continued, subsequent IMF frequencies become lower but average amplitudes have different change trends which could help identifying the driving behavior types. All residue curves are firstly monotone increasing and then monotone decreasing, but the occurrence time of residue maximums are inconsistent. Through this research, we can distinguish the driving behavior type between turn-left, turn-right and go-straight with those vehicle driving behavior time series characteristic values and their changing trend. If all those judgment and statistics of characteristic values be implemented by vehicular industrial control computes, it would improve driving behavior recognition or prediction performances of an advanced driving assistance embedded on vehicle.	hilbert–huang transform;time series	Liangli Zhang;Bian Pan	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-38789-5_43	automotive engineering	HCI	77.70328731332786	-15.880529252014547	175275

The condition required for synthesizing a fully isotropic parallel mechanism is obtained on the basis of the physical meaning of the row vector in the Jacobian matrix. Specifically, an over-constrained spherical 3-DOF parallel mechanism is presented and the modified structure, which avoids the redundant constraints, is also introduced. The proposed manipulator is capable of decoupled rotational motions around the x, y, and z axes and contains an output angle that is equal to the input angle. As this device is analyzed with the Jacobian matrix, the mechanism is free of singularity within its workspace and maintains homogenous stiffness over the entire workspace.	parallel manipulator	Dan Zhang;Fan Zhang	2011	Robotica			Robotics	69.5503088139646	-21.255337917687275	175739

The spiral motor is a newly developed high-thrust high-backdrivable direct-drive three-phase permanent-magnet motor with a unique 3-D structure. One of the possible uses of the spiral motor is to actuate musculoskeletal-like structure which is shown in animals and humans. This is achieved by indirectly actuating the elbow/shoulder joints via pulling/pushing the links by using a linear actuator. We describe the control methods for the direct drive of the spiral motor which are the decoupling control and independent control. Next, simulations were performed to assess the control parameter variation effects. Then, the experimental results confirm the validity of the control method in monoarticular position. The key element of the linear motion control of the spiral motor is the magnetic levitation (air gap between the stator and rotor) control and simultaneous angular motion control via vector d- and q-axis currents.	air gap (networking);angularjs;computation;computer simulation;coupling (computer programming);displacement mapping;optic axis of a crystal;r.o.t.o.r.;simulation;thrust	Ahmad Zaki Shukor;Yasutaka Fujimoto	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2013.2262757	control engineering;motion control;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;magnetic levitation;vector control;actuator	Robotics	70.8318074421385	-21.621910803391042	175780

By clustering polygon models of a finger and an object, the contact area between a finger and an object is obtained as the common area between an object cluster and a finger cluster. Then, by assuming the Winkler elastic foundation, the pressure distribution within the contact area is obtained. By using this pressure distribution, we show that we can judge grasp stability under soft-finger contact. We further consider defining a quality measure of a soft-finger grasp by assuming that although the gravitational force is applied to an object, the direction of gravity is unknown. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we show several numerical examples.	cluster analysis;experiment;finite element method;numerical analysis;numerical method;polygon mesh;simulation;space-filling curve	Kensuke Harada;Tokuo Tsuji;Soichiro Uto;Natsuki Yamanobe;Kazuyuki Nagata;Kosei Kitagaki	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2014.6906958	control engineering;simulation;engineering;engineering drawing	Robotics	69.96858683006386	-22.037620281934746	176136

The system composed of a passive static balancing mechanism to absorb high frequency impact and an active closed-loop controlled electric winch to provide the main compensation force. At desired compensation force of 505 N and walking speed of 3.6 kmph, the mean force error and the maximum force error of the presented system were 8 N and 35 N, respectively. The measured vertical ground reaction force data and motion data of the tested subject walking in simulated lunar gravity demonstrated the gravity compensation capability of the system.

d7a9dfd2627b166c19bcdec20a606f86be1ecef2	monopod hopping on compliant terrains	legged robots;hopping robots;contact modeling;field robots;legged robot control	One of the most intriguing research challenges in legged locomotion is robot performance on compliant terrains. The foot-terrain interaction is usually tackled by disregarding some of the effects of ground deformation, like permanent deformation and compaction; however this approach restricts their application to stiff environments. In this work, the foot-terrain interaction is studied, and used in developing a controller immune to terrain compliance. An impact dynamics model is developed, employing a viscoplastic extension of viscoelastic impact models, and used to study the performance of a monopod robot. To include the effects of compliance, a model of the robot that incorporates the description of the foot-terrain interaction is presented. A novel monopod controller immune to ground energy dissipation is developed, which does not require knowledge of ground parameters. The controller adapts to terrain changes quickly, successfully tackles the effects of slip during touchdown, and copes with the problems, which arise during hard impacts, as the terrain becomes stiffer. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the developed analysis.	frequency-hopping spread spectrum;surface hopping	Vasileios Vasilopoulos;Iosif S.

Directly attempting to reduce the apparent inertia of interacting systems through force feedback results in instability. It is shown here that one can introduce a mechanical filter to alter the open-loop system dynamics, making feedback much more effective. Experimental results are presented showing a reduction in apparent inertia by nearly two orders of magnitude.	dynamical system;haptic technology	Mark E. Dohring;Wyatt S.

The main idea for identifying backlash is explained. Measurement results clearly point out the efficiency of the identification strategy proposed in this paper. Thus, the results of the identification can be utilized for the tuning of the controller or for the diagnostics of the actual state of the drive.	sensor	Sebastian Villwock;Mario Pacas	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2008.2003498	control engineering;electronic engineering;systems modeling;mechatronics;resonance;system identification;time domain;engineering;control system;friction;control theory;torque;mechanical system;physics;quantum mechanics	SE	72.1108107026181	-13.71330813815829	178106
668e57dc5bef9168f7626a0a8d33bd28ab41293d	hydroïd humanoid robot head with perception and emotion capabilities: modeling, design, and experimental results	hydroid;mechanical design;humanoid head;pid control;mathematical model	In the framework of the HYDROïD humanoid robot project, this paper describes the modeling and design of an electrically actuated head mechanism. Perception and emotion capabilities are considered in the design process. Since HYDROïD humanoid robot is hydraulically actuated, the choice of electrical actuation for the head mechanism addressed in this paper is justified. Considering perception and emotion capabilities leads to a total number of 15 degrees of freedom for the head mechanism, which are split into four main sub-mechanisms: the neck, the mouth, the eyes, and the eyebrows. Biological data and kinematics performances of human head are taken as inputs of the design process. A new solution of uncoupled eyes is developed to possibly address the masterslave process that links the human eyes as well as vergence capabilities. Modeling each sub-system is carried out in order to get equations of motion, their frequency responses, and their transfer functions. The neck pitch rotation is given as a study example. Then, the head mechanism performances are presented through a comparison between model and experimental results validating the hardware capabilities. Finally, the head mechanism is integrated on the HYDROïD upper-body. An object tracking experiment coupled with emotional expressions is carried out to validate the synchronization of the eye rotations with the body motions.	algorithm;coat of arms;computation;design of experiments;experiment;frequency response;humanoid robot;kinematic chain;mathematical model;naive bayes classifier;optic axis of a crystal;pid;performance;pitch (music);prototype;robotics;simulation;transfer function;velocity (software development);vergence;yaws	Samer Alfayad;Mohamad El Asswad;A.

The proposed wheel has a series of bendable “nodes” on its circumference, each of which is made of two materials with differing friction properties: one material exhibits high friction, and the other exhibits low friction. The high friction section of the node generates a high traction force, while the low friction section enables the wheel to passively slide. The wheels are arranged such that the robot wheel exhibits high traction in its driving direction (much like a conventional tire), but low traction when sliding laterally. Due to this “anisotropic friction” property, the proposed wheel enables a vehicle to realize omnidirectional motion (i.e. the vehicle can move any direction within the plane—forward, back, or laterally). While many other omnidirectional wheel drives exist, the proposed wheel is simpler than any other existing design because the wheel is composed of a single, moldable element. This paper summarizes the design of the proposed wheel and presents a comparison between a small omnidirectional vehicle that uses the proposed wheel and an omnidirectional vehicle that uses conventional wheels.	anisotropic diffusion;rollable display;scroll wheel;traction teampage;wheels	Genya Ishigami;James L.

It first investigates the energy flow in the active lateral secondary suspensions and analyzes the conditions for self-powered control in detail. The impact of the controller design on both ride quality and energy consumption is then used to guide the design/specification of actuators and to define key actuator parameters to achieve both expected performance improvement and zero-energy consumption for the actuators. Furthermore, a control strategy for dealing with larger-than-expected energy consumption by the active suspensions is proposed not only to eliminate excessive power requirements but to ensure ride quality improvement, in comparison to that by passive suspensions, as well. Computer simulations are used to validate the control strategy for the self-powered active suspension.	control theory;lateral thinking;power supply;requirement;simulation	T. X.

The drive uses a new stator flux observer based on the extended rotor flux concept. Due to the simultaneous implementation of stationary and rotating reference frames, the proposed observer does not require any speed adaptation and is inherently sensorless. Unlike speed adaptive observers, the proposed observer is immune to speed estimation errors; thus, its performance at very low speed is improved significantly. A novel stator resistance estimator is incorporated into the sensorless drive to compensate the effects of stator resistance variation. The global asymptotic stabilities of both the flux observer and stator resistance estimator are guaranteed by the Lyapunov stability analysis. Simulation and experimental results at very low speeds, including 0 and 5 r/min, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.	lyapunov fractal;maxima and minima;r.o.t.o.r.;simulation;stationary process	Gilbert Foo;Muhammed Fazlur Rahman	2010	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2030815	reference frame;control engineering;magnet;synchronous motor;electronic engineering;voltage;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;vector control;coupling;quantum mechanics;direct torque control	Robotics	68.75090023839235	-10.627271600399977	179547

This paper describes a prototype pneumatic active suspension system, which was designed and built over a number of years as a sequence of student projects. The physical plant, which models a quarter-car suspension, consists of a wheel, coil springs, a pneumatic actuator for active damping, position and velocity sensors, and an AC motor for simulating road disturbance input signal. An electronic subsystem is used to process the sensor signals which are sent to a Motorola 68HC16 microcontroller-based evaluation board. The microcontroller controls a 4-bit automatic binary regulator which controls airflow to the pneumatic actuator for damping. A mathematical model of the suspension system was derived analytically and validated experimentally. Matlab and Simulink were used to analyze and design a digital state feedback plus integral controller for the system. The digital controller was implemented on a Motorola 68HC16 microcontroller. The controller was able to reject a physically generated 0.01143m negative step road disturbance input. The details of the design construction, modeling, analysis, computer simulation, controller implementation and experimental results are presented.	4-bit;computer simulation;experiment;freescale 68hc16;matlab;mathematical model;microcontroller;microprocessor development board;physical plant;prototype;sensor;simulink;velocity (software development)	Winfred K.

A compensation technique with creating a compensation model of the thermal error based on the relationship between temperature fields and thermal errors of machine tools is one of the most effective methods to enhance accuracy of machine tools. The key temperature measuring points have to be selected before building the thermal error compensation model because they has a great influence on the accuracy and robustness of error compensation model. In this paper, a new method to select the key temperature measuring points is presented. This method involves two phases: firstly using stability analysis of thermal error sensitivity to select the measuring points with strong correlation to thermal error; and then employing fuzzy cluster analysis to further reduce the number of the key temperature measuring points.

An example based on conventional manipulator design is evaluated in some detail and shows that, for kinematic models of some complexity, the NE approach is as fast as other techniques based on Lagrangian methods for deriving closed form dynamical equations.	euler;newton;recursion;time-scale calculus	Morris Driels;U.

The main control scheme is proposed to control the electromagnetic torque and stator power factor of a wound rotor induction generator connected to a local electrical network and mechanically coupled with a DC-motor whose velocity is controlled applying feedback linearization technique and super-twisting algorithm; it is known that the DC-motor can be emulate the operation of the wind turbine. Finally, a grid side converter controller is proposed to regulate the DC link bus located between to power converters connected in “back to back” standard configuration, applying linearization by block control and super-twisting algorithm. The performance of the designed controllers for the DC motor-WR induction generator group is validated through real time implementation.	algorithm;nonlinear system;r.o.t.o.r.;real-time computing;torque;velocity (software development)	Onofre A.

Contact of the ball/surface rolling interface in the rolling guides was simulated as a three-dimensional membrane element without thickness. By introducing Hertzian contact theory and applying proper normal/shear stiffness to such contact elements in the overall finite element model, dynamic behaviors of linear guides affected by preload were thus investigated. In the finite element procedure, three contact models, 1D point-to-point, 2D point-to-point and 3D surface-to-surface, were sequentially introduced for purpose of verification with experiments. As a validation in this project, vibrational experiments on linear guides with different preloads were conducted and related frequency spectrums were derived. Both the finite element and the experimental results reveal that the natural frequency of a linear guide increases with the increment of the preload. In addition, the dynamic characteristics predicted by finite element analysis agree well with those measured from instrumental experiments. The proposal of current study may provide an alternate and reliable way for understanding of the dynamic characteristic of the rolling contact components in machine design field. © 2006 IMACS.

In contact transition, phase transition can be divided into two definitely different phases, “PreTransition Phase” and “Transition Phase”. Here we define the “PreRansition Phose” and we propose three control methods. First, we propose a novel controller named as “Suppression Controller” which is not only stable but also simple to implement. Second, we present passive damper named as “Flexible-Damped Joint” which is a good solution to circumvent the pre-transition phase. Third, we suggest a stable and simple controller which can maximize joint damping and minimize recontact velocity in the flexible-damped joint. It is named as “Joint Damping Controller”. The effectiveness of these three approaches are verified via experiments using “POSTECH 1 DOF DD ARM”.	dd (unix);experiment;velocity (software development);zero suppression	Nakju Lett Doh;Gyudong Jeon;Wan Kyun Chung;Youngil Youm	2000		10.1109/ROBOT.2000.846452	phase transition;damping;control engineering;simulation;optimal control;stability;engineering;control theory	AI	72.91435934442899	-18.107165798978475	180253

Parallel manipulators under consideration are of a general form, with no restriction on their structure. Three orthogonal instantaneous motion spaces (IMSs) of a parallel manipulator are identified including deficient, uncontrollable, and controllable IMSs. Based on the IMSs, the deficiency and singularity of a parallel manipulator are devised and analyzed and their remedies are devised. Three types of redundancies of a parallel manipulator are introduced including the redundancies in serial chain, joint actuation, and parallelism. The three types of redundancies are shown to overcome the singularity of a parallel manipulator, as well as to improve either its dexterity or load capacity. >	parallel manipulator	Sukhan Lee;Sungbok Kim	1994		10.1109/ROBOT.1994.351007	pattern recognition;control engineering;motion control;parallel manipulator;simulation;control theory;mathematics;redundancy	Robotics	69.79240823644108	-21.329423527665814	180623

In this work, we explicitly show that this mechanism possesses a completely decoupled compliance characteristic at the object space, which is the important operational requirement for RCC devices. As a first condition to have a RCC point, this mechanism should maintain symmetric configurations. As the second condition, the same magnitude of joint compliance should be symmetrically placed at the same joint location of each chain. An alternative planar configuration with more adjustable feature of compliance is introduced. We also investigate the compliance characteristics of a spherical 3-degree-of-freedom mechanism which has a similar kinematic structure as the planar mechanism. It turns out that the spherical mechanism also has a RCC point at the intersection point of all of nine joint axes in its symmetric configuration. It is expected that these two parallel mechanisms not only can be used as excellent three degree-of-freedom RCC devices, but also can be integrated into the design of a new six degree-of-freedom RCC device.

Virtual prototyping software are multibody simulation software, which require the availability of models of all the vehicle components. The choice of the model is then of paramount importance, since it heavily affects the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results. Conventional models (like linear models) are often inadequate to describe the behavior of complex nonlinear components, so that it is necessary to appeal to different modeling approaches. This is actually the case when dealing with motorcycle suspension systems, given that their most critical part, the shock absorber, exhibits nonlinear and time-variant behavior.#R##N##R##N#In this paper, a grey-box model of a racing motorcycle mono-tube shock absorber is proposed, which consists of a nonlinear parametric model and a black-box, neural-network-based model. The absorber model has been implemented in a numerical simulation environment, and validated against experimental test data. The results of the validation show that the model is able to reproduce the real behavior of the shock absorber with an accuracy that matches or even beats that of other models previously presented in the literature. The interfacing of the proposed model to the ADAMS virtual prototyping environment is also discussed.	box modeling	Alessandro Beghi;Marco Liberati;Sergio Mezzalira;Stivi Peron	2007	Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory	10.1016/j.simpat.2007.04.011	identification;control engineering;simulation;parametric model;simulation software;system identification;computer science;engineering;operating system;machine learning;linear model;mechanical system;artificial neural network;statistics;mechanical engineering	SE	72.31138020482159	-13.449631975422195	181079

In this paper, the design principle and the initial model of CRAMB are introduced. To improve the performances of CRAMB and better meet the engineering requirements, the optimization is conducted on the bearing. Considering the incompatible objectives of the optimization model, the method of multiobjective optimization (MOO) on the bearing is proposed, which can balance these objectives compared with single-objective optimization (SOO). The objectives and constraints are provided in the form of analytical expressions by means of equivalent magnetic circuit whose rationality is demonstrated by finite-element method (FEM). To optimize the bearing efficiently, the integrated optimum methodology is adopted. After MOO process, the synthetical performances are improved, which are verified by FEM and experiment.	displacement mapping;finite element method;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;performance;r.o.t.o.r.;radial (radio);rationality;requirement	Bangcheng Han;Qinjie Xu;Qian Yuan	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2015.2509905	control engineering;magnetic circuit;magnet;electromagnet;engineering;electrical engineering;magnetic levitation;nuclear magnetic resonance;air gap;physics;quantum mechanics;magnetic bearing	EDA	81.2230401133279	-14.266045354074839	181332

Firstly, an experimental system is established. The system consists of an NC jig grinding machine with control device, a force sensor, a charge amplifier, and an FFT (fast Fourier transform) analyser. Over 10 groups of the typical experimental data are obtained under different milling tool wear states and cutting conditions. Then, because the experimental system is a nonlinear dynamic system with some fuzzy factors and too complicated to simplify it into an exact mathematical model, it is substituted by fuzzy neural networks, which are trained by using the above data. Lastly, for verifying the effectiveness of predicting self-excited chatter with the above model, some more experiments are performed. The comparison between the calculated and experimental results confirms that the method proposed in this paper could correctly predict the chatter vibration in high-speed milling.

10ba0394a674bfcd98a8622d566fe0d84a5d9592	advances in capacitive, eddy current, and magnetic displacement sensors and corresponding interfaces		This paper presents a review of the latest advances in the field of capacitive, inductive (eddy current), and magnetic sensors, for measurement of absolute displacement. The need for accurate displacement and position measurement in the micrometer, nanometer, and subnanometer scales has increased significantly over the last few years. Application examples can be found in high-tech industries, metrology, and space equipment. Besides measuring displacement as a primary quantity, absolute displacement sensors are also used when physical quantities such as pressure, acceleration, vibration, inertia, etc., have to be measured. A better understanding of the commonalities between capacitive, inductive, and magnetic displacement sensors, as well as the main performance differences and limitations, will help one make the best choice for a specific application. This review is based on both theoretical analysis and experimental results. The main performance criteria used are: sensitivity, resolution, compactness, long-term stability, thermal drift, and power efficiency.	capacitive sensing;displacement mapping;kinetic data structure;performance per watt;resolution (logic);sensitivity and specificity;sensor;thermal grease	Boby George;Zhichao Tan;Stoyan N.

Energization of the solenoid removes the influence of the plunger upon the lever and permits the seal pin to be spring biased to its closed or seated position. When the solenoid is deenergized the solenoid plunger is spring biased toward the lever and acts through the lever to exert impact force on the seal pin to unseat it.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms	Malrey Lee;Yupeng Zhang;ThaeEun Kim;Thomas M.

The EWOD system is composed of a DIP-mounted die produced via standard microfabrication techniques and containing the control electrodes / competition arena, and a transparent ITO cover slip for grounding.

This pulley can transmit wire tension by transforming itself into an ellipse. By inserting the belt pulleys into the route of wires instead of a complex mechanism, we can easily actualize a flexible tendon-driven manipulator. Internal force among the wires can drastically change the joint stiffness of the manipulator. Compared to other tendon-driven manipulators with variable stiffness, the belt pulley has some advantages such as simple design, low cost, less friction and light weight. Based on the characteristics of belt pulley, we developed tendon driven manipulators. The angle dependency is investigated experimentally though a one-link tendon manipulator. In order to overcome the difficulty of short stroke, we improved the belt pulley and developed a two-link manipulator.	belt machine;experiment	Hitoshi Kino;Naruyasu Okamura;Syuichi Yabe	2004	2004 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) (IEEE Cat.

The parameters of the TMD are optimized by minimizing the frequency-limited ℋ 2 norm of the transfer function of the discretized state space model with force and torque as inputs and tower-top displacement as output. In addition to control design, our model can also be used for fast & accurate simulation for the dynamics of the wind turbine tower. Other advantages of our model and method over previous work are also analyzed.

These radial force waves do not contribute to the torque generation of the machine but may lead to dangerous vibrations. This problem must be especially researched when designing salient pole synchronous machines with a high number of poles and fractional slot windings. At full load operation, the stator winding magnetomotive force (MMF), the stator tooth ripple effects, the saliency of the rotor poles, the induced currents in the damper winding, and the field winding MMF generate a set of harmonic field waves circulating around the air gap. The waves interact by modulation effects and therefore create different magnetic force wave modes. This paper presents an analytical computation model for force waves and compares results with finite-element calculations as well as measurements. Attention is paid to tooth ripple phenomena and reduction of parasitic forces with nonstandard stator winding phase belt distributions.	air gap (networking);incremental funding methodology;maxwell (microarchitecture);model of computation;modulation;r.o.t.o.r.;radial (radio);ripple effect	Georg Traxler-Samek;Thomas Lugand;Mauro Uemori	2012	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2011.2143382	control engineering;electronic engineering;electromagnetic field;engineering;electrical engineering;harmonic analysis;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	81.00024802646907	-14.403117038016378	183703

These coefficients are typically obtained measuring the forces acting on the object using a wind tunnel. Wind tunnels are expensive and not easily available; therefore, their use is limited. This paper presents a new procedure to measure aerodynamic coefficients of spherical objects using an electro-optic device. Forces are calculated from velocity changes instead of being directly measured. The procedure is based on a method to measure the three components of the instantaneous velocity vector at known positions. The main advantages are size, cost and complexity reduction compared to wind tunnels. These advantages open the possibility of integration in production lines for quality control.

The structural capacity of the Frigidarium to resist lateral accelerations generated by an earthquake is assessed by pushover analysis based on a limit kinematic approach. A 3D solid model of the Frigidarium modular section is subdivided into rigid blocks by cutting planes corresponding to the fracture surfaces determined by a preliminary nonlinear FE analysis. The blocks are then connected by rotational hinges to form a mechanism anchored to a base platform that translates horizontally with increasing acceleration. The mechanism, initially in static equilibrium, is eventually driven into dynamic conditions by the inertial forces generated by the moving platform. The intensity of the acceleration at the limit of the static condition (i.e., at the moment of impending motion) defines the structural capacity. A series of tests is conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to changes in fracture orientation and hinge location, and to the introduction of friction between two blocks.

This paper presents a model-based estimation method that utilizes pneumatic trail information in steering torque to identify a vehicle's lateral handling limits, which are defined by the tire slip angle and peak lateral force limits. This method uses measurements available on many current production vehicles. Most importantly, it takes advantage of the early friction information encoded in the tire pneumatic trail. Pneumatic trail decreases as a function of the tire parameters even in the linear handling region, enabling early detection of the limits before they are reached. Experimental results on an independent front steering steer-by-wire research vehicle demonstrate the observer's ability to provide accurate real-time estimates of tire slip angle up to the limits of handling. Testing conditions include maneuvers performed on dry, flat paved road, as well as on lower-friction, dry gravel.	cell (microprocessor);control system;information source;lateral thinking;real-time clock;slip (programming language);sensor;steering wheel;torque;tire-pressure monitoring system	Yung-Hsiang Judy Hsu;Shad M.

A laboratory test-bench composed of electrohydraulic control module, hydraulic steering unit (HSU with steering wheel), steering servo-cylinder, 32-bit microcontroller and joystick supports experimental work. Conventional approach for reference tracking in steering is usually based on classical control algorithms. In contrast, in this paper reference tracking is performed by using advanced control techniques, which can take into account the multivariable nature of the process. In this way a higher closed-loop performance is achieved.	32-bit;advanced process control;algorithm;control system;control unit;cylinder seal;joystick;microcontroller;servo;state-space representation;steering wheel;system identification	Alexander Mitov;Tsonyo Slavov;Jordan Kralev;Ilcho Angelov	2018	2018 41st International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)	10.1109/TSP.2018.8441398	microcontroller;control theory;real-time computing;steering wheel;multivariable calculus;joystick;system identification;h-infinity methods in control theory;control engineering;power steering;computer science	Robotics	70.17314504859691	-11.043202847377753	184034

A unique precapture configuration generalized straight-arm capture (GSAC) is proposed based on the dual-arm space manipulator with a prismatic joint and the corresponding angular relation is obtained. The configuration satisfies GSAC and can reduce the effect of system's angular momentum caused by the impact force during the capture operation and the burden of postimpact control, so it avoids the limitation of joint velocity and actuator torque when controlling the compound (a manipulator with a prismatic joint and an object) and guarantees the stability of the system. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by numerical simulations. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

Using the acceleration response recorded by the vibration sensors mounted on a test vehicle during its passage over the bridge, along with the computed displacement response, the bending stiffness of the bridge can be determined using either: (1) the frequency-domain method based on the improved directed stiffness method with the identified frequency and corresponding mode shape, or (2) the time-domain method based on the residual vector of the least squares method with a fourth-order displacement moment. By comparing the bending stiffness values identified from the vehicle-collected data for the bridge under the undamaged and damaged states that are monitored regularly by the test vehicle, the bridge damage location and severity can be identified. Through numerical simulations and field tests, the present approaches are shown to be effective and feasible.

However, it is difficult to control acceleration of piezoelectric actuator because of its hysteresis characteristic and spring characteristic. Therefore in this paper, piezo disturbance observer (PDOB) is proposed. Because PDOB treats hysteresis characteristic and spring characteristic as disturbance and compensates these elements, acceleration control is achieved. In addition, piezo reaction force observer (PRFOB) is proposed. By eliminating spring force from disturbance, PRFOB estimates the reaction force without utilizing any force sensors. Validities of PDOB and PRFOB are verified by experiments. Finally, experiment of micro-macro bilateral control (MMBC) constructed a master system and slave system is performed. The master system is a linear motor with conventional disturbance observer (DOB) and reaction force observer (RFOB). The slave system is a stacked piezoelectric actuator with PDOB and PRFOB. It achieved MMBC between a linear motor and a piezoelectric actuator.	actuator device component;bilateral filter;drug allergy;estimated;experiment;hla-dob wt allele;hypersensitivity;hysteresis;image resolution;observer pattern;piezoelectricity;quadratic equation;skin sensation disturbance;sensor (device)	S.

In this paper, mathematical model of the feed drive system, including electromagnetic and mechanical aspects, is concluded. To be consistent with the controller design techniques, two different grey-box identification methods are discussed to estimate the model of a practical milling machine. It turns out that the sampled-data control system with a slower sample rate fits the system better than the faster one. Moreover, compared with the model estimated by partial continuous approach, the total discrete-time model achieves better results in the model validation.	control system;fits;mathematical model;sampled data system;sampling (signal processing)	Jiangzhao Yang;Dongjun Zhang;Zexiang Li	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/COASE.2007.4341841	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	71.46679623995163	-13.822509597110107	184900

Experimental results are reported to showcase the correctness of the simulation method and the effectiveness of the feedback control technique to decrease the closing velocities of both the movable contact and the moving iron core that, in turn, will reduce the first and the second contact bounces significantly to lengthen the life span of the device.	closing (morphology);control unit;correctness (computer science);feedback;genetic algorithm;intelligent control;matlab;mathematical optimization;monostable;program optimization;simulated annealing;simulation;switch	Heyun Lin;Xianbing Wang;Shuhua Fang;Ping Jin;S.

In our method, the structure is formed by growing chain of blocks. The growth direction is determined by the rule set and a counter value passed between the blocks. The robots load or unload the block based on a simple algorithm and a local signal from the blocks. Because of the simplicity of each robot's behavior, the structure is locally unstable: the blocks can be attached or detached randomly from the structure even if they have already formed a part of the structure. In this paper, we first explain the mechanism of our proposal. Next we show some fundamental characteristics obtained by computer simulation and small scale experiment by real robot and blocks. We introduce small modification to enhance the adaptability of the system mainly focusing on a reinforcement function of the wall against the external stress.	algorithm;cluster analysis;computer simulation;control theory;randomness;robot;semiconductor industry;swarm robotics;thickness (graph theory)	Ken Sugawara;Yohei Doi	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7353408	structural engineering;simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence	Robotics	71.60506698547222	-23.569148137209087	185417

In this method, the coupling characteristics of manipulator dynamics are used, and no additional mechanisms are required. In this paper, the effectiveness of the method is verified by experiments using a prototype manipulator. The prototype is a two degree of freedom, horizontally articulated manipulator. The first axis is an active joint and the second axis is a passive joint. While the brake of the passive joint is released, the passive joint is indirectly controlled to point control of the manipulator was also presented. The feasibility of the method was demonstrated by computer simulation of a manipulator with two degrees of freedom. In this paper, a 2-d.0.f. horizontally articulated manipulator with a passive joint has been developed. The efficiency of the proposed method was experimentally verified by this prototype manipulator The control algorithm and the design of the control system is also described. 2 . Prototype Manipulator by the motion of the active joint, through the use of dynamic coupling. While the brake is engaged, the active joint is controlled. By combining these two control modes. total position of the manipulator is controlled. The experiments show that the precise positioning of the passive joint is feasible by use of the proposed method. 2.1 Hardware Structure of the Manipulator The view of the prototype manipulator with two degrees of freedom is shown in Fig.1. The first joint is an active joint with an actuator, and the second joint is a passive joint which has a holding brake instead of an actuator. The lengths of both link 1 and link 2 are 300mm. and the mass distribution of link 2 1 . Introduction is uniform. The actuator of the active joint is a 35W The number of degrees of freedom that a manipulator possesses is commonly equal to the number of joint actuators. In order to reduce weight. cost and energy consumption of a manipulator, various approaches have been proposed for controlling a manipulator which has more degrees of freedom than actuators[ll . However, they require special mechanisms in addition to the basic links and joints. On the other hand, the dynamics of a manipulator are non-linear and highly coupled. When each joint is controlled by a local linear feedback loop, these factors result in disturbance. The elimination of such disturbances has been one of the major problems in the control of a manipulatorC2-43. However, the force of this disturbance is available t o drive a joint which in itself does not have an actuator. These factors are utilized in several control methodsC51. As a means of controlling a manipulator which has more joints than actuators without additional mechanisms, the authors have proposed a method of controlling passive joints which have holding brakes instead of actuators by using dynamic coupling. In a previous paperC61, the principle of this method and the condition that ensures controllability of the passive joints was presented. An algorithm for point DC motor with a 1/50 harmonic-drive gear. The motor torque is controlled by motor current. A PWM current amplifier is used. The maximum power of the amplifier is + 7 5 V , + 4 A and 300W. The holding brake of the passive joint is an electro-magnetic type with a single friction disk. The static friction torque of the brake is 12"""". In order to achieve high-speed operation, the brake is driven by an over-excitation controller. An optical encoder is used to detect the angle of each joint. The encoder of the active joint is ZOO,OOOP/R at the output shaft of the actuator.

However some problems such as low torque, large size and narrow rotation range remain. To solve these problems, the employment of an outer rotor structure is one of the solutions. In this paper, we propose a new 3-DOF outer rotor spherical actuator and its control methods. The basic construction and operating principle are described. The static torque characteristics and dynamic characteristics are computed employing 3-D FEM, in which two types of control methods are taken into account and finally verify it by the measurement on a prototype.	finite element method;prototype;r.o.t.o.r.

These simulations, typically used by the pharmaceutical industry, for example Sanofi-Aventis, are based on the description of atomic energies to estimate the interactions between a ligand and a protein. The main drawback is that forces and torques cannot be calculated using a simple derivation.Moreover,when considering flexible ligand–protein docking, it is essential to take into account the delay in the molecular simulator’s response, as it may lead to an unstable bilateral control scheme. The proposed method allows for stable haptic feedback using wave variables. For the operator to feel the molecular interactions, this method builds a local energy model based on the interatomic interactions and on the haptic device’s displacement. The interaction wrench can be obtained using an analytic derivation of the energy model. Consequently, the teleoperation system is software independent, and can be extended to any bio-application, provided that it is energy based. Additionally, it ensures stable six degrees of freedommanipulation, therefore allowing comprehensive and stable haptic feedback. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We present details on the hardware including the actuation, mechanical design, control and sensing systems. The robot has 13 active joints which are all driven by hydraulic servo cylinders with an external hydraulic power supply. The robot is installed with a three-axis active torso, which are utilized for static and dynamic balancing. The height is 141 cm, and the weight is 72.3 kg including a dummy weight stands for the arms. The lightweight design with carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic allowed the legs have the similar mass distribution to human legs. We present experimental results including basic torque control, balancing against external push, balanced squat motions and compliant balancing on a moving platform. The attached experimental video and graphs demonstrates that the fabricated robot has a high potential as a research platform for human sensory-motor control because of its compliance, high torque, speed, range of motion, safety and durability.	apache axis;coat of arms;dummy variable (statistics);durability (database systems);humanoid robot;lambda-mu calculus;motion controller;power supply;prototype;servo;squatting attack	Sang-Ho Hyon;Daisuke Suewaka;Yuki Torii;Narifumi Oku;Hiroki Ishida	2015	2015 IEEE-RAS 15th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids)	10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2015.7363420	simulation;torso;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory;robot control;torque;force;read-only memory	Robotics	72.81279708892917	-23.256935853767047	188417

The system allows multiple multiaxis devices to be controlled simultaneously by a single controller (up to a total of 12 axes in the current implementation). The devices can be moved synchronously or asynchronously. The motion of a device can be explicitly expressed as a Cartesian path in a moving reference frame attached to another moving device for fully coordinated motion with minimum teaching requirements. The kinematics of coordinated motion and the multidevice programming/control schemes are reviewed. The underlying multitasking motion control software architecture which makes these options possible is highlighted. Necessary extensions to the RAIL robot programming language for multirobot coordinated motion, motion multitasking, and tight integration with end-of-tool processes (such as welding) are covered. The modular software architecture of the overall robot programming and control system, the multiple levels of user access and interfacing, and the options for application and system-level software development are also highlighted. Implementations of the architecture on multiprocessing computer systems and recent representative applications are outlined. >		John E. Agapakis;Joel M. Katz;Donald L.

In addition to characterizing the statistics of individual wavelet coefficients, HMMs capture the salient interactions between wavelet coefficients. However, as we model an increasing number of wavelet coefficient interactions, HMM-based signal processing becomes increasingly complicated. In this paper, we propose a new approach to HMMs based on the notion of context.By modeling wavelet coefficient inter-dependencies via contexts, we retain the approximation capabilities of HMMs, yet substantially reduce their complexity. To illustrate the power of this approach, we develop new algorithms for signal estimation and for efficient synthesis of nonGaussian, longrange-dependent network traffic.	algorithm;approximation;coefficient;hidden markov model;interaction;markov chain;network traffic control;signal processing;wavelet transform	Matthew S.

The first method is based on classical PC plus A/D and D/A converters and the second one is based on a microcontroller (Atmel ARM7). Both methods can be used for verification of algorithms for control and identification of processes, modeling of transport processes dynamics using simulation experiments, if simulations run in real time. The application of a microcontroller allows a simple realization of changing parameters and also non-linearity of the process.

420cef4454de02718a0cbf9b96c7df647e014836	regularization of the differential inverse orientation problem of generic serial revolute joint manipulators		Orienting manipulators in robotics are used to achieve the desired orientation of the end effector of the manipulator. These manipulators are composed of rotational joints, and thus inherently burdened with singularities. In singular configurations, the differential inverse orientation problem can not be applied since the Jacobian becomes singular. A regularization method is discussed that regularizes the Jacobian in singular configurations, by first transforming the angle-axis representation of angular velocities to infinitezimal rotation about an axis and infinitezimal translation perpendicular to that axis, then regularizing the infinitezimal translational motion in the new representation. It is shown that the Jacobian of generic manipulators composed of three rotational joints is always regularizable, so methods based on the Jacobian can be applied even in singular configurations. The method is generalized to redundant orienting manipulators as well, and its application is demonstrated on two examples: a 3R Euler wrist and a 4R Hamilton wrist.	algorithm;angularjs;apache axis;dls format;euler;jacobian matrix and determinant;matrix regularization;optic axis of a crystal;robot end effector;robotics	Dániel András Drexler	2017	2017 22nd International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)	10.1109/MMAR.2017.8046861	control theory;jacobian matrix and determinant;euler's formula;perpendicular;regularization (mathematics);revolute joint;angular velocity;kinematics;mathematics;mathematical optimization;robot end effector	Robotics	69.12427565392585	-20.690975474299222	189173

The aim is to block waves in one direction in a mechanical structure, while not affecting waves travelling in the opposite direction. The device is based on feedforward control and its design is proposed on the basis of equations that describe elastic extensional waves in bars. We present an ideal feedforward design which performs perfectly in the noise-free case. However, it has poor noise properties and is modified to be useful when measurement noise is present.

The first employs the LG model structure, the second the basic Maxwell slip model structure, and the third an extended version of it. The Maxwell Slip model structure accounts for the presliding hysteresis with nonlocal memory, but is confined to providing constant sliding friction. This limitation is circumvented by the postulated extended version. In all methods identification is based upon signals obtained from a single experiment. The methods are successfully assessed via Monte Carlo experiments, as well as via a laboratory setup. The DNLRX is shown to achieve the best overall performance, followed by the NLR and LG methods. A simple DNLRX-based feedforward friction compensation scheme is also postulated and assessed. The results indicate that it is capable of yielding effective friction compensation.	aharonov–bohm effect;experiment;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;hysteresis;maxwell (microarchitecture);monte carlo method;nonlinear system	Demosthenis D.

In this paper, the main phenomena characterizing the operation of the spur external gear units are successfully analyzed by means of a numerical model developed by the authors. The model, here referred as HYdraulic GEar machines Simulator (HYGESim), consists of different modules: a fluid dynamic model, a model for the evaluation of the movements of the gears’ axes of rotation and a geometrical model. When performing a HYGESim simulation, these models are executed in a co-operative simulation. Starting directly from the CAD drawing of the unit as input, the simulation tool permits to describe the main features of the flow though the machine and to evaluate the possible wear of the casing wear accounting for a detailed description of the geometry of the internal components (i.e. teeth’s profile, design of lateral bushes).#R##N##R##N#The paper describes the modelling approach and the main potentials of the simulation tool, pointing out how it can be utilized for design purposes. As a matter of fact, HYGESim permits to analyse the effects of the main design parameters on important aspects like efficiency, internal pressure peaks, local cavitation and fluctuations of flow at unit’s ports (associated with fluid borne noise). The presented tool also allows the evaluation of the radial movements of the gears’ axes of rotation resulting from the forces exerted on both gears, thus permitting to study the balancing feature related to a certain design.#R##N##R##N#The paper also presents several comparisons between simulation results and experimental data coming from an experimental activity specifically performed for validation of the presented tool.

This paper presents an approach that requires the estimation of the excitation force and its derivatives at present time with no need for prediction. An extended Kalman filter is implemented to estimate the excitation force. The measurements in this approach are selected to be the pressures at discrete points on the buoy surface, in addition to the buoy heave position. The pressures on the buoy surface are more directly related to the excitation force on the buoy as opposed to wave elevation in front of the buoy. These pressure measurements are also more accurate and easier to obtain. A singular arc control is implemented to compute the steady-state control using the estimated excitation force.

65818917349b38efa005969be9fae4a9f48ab7d5	automatic probe landing in atomic force microscopy resonance modes		Landing of the probe is one of the most critical elements of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). However, it remains inadequately studied. Practical implementations of landing usually rely on operator experience, ad hoc semi-automation, or both. In this paper, a systematic model-based approach to automatic soft landing of the probe is applied to resonance AFM modes.

Starting from a pendant position, the pendulum is swung up to the upright unstable equilibrium con5guration using energy control principles. An “energy well” is built within the cart track to prevent the cart from going outside the limited length. When su9cient energy is acquired by the pendulum, it goes into a “cruise” mode when the acquired energy is maintained. Finally, when the pendulum is close to the upright con5guration, a stabilizing controller is activated around a linear zone about the upright con5guration. The proposed scheme has worked well both in simulation and a practical setup and the conditions for stability have been derived using the multiple Lyapunov functions approach. c © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

There exists a kinematic connection between two surfaces linked through a curved crease that can be used to generate a folding motion. However, due to the interdependency of geometry, forces and material properties the design of pliable structures based on curved-line folding is very complex. To facilitate the design process, adequate computational modelling methods are essential. This paper presents two ways of modelling: a geometric modelling method based on discretisation of the crease pattern and a method based on Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The proposed methods are validated by means of a case study in which a physical model is compared to digital ones. It can be concluded that the method based on FEA corresponds very well with the physical model, proving its potential. The accuracy of the geometric modelling is improved by the introduction of a set of guidelines based on the direction of the principal bending moments in the pliable structure. Furthermore, the case study exposes how the material-dependent behaviour of pliable structures increases the complexity of the design and should certainly be part of future research.	computation;computer simulation	Aline Vergauwen;Lars De Laet;Niels De Temmerman	2017	Computer-Aided Design	10.1016/j.cad.2016.10.002	structural engineering;compliant mechanism;engineering;finite element method;engineering drawing;mechanical engineering	EDA	78.50811509631106	-18.579745489789325	190990

In this paper, a repetitive learning controller (RLC) is developed for cadence tracking during stationary FES-cycling. The RLC is developed for an uncertain, nonlinear cycle-rider system with autonomous state-dependent switching. The stimulation pattern switches across different muscle groups based on the joint effectiveness to produce torque during different regions of the crank cycle. An electric motor provides assistance in the regions of the crank cycle where the activation of the muscle groups yields low torque production. The developed RLC provides asymptotic cadence tracking despite the presence of unknown, time-varying, bounded disturbances. A Lyapunov-like stability analysis is implemented to generate the learning feedforward term and exploits a recently developed LaSalle-Yoshizawa corollary for nonsmooth systems.	autonomous robot;computer recycling;crank (person);feedforward neural network;functional electrical stimulation;lyapunov fractal;network switch;nonlinear system;rlc circuit;shin megami tensei: persona 3;stationary process	Victor H.

8ca6bc4cc7533045eb7a35eaef625f5d55668dd6	proper farm tractor seat angles for the right posture using fem	operator seat;comfort;simulation;fem;vibration;tractor	The uncomfortable seat in a tractor can lead to the operators' discomfort, hence an increase in operational malfunction and even accidents. The attempt is made in this article to determine the appropriate angles of the tractor operator seat as to have a better posture using Finite Element Method (FEM). Here, different angles of the operator seat are compared and the best are introduced for his/her comfort at set position. The test sample is a MF 285 tractor seat the different angles of the backrest and the seat-pan of which are simulated by (FEM) in an ABAQUS software. The output vibration magnitude from the simulated seat obtained from 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2ms-2 at 3-66Hz frequency with three different operator anthropometries are extracted from the software and analyzed. The evaluation of the output vibration magnitude variance at body-seat connection points indicates that the averages of the effect of angles of the backseat and seat-pan have a statistical significance at 5% level. Evaluating the body seat contact points with the 100-115 range of degree, 110 in specific for the backseat and 10-15 deg for the seat-pan indicate the appropriate angles for this tractor's seat to provide operator comfort.	experiment;finite element method;poor posture	Shohre Daeijavad;Ali Maleki	2016	Computers and Electronics in Agriculture	10.1016/j.compag.2016.02.025	structural engineering;simulation;engineering;vibration;finite element method;automotive engineering	Robotics	77.00617686626718	-17.440796676208084	191275

Lightweight linkages of parallel manipulators deform under high acceleration and deceleration, inducing unwanted vibration of linkages. Such vibration must be damped quickly to reduce settling time of the manipulator platform position and orientation. An integrated control system for a parallel manipulator is proposed to achieve precise path tracking of the platform while damping the undesirable manipulator linkage vibration. The proposed control system consists of a PD feedback control scheme for rigid body motion of the platform, and a linear velocity feedback control scheme applied to piezoelectric actuators to damp unwanted linkage vibrations. In this paper, we apply the proposed vibration suppression algorithm to two different types of piezoelectric actuators and evaluate their respective performances. The two piezoelectric actuators are (i) a PVDF layer applied to the flexible linkage and (ii) PZT actuator segments also applied to the linkage. Simulation results show that both piezoelectric actuators achieve good performance in vibration attenuation of the planar parallel manipulator. The dynamics of the planar parallel platform are selected such that the linkages have considerable flexibility, to better exhibit the effects of the vibration damping control system proposed.	parallel manipulator;piezoelectricity	Bongsoo Kang;James K.

The factors which significantly affect the axle temperature are screened out by using the stepwise regression analysis and the prediction equation of the axle temperature is established, so as to compare the predicted data and the measured data. The validity of the coefficients in the equation is verified through R-squared, F test and T test. The experiment shows that R-squared is between 0.81 and 0.93, indicating a high degree of fitting prediction equations, and F test results show that the overall equation is significantly better. The results of T test indicate that the velocity, the carrying capability and the ambient temperature have significant influence on the change of axle temperature. But the traction and the power of traction have less effect. The result shows that this method can reflects the variation trend of axle temperature, which can provide support to the operation and maintenance of axle.	coefficient;projection screen;stepwise regression;traction teampage;velocity (software development)	Weigang Ma;Siyu Tan;Xinhong Hei;Jinwei Zhao;Guo Xie	2016	2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)	10.1109/CIS.2016.0094	axle;simulation;temperature measurement;mathematical model;statistics	SE	76.80460490987097	-17.16563745595173	191547

However, rescue robots cannot approach the rubble due to safety risks. This study proposes a remote vertical exploration system for collapsed buildings with a robotic inspection system hoisted by a crane. An Active Scope Camera (ASC) has many advantages for the vertical exploration such as a light and flexible continuum body to produce distributed driving forces. The purpose of this paper is to confirm the feasibility of the vertical exploration system with the ASC. The vertical explorations have proper problems related to contact and hanging conditions of the scope cable. We developed a new ASC that has a two-step bending mechanism to produce larger head movement in multi-DOF. We also evaluated the performances of the prototype when the contact areas were small. Finally, we conducted a remote vertical exploration experiments at the simulated collapsed building in 6 m height. The robot could explore in six different pathways by changing head directions and running the rubbles within seven trials. The experimental results showed that the proposed system has high potential to get inserted in the deep area in the rubble.	experiment;performance;prototype;requirement;robot;robotic arm;ti advanced scientific computer;triune continuum paradigm	Junichi Fukuda;Masashi Konyo;Eijiro Takeuchi;Satoshi Tadokoro	2014	2014 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2014.6942810	computer vision;simulation;engineering;remote sensing	Robotics	75.45266467568193	-23.03192399510378	191574

Specifically, we focus on establishing the criteria for designing for an automated system for singulating and orienting the birds for subsequent transferring to a moving shackle line. Since both the mechanical forces and the bird’s natural reflexes contribute to the overall dynamics as the bird passes through the singulator, an experimental prototype singulator has been developed to facilitate the study of bird’s natural reflexes to mechanical singulation. The system has been experimentally demonstrated and evaluated with live birds at the Gold Kist research farm and at a poultry-processing plant in Georgia. It is expected that the results will provide significant insights to the design and control of future mechanical singulators.	emoticon;experiment;prototype;randomness;singulation	Kok-Meng Lee;Rishi Gogate;Richard Carey	1998		10.1109/ROBOT.1998.680956	gold;poultry farming;simulation;engineering;food processing;automation;feather;process control;prototype;contamination;water pollution	Robotics	74.32903987589019	-20.371130979082945	192189

In this paper, the nonlinear damping force model is made to identify the properties of the ER damper using higher order spectrum. The higher order spectral analysis is used to investigate the nonlinear frequency coupling phenomena with the damping force signal according to the sinusoidal excitation of the damper. Also, this paper presents an inverse model of the ER damper, i.e., the model can predict the required voltage so that the ER damper can produce the desired force for the requirement of vibration control of vehicle suspension systems. The inverse model is constructed by using a multi-layer perceptron neural network. A quarter-car suspension model is considered in this paper for analysis and simulation. Simulation results show that the proposed inverse model of ER damper can obtain control voltage of ER damper for required damping force.	erdős–rényi model	Jeongmok Cho;Taegeun Jung;Donghyeon Kim;Joongseon Joh	2006	Int.

The crawler mechanism is of circular cross-section and has active rolling axes at the center of the circles. Conventional crawler mechanisms can support massive loads, but cannot produce sideways motion. Additionally, previous crawler edges sink undesirably on soft ground, particularly when the vehicle body is subject to a sideways tilt. The proposed design solves these drawbacks by adopting a circular cross-section crawler. A prototype has been developed to illustrate the concept. Motion experiments confirm the novel properties of this mechanism: sideways motion and robustness against edge-sink.

It is designed in order to overcome the singularity configuration of planar manipulators. Manipulators are composed of five rigid links, five revolute joints and two actuators each actuating two of input links coordinated fashion, what we term coupled kinematics. Coupled kinematics is an actuating arrangement. It may be defined as a pair of axial rotations, which are distributed by an actuator at varieties of parameters, which depend transmission ratios of mechanism. Using the geometrical approach, the position of end-effector is obtained. Matching the velocity of endeffector from two branches, the input and output velocities relation can be derived. Considering the coupled kinematics effects, Jacobian matrix is determined. We show that, by mean of proper tuning of the parameters of coupled kinematics, the singularity manifold can be substantially simplified. Finally, note that kinematic coupling can be implemented using mechanical or electronic hardware.	electronic hardware;emitter-coupled logic;input/output;jacobian matrix and determinant;robot end effector;technological singularity;velocity (software development)	Theingi;Chuan Li;I-Ming Chen;Jorge Angeles	2002		10.1109/ICARCV.2002.1234855	kinematics equations;jacobian matrix and determinant;control engineering;robot end effector;computer science;artificial intelligence;inverse kinematics;control theory;mathematics;robot kinematics;actuator	Robotics	69.53156678864572	-21.126837598709404	193653

Chamber pressure changes in the system are determined by the mass flow rates during the processes of charging and discharging. Here, a sliding mode controller with an asymmetric compensator based on average mass flow rate is designed for accurate vacuum pressure tracking. The controller output signal is converted into the duty cycles of the high-speed on-off valves via a pulse width modulation pulsing scheme. Owing to the extreme asymmetry of the processes, an asymmetric structure comprising one high-speed on-off valve in the charging unit and three high-speed on-off valves in the discharging unit is applied to weaken the impact of asymmetry. In addition, an asymmetric compensator is also designed to modify the pulse width modulation pulsing scheme to further eliminate the asymmetry.

The constraint of having positive cable tensions ensuring the equilibrium of the platform has to be satisfied within the given workspace. The proposed algorithm is based on interval analysis, which covers the entire workspace and hence guarantees a singularity-free workspace. Furthermore, the algorithm is capable of finding all possible solutions for this problem and an optimal one is selected according to the user-defined criterion. Two examples are selected to show the efficiency of the developed algorithm in solving this complex problem. The first one deals with the design of a planar CDPM and the second one considers a spatial CDPM. In both cases, the algorithm succeeded to find all possible designs from which the designer can select a solution that fits best his application.	interval arithmetic;workspace	Houssein Lamine;Sami Bennour;Lotfi Ben Romdhane	2016	Advanced Robotics	10.1080/01691864.2016.1142897	control engineering;multidisciplinary design optimization;simulation;computer science;engineering drawing	Robotics	71.38980769331263	-20.601708594616806	193752
155fdf531ecce35a245a29b1061ed721ac60249f	wing design studies for small submersible-launched uavs		Submersible-launched UAVs can take advantage of the better stealth characteristics of lying underwater prior to deployment and extended range as a surrogate attached to a mothership. These designs, however, are still very much a concept in development due to the various challenges of operating efficiently in both water and air. This paper analyses the key that allows such designs to efficiently transit from the launch vehicle to the surface: the sizing and methods for wing-folding, and proposes a new concept for retractable wings of such aquaticaerial vehicles based on a compliant material based wing frame structure.	software deployment;stealth;unmanned aerial vehicle	Yu Herng Tan;Bin Han Liew;Xiaodong Liu;Ben M.

We assume linear torsion springs in the joints and between the knee and the ankle joint. Using experimental data of the leg dynamics we compute how the spring parameters (stiffness and rest angles) change during gait cycle. We found that during contact the joints reveal elasticity with strongly changing parameters and compare the changes of different parameters for different spring arrangements. The results may help to design and improve biologically inspired spring mechanisms with adjustable parameters.	elasticity (data store);torsion (gastropod)	Stephan Peter;Sten Grimmer;Susanne W.

In order to adapt various contact conditions, an adaptable fuzzy force control scheme has been proposed to improve the performance. The ability of the adaptable force control system is achieved by tuning the scaling factor of the fuzzy logic controller (FLC). A Mitsubishi MELFA RV-M1 industrial robot equipped with a BL Force/Torque sensor is utilized for implementing the hierarchical fuzzy force control system.

e749738dda42c7239eb75b1a124822e4ba39f9fb	design and implementation of multiaxial force sensing gripper fingers		This paper focuses on the integration of elementary force sensors into the fingers of parallel grippers. The theory of the approach of integrating three sensor elements into a gripper finger is described and the results of the practical evaluations are given. Strain gauges are used as elementary sensor elements. Two different design approaches are evaluated. The first one uses H-shaped cut-outs to weaken the structure at designated areas. The measurement accuracy of this system is compared with a second approach without cut-outs, which is easier to manufacture. Finite element analysis is used in both approaches to simulate the behaviour and to determine the best locations for strain gauge application. The performances of both design concepts are experimentally evaluated. It can be seen that the results of the finite-element analysis are correct and that a satisfactory decoupling of the basic sensors can be achieved using a physical or mathematical approach. Both prototypes are able to measure the gripping force with sufficient accuracy.	robot end effector	Sebastian Hogreve;Kirsten Tracht	2014	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-014-0563-x	structural engineering;control engineering;engineering;engineering drawing	HCI	73.66229416902988	-21.791354277238046	194427
48d8f87c85348964e5ee465fe437a5542afbcfdc	improving compressor surge performance with advanced control	compressor;advanced control;load capacity;radial bearing;active magnetic bearing	Single stage compressors supported in magnetic bearings are known to exhibit compromised capacity to handle loads associated with compressor surge and stall – generally in a frequency range from about 10 Hz to 100 Hz. The present work explores the premise that this reduced capacity is an artifact of the choice of PID control for the magnetic bearings, rather than something fundamental to magnetic bearing physics. A case study of a machine similar to a chiller compressor was used to compare performance achieved with two kinds of PID control (local control versus tilt/translate control) to that achieved with a generalized, multiple-input multiple-output control approach, such as H-infinity. It was found that H-infinity could readily achieve between two and three times the load rejection of PID in the frequency range associated with surge and stall, nearly reaching the theoretical capacity limit in that range. The more common approach of simply increasing the physical size of the bearings was also examined, and it was found (as expected) that a 40 percent increase in bearing size yielded roughly a 40 percent increase in capacity. More importantly, it was found that the smaller bearing with the better control algorithm substantially outperformed the larger bearing with conventional PID control. These observations provide motive to more strongly consider advanced MIMO control methods for active magnetic bearings.	advanced process control;algorithm;centrifugal governor;frequency band;mimo;pid;rejection sampling	Emil Kurvinen;Roger Fittro;Eric Maslen	2016	J.

The closed-form inverse and forward kinematic equations are established. Secondly, based on hierarchical modeling idea, velocity and acceleration analytical equation are deduced. Finally, all the kinematic equations are validated on a virtual prototype with the ADAMS software package. An interesting result is found that there exits only a weak coupling between main motions of the manipulator, which is very valuable for the decoupling controller design of the manipulator in further study. The researches in this paper aim at motion planning and automation for the heavy-duty manipulator in an integrated open-die forging centre.	coupling (computer programming);motion planning;prototype;velocity (software development)	Wenhua Ding;Hua Deng;Jianming Hu	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33503-7_30	kinematic chain;control engineering;parallel manipulator;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	70.02688546705825	-20.712346091552128	194667

So the reutilisation for other parts is restricted and associated with high effort for manual changeover. The presented poster shows a flexible gripping system with the possibility of self-adaptation to different workpieces. The adaptation is based on a robot-guided gripping system having a large number of passive joints without motion drives. These passive joints are normally fixed during operation and can be released in case of reconfiguration. The robot trajectory to reconfigure the gripping system is calculated using the 3D CAD data of the part. Restraints during the robot reconfiguration will be compensated with a sensor-controlled algorithm.	industrial robot	Torsten Felsch;Christian Herker	2010			control engineering;mobile robot;embedded system;simulation;robot control;robot kinematics	Robotics	71.98102500753917	-22.943151650206314	194749

One of them is reliable and safe operation without sensor of the rotor position. To fulfill this requirement, we propose a sensorless vector control allowing drive operation with maximum available torque. The proposed sensorless rotor position estimation utilizes natural ac components of the rotor field excitation current. This component acts as a modulation signal, which has measurable effect on the stator currents and can be used to estimate the actual position of the rotor. We investigate two techniques for identification of the rotor position: The phase-lock loop and the extended Kalman filter. Both techniques are able to estimate the rotor position and magnetic polarity. However, the Kalman filter offers faster convergence and higher accuracy. It is able to provide reliable rotor position estimation in the whole speed range of the drive. Proper function of the introduced control algorithm is verified by simulations and experiments made on a developed small-scale prototype of a mine hoist drive of rated power of 10 kW.	algorithm;experiment;extended kalman filter;javascript syntax;modulation;phase-locked loop;prototype;r.o.t.o.r.;simulation;synchronous circuit	David Uzel;Zdenek Peroutka;V&#x00E1;clav &#x0160;m&#x00ED;dl;Tom&#x00E1;&#x0161; Ko&#x0161;an;Karel Zeman	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2740818	rotor (electric);synchronous motor;control engineering;control theory;wound rotor motor;engineering;extended kalman filter;vector control;stator;hoist (device);excitation	Robotics	72.87064865364515	-13.779976972150315	194795

Using Lyapunov-Krasovskii-like functional, asymptotic tracking property of the position and velocity of the master-slave closed-loop systems with symmetric and unsymmetric time varying communication delays are developed.

The sensor is designed to be fitted to the wrist of a robot and used to acquire parts from a stack or a tray. The initial coordinates of the parts need only be approximately known (say to ±25 mm and ±45°). The robot is thus said to operate in a """"semi-ordered"""" environment which can be realised inexpensively as accurate pallets, fixtures or other parts presentation equipment are not required. Furthermore, the absence of complete disorder, as would exist with a """"bin-picking"""" approach where parts are allowed to lie at random in a bin, reduces the degree of sophistication demanded of the sensor system. Consequently, the cost of the latter can also be kept low. The proposed sensor has a circular platform mounted on the shaft of a motor such that the shaft is normal to the platform. The part whose location is to be determined is held on the platform by magnetic or other means. The assembly consisting of the part, platform and motor is constrained to vibrate about an axis parallel to the platform. Two methods for computing the location of the part relative to the platform are described. Both methods require the natural frequencies of vibration of the part-platform-motor assembly for various angular positions of the platform. A simulation study to examine the effect of various design and operational parameters (inertias of the platform and part, stiffness of the spring restraining the movements of the vibrating assembly, location of part on platform, accuracy of frequency measurements) on the accuracy of the location computed is presented. The simulation results clearly demonstrate the feasibility of the sensor."""	angularjs;apache axis;robot;semiconductor industry;sensor;simulation	D. T. Pham;M. W. M. G.

The modified CD optical head provides the defocusing signal from the tested surface. The defocusing signal is then used to drive the PZT via a feedback controller. The focus spot of the optical head follows the displacement of the tested surface through the movement of the PZT. The displacement or the profile of the tested surface can be obtained through three ways with different accuracy: the integration of the focus error signal (FES), the curve of driving voltage to expansion distance of the PZT or a secondary sensing device of displacement. The resolution of the system can reach lOnm and the accuracy is 0.05p.m. Some design considerations such as the control algorithm of focus servo and error analysis of the system are addressed in this paper. The measurement system and the sensor based on the CD pickup can also be applied to position sensing for robot as well as the non-contact probe for localization.	algorithm;bing translator;control theory;displacement mapping;error analysis (mathematics);internationalization and localization;piezoelectricity;servo;shin megami tensei: persona 3;system of measurement	Ji-Hua Zhang;Lilong Cai	1997		10.1109/ROBOT.1997.606711	control engineering;electronic engineering;adaptive control;computer science;engineering;control system;system of measurement;control theory;optics	Robotics	78.84305265428243	-19.57755596445271	195992

We show that zero-torsion motion types admit simple representations under canonical coordinates of the first kind of the special Euclidean group SE(3). Using the proposed representation, we give a classification of zero-torsion PKMs. The synthesis condition for several well known zero-torsion PKMs are correctly identified.

The closed-form solution leads directly to simple analytic formulas for the singular values of the manipulator Jacobian in terms of geometric design parameters. This makes it possible to easily design the local kinematics so that they meet desired specifications. Explicit formulas for designing the wrench/twist capabilities, achieving isotropy, maximizing the volume of achievable motions, and maximizing the minimum singular values are derived. Applications include design of generalized Gough-Stewart platforms (GSPs) and other parallel machines. To illustrate the power of the theory, the new methods are used to redesign an actual manipulator currently in use on the International Space Station (ISS). Unlike the existing manipulator, the new design is kinematically decoupled, isotropic, and fault tolerant - all highly desirable properties, especially in aerospace applications.	fault tolerance;geometric design;jt (visualization format);jt storage;jacobian matrix and determinant;paint tool sai	Anthony A.

The growing string method using internal coordinates has proven to be highly effective for the study of molecular, gas phase reactions, but difficulties in choosing a suitable coordinate system for periodic systems has prevented its use for surface chemistry. New developments are therefore needed, and presented herein, to handle surface reactions which include atoms with large coordination numbers that cannot be treated using standard internal coordinates. The double-ended and single-ended growing string methods are implemented using a hybrid coordinate system, then benchmarked for a test set of 43 elementary reactions occurring on surfaces. These results show that the growing string method is at least 45% faster than the widely used climbing image-nudged elastic band method, which also fails to converge in several of the test cases. Additionally, the surface growing string method has a unique single-ended search method which can move outward from an initial structure to find the intermediates, transition states, and reaction paths simultaneously. This powerful explorative feature of single ended-growing string method is demonstrated to uncover, for the first time, the mechanism for atomic layer deposition of TiN on Cu(111) surface. This reaction is found to proceed through multiple hydrogen-transfer and ligand-exchange events, while formation of H-bonds stabilizes intermediates of the reaction. Purging gaseous products out of the reaction environment is the driving force for these reactions. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.		Mina Jafari;Paul M.

f24e115213fff643cdb3f0f056ae24f8e6d59328	an adaptive sliding mode control for trajectory tracking of a self-reconfigurable robotic system		This paper presents the development of the model, dynamics and an adaptive sliding mode control of new self-reconfigurable robotic systems. These robotic systems combine as many properties of different open kinematic structures as possible and can be used for a variety of applications. The kinematic design parameters, i.e., their Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) parameters, can be modified to satisfy any configuration required to meet a specific task. By varying the joint twist angle parameter (configuration parameter), the presented model is reconfigurable to any desired open kinematic structure, such as Fanuc, ABB and SCARA robotic systems. The joint angle and the offset distance of the D-H parameters are also modeled as variable parameters (reconfigurable joint). The resulting self-reconfigurable robotic system hence encompasses different kinematic structures and has a reconfigurable joint to accommodate any required application in medical, space, future manufacturing systems, etc. Automatic model generation of a 3-DOF reconfigurable robotic system is constructed and demonstrated as a case study which covers all possible open kinematic structures. An adaptive controller is developed based on the sliding mode approach for a 3-DOF self-reconfigurable robotic system to achieve high tracking performance. This research is intended to serve as a foundation for future studies in reconfigurable control systems.	self-reconfiguring modular robot	Riyadh Al Saidi;Bruce P.

In this work, a novel electro-mechanical layout for a full by-wire management of a motorcycle clutch system is presented, and the related control problem is addressed. Comparing the new system with a more traditional electro-hydraulic setup that was previously studied, it results easier to control and it provides a better riding feeling. Experimental results on an instrumented vehicle demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	modulation	Paolo Giani;Mara Tanelli;Sergio M.

The key feature of RT1 is that all degrees of freedom (DOF) are actuated with only one motor, via specially designed hinge bar universal joints. The mechanism of RT1 which includes a special hinge bar universal joint, bend structure and motion diversion structure is described. RT1 is a discrete manipulator; the discrete working space is described, and the parameter optimization for kinematical redundancy resolution is also studied. In selecting the unit increment of joints angles as an optimizing parameter, the criterion used is to alter the design parameter as little as possible during the manipulator's motion from the initial to the expected position.

A RVE which is a repeating element at macroscopic level is first identified and volume proportions and engineering elastic constants of various constituents (matrix and family of constituent tows; warp, weft and z‐fibers) which contribute to the global stiffness of RVE/composite are next determined. For accurate predictions, emphasis is given to accurate measurements of micro‐structural data such as fiber volume fraction and fiber volume proportion of constituent tows and internal geometry of the 3DWOC structure‐in particular, undulation of z‐fibers.

The proposed approach uses geometric mechanics based on Screw Theory and Lie groups. Both Lagrange's and Newton-Euler's equation of motion are derived. Furthermore, the structure of the proposed set of geometric equations holds the intrinsic robot parameters explicitly arranged like symbolic matrices. The formulation is valid for any branched AMS without closed kinematic chains and whose joints have one degree of freedom (DoF) (revolute and/or prismatic). All these properties allow the use of these equations in different algorithms such as identification, simulation and control of branched AMSs like hands or humanoids. Finally, the proposed equations have been validated and verified with the multi-body simulation software package MSC=ADAMS© by computing the inverse dynamics of a two arm torso of 16 DoF.	algorithm;amplitude modulation signalling system;computation;euler;geometric mechanics;inverse dynamics;kinematic chain;matrix mechanics;newton;robot;simulation software;time-scale calculus;vhdl-ams	Juan A.

These primitives can be combined together according to strategies for assembly in zero gravity environments. Models of these primitives depend not only on kinetential uses on industrial factory floors that require work Iiandling over large areas. Free-floating planar robots are worthy substitutes for fixed-base robots in such places because of unlimited workspace. The factory floor provides a natural base to support floating robots on air bearings.	angularjs;robot;robotics;workspace	Sunil Kumar Agrawal;Glenn Desmier	1993		10.1109/IROS.1993.583912	control engineering;mobile robot;computer vision;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;social robot;arm solution;mathematical model;robot control;robot kinematics	Robotics	73.94097926209788	-22.40287855774674	197825

It is based on the use of sinusoidal perturbation signals and can determine the combined moment of inertia within one sinusoidal cycle of perturbation while the influence of viscous friction is eliminated during the modeling process. It does not need the aid of complex system identification algorithms, and thanks to the elimination of influence of viscous friction, the proposed scheme shows higher accuracy than the conventional method without taking into account. Furthermore, its accuracy is also competitive with the conventional method using complex system identification algorithms, for example, the model reference adaptive system. Besides, the performance of designed speed regulators using the estimated mechanical parameters and the influence of mismatching of mechanical parameters are also investigated.

A new model, linear in parameters, which captures the downward bends at low velocity is used to adaptively compensate for friction. The need for this type of model is mainly motivated by instability phenomena that can be caused by overcompensation when simple models (such as Coulomb friction models) are used as a basis for the friction compensation. This model, in combination with an adaptive computed torque method, was tested experimentally in a robot manipulator.	experiment;instability;robot;velocity (software development)	Carlos Canudas de Wit;P.

Two different algorithms for solving this problem for two different robot models are given. Control goal for both robots was formulated in the same way. Not to fall, the robots have to maintain their center line of mass at center of bearing area. The first algorithm refers to a virtual model with three links and three degrees of freedom. Control of the virtual model is based on a method of inverse dynamics in which the original model is linearized by feedback. For the linearized system PD controller is constructed. The second algorithm refers to a model that is implemented in practice. This bipedal robot was assembled from a robotics kit Bioloid and has six degrees of freedom. To control this robot we use switching regulator. When the angular velocity of the plane on which robot stands is not great, PD controller is running. At high angular velocities of the plane we also add values from gyroscope to this PD controller.	3d modeling;algorithm;angularjs;coat of arms;gyroscope;inverse dynamics;operability;robot;robotics;robotis bioloid;six degrees of separation;switched-mode power supply;velocity (software development);voltage regulator	Dmitry Bazylev;Anton A.

050b7dea25d33465fbe89b77d8896e8ac57f9a2b	stabilization and equilibrium control of a new pneumatic cart-seesaw system	ball and beam;cart seesaw system;robots	This investigation describes the mechanical configuration and control environment for a novel cart-seesaw system. This mechanism is called a super articulated mechanical system (SAMS). The system comprises a cart that slides on the pneumatic rodless cylinder. The rodless cylinder is double-acting with the carrier bracket, on which a cart is a pinion mechanism for the tracks. The cart-seesaw system brings the cart from any initial position to a desired position on the seesaw by applying an appropriate force to the cart and thus adjusting the angle of the seesaw. The position of a cart denotes the first degree of freedom, which is activated by a pneumatic proportional valve, and the angle of the seesaw indicates the second degree of freedom that is not actuated. Consequently, the proposed new pneumatic cart-seesaw system is straightforward to construct and direct to operate in different scenarios of performance. A state feedback controller is applied for stabilization of the equilibrium point of the system. Moreover, this study adds a supervisory controller that takes control action in extreme situations. Test results reveal excellent properties in control performance. The proposed product can be extensively applied in SAMS and pneumatic control for robotics control laboratory.		Jonqlan Lin;J. H.

A single model of the whole system is obtained by a combined physical and phenomenological modeling approach. The combined model for the joint, the muscles and the proportional valves results in a nonlinear, affine-in-control system description. The model is used to derive control laws for an input/output linearization approach to linearize the plant. Modeling and parametrization errors are covered via an outer control loop consisting of a state-feedback which is extended by an additional feedback of error integral. Extensive experimental results show the quality of the model and the performance of the respective control laws.	control system;control theory;experiment;hysteresis;input/output;kinematic chain;nonlinear system;pneumatic artificial muscles	Roman Weiss;Benjamin Grossmann;Marion Leibold;Thomas Schlegl;Dirk Wollherr	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2017.8014001	control engineering;transfer function;simulation;control theory;artificial muscle;parametrization;nonlinear system;nonlinear control;computer science;linearization;pneumatic artificial muscles;control system	Robotics	71.35043636744733	-12.17603553769103	199497
