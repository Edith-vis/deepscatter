In this paper, we focus on optical remote sensing data to propose an automatic procedure to reduce the impacts of optical data limitations and provide the emergency information in the early phases of a disaster. The procedure utilizes a series of new methods, such as an Optimizable Variational Model (OptVM) for image fusion and a scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) constraint optical flow method (SIFT-OFM) for image registration, to produce product maps including cloudless backdrop maps and change-detection maps for catastrophic event regions, helping people to be aware of the whole scope of the disaster and assess the distribution and magnitude of damage. These product maps have a rather high accuracy as they are based on high precision preprocessing results in spectral consistency and geometric, which compared with traditional fused and registration methods by visual qualitative or quantitative analysis. The procedure is fully automated without any manual intervention to save response time. It also can be applied to many situations.	accessibility;adobe streamline;backdrop cms;catastrophe theory;data acquisition;data loss prevention software;disaster recovery;financial risk modeling;geographic information system;image fusion;image registration;logistics;map;multi-source;optical flow;oracle fusion middleware;preprocessor;radar;response time (technology);risk management;scale-invariant feature transform;variational principle	Yong Ma;Fu Chen;Jianbo Liu;Yang He;Jianbo Duan;Xinpeng Li	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8040272	computer vision;simulation;remote sensing	HCI	80.45877951537909	-55.41308223741307	91587

These include the use of radar backscatter to estimate biomass, to employ PolInSAR relative phase for measuring the vertical extent, the use of interferometric phase and a ground reference, or the use of interferometric correlation magnitude alone. Temporal decorrelation is a significant contributor to decorrelation of interferometric echoes and is not always separable from volumetric decorrelation hence contributing to uncertainties in vegetation parameter estimates obtained using just correlation magnitude. In this text we analyze data that is close to the best case scenario for isolating temporal decorrelation. With almost zero baseline and a repeat pass of one day, SIR-C data over the eastern US serves as our case study of temporal decorrelation.	baseline (configuration management);best, worst and average case;decorrelation;estimation theory;radar	Razi Ahmed;Paul Siqueira;Scott Hensley;Bruce Chapman;Kathleen Bergen	2008	IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779033	geodesy;geology;hydrology;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	81.94819235452779	-62.54947752873472	91606

0de7160eb10cfe6c091d82a79510bb246cf1f7f5	cobweb - a toolbox for automatic tomographic image analysis based on machine learning techniques: application and examples		In this study, we introduce CobWeb 1.0 which is a graphical user interface tailored explicitly for accurate image segmentation and representative elementary volume analysis of digital rock images derived from high resolution tomography. The CobWeb code is a work package deployed as a series of windows executable binaries which use image processing and machine learning libraries of MATLAB. The user-friendly interface enables image segmentation and cross-validation employing K-means, Fuzzy C-means, least square support vector machine, and ensemble classification (bragging and boosting) segmentation techniques. A quick region of interest analysis including relative porosity trends, pore size distribution, and volume fraction of different phases can be performed on different geomaterials. Data can be exported to ParaView, DSI Studio (.fib), Microsoft Excel and MATLAB for further visualisation and statistical analysis. The efficiency of the new tool was verified using gas hydrate-bearing sediment samples and Berea sandstone, both from synchrotron tomography datasets, as well as Grosmont carbonate rock X-ray micro-tomographic dataset. Despite its high sub-micrometer resolution, the gas hydrate dataset was suffering from edge enhancement artefacts. These artefacts were primarily normalized by the dual filtering approach using both non-local means and anisotropic diffusion filtering. The desired automatic segmentation of the phases (brine, sand, and gas hydrate) was thus successfully achieved using the dual clustering approach	anisotropic diffusion;ct scan;cluster analysis;cross-validation (statistics);edge enhancement;executable;graphical user interface;image analysis;image processing;image resolution;image segmentation;k-means clustering;library (computing);matlab;machine learning;microsoft windows;non-local means;region of interest;support vector machine;tomography;usability;work breakdown structure	Swarup Chauhan;Kathleen Sell;Frieder Enzmann;Wolfram Rühaak;Thorsten Wille;Ingo Sass;Michael Kersten	2018	CoRR		image processing;region of interest;boosting (machine learning);computer science;edge enhancement;support vector machine;cluster analysis;image segmentation;anisotropic diffusion;machine learning;artificial intelligence	ML	71.80546346458381	-56.40999504217685	92003

This paper presents a spatial feature index, pixel shape index (PSI), to describe the shape feature in a local area surrounding a pixel. PSI is a pixel-based feature which measures the gray similarity distance in every direction. As merely the shape feature is inadequate for classifying HSRRS imagery, a transformed spectral feature extracted by independent component analysis is added to the input vectors of our classifier, and this replaces the original multispectral bands. Meanwhile, a fast fusion algorithm that integrates both shape and spectral features using the support vector machine has been developed to interpret the complex input vectors. The results by PSI are compared with some spatial features extracted using wavelet transform, gray level co-occurrence matrix, and the length-width extraction algorithm to test its effectiveness. The experiments demonstrate that PSI is capable of describing shape features effectively and result in more accurate classifications than other methods. While it is found that spectral and shape features can complement each other and their integration can improve classification accuracy, the transformed spectral components are also found to be more suitable for classification	algorithm;co-occurrence matrix;document-term matrix;experiment;grayscale;independent component analysis;multispectral image;pixel;shape context;support vector machine;texture mapping;wavelet transform	Liangpei Zhang;Xin Huang;Bo Huang;Pingxiang Li	2006	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2006.876704	support vector machine;computer vision;image resolution;heat kernel signature;machine learning;pattern recognition;accuracy and precision;wavelet transform	Vision	72.53670177984081	-61.56820872757626	92283

We have investigated the usage of highrate sampled Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data to measure seismic motion by implementing an industrial robot simulating the displacements close to an earthquake epicenter. The robot arm is tracked by GNSS signals. Two baselines-400 m and 60 km-from the robot to reference stations are used to process the observed GPS data. Both methods give similar (within 0.5 mm) Root Mean Square (RMS) differences between the estimated and the commanded coordinates. The RMS differences are 3.5 mm in the east component, 5.6 mm in the north component, and 8.1 mm in the vertical component.	global positioning system;industrial robot;methods of computing square roots;phone connector (audio);robotic arm;satellite navigation;simulation	Tong Ning;Jan Johansson;Hans-Georg Scherneck;Per Jarlemark;Ragne Emardson	2009	2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417658	seismology;global positioning system;geodesy;physics;remote sensing	Robotics	80.13863134539301	-65.11686776631134	92425

For example, these algorithms are commonly used to classify earth land cover, analyze crop conditions, assess mineral and petroleum deposits, and quantify urban growth. Many vendors of digital images are using or are considering the use of invisible watermarking as a means of protecting their images from theft or unauthorized usage. Indeed, the use of invisible watermarking is routinely considered for use in emerging digital rights management~(DRM) systems that may be deployed to manage and protect the rights associated with satellite imagery, or types of """"scientific"""" imagery~(e.g., in the medical field) that routinely have mathematical analyses applied to them. The concern then is how this watermarking impacts subsequent analyses. Specifically, the invisible watermarking process involves making imperceptible modifications to the pixel values of an image. However, even though these changes may be imperceptible to the human observer, they must be of sufficient magnitude to allow for watermark detection. Because of this, the use of invisible watermarking can also impact the performance of image classification algorithms. This paper is concerned with quantifying the impact that invisible watermarks have on satellite image classification. In particular, Landsat satellite images were watermarked using a number of well-known techniques, and the misclassification that resulted from this watermarking was measured. Experimental results show that even weak watermarking can lead to significant misclassification when common image classification algorithms are applied. Thus, the use of watermarking within DRM systems needs to be carefully considered, with particular attention given to the type of content that the watermarking will be applied to."""	algorithm;authorization;computer vision;digital image;digital rights management;digital watermarking;pixel;statistical classification	Gregory L.

Sentinel-2 is certainly one of the most outstanding systems that will deliver a flood of detailed and continuous data from the Earth's surface during the next years. However, the heterogeneity of remote sensing data recorded using different sensors demands prelaunch activities to develop the synergies for efficient multisensor data analysis. In this context, accurate sensor simulations are a valuable tool that enables a meaningful intersensor comparison. This paper addresses the simulation of the future Sentinel-2 data and products. The presented Sentinel-2 end-to-end simulation (S2eteS) software models Sentinel-2 data acquisition, sensor calibration, and data preprocessing, which are strongly oriented on the real system. Several tests were performed to prove the software capability to generate accurate Sentinel-2 products, with regard to the quality of the radiance and reflectance products. As an example for a large variety of possible applications, the effects of unknown spectral band shifts, sensor noise, and radiometric accuracy on the accuracy of different Sentinel-2 vegetation indexes (VIs) were investigated. The software also holds the possibility to simulate other similar multispectral sensors because of its generic design.	algorithm;data acquisition;data pre-processing;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;experiment;image noise;information retrieval;microsoft outlook for mac;multispectral image;preprocessor;programming tool;sensor;simulation;synergy;synthetic intelligence;test bench	Karl Segl;Luis Guanter;Ferran Gascon;Theres Kuester;Christian Rogaß;Christian Mielke	2015	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2015.2424992	computer vision;computer science;remote sensing	Mobile	79.14280393163688	-62.30815041745638	92550

Design/methodology/approach – At first, according to grey-weighted distance, a new grey relationship model is presented. Second, in order to make full use of the information of grey relationship sequences, the maximum grey relationship discrimination principle is improved and then the soil organic matter content spectral inversion pattern is put forward based on weighted grey recognition theory. A numeric example of Hengshan County in Shanxi Province is also computed in the last part of the paper. Findings – The results are convincing: not only that soil organic matter content spectral inversion pattern based on the weighted grey recognition theory is valid, but also the model’s prediction accuracy is higher; the sample’s average prediction accuracy is 94.917 per cent. Practical implications – The method exposed in the paper can be used at soil organic matter content hyper-spectral inversion and even for other similar forecast problems. Originality/value – The paper succeeds in realising both prediction pattern and application of soil organic matter content hyper-spectral inversion by using the newest developed theories: weighted grey recognition theory.	approximation error;emoticon;hyper-heuristic;nl (complexity);nsb/appstudio;pattern recognition;roland gs	Tao Yu;Xiao Wang;Zheng Yuan;Xiaodong Shang	2011	Grey Systems: T&A	10.1108/20439371111181260	geography;ecology;cartography	Vision	79.66965291275163	-54.8010535114161	92678

A two — component polarimetric interferometric model, designed for geophysical parameter retrieval, is presented for volumetric media over the ground. It is founded on a scattering model based polarimetric decomposition and the random volume over ground (RVoG) PolInSAR inversion technique. For forest vegetation observed at L-band, this model accounts for the ground topography, canopy layer and total tree heights, mean wave attenuation in the canopy, tree morphology in the form of orientation distribution and effective shapes of the branches, surface scattering contribution, and double — bounce ground-trunk interactions. A parameter retrieval framework is developed for repeat-pass acquisitions which aims to estimate and to compensate temporal decorrelation. The parameter estimation performance is evaluated on real airborne L-band SAR data in the repeat pass mode.	airborne ranger;decorrelation;estimation theory;galaxy morphological classification;interaction;l band;motorola canopy;polarimetry;topography	Maxim Neumann;Laurent Ferro-Famil;Andreas Reigber	2009	2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417353	synthetic aperture radar;geology;hydrology;optics;data acquisition;estimation theory;physics;vegetation;remote sensing	Vision	81.70341361299208	-62.73420252561418	92889

The Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI) and the Shortwave Infrared Normalized Difference Residue Index (SINDRI) are two spectral indices that have shown promise for remote estimation of crop residue cover. CAI and SINDRI utilize three and two spectral bands, respectively, rendering the latter less expensive to implement in future satellite sensors. This study shows that while CAI always contrasts well among soils, crop residues, and live vegetation, this is not always the case for SINDRI. A small number of surficial soil samples had positive SINDRI values that have reduced contrasts among crop residues. Some of these soils were biased by SINDRI-positive component minerals. As such, SINDRI is less applicable for remote crop residue cover estimation, even with reduced implementation costs.	sensor	Guy Serbin;E. Raymond Hunt;Craig S. T. Daughtry;David J. Brown;Gregory W.

I. INTRODUCTION One of the key applications of polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (POLSAR) image is classification of terrain cover types. In 1997, Cloude and Pottier (1) proposed an unsupervised classification algorithm based on another target decomposition theory (2).

5b2d582ba6e021a3088039fb9ae8cf4b245e081d	development of a qgis plugin to obtain parameters and elements of plantation trees and vineyards with aerial photographs		Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery allows for a new way of obtaining geographic information. In this work, a Geographical Information System (GIS) open source application was developed in QGIS software that estimates several parameters and metrics on tree crown through image analysis techniques (image segmentation and image classification) and fractal analysis. The metrics that have been estimated were: area, perimeter, number of trees, distance between trees, and a missing tree check. This methodology was tested on three different plantations: olive, eucalyptus, and vineyard. The application developed is free, open source and takes advantage of QGIS integration with external software. Several tools available from Orfeo Toolbox and Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) GIS were employed to generate a classified raster image which allows calculating the metrics referred before. The application was developed in the Python 2.7 language. Also, some functions, modules, and classes from the QGIS Application Programming Interface (API) and PyQt4 API were used. This new plugin is a valuable tool, which allowed for automatizing several parameters and metrics on tree crown using GIS analysis tools, while considering data acquired by UAV.	aerial photography;algorithm;application programming interface;computer vision;crown group;emoticon;erosion (morphology);fractal analysis;geographic information system;image analysis;image segmentation;mathematical morphology;multispectral image;open-source software;orfeo toolbox;perimeter;pixel;plug-in (computing);pyqt;python;qgis;raster graphics;supervised learning;thresholding (image processing);tree (data structure);unmanned aerial vehicle	Lia Duarte;Pedro Silva;Ana C.

cb36d987818a8fd2c7de1dc26bf4cabd6faf7d0d	the physics of ghost imaging	atmospheric turbulence;entanglement;coherence theory;ghost imaging;photon statistics	Ghost images are obtained by correlating the output of a single-pixel (bucket) photodetector—which collects light that has been transmitted through or reflected from an object—with the output from a high spatial-resolution scanning photodetector or photodetector array whose illumination has not interacted with that object. The term “ghost image” is apt because neither detector’s output alone can yield an image: the bucket detector has no spatial resolution, while the high spatial-resolution detector has not viewed the object. The first ghost imaging experiment relied on the entangled signal and idler outputs from a spontaneous parametric downconverter, and hence the image was interpreted as a quantum phenomenon. Subsequent theory and experiments showed, however, that classical correlations can be used to form ghost images. For example, ghost images can be formed with pseudothermal light, for which quantum mechanics is not required to characterize its photodetection statistics. This paper presents an overview of the physics of ghost imaging. It clarifies and unites two disparate interpretations of pseudothermal ghost imaging—two-photon interference and classical intensity-fluctuation correlations—that had previously been thought to be This work was supported by the U.S. Army Research Office MURI grant W911NF-05-0197.

Satellite and airborne remote sensing has been applied in monitoring and mapping seagrasses. One research issue from a remote sensing perspective is the spectral impact of water column depths since seagrasses normally grow in the optically shallow waters. The objective of this hyperspectral sensing study is to investigate the spectral characteristics of Thalassia testudinum at different water depths. The results indicated a close association between the water depths and reflectance, and a much stronger correlation between the depths and derivative spectra.

Recently, various methods have been proposed to incorporate sparse constraints into hyperspectral unmixing and achieve advanced performance. However, most of them ignore the complex distribution of substances in hyperspectral data so that they are only effective in limited cases. In this paper, the concept of substance dependence is introduced to help hyperspectral unmixing. Generally, substance dependence can be considered in a local region by K-nearest neighbors method. However, since substances of hyperspectral images are complicatedly distributed, number K of the most similar substances to each substance is difficult to decide. In this case, substance dependence should be considered in the whole data space, and the number of the K most similar substances to each substance can be adaptively determined by searching from the whole space. Through maintaining the substance dependence during unmixing, the abundances resulted from the proposed method are closer to the real fractions, which lead to better unmixing performance. The following contributions can be summarized. 1) The concept of substance dependence is proposed to describe the complicated relationship between substances in the hyperspectral image. 2) We propose substance dependence constrained sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (SDSNMF) for hyperspectral unmixing. Using SDSNMF, we meet or exceed state-of-the-art unmixing performance. 3) Adequate experiments on both synthetic and real hyperspectral data have been tested. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the experimental results prove the superiority of the proposed method.	dataspaces;experiment;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;non-negative matrix factorization;pixel;robustness (computer science);sparse matrix;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence	Yuan Yuan;Min Fu;Xiaoqiang Lu	2015	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2014.2365953	database index;computer vision;substance dependence;image resolution;sparse matrix;noise;hyperspectral imaging;pattern recognition;mathematics;matrix decomposition;physics;remote sensing	Vision	69.08760620352383	-66.01361454500785	93946

The PCIAS is now a fully operational, professional C++ software package equipped with a robust phase correlation engine, which is among the most advanced technology for sub-pixel image feature shift analysis, and is able to achieve <;1/50th pixel accuracy in dense disparity map estimation. Our experiment indicates PCIAS can generate high quality DEM from very narrow baseline satellite image pairs with view angle difference as small as just 1 degree.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);binocular disparity;c++;display resolution;feature (computer vision);image analysis;oblique projection;phase correlation;pixel;refinement (computing)	Hongshi Yan;Jian Guo Liu;Gareth Morgan;Cheng-Chien Liu	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352501	computer vision;image resolution;digital elevation model;geology;computer science;phase correlation;remote sensing;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	76.83537682960038	-63.62937985056211	94282

6527c8756c3542c26aa0a9fcafaa9013a5cb603b	an efficient vector-raster overlay algorithm for high-accuracy and high-efficiency surface area calculations of irregularly shaped land use patches	edge effect;landforms;dem;vector raster overly;surface area;pixel boundary	The Earth’s surface is uneven, and conventional area calculation methods are based on the assumption that the projection plane area can be obtained without considering the actual undulation of the Earth’s surface and by simplifying the Earth’s shape to be a standard ellipsoid. However, the true surface area is important for investigating and evaluating land resources. In this study, the authors propose a new method based on an efficient vector-raster overlay algorithm (VROA-based method) to calculate the surface areas of irregularly shaped land use patches. In this method, a surface area raster file is first generated based on the raster-based digital elevation model (raster-based DEM). Then, a vector-raster overlay algorithm (VROA) is used that considers the precise clipping of raster cells using the vector polygon boundary. Xiantao City, Luotian County, and the Shennongjia Forestry District, which are representative of a plain landform, a hilly topography, and a mountain landscape, respectively, are selected to calculate the surface area. Compared with a traditional method based on triangulated irregular networks (TIN-based method), our method significantly reduces the processing time. In addition, our method effectively improves the accuracy compared with another traditional method based on raster-based DEM (raster-based method). Therefore, the method satisfies the requirements of large-scale engineering applications.	algorithm;comparison of raster-to-vector conversion software;computation;digital elevation model;ecosystem services;landscape ecology;patch (computing);projection plane;raster data;raster graphics;requirement;time complexity;topography;triangulated irregular network;undulation of the geoid	Peng Xie;Yaolin Liu;Qingsong He;Xiang Zhao	2017	ISPRS Int.

The radar backscattering coefficient, one of the most direct and accessible parameters has been proved to be capable of retrieving rice growth parameters. This paper aims to investigate the possibility of monitoring the rice phenology (i.e., transplanting, vegetative, reproductive, and maturity) using the backscattering coefficients or their simple combinations of multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 datasets only. Four RADARSAT-2 datasets were analyzed at 30 sample plots in Meishan City, Sichuan Province, China. By exploiting the relationships of the backscattering coefficients and their combinations versus the phenology of rice, HH/VV, VV/VH, and HH/VH ratios were found to have the greatest potential for phenology monitoring. A decision tree classifier was applied to distinguish the four phenological phases, and the classifier was effective. The validation of the classifier indicated an overall accuracy level of 86.2%. Most of the errors occurred in the vegetative and reproductive phases. The corresponding errors were 21.4% and 16.7%, respectively.	capability maturity model;coefficient;decision tree;h. h. scott, inc.;persistent vegetative state;radar;signal-to-noise ratio;test and evaluation master plan;verification and validation	Ze He;Yong Wang;Leiyu Dai;Sen Lin	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10020340	remote sensing;backscatter;geology;decision tree;decision tree learning;phenology;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence	HCI	82.38421813557065	-59.51265325237506	94405

We tested our approach using SnowEx data from NASA's Cloud Absorption Radiometer (CAR) over Grand Mesa; one of the largest flat-topped mountains in the world, which features sufficient forested stands with a range of density and height (and a variety of other forest conditions); a spread of snow depth/snow water equivalent conditions over sufficiently flat snow-covered terrain. The retrieved fractional snow-covered area from CAR compares reasonably with a Sentinel-2 image over the same location and demonstrates CAR's unique capability to improve the retrieval of snow properties using machine learning. The retrieved snow fraction parameter from our method is expected to minimize the error associated with the traditional binary snow detection scheme, and improve the retrieval quality of key parameters such as surface albedo.	artificial neural network;cloud computing;machine learning;mesa;snow	Charles K.

The relevant SAR system parameters are discussed and calibrated by using the European Space Agency (ESA) transponders at Flevoland. The resulting accuracy of the slant range images corresponds to 10 m horizontally on the ground. The results are verified by using runway intersections and corner reflectors surveyed with differential GPS techniques. Based on a seven-year ERS-1 and a four-year ERS-2 time series, the long term stability is found to be sufficient to allow a single calibration covering the entire mission period. A descending and an ascending orbit tandem pair of the ESA calibration site on Flevoland, suitable for calibration of ERS SAR processors, is described to allow other researchers to geometrically calibrate their processing systems.

These targets generally cannot be identified by visual inspection or prior knowledge, but yet provide crucial and vital information for data exploitation. One such type of targets is anomalies which have recently received considerable interest in hyperspectral image analysis. Many anomaly detectors have been developed and most of them are based on the most widely used Reed-Yu's algorithm, called RX detector (RXD). However, a key issue in making RX detector-like anomaly detectors effective is how to effectively utilize the spectral information provided by data samples, e.g., sample covariance matrix used by RXD. Recently, a dual window-based eigen separation transform (DWEST) was developed to address this issue. This paper extends the concept of DWEST to develop a new approach, to be called multiple-window anomaly detection (MWAD) by making use of multiple windows to perform anomaly detection adaptively. As a result, MWAD is able to detect anomalies of various sizes using multiple windows so that local spectral variations can be characterized and extracted by different window sizes. By virtue of this newly developed MWAD, many existing RXD-like anomaly detectors including DWEST can be derived as special cases of MWAD.	algorithm;anomaly detection;decorrelation;eigen (c++ library);image analysis;map;microsoft windows;microwave;multispectral image;pixel;real-time clock;real-time computing;sensor;visual inspection;whole earth 'lectronic link;zero suppression	Weimin Liu;Chein-I Chang	2008	IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4778922	computer vision;anomaly detection;computer science;hyperspectral imaging;remote sensing	Vision	71.37546648057337	-64.84111010691524	94966

Volcanic eruptions may spread tephra deposits over regional-scale glacierized areas. In November 2004, an explosive, phreatomagmatic eruption of the subglacial Grímsvötn volcano, located in the centre of the Icelandic ice cap Vatnajökull, produced ash fall covering an area of ∼1280 km2 in the northwestern part of the ice cap. This event affected the surface albedo of the glacier over several years after the eruption. We use MODIS surface-albedo data and an ash-dispersal dataset obtained from in situ measurements on the ice cap to develop a novel, empirically based modelling approach to describe the albedo decrease across the glacier surface caused by the deposited tephra. We present analyses of the temporal and spatial variability of the albedo pattern over the post-eruption period from November 2004 to December 2008. The tephrainduced albedo changes were largest and most widely distributed over the glacier surface during the summer season 2005. The observed albedo decrease reached 0.35 when compared to modelled, undisturbed conditions. In the low-lying ablation area, where strong surface melting takes place, the tephra influence on albedo diminished with time and completely faded out within four years after the eruption. In contrast, at the rim of the Grímsvötn caldera surrounding the eruption site the tephra influences on albedo considerably increased with time. Throughout the rest of the high-lying accumulation area, the influences were scattered in both space and time.	chemical vapor deposition;karlino oil eruption;mass effect trilogy;spatial variability;tree accumulation	Rebecca Möller;Marco Möller;Helgi Björnsson;Sverrir Guðmundsson;Finnur Pálsson;Björn Oddsson;Peter A.

54351b711024a61888f6eca937e2739c465b7d4a	water depth estimation from worldview-2 image with back propagation neural network in coastal area		Bathymetry provides important information for marine environment with various hydrological applications. Traditional acoustic echo-sounding techniques have been developed for several decades which can measure water depth more than hundreds of meters. However, they have their limitation in the shallow area when it is difficult to access by ships. Recent airborne bathymetry LIDAR systems can access coastal area without restriction and can measure water depth up to tens of meters in clear water, but the operational expanse is high. The economic approach for bathymetry estimation in coastal area is optical satellite images. They can survey a large area with single or multiple satellite images and the penetration of visible light in water merely reaches 30 meters. In this study, a three-layer back propagation neural network is proposed to estimate bathymetry with limited number of training samples. The experiments show the mean square errors are less than 5 meters.	acoustic cryptanalysis;airborne ranger;artificial neural network;automatic sounding;backpropagation;bathymetry;experiment;mean squared error;multitier architecture;software propagation	Haohaohb Ren;S.

The purpose of this paper is to present a method that evolved from the current GOES sounder TCO retrieval that can be applied to ABI, with SEVIRI serving as a proxy for ABI. Although ABI and SEVIRI have fewer infrared spectral bands than the current series of GOES (-8 to -P) sounders, ABI and SEVIRI can provide TCO with an accuracy that is comparable to the current GOES sounder by using forecast temperature profiles as additional a priori information. Despite the need for additional data, the greatest advantage of ABI and SEVIRI is their fast 15-min coverage of the full disk. The SEVIRI TCO demonstrates how well geostationary imagers can capture ozone transport and change at high temporal and spatial resolutions. The estimated TCO has very good agreement (R = 0.92 and root-mean-square error = 3.7%) with the total ozone measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard the Earth Observing System aura platform.	application binary interface;geosynchronous satellite;image sensor;maxima and minima;total cost of ownership	Xin Jin;Jun Li;Christopher C.

In particular, it presents a study on the effects and the properties of the registration noise on the change-detection process in the framework of the polar change vector analysis (CVA) technique. According to this study, a multiscale technique for reducing the impact of residual misregistration in unsupervised change detection is presented. This technique is based on a differential analysis of the direction distributions of spectral change vectors at different resolution levels. The differential analysis allows one to discriminate sectors associated with residual registration noise from sectors associated with true changes. The information extracted is used at full resolution for computing a change-detection map where geometrical details are preserved and the impact of residual registration noise is strongly reduced.	change vector;marginal model;pixel;unsupervised learning	Lorenzo Bruzzone;Francesca Bovolo;Silvia Marchesi	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-77046-6_10	computer vision;computer science;change detection;information extraction;statistics	Vision	74.13973875381308	-64.88601668675642	95301

To derive the ice movement of the whole glacier surface with a high accuracy, an integrated approach combining differential interferometric SAR (D-InSAR), multi-aperture interferometry (MAI), and a pixel-tracking (PT) method is proposed, which could fully exploit the phase and intensity information recorded by the SAR sensor. The Chongce Glacier surface flow field is estimated with the proposed integrated approach. Compared with the traditional SAR-based methods, the proposed approach can determine the ice motion over a widely varying range of ice velocities with a relatively high accuracy. Its capability is proved by the detailed ice displacement pattern with the average accuracy of 0.2 m covering the entire Chongce Glacier surface, which shows a maximum ice movement of 4.9 m over 46 days. Furthermore, it is shown that the ice is in a quiescent state in the downstream part of the glacier. Therefore, the integrated approach presented in this paper could present us with a novel way to comprehensively and accurately understand glacier dynamics by overcoming the incoherence phenomenon, and has great potential for glaciology study.	aperture (software);displacement mapping;downstream (software development);intelligence amplification;pixel;quiesce;synthetic intelligence	Shiyong Yan;Zhixing Ruan;Guang Liu;Kazhong Deng;Mingyang Lv;Zbigniew Perski	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8070611	geomorphology;hydrology;remote sensing	Robotics	81.19127787444178	-61.00148099646786	95937

In this paper, we present the prototype of a new processor which is aimed to derive the surface ice parameters on the basis of pairs of space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of the same and of different sensors, i.e. from data of different bands, resolutions, and orbits. The study is carried out on image data collected during a joint campaign with the Office of Naval Research (ONR) in the western Arctic in 2015.

In the framework of the project, this paper shows the first classification results using machine learning algorithms over a two-year period of InSAR coherence data. The evaluation is performed on the test site of Doñana (Seville, Southwestern Spain), mainly an agricultural area where different land covers can be identified. Classification results exploiting InSAR coherence shows accuracies around 80 % for this site.	algorithm;cache coherence;esa;machine learning	Fernando Vicente-Guijalba;A. Jacob;Juan M.

The sea level varies uniformly in a region bounded by the coast and the mean Kuroshio axis, which stretches for several hundreds kilometers along the coast. These variations are related with the Kuroshio velocity, as coastal sea level decreases (or increases) when the Kuroshio is faster (or slower).	apache axis;velocity (software development)	Zhongzhe Zhang;Kaoru Ichikawa	2005	Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2005.

Three public data sets were used: i. Mobile Century data set collected on Highway I-880, near Union City, California; ii. Borlänge GPS data set collected in the Swedish city of Borlänge; and iii. Beijing taxicabs data set collected in Beijing, China, where each vehicle speed is stored as a time series. The Bandt-Pompe methodology combined with the Complexity-Entropy plane were used to identify different regimes and behaviors. The global velocity is compatible with a correlated noise with f Power Spectrum with k ≥ 0. With this we identify traffic behaviors as, for instance, random velocities (k ≃ 0) when there is congestion, and more correlated velocities (k ≃ 3) in the presence of free traffic flow.	approximation;assisted gps;causality;colors of noise;complex dynamics;complexity;dynamical system;global positioning system;information privacy;information source;information theory;interpolation;network congestion;nicoll highway collapse;portable document format;sampling (signal processing);spectral density;stochastic process;time series;velocity (software development);white noise	André L.

It is thus more restricted than conventional MUSIC, but simulation studies indicate that Root-MUSIC (and related algorithms, such as ESPRIT) have performance advantages over ordinary MUSIC for such linear arrays. The receiving array of the University of Michigan's Multifrequency Coastal Radar (MCR) is a linear array of 8 identical loops and thus is a good candidate for experimental study. Four-frequency data recorded during the COPE-3 experiment at Chesapeake Bay, Virginia during 1997 have been processed with Root-MUSIC as well as ordinary MUSIC and beam formation. Directional estimates for a calibration transponder at known locations processed with MUSIC and Root-MUSIC are compared. Root-MUSIC and MUSIC appear to give very similar results.	direction finding;radar	Calvin C.

The extraction of contours, which depends on the encountered texture, is obtained by an iterative filtering followed by several thresholds that generate binary images. The thresholds are determined by different percentages of pixels over the total number of pixels contained in the image. We then trace the limits of the binary forms previously filtered by an iterative majority smoothing. b. The detection of the structures from the contours involves four substeps: individualization of the curves; decomposition of the curves into subcircular elements; application of a version of the Hough transform to each subcircular elements; computation of precise results. c. The computation of parameters that discriminate the detected structures; namely, for each structure, the position of the center and radius of the reference circle, thk number of detected pixels, the chord and the intersection coefficients, the normal direction and the distance between the middle of the chord, and the intersection point between normal and chord. This set of data allows us to select the different families of structures that we are looking for. As an example, the method has been applied to the region of &ru, which presents on both geological and geofhorphological levels, numerous circular structures of varied origins.	binary image;coefficient;computation;hough transform;iterative method;normal (geometry);pixel;sensor;single source of truth;smoothing;sorting;unsupervised learning	Jean-François Parrot;Hind Taud	1992	IEEE Trans.

The STME (Surface Texture and Microstructure Extraction) system is applied to the elevation map to extract the 3-D microstructures. A hybrid application of this system to both intensity and elevation maps results in a complete extraction of individual vehicles. Based on a comparison of texture exploitation techniques, a WCC (weighted combination criterion) algorithm is presented to generate a clean parking lot ground surface, which facilitates visualization and simulation of parking lot activities with a high degree of visual realism.	aerial photography;algorithm;map;portal;simulation	Xiaoguang Wang;Allen R.

Object-level BRDF spectral signatures for an olive green sedan were simulated using a fast, radiometrically accurate 3D rendering model, and the signatures were embedded as subpixel targets of low fractional fill into the HyMap hyperspectral image provided in the Rochester Institute of Technology Blind Test dataset. Detection algorithms based on the ACE detector were run on the scene. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in detection performance when including the target's BRDF variation in the detection scheme through either a subspace ACE or a Bayesian selection (multiple ACE detector) method.	3d rendering;ace;algorithm;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;embedded system;hymap;lambertian reflectance;pixel;type signature	Robert Sundberg;Steven M.

By extracting attributed parameters, polarimetric characteristics of targets can be exploited by performing PTD on the extracting parameters of ASCs instead of pixels in conventional PTD algorithms. As a result, the integrity of target components is enhanced, leading to a reliable analysis on the polarimetric scattering mechanisms of SAR targets. In the proposal, an attributed parameters extraction method based on joint exploitation of multiple polarimetric channels and a target discriminating method based on a constant-false-alarm threshold are developed to improve its robustness in strong noise scenarios.

b43429955f76d80903f4bd18f376fbfaee76b6f9	synergistic use of radarsat-2 ultra fine and fine quad-pol data to map oilsands infrastructure land: object-based approach	oilsands infrastructure land;polsar;radarsat 2;object based classification;mapping	The landscape of Alberta’s oilsands regions is undergoing extensive change due to the creation of infrastructure associated with the exploration for and extraction of this resource. Since most oil sands mining activities take place in remote forests or wetlands, one of the challenges is to collect up-to date and reliable information about the current state of land. Compared to optical sensors, SAR sensors have the advantage of being able to routinely collect imagery for timely monitoring by regulatory agencies. This paper explores the capability of high resolution RADARSAT-2 Ultra Fine and Fine Quad-Pol imagery for mapping oilsands infrastructure land using an object-based classification approach. Texture measurements extracted from Ultra Fine data are used to support an Ultra Fine based classification. Moreover, a radar vegetation index (RVI) calculated from PolSAR data is introduced for improved classification performance. The RVI is helpful in reducing confusion between infrastructure land and low vegetation covered surfaces. When Ultra Fine and PolSAR data are used in combination, the kappa value of well pads and processing facilities detection reached 0.87. In this study, we also found that core hole sites can be identified from early spring Ultra Fine data. With single-date image, kappa value of core hole sites ranged from 0.61 to 0.69.

Under such a circumstance, these targets can be only detected spectrally at the subpixel level, not spatially as ordinarily conducted by classical image processing techniques. This paper investigates a more challenging issue than subpixel detection, which is the estimation of target size at the subpixel level. More specifically, when a subpixel target is detected, we would like to know """"what is the size of this particular target within the pixel?"""". The proposed approach is to estimate the abundance fraction of a subpixel target present in a pixel, then find what portion it contributes to the pixel that can be used to determine the size of the subpixel target by multiplying the ground sampling distance. In order to make our idea work, the subpixel target abundance fraction must be accurately estimated to truly reflect the portion of a subpixel target occupied within a pixel. So, a fully constrained linear unmixing method is required to reliably estimate the abundance fractions of a subpixel target for its size estimation. In this paper, a recently developed fully constrained least squares linear unmixing is used for this purpose. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method in comparison with an unconstrained linear unmixing method, unconstrained least squares method, two partially constrained least square linear unmixing methods, sum-to-one constrained least squares, and nonnegativity constrained least squares."""	embedded system;experiment;ground sample distance;image processing;linear least squares (mathematics);pixel;sampling (signal processing);simulation	Chein-I Chang;Hsuan Ren;Chein-Chi Chang;Francis D'Amico;James O.

4298e0f61bd6651e88bb2c3aef26cff7abc349b6	algorithm for detecting the image of river sediment based on hydrometric cableway	image processing;sediment content;underwater camera	In order to solve the long period of drying method in river sediment conditions, an image acquisition device which installed in the lead fish existing in Cableway river is designed. This new device sinks into the pre-set the vertical position, when the computer of bank workstation issuing control commands, the camera in lead fish started to sample recording in the water, and image transfer to the image acquisition card, and then transmitted image data to the banks of workstations by the ARM. After denoising, segmentation, calculation and processing to images by computer in riparian workstation, the river sediment content is done. The measurement of the river sediment proposed by this paper is adequate for the lower detection (30kg/m), and used in Ji’an Wu River hydrological station. Applying the presented method it is shown that comparing with traditional method the presented method has reduced in time 96% and compared with the drying method error of 1% -% 5, which meets hydrology and sediment survey. Although the method for larger sediment (100kg/m) river sediment concentration measurements still short of expectations, but it can provide a reference for sand measuring.	algorithm;capability maturity model;noise reduction;requirement;workstation	Bing Zhu;Xuyan Zhou;Bin Tan;Xuemou Liu	2011	JSW		image processing;computer science	Vision	77.83541745384602	-61.38247441109653	98109

We speculate that a previously unrecognized dextral strike-slip subvertical fault striking NW–SE was responsible for this event. The coseismic slip distribution on the fault planes is inverted based on the InSAR-derived deformation. The results indicate that the fault slip was confined to two lobes.

Fine grained air quality assessment (both in time and space) is the future. Different approaches, ranging from measurement with low-cost sensors over advanced modeling and remote sensing to combinations of these have been proposed.

It is a real-time ice-sounding imaging method. First, theory analysis has been carried on the proposed algorithm. Then, we give the particular realizing steps to implement this algorithm. Finally, we apply this algorithm to the simulation point targets and real data collected during the 29th Chinese Antarctic Research Expedition to prove its validity of imaging of ice sheets. Furthermore, compared with two previous algorithms in two major aspects—the power of azimuth clutter reduction and calculating time—the proposed algorithm could considerably reduce the imaging time to meet the requirement of real-time imaging of ice-sounding data without degrading the ability of azimuth clutter reduction via C+MPI language on a parallel computer system.	airborne ranger;algorithm;automatic sounding;clutter;computation;computer;motion compensation;parallel computing;radar;real-time clock;real-time locating system;redirection (computing);simulation;thickness (graph theory);topography	Shinan Lang;Qiang Wu;Xiaojun Liu;Bo Zhao;Wenxin Zhang;Xiuwei Chen	2017	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2016.2631278	meteorology;medical imaging;algorithm design;snow;simulation;radar imaging;remote sensing;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	77.44295362038157	-64.54442067318018	98757

The method is an implementation of the anisotropic diffusion process which results in a gray scale image. This paper discusses modifications to the AS method for application to multi-band data which results in a color segmented image. The process was used to visually enhance the three most distinct abundance fraction images produced by the Lagrange constraint neural network learning-based unmixing of Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus multispectral sensor data. A mutual information-based method was applied to select the three most distinct fraction images for subsequent visualization as a red, green, and blue composite. A reported image restoration technique (partial restoration) was applied to the multispectral data to reduce unmixing error, although evaluation of the performance of this technique was beyond the scope of this paper. The modified smoothing process resulted in a color segmented image with homogeneous regions separated by sharpened, coregistered multiband edges. There was improved class separation with the segmented image, which has importance to subsequent operations involving data classification.	adaptive filter;anisotropic diffusion;artificial neural network;circuit restoration;color;gradient descent;grayscale;image restoration;iterative method;multispectral image;mutual information;smoothing;xfig	George P.

These signals can be detected from airplanes, surface platforms and in Low Earth orbit and are known to contain information on the oceans. Recently, a new opportunity to study GPS reflections in space has been realized with the launch in October 2003 of the United Kingdom's Disaster Monitoring Constellation (UK-DMC) satellite. The UK- DMC carries a dedicated GPS reflections receiver and a custom designed downward facing antenna. Using this GPS experiment it is possible to process surface scattered signals and estimate the ocean wind and waves. This paper will present a method for calculating a bistatic radar cross section (BRCS) for ocean scattered GPS signals. This method will then be applied over a range of signals detected by the UK-DMC experiment. For purposes of comparison, numerous data collections have been collocated with National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys. These buoys provide an independent measurement of the ocean wind, waves and often a wave frequency spectrum from which the surface mean square slopes, an indication of ocean roughness, can be determined. BRCS values have been estimated over a range of ocean conditions (from less than 2 m/s winds to greater than 14 m/s winds) and vary generally as expected when compared to buoy measurements of the ocean wind and waves. An empirical relationship between the estimated BRCS and the ocean wind speeds and surface roughness will be presented for a limited set of data gathered by the UK-DMC experiment.	amiga reflections;cross section (geometry);dynamic markov compression;gps signals;global positioning system;lumix;mean squared error;reflection (computer graphics);spectral density	Scott Gleason;Valery U.

As the thematic accuracy alone is not sufficient to adequately characterize the geometrical properties of classification maps, we propose a novel protocol that is based on the analysis of two families of indexes: (i) the traditional thematic accuracy indexes, and (ii) a set of geometric indexes that characterize different geometric properties of the objects recognized in the map. These indexes can be used in the training phase of a classifier for identifying the parameters values that optimize classification results on the basis of a multi-objective criterion. Experimental results obtained on Quickbird images show the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in selecting classification maps characterized by better tradeoff between thematic and geometric accuracy with respect to standard accuracy measures.	communications protocol;image resolution;multispectral image;statistical classification;thematic map	Lorenzo Bruzzone;Claudio Persello	2008	IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4778978	layout;database index;communications protocol;computer vision;contextual image classification;synthetic aperture radar;image resolution;shape;computer science;data mining;accuracy and precision;thematic map;satellite;pixel;measurement uncertainty;remote sensing	Vision	73.01195678537596	-60.45319366963095	99559

In synthetic aperture radar (SAR) despeckling, however, the lack of speckle-free images precludes the use of reliable full-reference measures, leaving the comparison among competing techniques on shaky bases. In this paper, we propose a new framework for the objective (quantitative) assessment of SAR despeckling techniques, based on simulation of SAR images relevant to canonical scenes. Each image is generated using a complete SAR simulator that includes proper physical models for the sensed surface, the scattering, and the radar operational mode. Therefore, in the limits of the simulation models, the employed simulation procedure generates reliable and meaningful SAR images with controllable parameters. Through simulating multiple SAR images as different instances relevant to the same scene we can therefore obtain, a true multilook full-resolution SAR image, with an arbitrary number of looks, thus generating (by definition) the closest object to a clean reference image. Based on this concept, we build a full performance assessment framework by choosing a suitable set of canonical scenes and corresponding objective measures on the SAR images that consider speckle suppression and feature preservation. We test our framework by studying the performance of a representative set of actual despeckling algorithms; we verify that the quantitative indications given by numerical measures are always fully consistent with the rationale specific of each despeckling technique, strongly agrees with qualitative (expert) visual inspections, and provide insight into SAR despeckling approaches.	algorithm;aperture (software);artifact (software development);benchmark (computing);computer performance;design rationale;dynamical simulation;experiment;image processing;noise reduction;numerical analysis;programming paradigm;scientific literature;synthetic data;virtual community;visual inspection;zero suppression	Gerardo Di Martino;Mariana Poderico;Giovanni Poggi;Daniele Riccio;Luisa Verdoliva	2014	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2013.2252907	computer vision;synthetic aperture radar;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;remote sensing	Vision	74.54736050983624	-65.38095447312682	99611

The topographic change has been estimated on basis of 3D laser data and information obtained by digitizing 1/1000 topographic map. All the survey is composed of 5 scans (point clouds) collected by Optech ILRIS-3D Ground Laser Scanner (GLS). The georeferencing was carried out with some natural and artificial targets displaced in the subsidence area. The artificial targets used for this survey, were purposely projected, in order to get the best radiometric response and univocal geometrical definition; instead the natural target were surveyed in a traditional topographic way with a Total Station. This method permits to get a good topography representation. The accuracy is about a centimeter calculated with some control points. You can map the images onto the numerical model. The effectiveness of applying 3D laser scan is proved in this study.

HIRIS is designed to acquire 24-km wide, 30-m pixel images in 192 spectral bands simultaneously in the 0.4–2.45-μm wavelength region. With pointing mirrors it can sample any place on Earth, except the poles, every two days. HIRIS operates at the intermediate scale between the human and the global and therefore links studies of Earth surface processes to global monitoring carried out by lower-resolution instruments. So far, over 50 science data products from HIRIS images have been identified in the fields of atmospheric gases, clouds, snow and ice, water, vegetation, and rocks and soils. The key attribute of imaging spectrometry that makes it possible to derive quantitative information from the data is the large number of contiguous spectral bands. Therefore spectrum matching techniques can be applied. Such techniques are not possible with present-day, multispectral scanner data.		Alexander F. H. Goetz;Curtiss O. Davis	1991	Int. J.

The state-of-the-art System-on-Programmable-Chip (SoPC) technique, associated with embedded processor and other function modules, provides a potential solution to satisfy all constraints. However, with the improvement of processing efficiency and imagery granularity, to implement an entire SAR imaging processing using floating-point arithmetic is unaffordable. Data fixed-pointing is an effective solution, and the core issue is the finite word length optimization under the condition of trading-off hardware resource and processing precision. In this paper, we analyze the finite word length computing error for SAR imaging system using Chirp Scaling (CS) algorithm, and propose a mathematical computing error model. Then, the empirical formula of the system's output noise-to-signal ratio is derived. Guiding by the software simulation result, we implement and verify the proposed method into a Zynq+NetFPGA platform. The run-time results show that the proposed method can achieve a decent image quality assessed by Integrated Side Lobe Ratio (ISLR), Peak Side Lobe Ratio (PSLR) and Relative Mean Square Deviation (RMSD).

1aa50409b70be8bcd8d97e875da0e84344c92307	combinational biophysical composition index (cbci) for effective mapping biophysical composition in urban areas		The current spectral indices for estimating urban biophysical compositions still have several limitations. First, most of those indices can highlight one urban biophysical composition, such as impervious surfaces, vegetation, or water. Furthermore, most of those indices depend on short-and mid-wave infrared and thermal infrared bands and thus have limited availability in high-resolution imagery. Finally, the separability between impervious surfaces and bare soil still needs to improve. Therefore, this paper proposed a combinational biophysical composition index (CBCI) for effective highlighting the four-major urban biophysical compositions. Correlation analyses were performed to estimate the relationship between the CBCI values and biophysical compositions, and the spectral discrimination index (SDI) was conducted to test the separability degree between impervious surfaces and bare soil. Moreover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference building index, BCI, and the combinational build-up index were utilized to perform the comparative analyses. Moreover, this paper investigated the applicability of the CBCI in different spatial resolution remote sensing images. Our results indicated that the CBCI had a much closer relationship with impervious surface fraction than the other four indices and had a stronger correlation with vegetation abundances when compared with the NDVI. In addition, the CBCI had much higher SDI values than the other indices. This paper proved that the CBCI was an effective index for highlighting the four-major urban biophysical compositions and had good performance for separating impervious surfaces and bare soil.	book citation index;combinational logic;image resolution;limited availability;linear separability;stellar classification	Shaohua Zhang;Kun Yang;Mingchan Li;Yuling Ma;Mengzhu Sun	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2857405	computer science;distributed computing;vegetation;normalized difference vegetation index;soil science;normalization (statistics);reflectivity;impervious surface	Visualization	80.71227892994001	-57.72177624565819	100443

The project aims to the systematic evaluation of the added value of the use of Earth Observation techniques into operational flood prediction chains. Due to the specific geomorphology of Italy, the focus is mainly on flash floods on small sized river catchments.

A first Sentinel-1 image was acquired over Poyang Lake, PR China, less than 6 weeks after its launch. This allowed comparing the respective capacities in term of water recognition of the former ASAR ENVISAT and the Sentinel data. Then, since the operation functioning of the mission in fall 2014, data are regularly acquired, every 5 and 7 days, and processed in order to derive water bodies' maps and insure the monitoring of this crucial resources, the largest fresh water bodies in China.

This work examines classification based on Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) to extract SO characteristics from observations while estimating the probability the observations belong to a given class of objects. Recovering these characteristics and trajectories with sufficient accuracy is shown in this paper, where the characteristics are inherent in unique SO models used in the MMAE filter bank. A number of scenarios are shown to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed classification approach. The performance of this strategy is demonstrated via simulated scenarios.	control theory;filter bank;simulated annealing;simulation	Richard Linares;John L. Crassidis;Moriba K.

d48f50e0ac8ecc55e603937cfb774cfc60d4bcc6	high-value remote sensing for the geosciences: opportunistic use of navigation satellite signals		It is now recognized that the enormous challenge of scientifically understanding the Earth system requires careful strategic decisions on what missions are deployed. In a recent report, the National Research Council developed a “value framework” for Earth observing systems with a focus on prioritizing NASA observations that merit long-term continuity. In this paper, we refer to this framework to discuss how high value observations arise from opportunistic use of signals generated by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS. The increasing number of GNSS constellations internationally, likely to be permanently deployed, suggests that the geosciences community will benefit by adopting these signals for a variety of remote sensing needs. We describe recent progress in using these observations scientifically and developing technology to exploit them. We conclude that dedicated constellations of GNSS science instruments in low Earth orbit capable of receiving both direct and reflected GNSS signals will provide excellent science return in a broad range of areas, and constitute a high value Earth observing system.	earth system science;galileo (satellite navigation);global positioning system;satellite navigation;scott continuity	Anthony J.

It demonstrates the efficiency of this approach for street level elevation images, derived from 3D point clouds acquired by terrestrial mobile mapping systems. An area-stability term is introduced in the residual definition, reducing the over-segmentation of the vegetation while preserving small significant regions. We compare two possible combinations of the Ultimate Opening and the Area Stability: first as a multiplicative factor, then as a subtractive term. On the one hand, multiplicative factor is very strict and many significant regions may be eliminated by the operator. On the other hand, a subtractive factor is more easily controlled according to the image dynamics. In our application, the latter provides the best results by preserving small meaningful objects such as poles and bollards while avoiding over-segmentation on more complex objects such as cars and trees.

This research intends to estimate spatial distribution of electricity consumption in China, the largest developing country, and analyze the temporal and spatial change of electricity consumption during 1994–2009. The spatial modeling is based on the total electricity consumption of each province and DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program) – Operational Line-scan System (OLS) data, the latter provides the nighttime light information corresponding to electricity consumption, GDP and population. A simple method was developed to correct the saturated pixels with digital number of 63 in non-radiance-corrected DMSP-OLS data, using cities’ GDP data. The spatial electricity consumption maps were produced during 1994–2009, and they were validated by the electricity consumption records of 101 cities. Finally, the spatial–temporal changes of electricity consumption were analyzed. The results of this research can help to understand the regional discrepancy, especially rural and urban areas of China, of electricity consumption and economic development.	ordinary least squares	Xin Cao;Jianmin Wang;Jin Chen;Feng Shi	2014	Int.

Usually in a PolSAR image, each resolution contains several different scattering mechanisms. If these mechanisms can be allocated to different parts in one resolution cell, the details of the images can be enhanced, which means the resolution of the images is improved. In this paper, a new super-resolution algorithm for PolSAR image processing is proposed, in which target decomposition and polarimetric spatial correlation are both taken into consideration.

The ability to perform large scale Landsat analysis relies on the ability to access observations that are geometrically and radiometrically consistent, and have had non-target features (clouds) and poor quality observations flagged so that they can be excluded. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has processed all of the Landsat 4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) archive over the conterminous United States (CONUS), Alaska, and Hawaii, into Landsat ARD. The ARD are available to significantly reduce the burden of pre-processing on users of Landsat data. Provision of pre-prepared ARD is intended to make it easier for users to produce Landsat-based maps of land cover and land-cover change and other derived geophysical and biophysical products. The ARD are provided as tiled, georegistered, top of atmosphere and atmospherically corrected products defined in a common equal area projection, accompanied by spatially explicit quality assessment information, and appropriate metadata to enable further processing while retaining traceability of data provenance.	analysis of algorithms;archive;brian;conceptualization (information science);data quality;data system;image sensor;leo (computer);list of system quality attributes;mapper;map projection;pixel;preprocessor;tiling window manager;time series;traceability	John L.

Although some optical image ship detection methods have been proposed in recent years, there are still three obstacles in this task: 1) the inference of clouds and strong waves; 2) difficulties in detecting both inshore and offshore ships; and 3) high computational expenses. In this paper, we propose a novel ship detection method called SVD Networks (SVDNet), which is fast, robust, and structurally compact. SVDNet is designed based on the recent popular convolutional neural networks and the singular value decompensation algorithm. It provides a simple but efficient way to adaptively learn features from remote sensing images. We evaluate our method on some spaceborne optical images of GaoFen-1 and Venezuelan Remote Sensing Satellites. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high detection robustness and a desirable time performance in response to all of the above three problems.	algorithm;artificial neural network;computation;convolutional neural network;experiment;image;sensor;singular value decomposition	Zhengxia Zou;Zhenwei Shi	2016	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2016.2572736	meteorology;computer vision;remote sensing	Vision	69.4571346113962	-65.1988312299929	102590

The first satellite will be ready for launch by April 2010, the second 18 months later. It will allow, in Nadir acquisition conditions, to deliver image products 20 km wide, false or natural coloured scenes with a 50 cm ground sampling distance. Imaging capabilities have been highly optimized in order to acquire, in the same pass, along-track mosaics, stereo pairs and triplets, and multi-targets. To fulfil the operational requirements and ensure quick access to information, ground processing has to automatically perform the radiometnc and geometric corrections. Since ground processing capabilities have been taken into account very early in the mission development, it has been possible to relax some costly on-board components requirements, in order to achieve a cost effective on-board/ground compromise. Starting from a Pleiades-HR system overview, this paper gives a quick description of the ground segment functional breakdown and focuses more precisely on the image processing and associated products. The geometric accuracy is evaluated and the excellent results obtained are presented. Finally the paper presents the ground segment architecture that will handle this """"heavy"""" processing in the different operational Centres."""	freedom of information laws by country;ground sample distance;half rate;image processing;on-board data handling;performance;pleiades (supercomputer);requirement;sampling (signal processing);segment architecture	Simon Baillarin;Laurent Lebegue;Philippe Kubik	2009	2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5416940	meteorology;layout;computer vision;simulation;cost-effectiveness analysis;radiometry;process capability;ground sample distance;image resolution;image processing;computer science;optical imaging;image segmentation;optics;data acquisition;physics;satellite;remote sensing	Robotics	77.64981670201026	-61.12486087439804	102611

We flew in tandem a CASI-1500 (368–1052 nm) and an AHS (430–13,000 nm) airborne sensors in an area with presence of S. densiflora. We simplified the processing of hyperspectral data (no atmospheric correction and no data-reduction techniques) to test if these treatments were necessary for accurate S. densiflora detection in the area. We tested several statistical signal detection algorithms implemented in ENVI software as spectral target detection techniques (matched filtering, constrained energy minimization, orthogonal subspace projection, target-constrained interference minimized filter, and adaptive coherence estimator) and compared them to the well-known spectral angle mapper, using spectra extracted from ground-truth locations in the images. The target S. densiflora was easy to detect in the marshes by all algorithms in images of both sensors. The best methods (adaptive coherence estimator and target-constrained interference minimized filter) on the best sensor (AHS) produced 100% discrimination (Kappa = 1, AUC = 1) at the study site and only some decline in performance when extrapolated to a new nearby area. AHS outperformed CASI in spite of having a coarser spatial resolution (4-m vs. 1-m) and lower spectral resolution in the visible and near-infrared range, but had a better signal to noise ratio. The larger spectral range of AHS in the short-wave and thermal infrared was of no particular advantage. Our conclusions are that it is possible to use hyperspectral sensors to map the early spread S. densiflora in the Guadalquivir River marshes. AHS is the most suitable airborne hyperspectral sensor for this task and the signal processing techniques target-constrained interference minimized filter (TCIMF) and adaptive coherence estimator (ACE) are the best performing target detection techniques that can be employed operationally with a simplified processing of hyperspectral images.

Therefore, it sometimes occurs that the orthoimage obtained by the affine tranform is not desirable. In order to overcome this ploblem, Iikura proposed the method that orthorectifies the satellite image with digital elevation model (DEM) and optimizes the translation with the DEM shaded relief image. His method had practical appeal, but the correction of the rotation angle and scaling were not considered. In this paper, we describe the method to optimize not only the translation but also the rotation angle and scaling using the Fourier-Mellin transform and the Fourier phase-only-correlation (POC) technique. When applied to system-corrected Landsat TM images, the result shows that the parameters obtained by the new method were more accurate than either the original or the revised parameters contributed by JAXA.	digital elevation model;image scaling;shading;terrain cartography;xml:tm	Hiroyuki Saito	2011	2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049195	computer vision;digital elevation model;optics;physics;satellite;remote sensing	Robotics	77.08141953185033	-63.327458740608726	103319

0fe0611e1755c983f5ff5a733dbdac819397aa5b	supervised sub-pixel mapping for change detection from remotely sensed images with different resolutions	change detection;sub pixel mapping spm;soft classification;back propagation neural network bpnn	Due to the relatively low temporal resolutions of high spatial resolution (HR) remotely sensed images, land-cover change detection (LCCD) may have to use multi-temporal images with different resolutions. The low spatial resolution (LR) images often have high temporal repetition rates, but they contain a large number of mixed pixels, which may seriously limit their capability in change detection. Soft classification (SC) can produce the proportional fractions of land-covers, on which sub-pixel mapping (SPM) can construct fine resolution land-cover maps to reduce the low-spatial-resolution-problem to some extent. Thus, in this paper, sub-pixel land-cover change detection with the use of different resolution images (SLCCD_DR) is addressed based on SC and SPM. Previously, endmember combinations within pixels are ignored in the LR image, which may result in flawed fractional differences. Meanwhile, the information of a known HR land-cover map is insignificantly treated in the SPM models, which leads to a reluctant SLCCD_DR result. In order to overcome these issues, a novel approach based on a back propagation neural network (BPNN) with different resolution images (BPNN_DR) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, endmember variability per pixel is considered during the SC process to ensure the high accuracy of the derived proportional fractional difference image. After that, the BPNN-based SPM model is constructed by a complete supervised framework. It takes full advantage of the prior known HR image, whether it predates or postdates the LR image, to train the BPNN, so that a sub-pixel change detection map is generated effectively. The proposed BPNN_DR is compared with four state-of-the-art methods at different scale factors. The experimental results using both synthetic data and real images demonstrated that it can outperform with a more detailed change detection map being produced.	1:1 pixel mapping;artificial neural network;backpropagation;lr parser;map;software propagation;spatial variability;super paper mario;synthetic data	Ke Wu;Qian Du;Yi Wang;Yetao Yang	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9030284	computer vision;change detection;statistics;remote sensing	AI	75.10559263843669	-60.770371139748654	103661
80d51c20c4beabb4eea92f8243f9217d5af199cb	hyperspectral discrimination of tree species with different classifications using single- and multiple-endmember	spectral measure techniques;age detection;airborne hyperspectral remote sensing;within species variation;derivative spectra;tree species discrimination;multiple endmember	Discrimination of tree species with different ages is performed in three classifications using hyperspectral data. The first classification is between Broadleaves and pines; the second classification is between Broadleaves, Corsican Pines, and Scots Pines, and the third classification is between six tree species including different ages of Corsican and Scots Pines. These three classifications are performed by having singleand multiple-endmember and considering five different spectral measure techniques (SMTs) in combination with reflectance spectra (ReflS), first and second derivative spectra. The result shows that using single-endmember, derivative spectra are not useful for a more challenging classification. This is further emphasized in multiple-endmember classification, where all SMTs perform better in ReflS rather than derivative in all classifications. Furthermore, using derivative spectra, discrimination accuracy become more dependent on the type of SMTs, especially in single-endmember. By employing multiple-endmember, the within-species variation is significantly reduced, thereby, the remaining challenge in discriminating tree species with different ages is only due to the between-species similarity. Overall, discrimination accuracies around 92.4, 76.8, and 71.5% are obtained using original reflectance and multiple-endmember for the first, second, and third classification, which is around 14.3, 17, and 8.3% higher than what were obtained in single-endmember classifications, respectively. Also, amongst the five SMTs, Euclidean distance (in both singleand multiple-endmember) and Jeffreys–Matusita distance (in single-endmember and derivative spectra) provided the highest discrimination accuracies in different classifications. Furthermore, when discrimination become more challenging from the first to second and third classification, the performance difference between different SMTs is increased from 1.4 to 3.8 and 7.3%, respectively. The study shows high potential of multiple-endmember to be employed in remote sensing applications in the future for improving tree species discrimination accuracy.	euclidean distance	Azadeh Ghiyamat;Helmi Zulhaidi Mohd Shafri;Ghafour Amouzad Mahdiraji;Abdul Rashid Mohamed Shariff;Shattri Mansor	2013	Int.

A novel ground filtering method using scan line segmentation is proposed here, which we call SLSGF. It utilizes the scan line information in LiDAR data to segment the LiDAR data. The similarity measurements are designed to make it possible to segment complex roof structures into a single segment as much as possible so the topological relationships between the roof and the ground are simpler, which will benefit the labeling process. In the labeling process, the initial ground segments are detected and a coarse to fine labeling scheme is applied. Data from ISPRS 2011 are used to test the accuracy of SLSGF; and our analytical and experimental results show that this method is computationally-efficient and noise-insensitive, thereby making a denoising process unnecessary before filtering.	airborne ranger;algorithm;noise reduction;point cloud;scan line	Lei Wang;Yongun Zhang	2016	CoRR		computer vision	Robotics	74.86168614045613	-58.39807209337711	104293

Ground Penetrating Radar (GRP) and InSAR temporal deformation evolution profiles are integrated to interpret the phenomena acting and interacting in this area. The present investigation indicates that profiles based on InSAR time series can be effectively exploited to identify soil fractures and the sliding mechanism in the area.	enterprise resource planning;interaction;kriging;software propagation;time series	Gabriela Siles;Penélope López-Quiroz;Mariano Cerca;Wolfgang Niemeier	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326587	seismology;synthetic aperture radar;ground-penetrating radar;hazard;geology;hydrology;time series;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;geotechnical engineering;remote sensing	Embedded	81.71544254552828	-58.21888098156796	104834

Wenchuan Earthquake induced thousands of landslides, debris flows, which made a huge impact on the medicinal plant habitat by means of severe fragmentation. In this paper, through evaluating and integrating the multi-period remote sensing image data and basic geographic information data of the Longmen Shan region after earthquake by grid technology, the image group that covers the whole Longmen Shan belt and reflects the different features of ground object is acquired. Characters of Wenchuan earthquake disaster distributing is interpreted and analyzed by geographic information system platform for spatial analysis with the image group. Combine with the life habits of medicinal plants in this area and the main ecological factors impacting the spatial distribution pattern of medicinal plants, the impact on distribution pattern of medicinal plants habits during the disaster discussed, as a result, medicinal plants habitat influenced in the shock in various environmental factors is concluded. It can provide the academic evidence for medicinal plant restoration in earthquake zone.	circuit restoration;ecology;fragmentation (computing);geographic information system;habitat;microsoft outlook for mac;spatial analysis	Jun Zhang;Panxin Yang;Chenghu Zhou;Chengjie Wei;Ling Zhang;Bengang Zhang;Guoqiang Li	2010	2010 18th International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567869	seismology;geomorphology;geography	Robotics	82.79836999390069	-55.65532673481588	105386

Using of high power laser diodes in such systems open new opportunities in improvement of the whole  system efficiency. This becomes possible due to the great improvement of output characteristics of diode lasers which will  be described in the present work.  	geographic information system	Ilya S. Tarasov;Nikita A.

A power budget analysis is detailed for Inmarsat signals, considering both the reference and the radar channels. The effect of sea clutter is also examined. It is shown that relatively poor range resolution can be improved if the available communication channels are combined to improve the bandwidth, a process that also improves the sensitivity. For the first time, detection and preliminary bistatic range-Doppler tracking are presented for a representative maritime target.	clutter;communications satellite;experiment;global surveillance;multipath propagation;obstacle avoidance;radar;revision control system;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio	Andrew Stove;Marina Gashinova;Stanislav Hristov;Mikhail Cherniakov	2017	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2017.2722598	an/apy-10;mathematics;bistatic radar;electronic engineering;radar horizon;low-frequency radar;semi-active radar homing;remote sensing;radar masint;passive radar;man-portable radar	Visualization	77.20526337634377	-65.7887222982909	105507

The estimation obtained from a single-phase interferogram suffers from ambiguities. To solve these problems, multichannel AT-InSAR systems are required. In this letter, we analyze the radial velocity maximum-likelihood estimation accuracy with respect to AT-InSAR system parameters, such as velocity values and different clutter and thermal noise levels. We consider two different models for the target response: a deterministic model and a zero-mean Gaussian model. The presented results show that AT-InSAR systems exhibit better estimation accuracies for low-velocity values (slow targets).	clutter;ising model;johnson–nyquist noise;radial (radio);synthetic data;velocity (software development)	Alessandra Budillon;Vito Pascazio;Gilda Schirinzi	2008	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2008.915937	geodesy;mathematics;maximum likelihood;optics;physics;statistics;remote sensing	EDA	75.12521093136813	-66.14593258105293	105623

Simultaneous observations using multiple ~300 MHz subbands, incorporated into the PSR/CX instrument, have provided one means of interference mitigation that is useful under moderately contaminated conditions. ETL has developed a new C-band spectrometer that observes emissions within relatively narrower bandwidths and is tunable from 5.8 to 7.5 GHz. The spectrometer is able to reduce the effects of the interference at the expense of radiance sensitivity and observation time. Preliminary data analysis suggests the spectrometer to be an effective component for improving the accuracy of remotely sensed soil moisture measurements using C-band radiometry.	airborne ranger;aqua;eos;interference (communication);microwave;nikon cx format;predictive state representation;terrestrial television	Eric M.

Recent observations with fully polarimetric data from Radarsat-2 over the extensive wetlands of the Everglades and numerous small wetlands in Ontario are not consistent with this interpretation of the backscatter physics. In this paper we use several forms of polarimetric analysis and decomposition. All of these indicate that the backscatter from small marshes and swamps in Ontario has polarimetric characteristics normally attributed to the odd-bounce mechanism. A recently-proposed form of Bragg scattering provides a conceptual model to explain these observations. However, detailed electromagnetic backscatter modelling is still needed to provide a new and reliable understanding of backscattering from wetlands with emergent vegetation.	backscatter (email);emergence;polarimetry	Frank J.

With the increasing demands of microwave Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) earth observation for weather forecast, non snap shot type of imaging technology can be considered. While an image can be taken within a certain period of time, the hardware complexity can be dramatically reduced by scanning the sampling system during this period of time. In this paper, two kinds of rotational time shared scan scheme are analyzed, which are single rotation scan and double rotation scan.

Although exciting progresses have been made in this area, accurate real-time rainfall estimation is still a significant opening topic that requires practical modeling. The research study presented in this letter improves rainfall estimation accuracy by proposing a random forest and linear chain conditional random-field-based spatiotemporal model (RANLIST). To apply this model for rainfall estimation, the implementing approach is presented. The advantages are listed as follows: 1) RANLIST improves rainfall estimation accuracy by exploiting both underlying local spatial structure of multiple radar reflectivity factors and time-series information of rain processes. 2) The time-series information of rain processes can be utilized in virtue of the presented implementation method. Experiments have been carried out over the radar-covered area of Quanzhou, China, in June and July 2014. Results show that RANLIST is superior to previous works.	conditional random field;experiment;interpolation;performance;radar;radio frequency;random forest;real-time locating system;time series	Qiuming Kuang;Xuebing Yang;Wensheng Zhang;Guoping Zhang	2016	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2016.2597170	meteorology;estimation;hydrology;computer science;mathematics;radio frequency;physics;hidden markov model;statistics;remote sensing	EDA	82.86234521854475	-60.26281886649595	106117

We review a model for the hyperspectral image pixels that we have been developing, for which a maximum likelihood can be used for tem-perature/emissivity separation. Optimization of the ridge-like log likelihood function is accomplished using an “eigenstep” method, in which an eigenvector of the Hessian determines motion along the ride. We report on new testing performance, including bias, showing that bias can be reduced by increasing the number of image samples used.	hessian;image processing;pixel	David A. Neal;Toff K.

Conventional methods for subpixel target detection rely on estimating a large-size covariance matrix of the background and using the matrix for target detection. To complete the estimation, a large set of target-free training pixels is needed, which makes the estimation impractical for a heterogeneous environment and also computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose to generate a parametric model, named knowledge-aided non-stationary autoregressive (KANS-AR) model, for target detection. Instead of estimating the large-size covariance matrix explicitly, the proposed parametric model can be estimated from a small-size training pixels and used directly in timeseries- based whitening. This advantage makes a KANS-AR based target detector work well in both homogenous and heterogeneous environments. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.	adaptive filter;analysis of algorithms;autoregressive model;coefficient;decorrelation;horizontal situation indicator;parametric model;pixel;sensor;stationary process;the matrix	Xiaokun Li	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2010.5650035	adaptive filter;computer vision;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	70.44105515976129	-65.8562247481737	106711

Eigenvalue-eigenvector and four-component decompositions were used to classify the PALSAR-2 data and discriminate different agricultural parcels. Threshold analysis was applied for the polarimetric decomposition components. Polarimetric decomposition parameters, alpha angle, double bounce scattering component ratio, and surface scattering component ratio, were applied to classify areas according to their use for paddy rice or other crops including soybean. The same threshold value used for analysis using the double bounce scattering component ratio was useful for all PALSAR-2 data analyzed in this study. However, the efficient threshold for alpha angle discrimination was different between the analyzed datasets. Differences in data observation direction, incidence angle, and the growth situation of paddy rice at observation time are conceivable reasons for this difference.	course (navigation);incidence matrix;polarimetry	Chinatsu Yonezawa	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517291	paddy field;remote sensing;computer vision;angle of incidence;artificial intelligence;polarimetry;synthetic aperture radar;agriculture;scattering;computer science	Embedded	78.59611221888109	-58.041674758274155	106928

Developing tools to automate this task for specific features, such as roads, has become an important research topic. The purpose of this paper was to present a technique for the semi-automatic extraction of multiple pixel width river features appearing in high resolution satellite imagery. This was accomplished using a two stage, multi-resolution procedure. Initial river extraction was performed on low resolution (SPOT multi-spectral, 20 m) imagery. The results from this low resolution extraction were then refined on higher resolution (KFA1000, panchromatic, 5 m) imagery to produce a detailed outline of the channel banks. To perform low resolution extraction a cost surface was generated to represent the combined local evidence of the presence of a river feature. The local evidence of a river was evaluated based on the results of a number of simple operators. Then, with user specified start and end points for the network, rivers were extracted by performing a least cost path search across this surface using the Aa algorithm. The low resolution results were transferred to the high resolution imagery as closed contours which provided an estimate of the channel banks. These contours were then fit to the channel banks using the dynamic contours (or snakes) technique.	semiconductor industry	Craig R. Dillabaugh;K.

Thus, RFMs facilitate versatility and high security during geometric processing of optical satellite imagery. Increasingly, RFMs are offered to users as the basic geolocation model for further geometric processing by imagery vendors. However, imagery vendors might perform inadequate in-orbit geometric calibrations, or the calibrated geometric parameters might not be updated in a timely manner. Thus, the RFMs may suffer from high distortion due mainly to interior errors (such as lens distortion). Using the radiometric correction products of Ziyuan1-02C panchromatic and multispectral sensor as examples, the present study addresses the compensation of systematic errors in RFMs. An undistorted RFM can be generated after calibrating the interior error compensation model once, before high-accuracy registration between the panchromatic imagery and multispectral imagery can be achieved using the undistorted RFM. Experimental evaluations based on the positioning accuracy using a few ground control points (GCPs) with an undistorted RFM matched the accuracy of the GCPs. In addition, our approach greatly improves the accuracy of registration (which surpasses 0.7 panchromatic pixels) between panchromatic and multispectral imagery.	distortion;function model;geolocation;multispectral image;pixel;polynomial and rational function modeling;tuple space	Yong-hua Jiang;Guo Yong Zhang;Peng Chen;Deren Li;Xinming Tang;Wen-chao Huang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2015.2388700	computer vision;astronomy;systematics;accuracy and precision;optics;physics;satellite;statistics;remote sensing	Visualization	77.6288072954499	-63.89157964051126	107252

The antenna is driven for rotation about both a horizontal and a vertical shaft. A mean running speed MVb and a mean azimuth MQd of the vehicle over a time interval t2 are used to calculate corrections DELTA Px and DELTA Py to the vehicle location, which corrections are added to vehicle location data corresponding to the starting point of the interval t2. A mean azimuth MQd, a mean speed MVb, a mean roll angle MQr and a mean pitch angle MQp are used to control shifts DELTA Qdpo and DELTA Qppo which occur in the antenna attitude relative to the geostationary satellite as a result of the running of the vehicle over the time interval t2, and these shifts are used to correct the antenna attitude. In order to allow the antenna to be maintained as directed toward the geostationary satellite if the vehicle rapidly changes its direction of travel, the antenna attitude is controlled in advance in accordance with rates of change in running speed Vb, throttle opening Op, angle of rotation of steering wheel Sa, roll angle Qr and pitch angle Qd of the vehicle, by detecting these rates of change.	linear algebra;unique name assumption;web 2.0	Jaime Alberto Guzmán Luna;Demetrio Arturo Ovalle Carranza	2008			geodesy;steering wheel;attitude control;geostationary orbit;throttle;azimuth;angle of rotation;physics;pitch angle	ML	80.25104259392734	-66.00494216486577	107268
451ce0a303a77d5e11d617bdb0584db0eed0ff34	vineyard detection from unmanned aerial systems images	precision viticulture;remote sensing;vineyard detection;unmanned aerial vehicles	Display Omitted New algorithm to automatically detect vine rows in UAV aerial images.Based on dynamic segmentation, Hough Space Clustering and Total Least Squares.Robust to disturbance elements and non-crop vegetation.Able to process images with a limited intervention of the user. In viticulture, the adoption of precision agriculture techniques is nowadays increasingly essential to reach required high product quality standards. New reliable tools for mapping crop variability indexes in a vineyard or a single parcel are necessary to deploy site-specific management practices. In this paper, a new method to automatically detect vine rows in gray-scale aerial images is presented. The developed image processing algorithm is constituted by three main steps based on dynamic segmentation, Hough Space Clustering and Total Least Squares techniques. The procedure's reliability has also been proven in the presence of disturbance elements, like dense inter-row grassing, bushes and trees shadows, by properly detecting vine rows in the vineyard images. Moreover, its adaptive features allow it to obtain optimal results in the presence of uneven image illumination due, for example, to the presence of clouds or steep terrain slopes. The extracted row and inter-row information, besides being the basis for vineyard characterization maps computation, like vine plants vigor maps, could also be used as a reference for other precision viticulture tasks such as, for example, path planning of unmanned ground vehicles.	aerial photography;unmanned aerial vehicle	Lorenzo Comba;Paolo Gay;Jacopo Primicerio;Davide Ricauda Aimonino	2015	Computers and Electronics in Agriculture	10.1016/j.compag.2015.03.011	computer vision;simulation;precision viticulture;remote sensing	Robotics	76.62550957778576	-55.80629549492716	107416
8fea178c39d958e1313558a0c7074d0af4086f8f	sh-tof: micro resolution time-of-flight imaging with superheterodyne interferometry		Three dimensional imaging techniques have been widely used in both industry and academia. Time-of-flight (ToF) sensors offer a promising method of 3D imaging due to compact size and low complexity. However, state-of-the-art ToF sensors only have depth resolutions of centimeters due to limitations in the modulation frequencies that can be used. In this paper, we propose a technique to generate modulation frequencies as high as 1 THz using optical superheterodyne interferometry. Our proposed system provides great flexibility in imaging range and resolution. We experimentally demonstrate an increase in depth resolution by an order of magnitude relative to currently available commercial ToF cameras.	3d reconstruction;experiment;image resolution;modulation;sensor;superheterodyne receiver	Fengqiang Li;Florian Willomitzer;Prasanna Rangarajan;Mohit Gupta;Andreas Velten;Oliver Cossairt	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)	10.1109/ICCPHOT.2018.8368473	optical imaging;modulation;superheterodyne receiver;computer science;optics;time of flight;terahertz radiation;frequency modulation;adaptive optics;interferometry	Robotics	76.74425728885612	-65.55316627599316	107613

We apply Laplacian eigenmaps (LE), a nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NDR) technique, to a high-dimensional polarimetric feature representation for PolSAR land-cover classification. A wide variety of polarimetric signatures are chosen to construct a high-dimensional polarimetric manifold which can be mapped into the most compact low-dimensional structure by manifold-based dimensionality reduction techniques. This NDR technique is employed to obtain a low-dimensional intrinsic feature vector by the LE algorithm, which is beneficial to PolSAR land-cover classification owing to its local preserving property. The effectiveness of our PolSAR land-cover classification scheme with LE intrinsic feature vector is demonstrated with the RadarSat-2 C-band PolSAR data set and the 38th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation X-band PolInSAR data set. The performance of our method is measured by the separability in the feature space and the accuracy of classification. Comparisons on the feature space show that the LE intrinsic feature vector is more separable than different original feature vectors. Our LE intrinsic feature vector also improves the classification accuracy.	algorithm;bounce message;comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;computer vision;feature vector;linear separability;manifold regularization;nonlinear dimensionality reduction;nonlinear system;polarimetry;synthetic intelligence;type signature	Shang Tan Tu;Vince D.

45c919486c3d7b2db1ed690e942c6584a6d12e04	detecting multi-interface from oil-water separation image based on difference statistics method		Detecting multi-interface from the oil-water separation image is the basis of automatic detection of the moisture content and other indicators based on machine vision in heavy oil. Because of the strong viscosity, heavy oil easily attaches to the test tube wall and the oil-air and oil-water interface information is fuzzy. It is difficult to extract different location of the interface information simultaneously in vitro for traditional image interface detection method. To solve these problems, we proposed a difference statistics based method to detect multi-interface in vitro. Based on the interface enhancement of oil-water image, we calculate row average grey value of the oil-water image so that convert the two-dimensional image information into one-dimensional signal, then analyze the difference statistics information of one-dimensional signal, finally locate the position of the oil-air and oil-water interface according to the local extreme value of the difference. Experiments show that the multi-interface detection method has high precision and reaches the requirements of industrial applications, which could be used for a similar scene multi-interface detection.	algorithm;experiment;in the beginning... was the command line;machine vision;maxima and minima;real-time locating system;requirement;sensor	Daihong Zhou;Guoying Zhang;Yu Guo	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Smart Cloud (SmartCloud)	10.1109/SmartCloud.2017.37	fuzzy logic;extreme value theory;statistics;machine vision;water content;computer science	Robotics	73.54511636830205	-57.8596160354268	107916

Landscape characteristics are under continuous modification, especially in urban and suburban areas, and therefore the maps of these areas need regular updating. Derived databases, such as land use maps and 3D city models, are used in several applications including change detection and urban planning [7,5]. Tn this paper, we use Digital Surface Models (DSM) with lm, ground resolution to detect and discriminate buildings and vegetation. The DSM is a 2.5D matrix representation of relief generated from data obtained using scanning laser altimeters (LTDAR). Huising et al. [6] demonstrated the potential of laser data for the extraction of topographic information. Several techniques have been proposed for detecting buildings in aerial imagery. However, strategies relying entirely on image data are often sensitive to brightness variations or require additional information. Being dense and independent of ambient lighting, DSM data are better suited to this purpose [lo, 21. Haala [5] located buildings by searching for local maxima, Eckstein [3] suggested a dual rank filter for extracting spatial objects and Jaynes et al. [7] used both optical and range data. Weidner et al. [lo] used morphological opening; Brunn and Weidner [ll added Bayesian nets. Kilian et al. [Sl noted that the size of the structuring element used in opening [lo, 11 to obtain an estimate of the topographic surface is critical. Furthermore, the appmximation converges to the underlying topographic surface near the objects only when it is relatively smoother than the surface with the objects included. Buildings sited on coarse terrain are not identified during initial segmentation. Vosselman [9] proposed a technique to filter out spatial objects from laser data for generating Digital Elevation Models (DEM). Essentially, the complement of this approach can be adapted to our purpose. Since this method avoids the approximation step, there are fewer errors.	2.5d;3d city models;aerial photography;approximation;database;digital elevation model;digital geometry;map;matrix representation;maxima and minima;median filter;opening (morphology);sensor;shading;structuring element;topography	Prabhu Krishnamoorthy;Kim L.

The modeling accuracy is evaluated through the use of simulated and observed Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images. TM images include a discontinuous distortion and a high-frequency distortion due to attitude fluctuations and bidirectional scans. A geometric model consisting of a single-valued-function is used to correct these distortions. The iteration calculation of the mapping cannot be converged, resulting in an enormous amount of calculation and data. Therefore, geometric models consisting of separate geometric models of the bidirectional scans and frequency components are proposed. >	algorithm;bi-directional text	Yoichi Seto;Koichi Homma;Fuminobu Komura	1991	IEEE Trans.

This cruise provided in situ data from a large area of the Scotia Sea containing areas of extreme contrasts in terms of chl-a concentration. We present the results of correlation analysis between the in situ ship based chl-a measurements and the satellite chl-a products (SeaWiFS, and from MODIS the semi-analytic, SeaWiFS analog OC3M, HPLC empirical algorithms). The results confirm the good correlation between SeaWiFS and in situ chl-a measurements. The results indicate Terra MODIS chl-a measurements show reduced correlation to in situ values when compared to SeaWiFS. In addition, we compared chl-a averages from the various algorithms, over wider geographical regions of greater ecological relevance than point measurements. Over an area of 3/spl deg/ /spl times/ 3/spl deg/, SeaWiFS estimates could be as much as 2 times higher than estimates from MODIS.	algorithm;broadcast auxiliary service;dead sea scrolls;optical carrier transmission rates;relevance;semiconductor industry	Andrew H.

The Landuse / Landcover system espoused by almost all Organisations and scientists, engineers and remote sensing community who are involved in mapping of earth surface features, is a system which is derived from the united States Geological Survey (USGS) LULC classification system. The application of RS and GIS involves influential of homogeneous zones, drift analysis of land use integration of new area changes or change detection etc.,National Remote Sensing Agency(NRSA) Govt. of India has devised a generalized LULC classification system respect to the Indian conditions based on the various categories of Earth surface features , resolution of available satellite data, capabilities of sensors and present and future applications. The profusion information of the earth surface offered by the high resolution satellite images for remote sensing applications. Using change detection methodologies to extract the target changes in the areas from high resolution images and rapidly updates geodatabase information processing.Traditionally, classification approaches have focused on per-pixel technologies.Pixels within areas assumed to be automatically homogeneous are analyzed independently. These new sources of high spatial resolution image will increase the amount of information attainable on land cover. Significance is that the data can be acquired by our eyes and the energy can be analyzed. But satellites are capable of collecting data beyond the visible band also However, the traditional method of change detection are not suitable for high resolution remote sensing images. To overcome the limitations of traditional pixel-level change detection of high resolution remote sensing images, based on georeferencing and analysis method, this paper presents a unsullied way of multi-scale amalgamation for the high resolution remote sensing images change detection. Experiment shows that this method has a stronger advantage than the traditional pixel-level method of high resolution remote sensing image change detection. detection, Remote sensing images.	e-governance;emoticon;geographic information system;image resolution;information processing;map;pixel;sensor;spatial database	Y.

This paper proposes a novel Bayesian-based algorithm within the framework of wavelet analysis, which reduces speckle in SAR images while preserving the structural features and textural information of the scene. First, we show that the subband decompositions of logarithmically transformed SAR images are accurately modeled by alpha-stable distributions, a family of heavy-tailed densities. Consequently, we exploit this a priori information by designing a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. We use the alpha-stable model to develop a blind speckle-suppression processor that performs a nonlinear operation on the data and we relate this nonlinearity to the degree of non-Gaussianity of the data. Finally, we compare our proposed method to current state-of-the-art soft thresholding techniques applied on real SAR imagery and we quantify the achieved performance improvement.	algorithm;coherence (physics);noise reduction;nonlinear system;stable model semantics;thresholding (image processing);wavelet;zero suppression	Alin Achim;Panagiotis Tsakalides;Anastasios Bezerianos	2003	IEEE Trans.

Twenty-one coherent interferograms have been successfully constructed from Japanese Earth Resources Satellite 1 (JERS-1) SAR data obtained over oyster sea-farming structures. A coherence analysis of the 21 interferometric pairs showed that a perpendicular baseline of less than 3 km, with a temporal baseline within 500 days, are required to obtain a coherent pair, with a coherence higher than 0.25, in the study area. The coherent phases preserved in the interferograms showed a close relation with the sea level. The problem of phase unwrapping to restore an absolute tide height was overcome by introducing normalized image intensities. The radar measurements estimated by the proposed method were verified using tide gauge data, and comparison of the two datasets yielded a correlation coefficient R/sup 2/ of 0.91, with a root mean square error of 5.76 cm. The results demonstrate that radar interferometry can be applied for a tide height measurement near the coast given sufficient structures that return off-nadir radar pulses to the antenna.

Several devices have been developed in order to answer this problem. Acoustic, electromagnetic or RFID technologies are used to find pipes in the underground. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is also used to detect buried gas pipes. However it does not directly provide a 3D position but a reflection map called B-scan that the user must interpret. In this paper, we propose a novel method to automatically get the position of gas pipes with GPR acquisitions. This method uses a dictionary of theoretical pipe signatures. The correlation between each atom from the dictionary and the B-scan is used as feature in a two part supervised learning scheme. Our method has been applied to real data acquired on a test area and in real condition. The proposed method presents satisfying qualitative and quantitative results compared to other methods.	algorithm;ct scan;coefficient;computation;dictionary;edge enhancement;ising model;kriging;patch tuesday;radio-frequency identification;reflection mapping;robustness (computer science);supervised learning;support vector machine;type signature	Guillaume Terrasse;Jean-Marie Nicolas;Emmanuel Trouvé;Emeline Drouet	2016	2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760678	computer vision;engineering;machine learning;remote sensing	Robotics	75.52014786821773	-63.824013658590886	110083
8f23ae34336ab1255aa6577554d3edbc4bccf2a4	interactive semi-automatic categorization for spinel group minerals		Spinel group minerals are excellent indicators of geological environments (tectonic settings). In 2001, Barnes and Roeder defined a set of contours corresponding to compositional fields for spinel group minerals. Geologists typically use this contours to estimate the tectonic environment where a particular spinel composition could have been formed. This task is prone to errors and requires tedious manual comparison of overlapping diagrams. We introduce a semi-automatic, interactive detection of tectonic settings for an arbitrary dataset based on the Barnes and Roeder contours. The new approach integrates the mentioned contours and includes a novel interaction called contour brush. The new methodology is integrated in the Spinel Explorer system and it improves the scientist's workflow significantly.	categorization;contour line;diagram;semiconductor industry	Maria Luján Ganuza;Maria Florencia Gargiulo;Gabriela Ferracutti;Silvia Mabel Castro;Ernesto A.

Distinguishing Brazilian savanna physiognomies is an essential task to better evaluate carbon storage and potential emissions of greenhouse gases. In this study, we propose to evaluate the potential of texture features to improve the discrimination among five physiognomies in the Brazilian savanna: Open Grasslands, Shrubby Grassland, Shrubby Savanna, Savanna Woodland and Gallery Forest. Texture features extracted from RapidEye images and also from Spectral Linear Mixture Model components and Vegetation Index are evaluated in this study. Results showed that texture features based on GLCM can reduce misclassification for Open Grasslands, Shrubby Grasslands and Shrubby Savanna classes.	mixture model	Cesare Di Girolamo Neto;Leila Maria Garcia Fonseca;Thales Sehn Korting	2016			national park;computer science;data mining	NLP	80.38009187901469	-56.799340668713434	110681

Water quality is a critical component of global fresh water security and ecosystem health, yet is often overlooked when global analyses of water security are undertaken. In the face of declining surface measurements and datasets across the globe, alternatives to conventional water quality measurement are required. The case for an optical remote sensing based inland water quality product is a strong one. Global products of ocean color and their dissemination infrastructure are operational and widely used, providing a framework for global inland products. Furthermore, coastal and inland water quality algorithms based on spectral inversion algorithms are now sufficiently mature to cope with the greater variability of inherent optical properties in these systems. While these algorithms provide the greatest promise for reliable, robust and simultaneous retrieval of several water quality variables across sensors, limited knowledge of the bio-optical properties of inland waters and limited validation currently prevent global implementation. Internationally coordinated efforts are required to accumulate representative bio-optical data to improve our understanding of the optical complexity and variability of inland waters.	algorithm;british informatics olympiad;heart rate variability;sensor;spatial variability	Timothy J.

The SAR information is exploited using a new statistical decomposition method based on AANN. Thanks to the AANN the original image is represented in terms of Nonlinear principal components (NLPC).

The majority of work in this area has been at low grazing angles from clifftops or wave tanks and does not consider scattering in the high grazing angle region beyond 10 °. To improve our understanding at high grazing angles of 15 ° -45 °, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation's Ingara airborne X-band fully polarimetric radar has been used to collect 12 days' worth of sea-clutter data. This paper focuses on understanding the characteristics of sea-spikes as they are often the cause of false detections in a radar processor. Using the Ingara data, a threshold is used to isolate these scatterers in the range/time domain with results verified against the KK probability distribution function. Detections due to discrete and persistent scattering are then isolated to provide more information regarding the underlying cause of sea-spikes and answer the question of whether Walker's three-component mean Doppler spectrum model is suitable at high grazing angles.	airborne ranger;amiga walker;clutter;polarimetry;radar;sensor	Luke Rosenberg	2013	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2013.2239112	meteorology;early-warning radar;continuous-wave radar;radar engineering details;synthetic aperture radar;radar lock-on;x band;radar horizon;bistatic radar;pulse-doppler radar;clutter;3d radar;optics;radar imaging;preprocessor;radar;remote sensing;low-frequency radar	Visualization	78.92968872749489	-63.31775266850806	111423
22bdf11ef72d3bda28a89dc81f43f22d11f7e021	improving shadows detection for solar radiation numerical models		Solar radiation numerical models need the implementation of an accurate method for determining cast shadows on the terrain or on solar collectors. The aim of this work is the development of a new methodology to detect the shadows on a particular terrain. The paper addresses the detection of self and cast shadows produced by the orography as well as those caused by clouds. The paper presents important enhancements on the methodology proposed by the authors in previous works, to detect the shadows caused by the orography. The domain is the terrain surface discretised using an adaptive mesh of triangles. A triangle of terrain will be under cast shadows when, looking at the mesh from the Sun, you can find another triangle that covers all or partially the first one. For each time step, all the triangles should be checked to see if there are cast or self shadows on it. The computational cost of this procedure eventually resulted unaffordable when dealing with complex topography such as that in Canary Islands thus, a new methodology was developed. This one includes a filtering system to identify which triangles are those likely to be shadowed. If there are no self shadowed triangles, the entire mesh will be illuminated and there will not be any shadows. Only triangles that have their backs towards the Sun will be able to cast shadows on other triangles. Detection of shadows generated by clouds is achieved by a shadow algorithm using satellite images. In this paper, Landsat 8 images have been used. The code was done in python programming language. Finally, the outputs of both approaches, shadows generated by the topography and generated by clouds, can be combined in one map. The whole problem has been tested in Gran Canaria and Tenerife Island (Canary Islands – Spain), and in the Tatra Mountains (Poland and Slovakia). © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.		F. Díaz;H.

As the data acquisition for difficult terrain lasted until April 2014, final DEM production started for flat to moderate terrain regions where two final coverages surfice. This paper focuses on a first validation of moderate terrain to prove the absolute height accuracy. In a detailed comparison three DEM tiles from different continents are chosen to validate the TanDEM-X DEM by computing differences to GPS tracks, ICESat validation points, and SRTM. On a global scale all TanDEM-X DEMs produced so far are compared with ICESat and GPS tracks. Both validations presented here for the first time indicate that the absolute height error for moderate terrain for TanDEM-X is below 2m and therefore much better than the specified 10m/LE90.	data acquisition;digital elevation model;global positioning system;shuttle radar topography mission;tandem computers;usgs dem	Birgit Wessel;Astrid Gruber;Martin Huber;Markus Breunig;Susanne Wagenbrenner;Anna Wendleder;Achim Roth	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6947209	meteorology;geodesy;remote sensing	Embedded	82.43804354250959	-61.10675503671249	111910

A technique based on scale space smoothing is used. However, where the usual scale space analysis approach is to suppress detail by increasing smoothing progressively, the proposed method instead considers differences of smooths at neighboring scales. A random signal can then be represented as a sum of such differences, a kind of a multiresolution analysis, each difference representing details relevant at a particular scale or resolution. Bayesian analysis is used to infer which details are credible and which are just artifacts of random variation. The applicability of the method is demonstrated using noisy digital images as well as global temperature change fields produced by numerical climate prediction models.

It is about four times faster than the most recent and most efficient published methods. Ours is also much simpler. Since processing large datasets can take hours, this improvement is significant. To reduce the total number of I/O operations, our method is based on subdividing the terrain into blocks which are stored in a special data structure managed as a cache memory.  The viewshed is that region of the terrain that is visible by a fixed observer, who may be on or above the terrain. Its applications range from visual nuisance abatement to radio transmitter siting and surveillance.	algorithm;cpu cache;computation;data structure;input/output;transmitter	Chaulio Ferreira;Salles V.

The continuous monitoring of their stability therefore is of utmost significance to prevent the public death and injures resulting from bridge collapses. Typically, the deformation of bridges is detected by traditional on-structure surveying methods which are limited by the sparse measurements and large consumption of time and manpower. Thanks to the availability of numerous archived high-resolution spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images coupled with the technology development of multi-temporal interferometry SAR, currently, millimetre level of subtle deformation monitoring and health diagnosis on bridges through the estimation of subsidence velocities using time-series SAR images has become a precise and cost-effective solution, assisting the conventional measures for bridges monitoring.

6031f8005a88bef6f1cd5b9aa4afdb4d7f553110	optimal features selection for wetlands classification using landsat time series		Accurate wetlands distribution maps could provide important information for wetland management and protection. While, wetlands have significantly inner-annual variation which makes accurate wetland mapping challenging. Time series data with high temporal resolution, such as MODIS are wildly used in monitoring wetlands, but the coarse resolution cannot precisely identify detail of the wetlands and smaller wetlands. In addition, optimal features for wetlands classification is still unclear. In this study, Landsat monthly composited time series were used to identify wetlands. Firstly, we generated the Landsat 30m land surface reflectance, NDVI, NDWI and TC-Wetness time series by compositing the Landsat7 ETM+ and Landsat8 OLI data. Then the extension of the Jeffries-Matusita Distance (JBh) and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm were used to select the optimal features for accurate wetlands classification. Finally, the optimal features were used for wetlands classification based on the RF algorithm. The results showed that: (1) the optimal features included NDVI in May and August, TC-Wetness in May and NDWI in June and August which can effectively separate seasonal and permanent marshes, rice fields, grass and drylands; (2) the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient calculated using the optimal features were 90.05% and 0.88 respectively which were similar to the wetlands classification result derived by the entire Landsat time series data. The optimal features could improve efficiency and decrease data redundancy.	algorithm;compositing;data redundancy;map;matthews correlation coefficient;radio frequency;random forest;time series	Liwei Xing;Huabin Wang;Wenfeng Fan;Chen Chen;Tao Li;Guanghui Wang;Haoran Zhai	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517980	remote sensing;time series;normalized difference vegetation index;wetland;reflectivity;marsh;computer science;random forest	ML	82.26982892658481	-57.6222929438762	112870

The processor generates an image of the scene. This paper is about the second part of processing the simulated raw data that is acquired by the step steering sliding spotlight mode of KOMPSAT-5. For this observation mode, dechirp on receive is operated in receiving the echoes. So, extended frequency scaling algorithm is used to process the raw data in order to directly handle the dechirped data [2]. This paper mainly contributes for the accuracy of effective velocity. The effective velocity criterions for range and azimuth processing allows that the processor uses only one scene center effective velocity in range processing and several ones in azimuth processing. In this paper, a method to increase the accuracy of calculation of effective velocity is also proposed. Simulation result shows that the proposed method is valid.	algorithm;dbpedia;frequency scaling;image scaling;simulation;velocity (software development)	Dong-Hyun Kim;Jae-Cheol Yoon;Jae-Min Shin;Moon-Gyu Kim	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5652783	data modeling;computer vision;frequency scaling;synthetic aperture radar;doppler effect;image processing;computer science;accuracy and precision;azimuth;physics;remote sensing	Robotics	78.59103483159114	-64.57925890923798	112952

Landsat images with multispectral bands are commonly used to study the numerous classification methods in order to improve the classification accuracy. Thermal remote sensing provides valuable information to investigate the effectiveness of the thermal bands in extracting land cover patterns. k-NN and Random Forest algorithms were applied to both the single Landsat 8 image and the time series Landsat 4/5 images for the Attert catchment in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, trained and validated by the ground-truth reference data considering the three level classification scheme from COoRdination of INformation on the Environment (CORINE) using the 10-fold cross validation method. The accuracy assessment showed that compared to the visible and near infrared (VIS/NIR) bands, the time series of thermal images alone can produce comparatively reliable land cover maps with the best overall accuracy of 98.7% to 99.1% for Level 1 classification and 93.9% to 96.3% for the Level 2 classification. In addition, the combination with the thermal band improves the overall accuracy by 5% and 6% for the single Landsat 8 image in Level 2 and Level 3 category and provides the best classified results with all seven bands for the time series of Landsat TM images.	cpu cache;comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;multispectral image;random forest;time series;visual instruction set	Liya Sun;Karsten Schulz	2015	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs70708368	random forest;hydrology;machine learning;cross-validation;remote sensing	ML	80.32453142917073	-56.912903959427936	113216

As the first step, monotone samples from the Musical Instrument Samples (Univ. Iowa) and RWC Music Database were used to identify the individual instruments. For the Iowa monotones, an overall instrument recognition rate of 24.8% and 82.1% was obtained using LDA and RF, respectively. However, the rate degrades to 54.9% on the RWC monotones even with RF, most likely due to insufficient number of features to cover the increase in variability of this large database.	linear discriminant analysis;radio frequency;random forest;spatial variability;monotone	Yuta Takahashi;Kazuhiro Kondo	2014	2014 IEEE 3rd Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)	10.1109/GCCE.2014.7031196	computer vision;speech recognition;geography;communication	Vision	78.7346615448059	-58.76494054238029	113562

The goal of this instrument is to be put onboard of future Chinese space-borne platforms to provide precise position and timing information for high-demand space missions and to monitor ionosphere, atmosphere and the earth's surface. A DDM module was developed based on FFT, as a part of the instrument, to receive the reflected signal from a wide code and frequency range. The stored data could be used to study the state of sea and land. An airborne experiment was carried out in order to verify the performance of the module.

The work focuses on taking advantage of generated target spaces and how to incorporate them into a detection scheme. Analysis was performed in a whitened space where lack-of-fit issues can be magnified. From this, two types of detectors were generated, one based on utilizing all vectors in a target space and another, similar detector, utilizing all target space vectors in a lower dimensional space. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve results show that the new detectors perform better than previously implemented methodologies.	receiver operating characteristic;sensor	Emmett J.

e060ea06742b92cd39edaff70dac17ae3fc9d219	multi-temporal image analysis for fluvial morphological characterization with application to albanian rivers		A procedure for the characterization of the temporal evolution of river morphology is presented. Wet and active river channels are obtained from the processing of imagery datasets. Information about channel widths and active channel surface subdivision in water, vegetation and gravel coverage classes are evaluated along with channel centerline lengths and sinuosity indices. The analysis is carried out on a series of optical remotely-sensed imagery acquired by different satellite missions during the time period between 1968 and 2017. Data from the CORONA, LANDSAT and Sentinel-2 missions were considered. Besides satellite imagery, a digital elevation model and aerial ortho-photos were also used. The procedure was applied to three, highly dynamic, Albanian rivers: Shkumbin, Seman and Vjosë, showing a high potential for application in contexts with limitations in ground data availability. The results of the procedure were assessed against reference data produced by means of expert interpretation of a reference set of river reaches. The results differ from reference values by just a few percentage points (<6%). The time evolution of hydromorphological parameters is well characterized, and the results support the design of future studies aimed at the understanding of the relations between climatic and anthropogenic controls and the response of river morphological trajectories. Moreover, the high spatial and temporal resolution of the Sentinel-2 mission motivates the development of an automatic monitoring system based on a rolling application of the defined procedure.	aerial photography;digital elevation model;expert system;futures studies;image analysis;mathematical morphology;orthophoto;subdivision surface	Daniele Spada;Paolo Molinari;Walter Bertoldi;Alfonso Vitti;Guido Zolezzi	2018	ISPRS Int.

The purpose of this Advancing Collaborative Connections for Earth-Sun System Science (ACCESS) project is to provide researchers with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) biophysical data products that are custom tailored for use in NACP model studies. Standard MODIS biophysical products provide used to improve our understanding on the climate and ecosystem changes. However, direct uses of the MODIS biophysical parameters are constrained by retrieval quality and cloud contamination. Another challenge that NACP users face is acquiring MODIS data in formats and at spatial-temporal resolutions consistent with other data sets they use. We have been working closely with key NACP users to tailor the MODIS products to fit their needs. First, we provide new temporally smoothed and spatially continuous MODIS biophysical data sets. Second, we are distributing MODIS data at suitable spatial- temporal resolutions and in formats consistent with other data integration into model studies.	ecosystem;mosis;smoothing;temporal logic	Robert E.

The proposed method is compared to the best level discrete wavelet transform approach for dimensionality reduction and least squares estimation and quadratic programming for unmixing (DWT-LSE-QP). The contributions of this letter are given as follows: (1) the band selection and filter selection algorithm and (2) the DCI-SVD algorithm. The dc insensitivity of the DCI-SVD method is proven, and simulation results using data from an analytical spectral device spectroradiometer show the efficacy of the proposed method and its superiority to the DWT-LSE-QP-based approach in the harder unmixing cases.	data, context and interaction;digitally controlled impedance;dimensionality reduction;discrete wavelet transform;least squares;low-pass filter;pixel;selection algorithm;simulation;singular value decomposition;whole earth 'lectronic link	John E.

The idea was developed on a previous paper, and this work presents the results on real data. For seabed characterization, we need to fuse the multiview of sonar images to increase performances. However, before fusion, we have to proceed to an image registration. The proposed approach is based on the use of the conflict due to the combination as a similarity measure in the classified images registration. This allows a good modelization of imperfections and has been employed with success for classifier fusion in image processing.	computation;image fusion;image processing;image registration;mathematical model;performance;sonar (symantec);similarity measure	Cedric Rominger;Arnaud Martin;Ali Khenchaf;Hicham Laanaya	2009	2009 12th International Conference on Information Fusion		computer vision;speech recognition;geography;remote sensing	Robotics	71.34736339512669	-61.53051590488909	114538

9f55fa7a1c3925a666cccc563f37ee3918e9d370	mapping skips in sugarcane fields using object-based analysis of unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) images		Abstract The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as remote sensing platforms has tremendous potential for describing detailed site-specific features of crops, especially in early post-emergence, which was not possible previously with satellite images. This article describes an object-based image analysis (OBIA) procedure for UAV images, designed to map and extract information about skips in sugarcane planting rows. The procedure consists of three consecutive phases: (1) identification of sugarcane planting rows, (2) identification of the existent sugarcane within the crop rows, and (3) skip extraction and creation of field-extent crop maps. Results based on experimental fields achieved skip rates of between 2.29% and 10.66%, indicating a planting operation with excellent and good quality, respectively. The relationship of estimated versus observed skip length had a coefficient of determination of 0.97, which was confirmed by the value of the enhanced Wilmott concordance coefficient of 0.92, indicating good agreement. The OBIA procedure allowed a high level of automation and adaptability, and it provided useful information for decision making, agricultural monitoring, and the reduction of operational costs.	aerial photography;object-based language;unmanned aerial vehicle	Carlos Henrique Wachholz de Souza;Rubens A.

According to the characteristics of polder structure and spectral analysis of typical objects, differential methods were used to gain structural characteristics of polder landscape in this area. The results indicated that the spatial structural characteristics of polder landscape could be divided into six categories: polygon-shaped structure, jaggies-shaped structure, dendritic-shaped structure, feather-shaped structure, cricoid fan-shaped structure, and rectangular-shaped structure. All six landscape structures were formed by the long-term human exploitation of farmland, reflecting different natural and social functions of polder's construction. Finally, combined with regional environment and historical literature, this paper synthetically analyzed the five main driving factors of this artificial field development.	jaggies;spectrum analyzer	Li Wu;Wenshuai Ji	2013	2013 21st International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/Geoinformatics.2013.6626024	geography;cartography;remote sensing	Robotics	82.75012435310734	-54.842992023023506	114921

Besides technical problems such as synchronization of the oscillators, involved adjustment of transmit pulse versus receive gate timing, antenna pointing, flight coordination, and motion compensation, the development of a bistatic focusing algorithm is still in progress and not sufficiently solved. As a step to a numerically efficient processor, this paper presents a bistatic range migration algorithm for the translationally invariant case, where transmitter and receiver have equal velocity vectors. In this paper, the algorithm was successfully applied to simulated and real bistatic data.

Individual samples are typically a mixture of only one, two, three, or occasionally four minerals. Therefore, in order to avoid overfitting, a sparse unmixing algorithm is required. We compare three such algorithms using some real world test data sets: full subset selection (FSS), sparse demixing (SD), and L1 regularization. To aid the comparison, we introduce two novel aspects: 1) the simultaneous fitting of the low frequency background with mineral identification (which provides greater model flexibility) and 2) the combined fitting being carried out using a suitably defined Mahalanobis distance; this has certain optimality properties under an idealized model. Together, these two innovations significantly improve the accuracy of the results. FSS and L1 regularization (suitably optimized) produce similar levels of accuracy, and are superior to SD. Discussion includes possible improvements to the algorithms, and their possible use in other domains.	algorithm;elastic net regularization;flying-spot scanner;matrix regularization;overfitting;rca spectra 70;sparse matrix;test data	Mark Berman;Leanne Bischof;Ryan Lagerstrom;Yi Guo;Jonathan F.

For this reason, different routes are designed and applied to extract the two kinds of ships. Our whole method can be divided into three main steps: 1) extract water polygons with histogram segmentation, 2) extract holes in the water polygons with morphological operations as the possible offshore ships, and extract possible moored ship with the identification of the salients to sea along the water boundary, and then 3) screen real ships out of these possible ships with more shape constraints. A case study is carried out on Spot 5 imagery to validate our method.

Spectral images are fused according to the physics properties of the imaging system, including illumination, spectral response of the camera, and spectral reflectance of skin. The fused image is given as a probe to the recognition software Facelttrade which compares it to a gallery of images. The identification performance of our physics-based fusion method is compared to the performance of principle component analysis and average fusion methods. The results show that the proposed fusion yields a higher identification rate. A method of illumination adjustment is proposed when the probe and gallery images are acquired under different illumination conditions.

Technology, USA Abstract: Time-mean and absolute geostrophic velocities of the Kuroshio current south of Japan are derived from TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data using a Gaussian jet model. When compared with simultaneous measurements from a shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) at two intersection points between the altimeter and the ADCP tracks, the time-mean velocity is accurate to 1 cm s to 5 cm s. The errors in the absolute and the mean velocities are similar to those reported previously for other currents. The comparable performance suggests the Gaussian jet model is a promising methodology for determining absolute geostrophic velocities, noting that in this region the Kuroshio does not meander sufficiently, which provides unfavorable environment for the performance of the Gaussian jet model.	acoustic cryptanalysis;radar;velocity (software development)	Seung-Bum Kim	2005	Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2005.

4646caf3eef8671ec94f8399a7eaf7df8c50859f	multi-annual kinematics of an active rock glacier quantified from very high-resolution dems: an application-case in the french alps		Rock glaciers result from the long-term creeping of ice-rich permafrost along mountain slopes. Under warming conditions, deformation is expected to increase, and potential destabilization of those landforms may lead to hazardous phenomena. Monitoring the kinematics of rock glaciers at fine spatial resolution is required to better understand at which rate, where and how they deform. We present here the results of several years of in situ surveys carried out between 2005 and 2015 on the Laurichard rock glacier, an active rock glacier located in the French Alps. Repeated terrestrial laser-scanning (TLS) together with aerial laser-scanning (ALS) and structure-from-motion-multi-view-stereophotogrammetry (SFM-MVS) were used to accurately quantify surface displacement of the Laurichard rock glacier at interannual and pluri-annual scales. Six very high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs, pixel size u003c50 cm) of the rock glacier surface were generated, and their respective quality was assessed. The relative horizontal position accuracy (XY) of the individual DEMs is in general less than 2 cm with a co-registration error on stable areas ranging from 20–50 cm. The vertical accuracy is around 20 cm. The direction and amplitude of surface displacements computed between DEMs are very consistent with independent geodetic field measurements (e.g., DGPS). Using these datasets, local patterns of the Laurichard rock glacier kinematics were quantified, pointing out specific internal (rheological) and external (bed topography) controls. The evolution of the surface velocity shows few changes on the rock glacier’s snout for the first years of the observed period, followed by a major acceleration between 2012 and 2015 affecting the upper part of the tongue and the snout.

a932ae64c9beda7e73e4ae29608684ec2002bfe3	embedded gpu implementation of sensor correction for on-board real-time stream computing of high-resolution optical satellite imagery	sensor correction;embedded gpu;on-board;real-time;stream computing	In recent years, the data generation rate of high-resolution optical satellites is increasing rapidly, and this situation brings massive stress to the data downloading link and data processing system. To relieve downloading link stress and enhance the time efficiency of information acquisition, on-board processing needs to be introduced. Current on-board solutions are mostly based on digital signal processing and field-programmable gate array, which are obturated, lack flexibility, and are highly costly to implement. This paper takes sensor correction, the prerequisite geometric step of high-resolution optical satellite data processing, as an example, using a simulation prototype made of a double-module data parallel pipeline system based on NVIDIA embedded graphics processing unit platform, and proposes a feasible stream computing approach for low power consumption, flexible, and expandable on-board real-time processing. The experiments use a short strip of GaoFen-9 satellite data that contain 4.5 standard scenes to validate the performance and correctness of this approach. Compared to the same algorithms on the Dell PowerEdge T630 Server, the on-board version demonstrates an obvious performance advantage. When considering the contrast of power consumption for each platform, the advantage becomes even more significant. With statistics and analysis of experimental results, the timeline of processing demonstrates that this approach could meet the on-board real-time sensor correction requirement. And correctness is also verified by the root-mean-square error of pixel-by-pixel image comparison experiments.	algorithm;best practice;computer graphics;correctness (computer science);data parallelism;dell poweredge;digital signal processing;download;embedded system;experiment;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;geo (microformat);graphics processing unit;image rectification;image resolution;mathematical optimization;on-board data handling;pixel;prototype;real-time clock;real-time transcription;region of interest;requirement;sensor;simulation;stream processing;timeline	Mi Wang;Zhiqi Zhang;Ying Zhu;Zhipeng Dong;Yingying Li	2017	Journal of Real-Time Image Processing	10.1007/s11554-017-0741-0	computer science;real-time computing;digital signal processing;graphics processing unit;data processing system;test data generation;gate array;correctness;stream;data processing	Embedded	71.317749643497	-54.25935351427883	116828

d92a123d6199eec9e3bb115814c57f7694273716	estimating nonlinearities in p-linear hyperspectral mixtures		Accurately estimating the elements in Earth observations is crucial when assessing specific features such as air quality index, water pollution, or urbanization process behavior. Moreover, physical–chemical composition can be retrieved from hyperspectral images when proper spectral unmixing architectures are employed. Specifically, when linear and nonlinear combinations of endmembers (pure spectral components) are accurately characterized, hyperspectral unmixing plays a key role in understanding and quantifying phenomena occurring over the instantaneous field-of-view. Thus, reliable detection of nonlinear reflectance behavior can play a key role in enhancing hyperspectral unmixing performance. In this paper, two new methods for adaptive design of mixture models for hyperspectral unmixing are introduced. One of the methods relies on exploiting geometrical features of hyperspectral signatures in terms of nonorthogonal projections onto the space induced by the endmembers’ spectra. Then, an iterative process aims at understanding the order of local nonlinearity that is displayed by each endmember over every pixel. An improved version of an artificial neural network-based approach for nonlinearity order information is also considered and compared. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches are actually able to retrieve thorough information on the nature of the nonlinear effects over the image, while providing excellent performance in reconstructing the given data sets.	algorithmic efficiency;artificial neural network;assistive technology;interaction;iterative method;mixture model;nonlinear system;pixel;supercomputer;synthetic intelligence;type signature	Andrea Marinoni;Javier Plaza;Antonio J.

Unfortunately, atmospheric scattering, secondary illumination, changing viewing angles, and sensor noise degrade the quality of these images. Improving their resolution has a high payoff, but applying super-resolution techniques separately to every spectral band is problematic for two main reasons. First, the number of spectral bands can be in the hundreds, which increases the computational load excessively. Second, considering the bands separately does not make use of the information that is present across them. Furthermore, separate band super resolution does not make use of the inherent low dimensionality of the spectral data, which can effectively be used to improve the robustness against noise. In this paper, we introduce a novel super-resolution method for hyperspectral images. An integral part of our work is to model the hyperspectral image acquisition process. We propose a model that enables us to represent the hyperspectral observations from different wavelengths as weighted linear combinations of a small number of basis image planes. Then, a method for applying super resolution to hyperspectral images using this model is presented. The method fuses information from multiple observations and spectral bands to improve spatial resolution and reconstruct the spectrum of the observed scene as a combination of a small number of spectral basis functions.	super-resolution imaging	Toygar Akgun;Yücel Altunbasak;Russell M.

By taking profiles of polarimetric parameters along the line crossing from the west edge to the eastern area of Lake Saroma, the polarimetric and the incidence angle characteristics for various ice types and open water were extracted. It was found that VV to HH backscattering ratio at higher incidence angle was correlated with ice thickness and sensitive to thickness difference. The scattering entropy of OW was lower than any other ice types even at the higher incidence angles.	incidence matrix;l band;polarimetry;thickness (graph theory);verification and validation	Hiroyuki Wakabayashi;Kohei Cho	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128121	computer science;geophysics;sea ice;backscatter;remote sensing;pi;angle of incidence;polarimetry;synthetic aperture radar;scattering	Embedded	82.50173115184951	-62.0457944970176	118688

In sort-rst rendering, image-space, or screen, is divided into regions. Each processor is assigned one or multiple regions to render. Primitives in the scene are redistributed among the processors according to region assignments. The total number of primitives in the system may increase due to duplication of primi-tives crossing multiple regions assigned to diierent processors. The common characteristic of the algorithms discussed in this paper is that a 2-dimensional mesh is superimposed on the screen and screen is subdivided using the primitive distribution on this mesh. Each processor is assigned a single region to render. The rst algorithm uses summed area table for subdividing the screen. The second algorithm uses quadtrees for subdivision. The third algorithm utilizes a graph partitioning approach. The second and the third algorithms are new approaches to adaptive screen subdivision in sort-rst rendering. We compare the algorithms in terms of load balancing performance, execution time of the algorithms, and percent increase in the total number of primitives after redistribution step. In this paper, we do not target a speciic rendering method such as polygon rendering or volume rendering. Our load balancing criteria is the number of primitives in each processor. We present experimental results on a Parsytec's CC parallel system.	algorithm;central processing unit;distributed memory;experiment;graph partition;graphics;heuristic (computer science);load balancing (computing);quadtree;rendering (computer graphics);run time (program lifecycle phase);space partitioning;subdivision surface;volume rendering	Tahsin M.

The rationale is to detect the so-called persistent scatterers, which are characterized by preserving their phase quality along the multi-temporal set of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images available. Two criteria are mainly available for the estimation of pixels’ phase quality, i.e., the coherence stability and the amplitude dispersion or permanent scatterers (PS) approach. The coherence stability method allows an accurate estimation of the phase statistics, even when a reduced number of SAR acquisitions is available. Unfortunately, it requires the multi-looking of data during the coherence estimation, leading to a spatial resolution loss in the final results. In contrast, the PS approach works at full-resolution, but it demands a larger number of SAR images to be reliable, typically more than 20. There is hence a clear limitation when a full-resolution PSI processing is to be carried out and the number of acquisitions available is small. In this context, a novel pixel selection method based on exploiting the spectral properties of point-like scatterers, referred to as temporal sublook coherence (TSC), Remote Sens. 2015, 7 531 has been recently proposed. This paper seeks to demonstrate the advantages of employing PSI techniques by means of TSC on both orbital and ground-based SAR (GB-SAR) data when the number of images available is small (10 images in the work presented). The displacement maps retrieved through the proposed technique are compared, in terms of pixel density and phase quality, with traditional criteria. Two X-band datasets composed of 10 sliding spotlight TerraSAR-X images and 10 GB-SAR images, respectively, over the landslide of El Forn de Canillo (Andorran Pyrenees), are employed for this study. For both datasets, the TSC technique has showed an excellent performance compared with traditional techniques, achieving up to a four-fold increase in the number of persistent scatters detected, compared with the coherence stability approach, and a similar density compared with the PS approach, but free of outliers.	aperture (software);control theory;dbpedia;decorrelation;design rationale;displacement mapping;map;molecular orbital;pixel density;remote desktop services;synthetic data;universal product code	Rubén Iglésias;Jordi J.

In prior research we demonstrated that wide angle remotely sensed imagery having high radiance values measured near the direction of the sun glint in the principal plane signaled the presence of either open water or inundated plant communities, in contrast to dry upland plant communities. We demonstrated that regional to global scale wetlands issues that do not involve one meter resolution per se may be addressed with acceptable accuracy by applying spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and atmospheric correction techniques to the 6-10 km pixel imagery from POLDER. Here we investigate the influence of wind speed upon the discrimination process, showing that at very low wind speeds and very high wind speeds we are not able to discriminate the three cover types and that when wind speeds are moderate there is potentially an error associated with estimation of the areal extent of open water areas.	pixel;polarization (waves)	Vern C.

Additionally, when the propagation of uncertainties during the analysis process is investigated using the Monte Carlo method, the run time of the algorithm can increase by a factor of between 100 and 1000, depending on the desired accuracy of the result. This increase in run time constitutes a large barrier when we expect the use of uncertaintyaware terrain analysis become more general. In this paper, we evaluate the use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) in uncertainty-aware drainage basin delineation. All computations are run on a GPU, including the creation of the realization of a stationary DEM uncertainty model, stream burning, pit filling, flow direction calculation, and the actual delineation of the drainage basins.

Concretely, by use of the Landsat TM satellite images in different time of 1988, 1996 and 2000, Man-Wan Dam Immigrants Settlement land cover condition were monitored, and data analysis was completed on land cover changes in class composition and spatial distribution. The results shows that, with the Dam setting up, land cover changes has its characteristic in the mountain Immigrants Settlement area. The behavior is that mountain slope dry land mix with other cover types is of dominance relative to other cover classes, and shrubbery cover area reduces rapidly while dry land mix with other cover types increase quickly. Integrated research associated with field investigation, some primary conclusion can be made like that, in mountain Immigrants Settlement area, the main reason of LUCC comes from the limit of the mountain natural conditions; another drive may be the lag of land use management manner by man-made action. So it is necessary to enhance land use plan and management of Dam Immigrants Settlement area in Lancang River basin, prompt local social sustainable development.

Antenna pattern error analysis and calibration methods of an L-band 1-D synthetic aperture radiometer are presented in this paper. An improved calibration algorithm proposed here uses approximate observation target modeled brightness temperature to replace the reference brightness temperature defined as the mean value of the field of view in the flat target transformation(FTT) method. This improved method is verified through a simulation system that simulates L-band 1-D synthetic aperture radiometer's observation process in viewing a series of near real case brightness temperature maps.

Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) is one of such Technologies. It enables measurements of altitudes of sampled points on ground objects as well as on the ground, and consequently, generation of surface models. Extraction of morphological properties from such a model is possible, and combinations of such parameters lead to implications. By applying this to an urban area, a surface model only representing morphology of buildings could become a matrix to derive socio-economic implications. In this context, a set of experiments were conducted by using a part of central Tokyo as a study site.	airborne ranger;emergence;experiment;mathematical morphology	Hiroyuki Yoshida;Manabu Omae	2005	2005 Symposium on Applications and the Internet Workshops (SAINT 2005 Workshops)	10.1109/SAINTW.2005.64	lidar;the internet;law	HCI	78.96061932711658	-57.69315902730389	119747

In this research we show a different use for PCA technique as a tool for data fusion. PCA as a data fusion technique is performed over the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) data, studying dust storms to better serve their identification. The multi-angle viewing capability of MISR is used to enhance our understanding of the Earth’s environment that includes climate particularly of atmosphere and of land surfaces. In this research the multi angle MISR images clearly show a dust storm over the Liaoning region of China as well as parts of northern and western Korea on April 8, 2002. PCA is used to combine the obtained information from the different angle views and frequency bands of MISR datasets. Performing K-means clustering on the original and the assimilated products apply a quantitative measure that is introduced. Upon classifying the first 4 principal components (PCs) having 95% of the information content similar results were obtained as compared to the classification using original datasets.

The approaches of the algorithms adjustment and checking are conducted in the GPS storage location. For guaranteeing the quality of the relevant GPS software and not restricted by data type and source, two new algorithms is designed. Key parameters of the algorithm can be manually-controlled and suited to the different data sets and the movement objects. Hence the requirement for the GPS receiver performance can be reduced and the limited capability weakness of the embedded computing is compensated. However, the proposed algorithms can not achieve much more performance gain with a poor quality GPS position data. For guaranteeing the quality of the relevant GPS software and not restricted by data type and source,two new algorithms is designed. Key parameters of the algorithm can be manually-controlled and suited to the different data sets and the movement objects. The proposed algorithms are better methods for data secondary discrimination and correction with high quality GPS data. Moreover, with the development and maturity of the time series method, the proposed algorithm will have more potential to grow and establish. The algorithms which based on temporal series and Euclidean space make improvement for the positioning accuracy of GPS data.	algorithm;assisted gps;capability maturity model;display resolution;embedded system;gps navigation software;global positioning system;time series;variable (computer science)	Guanli Huang;Bin Yang;Keyu Jiang	2011	JCP	10.4304/jcp.6.1.83-89	mathematical optimization;gps/ins;real-time computing;simulation;time to first fix;computer science;euclidean space;data mining	Mobile	78.60775074845111	-52.15932499034003	120008

A grid of PVC pipes was used to circulate the salt water in the pond. A pump was used at low speed to constantly circulate the water, and no waves were present during measurements. A gas heater was in series with the pump to heat the water during the measurements. After a set of measurements, water chillers were used to cool the water down for the next evening’s measurements. To increase the salinity level, sea salt was mixed with filtered reverse osmosis water and fed into the pond through the pump line. To decrease the salinity, filtered reverse osmosis water was added to the pond. Two new thermosalinograph instruments were used in opposite sides of the pond to measure the average salinity and temperature of the water. There were also four (4) temperature probes located in each corner. All measurements were made after sunset to eliminate any solar interference. On October 26, November 3 and 10, measurements were made with a constant salinity of 35 psu and a constant temperature to measure changes in the background radiation. These data showed exceiient agreement within 0.05 I(. This smoothed background data was subtracted from aii the salinity measurements to correct for the small background changes from the sky.	heat pipe;incidence matrix;interference (communication);pet pals: animal doctor;power supply unit (computer);series and parallel circuits;smoothing;water model	William J.

a16a16f2e9cfff9936dbc21416b166a7e5f5dcc6	the wavelet-based fusion model for multi-resolution satellite data		This paper discusses a design framework of the fusion of the multi-spectral image data for the analysis of satellite images. In recent years, as the availability of remote sensing imagery has increased, fusing images of different wavelength and different resolution have become a significant operation in remote sensing study. Image fusion process is designed to enhance the resolution of multi-spectral images by merging a relatively coarse-resolution image with a higher resolution of the same geographic area. The result of the fusion process is a single image which contains more information for human vision and machine perception. We have designed and implemented the fusion model for the satellite image analysis in this work. The model is based on a multi-scale decomposition (wavelet transform) and the maximum coefficient fusion rule. To evaluate the model, it was applied to the multi-spectral image taken from the Landsat ETM+ sensor. The image of Chiangmai, Thailand is used as our experimental scene due to a good mixture of foliated and urban areas contained in the scene. The resulting image quality was evaluated using the SNR and the RMSE as well as human interpretation.	algorithm;autostereogram;coefficient;concurrent computing;experiment;image analysis;image fusion;image quality;image registration;information;machine perception;multispectral image;real-time clock;real-time computing;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;wavelet transform	Thitirat Wiyarat;Tiranee Achalakul	2004			artificial intelligence;wavelet;machine learning;fusion;computer vision;satellite;computer science	Vision	75.71588366664737	-60.37996662194927	120168

In this study, we present a novel land cover classification product based on spectral and phenological information for the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in China. The product is derived at a 500 m spatial resolution using an innovative approach employing moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series. The classification results capture regional scale land cover patterns and small-scale phenomena. By applying a regionally specified classification scheme, an extensive collection of training data, and regionally tuned data processing, the quality and consistency of the phenological maps are significantly improved. With the ability to provide an updated land cover product considering the heterogenic environmental and climatic conditions, the novel land cover map is valuable for research related to environmental change in this region.	comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;decision tree;digital elevation model;futures studies;map;shuttle radar topography mission;time series;video post-processing	Linlin Lu;Claudia Kuenzer;Huadong Guo;Qingting Li;Tengfei Long;Xinwu Li	2014	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs6043387	phenology;remote sensing	ML	80.82146467646552	-56.483954316013886	120255

The campaign was carried out in Finland in fall 2003. The main instruments of the campaign were the E-SAR airborne radar (operating at L- and X-band) and the HUTSCAT helicopter-borne profiling scatterometer (operating at X- and C-band). We compare and discuss forest height obtained from the inversion quad-pol polarimetric interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data sets at L-band and forest height obtained from the inversion of single-pol X-band in SAR data with forest height estimates from HUTSCAT scatterometer data. Our results show that the forest height values, which are estimated by means of two different radar instruments, are in good agreement. The correlation between HUTSCAT and E-SAR height estimates ( at L-band and at X-band) underlines the good agreement between the results obtained by the two approaches.	airborne ranger;algorithm;aperture (software);ecosystem;l band;polarimetry;radar;synthetic data;the forest;tree (data structure);xband	Jaan Praks;Florian Kugler;Konstantinos P.

6d7b34023f55afb0f17e009087329fad75d7b4c9	a novel strategy for very-large-scale cash-crop mapping in the context of weather-related risk assessment, combining global satellite multispectral datasets, environmental constraints, and in situ acquisition of geospatial data	best practice;crop mapping;crowdsourcing;drought risk assessment;exposure;flood risk assessment;geospatial data;rule-based classification;spaceborne remote sensing;unsupervised classification	"""Cash crops are agricultural crops intended to be sold for profit as opposed to subsistence crops, meant to support the producer, or to support livestock. Since cash crops are intended for future sale, they translate into large financial value when considered on a wide geographical scale, so their production directly involves financial risk. At a national level, extreme weather events including destructive rain or hail, as well as drought, can have a significant impact on the overall economic balance. It is thus important to map such crops in order to set up insurance and mitigation strategies. Using locally generated data-such as municipality-level records of crop seeding-for mapping purposes implies facing a series of issues like data availability, quality, homogeneity, etc. We thus opted for a different approach relying on global datasets. Global datasets ensure homogeneity and availability of data, although sometimes at the expense of precision and accuracy. A typical global approach makes use of spaceborne remote sensing, for which different land cover classification strategies are available in literature at different levels of cost and accuracy. We selected the optimal strategy in the perspective of a global processing chain. Thanks to a specifically developed strategy for fusing unsupervised classification results with environmental constraints and other geospatial inputs including ground-based data, we managed to obtain good classification results despite the constraints placed. The overall production process was composed using """"good-enough"""" algorithms at each step, ensuring that the precision, accuracy, and data-hunger of each algorithm was commensurate to the precision, accuracy, and amount of data available. This paper describes the tailored strategy developed on the occasion as a cooperation among different groups with diverse backgrounds, a strategy which is believed to be profitably reusable in other, similar contexts. The paper presents the problem, the constraints and the adopted solutions; it then summarizes the main findings including that efforts and costs can be saved on the side of Earth Observation data processing when additional ground-based data are available to support the mapping task."""	agricultural workers' diseases;avian crop;droughts;entity name part qualifier - adopted;global serializability;multispectral image;preparation;risk assessment;risk aversion;seeding;unsupervised learning;algorithm;hail	Fabio Dell'Acqua;Gianni Cristian Iannelli;Marco A.

69b018b8012c592c1b287c96ad0e6280992e7ad5	covert ground and port surveillance using hyperbox®: rayleigh backscattering from fiber optics	fiber lasers;optical fiber sensors;optical fiber testing;backscatter;optical fiber cables;optical fiber amplifiers	"""A fiber optic interrogator has been developed with software (S/W) that will deteet people walking, vehicles and digging across a 100m swath around a buried fiber optic cable. These activities cause minute pressure waves that transmit through the ground to the buried fiber. The pressure waves then hit the fiber causing minute changes in the fiber index. Rayleigh backscattering is extremely sensitive to these index changes. The three activities are distinguished from each other with S/W and the activities can be located within a few meters along the fiber. The temporal frequency of this backscatter allows discrimination of the targets. The resultant system is analogous to an array of geophones where the number and sensitivity of the geophones is programmable. The interrogator was field tested with 40 Km of buried fiber providing definitive discrimination of all three target types. This system was designed for maximum versatility with S/W controlled variable pulse width to improve target location, S/W controlled variable pulse rate and data sampling to optimize storage requirements, and S/W controlled variable output power to allow increased sensitivity at longer ranges. The buried fiber GPS coordinates are correlated with Google maps to allow the events to be overlaid onto a topographical map. The result is a color coded real time pictorial of events over the entire fiber length (>80 Km) fused with a map of the area giving operators total situational awareness. The entire interrogator and processing computer have been packaged into a portable ruggedized 19"""" rack. Data is transmitted across an Ethernet connection for analysis at a central location. This system is suitable for use on any border. For the US Northern border: There are only 2,200 US agents (4 agents/10Km average). For the US Southern border: there are 17,659 US agents (56 agents/10 Km average). The Hyperbox® would reduce the number of required agents by providing a force multiplier with a few dozen installations and 24/7 coverage at a price that is the lowest cost/Km of any other available surveillance technology."""	backscatter (email);global positioning system;image;map;optical fiber cable;pulse-width modulation;rayleigh–ritz method;requirement;resultant;rugged computer;sampling (signal processing);topography	Jefferson E.

Consequently, ground control point (GCP) extraction hardly obtains accurate results for aircraft positioning. Based on the digital elevation model (DEM) and polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data, we propose a method for extracting GCPs in mountainous areas by introducing the polarization orientation angle shift (POAS) to minimize geometric distortions. In this method, DEM data are used as the reference map by providing POASs at arbitrary look directions to make up for the look-direction sensitivity of POASs transformed from PolSAR data. The geometric distortions between POASs transformed from DEM and PolSAR data are effectively reduced by calculating the POASs from DEM data at the same look direction and look angles of the PolSAR data. In contrast to the SAR data, which have a large dynamic range, the values of POAS are limited to a small interval. Therefore, the illumination distortions induced by visualization can be reduced. Finally, the GCP extraction between the POAS images is conducted by bilateral filter scale-invariant feature transform. Experiments using various data at different look directions demonstrate that the proposed method obtains better-quality GCPs but less invalid keypoints than the method using only intensity images for mountainous areas.	aperture (software);bilateral filter;control point (mathematics);digital elevation model;distortion;dynamic range;experiment;games computers play;multiply–accumulate operation;polarimetry;polarization (waves);quadruple-precision floating-point format;reduction (complexity);scale-invariant feature transform;successive approximation adc;synthetic data	Wenting Ma;Jian Yang;Wei Gao	2014	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2014.2319111	computer vision;synthetic aperture radar;feature extraction;computer science;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;optics;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar;data visualization;remote sensing	Visualization	76.68191906337076	-63.163971633339116	120691

We focus on elementary shape extraction and propose a method that extracts rectangular buildings. The result is a vectorial land register that can be used, for instance, to perform precise roof shape estimation. Using a spatial point process framework, we model towns as configurations of and unknown number of rectangles. An energy is defined, which takes into account both low level information provided by the altimetry of the scene, and geometric knowledge about the disposition of buildings in towns. Estimation is done by minimizing the energy using simulated annealing. We use an MCMC sampler that is a combination of general Metropolis Hastings Green techniques and the Geyer and Møller algorithm for point process sampling. We define some original proposition kernels, such as birth or death in a neighborhood and define the energy with respect to an inhomogeneous Poisson point process. We present results on real data provided by the IGN (French National Geographic Institute). Results were obtained automatically. These results consist of configurations of rectangles describing a dense urban area.	automatic taxonomy construction;digital elevation model;markov chain monte carlo;metropolis;metropolis–hastings algorithm;point process;sampling (signal processing);simulated annealing;towns	Mathias Ortner;Xavier Descombes;Josiane Zerubia	2005	International Journal of Computer Vision	10.1007/s11263-005-5033-7	digital elevation model;image processing;calculus;mathematics;statistics	Vision	71.48058932548659	-62.3649250907385	120723

Compared to broadband multispectral data, hyperspectral data provides a better option with high spectral resolution. Classification of vegetation with the use of hyperspectral remote sensing generates a classical problem of high dimensional inputs. Complexity gets compounded as we move from airborne hyperspectral to Spaceborne technology. It is unclear how different classification algorithms will perform on a complex scene of tropical forests collected by spaceborne hyperspectral sensor. The present study was carried out to evaluate the performance of three different classifiers (Artificial Neural Network, Spectral Angle Mapper, Support Vector Machine) over highly diverse tropical forest vegetation utilizing hyperspectral (EO-1) data. Appropriate band selection was done by Stepwise Discriminant Analysis. The Stepwise Discriminant Analysis resulted in identifying 22 best bands to discriminate the eight identified tropical vegetation classes. Maximum numbers of bands came from SWIR region. ANN classifier gave highest OAA values of 81% with the help of 22 selected bands from SDA. The image classified with the help SVM showed OAA of 71%, whereas the SAM showed the lowest OAA of 66%. All the three classifiers were also tested to check their efficiency in classifying spectra coming from 165 processed bands. SVM showed highest OAA of 80%. Classified subset images coming from ANN (from 22 bands) and SVM (from 165 bands) are quite similar in showing the distribution of eight vegetation classes. Both the images appeared close to the actual distribution of vegetation seen in the study area. OAA levels obtained in this study by ANN and SVM classifiers identify the suitability of these classifiers for tropical vegetation discrimination.	airborne ranger;algorithm;artificial neural network;complexity;hyperion;linear discriminant analysis;multispectral image;open agent architecture;support vector machine;top-down and bottom-up design;tropical freeze	Dhaval Vyas;N.

In radio astronomy (RA) applications, the interferometric array processing of data streams presents algorithmic and response time challenges as well as a high volume of data. The radio interferometer is an RA instrument composed of an array of antennas. Radio signals emitted by a celestial object are captured by the antennas and are subsequently processed in such a way that each pair of antennas produces correlated data. The overall correlated data is then accumulated and, after an integration period, the spectral image of the observed object is obtained. The process of deconvolution of the spectral image produces the desired spatial image of the celestial object. The proposed solar flare detection system is embedded in a computational platform framework suitable for dealing with huge volumes of data, based on a cluster of CPU-GPU pairs. The experimental results presented in the paper include comparison of the TNS-based algorithm (implemented as the SOL-FLARE system) with the K-means algorithm using significant samples of test images to validate the detection system. The performances of both systems are comparatively analyzed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. The images used in the experiments were selected from a data repository produced by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph, in Japan, during the years 2004 up to 2013. The main contribution of the article is a novel approach to solar flare detection in a GPU-CUDA framework.	cuda;graphics processing unit	Gustavo Poli;E. Llapa;J. R. Cecatto;José Hiroki Saito;James F.

A bilateral filtering-based approach is presented for hyperspectral image fusion to generate an appropriate resultant image. The proposed approach retains even the minor details that exist in individual image bands, by exploiting the edge-preserving characteristics of a bilateral filter. It does not introduce visible artifacts in the fused image. A hierarchical fusion scheme has also been proposed for implementation purposes to accommodate a large number of hyperspectral image bands. The proposed scheme provides computational and storage efficiency without affecting the quality and performance of the fusion. It also facilitates the midband visualization of a subset of the hyperspectral image cube. Quantitative performance results are presented to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);bilateral filter;elegant degradation;image fusion;pixel;pyramid (geometry);resultant;statistical classification;storage efficiency	Ketan Kotwal;Subhasis Chaudhuri	2010	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2009.2037950	computer vision;performance;hyperspectral imaging;bilateral filter;data visualization;remote sensing;computer graphics (images)	Vision	68.84315170715536	-63.78881166814476	121035

The proposed FPI based instrument is designed to make absorption measurements of trace gases in the Martian atmosphere. The measurements can be made from a satellite platform using nadir and limb viewing modes of operation or from a ground platform such as a lander in a direct sun viewing mode. The FPI technique offers a unique combination of high spectral resolution enabling great specificity with high optical throughput permitting a large signal to noise ratio. A version of this instrument for measuring column CO2, O2, and H2O vapor on Earth has been highly developed at Goddard over the last five years and has had extensive testing from both ground and aircraft platforms. The instrument has been further advanced through an ISAL (Instrument Synthesis and Analysis Lab) studies to reduce the size and power requirements to be more appropriate for a Mars mission.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;block cipher mode of operation;delay line interferometer;fixed-point iteration;large-signal model;lunar lander (video game series);prototype;requirement;sensitivity and specificity;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial scale;throughput	Elena M.

This paper presents a novel classification approach suitable for regional-scale vegetation mapping using the GRFM datasets. The mapping system consists of: 1) an application-dependent wavelet-based edge-preserving smoothing algorithm and 2) a two-stage per-pixel hybrid learning nearest multiple-prototype (NMP) classifier, whose unsupervised first stage is a per-pixel near-optimal vector quantizer, called enhanced Linde-Buzo-Gray (ELBG), recently proposed in pattern recognition literature. Identified as ENMP (NMP with ELBG), this novel classification approach is compared against two alternative systems in the classification of forest cover disturbances located across an area in the Amazon Basin. Surface classes of interest are primary forest, degraded forest, nonforest, and water bodies. Reference maps, derived from 30-m resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, are provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Abundant quantitative and qualitative evidence shows that: 1) in a forest/nonforest data-mapping task, ENMP provides a testing accuracy of 87%, in line with training accuracies, i.e., the proposed method seems capable of generalizing well over the GRFM South America dataset and 2) among three competing approaches, ENMP provides the best compromise between ease of use, mapping accuracy, and computational time. Starting from these results, ENMP is employed to generate a swamp forest map of the whole Amazon Basin from the two-season GRFM radar mosaic of South America, in the context of the Global Land Cover project (GLC 2000).	computation;decimation (signal processing);discrepancy function;ecosystem;edge-preserving smoothing;experiment;fragmentation (computing);image editing;köppen climate classification;l band;linde–buzo–gray algorithm;map;pattern recognition;pixel;prototype;quantization (signal processing);radar;simple network management protocol;thematic map;time complexity;usability;wavelet	Matteo Sgrenzaroli;Andrea Baraldi;Gianfranco De Grandi;Hugh Eva;Frédéric Achard	2004	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2004.836816	meteorology;accuracy and precision;cluster analysis;statistics;remote sensing	Vision	79.01726697572066	-57.480176855230994	121684

Obtained results show improvements in the total accuracy for the proposed hybrid approach confirming the initial hypothesis.

f1cbb8c96b2a00ecd91e11d35193c2690f89e1cb	a land product characterization system for comparative analysis of satellite data and products		A Land Product Characterization System (LPCS) has been developed to provide land data and products to the community of individuals interested in validating space-based land products by comparing them with similar products available from other sensors or surface-based observations. The LPCS facilitates the application of global multi-satellite and in situ data for characterization and validation of higher-level, satellite-derived, land surface products (e.g., surface reflectance, normalized difference vegetation index, and land surface temperature). The LPCS includes data search, inventory, access, and analysis functions that will permit data to be easily identified, retrieved, co-registered, and compared statistically through a single interface. The system currently includes data and products available from Landsat 4 through 8, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua, Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP)/Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and simulated data for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). In addition to the future inclusion of in situ data, higher-level land products from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 and -3 series of satellites, and other high and medium resolution spatial sensors, will be included as available. When fully implemented, any of the sensor data or products included in the LPCS would be available for comparative analysis.	application binary interface;aqua;esa;qualitative comparative analysis;sensor;terabyte	Kevin Gallo;Greg Stensaas;John Dwyer;Ryan Longhenry	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10010048	remote sensing;moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer;geology;geostationary operational environmental satellite;normalized difference vegetation index;satellite;reflectivity;visible infrared imaging radiometer suite	Visualization	82.88737182828586	-60.39136977572575	121961

However, after about 10 months operation, it has lost most of its power due to the solar paddle failure. As a follow on of ADEOS II mission, JAXA is now planning GCOM mission which is composed of a series of satellites. They are now called GCOM-W and GCOM-C satellites. Both satellites are composed of 3 satellites with 5 year lifetime. Hence, 13 years of continuous observation can be assured with 1 year overlaps. The first satellite of GCOM-W was launched on 18, May, 2012 while the first one of GCOM-C will be launched in 2017. GCOM-W1 carries AMSR-2 (AMSR F/O). AMSR-2 is very similar to AMSR on ADEOS II and AMSR-E on EOS-Aqua with some modifications. GCOM-C1 will carry SGLI (GLI F/O). The SGLI will be rather different from GLI. The main targets of SGLI are atmospheric aerosols, coastal zone and land. In order to measure aerosols over both ocean and land, it will have an near ultra violet channel, as well as polarization and bi-directional observation capability. For, coastal zone and land observation, the IFOV of SGLI for these targets will be around 250m. The instrument will be composed of several components. The shorter wavelength region will adopt push broom scanners, while long wave region will use a conventional whisk broom scanner. The orbit of GCOM-W1 is A-train, while the orbit of GCOM-C1 will be similar to ADEOS II.	a-train;aqua;eos;polarization (waves)	Haruhisa Shimoda	2015	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326978	meteorology;sea surface temperature;snow;atmospheric sciences;geology;physics;satellite;remote sensing	Embedded	81.43769193613026	-63.13073682577533	122342
61705b5eb26a3abc6135e02bd7fcbe3f22a7c441	hazard implications of the 2016 mw 5.0 cushing, ok earthquake from a joint analysis of damage and insar data		The Cushing Hub in Oklahoma, one of the largest oil storage facilities in the world, is federally designated as critical national infrastructure. In 2014, the formerly aseismic city of Cushing experienced a Mw 4.0 and 4.3 induced earthquake sequence due to wastewater injection. Since then, an M4+ earthquake sequence has occurred annually (October 2014, September 2015, November 2016). Thus far, damage to critical infrastructure has been minimal; however, a larger earthquake could pose significant risk to the Cushing Hub. In addition to inducing earthquakes, wastewater injection also threatens the Cushing Hub through gradual surface uplift. To characterize the impact of wastewater injection on critical infrastructure, we use Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR), a satellite radar technique, to observe ground surface displacement in Cushing before and during the induced Mw 5.0 event. Here, we process interferograms of Single Look Complex (SLC) radar data from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1A satellite. The preearthquake interferograms are used to create a time series of cumulative surface displacement, while the coseismic interferograms are used to invert for earthquake source characteristics. The time series of surface displacement reveals 4–5.5 cm of uplift across Cushing over 17 months. The coseismic interferogram inversion suggests that the 2016 Mw 5.0 earthquake is shallower than estimated from seismic inversions alone. This shallower source depth should be taken into account in future hazard assessments for regional infrastructure. In addition, monitoring of surface deformation near wastewater injection wells can be used to characterize the subsurface dynamics and implement measures to mitigate damage to critical installations.

They are characterized by several habitats that coexist and interact in a condition of dynamic equilibrium. Moreover they are sites of human settlements and important economic and commercial activities. Therefore, an accurate environmental characterization of these complex systems require a large amount of information and different levels of analysis. To date, the contribution by remote sensing to study coastal zones is widely accepted as it provides high quality tools and products to investigate and monitor these fragile ecosystems. In this framework, the aim of this work is to test the performance of the multispectral Daedalus Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM-2) sensor for the interpretation and analysis of geo-environmental features of the Migliarino, San Rossore, Massaciuccoli Regional Park's coastal area.	coexist (image);complex systems;display resolution;ecosystem;habitat;multispectral image	Maria Giuseppina Persichillo;Luca Cenci;Leonardo Disperati;Marzia Ballerano;Alessandro Barducci;Donatella Guzzi;Vanni Nardino;Ivan Pippi;Andrea Rindinella;Claudia Meisina	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326817	geology;hydrology;sediment;remote sensing	Embedded	80.47223070422284	-59.168178302634985	122944

Today, altimetric satellites are observing the whole oceans, measuring the sea surface height with a rms precision of 3-4 cm at 1 Hz sampling, as demonstrated by TOPEX/POSEIDON, launched in 1992, by Jason-1, launched in 2001 and by ENVISAT, launched in 2002. Such a high level error budget was achieved thanks to the tremendous improvements which have been obtained in radar performances as well as in precise orbit determination. Indeed, applications of altimetry in oceanography and geodesy requires very precise measurements of the satellite-sea level range, along with appropriate environmental corrections, but also an accurate knowledge of the satellite position with respect to the Earth reference. One campaign has also been made in June 2003 at the Ibiza island area (Martinez-Benjamin et al., 2003). The marine geoid has been used to relate the coastal tide gauge data from Ibiza and San Antonio harbours to off-shore altimetric data. A technical Spanish contribution to the calibration experience has been the design of GPS buoys and GPS catamaran taking in account the University of Colorado at Boulder and Senetosa/Capraia designs. We present a synthesis of the sea level results results obtained from the altimeter calibration campaign at Ibiza island on June 2003 using the direct measurements from GPS buoys and the derived marine geoid. The main objective of the marine campaign was to check the value of Ibiza Island as a permanent calibration site in the western Mediterranean Sea, to complement the Corsica site in the network of altimeter calibration sites.	earth system science;global positioning system;high-level programming language;performance;radar;sampling (signal processing);stunt island;topography	Juan Jose Martinez-Benjamin;Marina Martinez-Garcia;Jose Martin Davila;Jorge Garate Pasquin;Miquel Angel Ortiz Castellon;Julia Talaya Lopez;Anna Baron;Gema Rodriguez Velasco;Pascal Bonnefond;Begoña Perez Gomez	2007	2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4424014	meteorology;calibration;sea-surface height;global positioning system;geodesy;geology;earth system science;geoid;earth;ocean current;tide gauge;physics;satellite;remote sensing;sea level	Embedded	81.98877366752228	-63.250590662402935	122997

It aims at inferring, from a large spectral library, the pure spectral signatures (endmembers) present in each pixel of a hyperspectral image, jointly with their corresponding abundances. The input to sparse unmixing is represented, thus, by a hyperspectral image acquired from a platform flying at high altitude and a spectral library compiled using laboratory measurements. The reflectance datacube results from a complex ensemble of algorithms which translate the digital numbers stored by the sensor to meaningful ground reflectance, including the removal of atmospheric influence. A recurrent question in the research community does not have an answer yet: how does the atmospheric composition at the time of the flight influence the fractional abundances retrieved via sparse unmixing? This is a fundamental question, as the atmospheric parameters are subject to uncertainties, being very difficult to know them in all pixels. In this paper, we investigate how the uncertainty in two atmospheric parameters: water vapor content and visibility range, propagates to the final abundance maps via atmospheric correction of the sensed image. Our experiments reveal that sparse unmixing is more robust to uncertainty in those parameters and performs better in terms of accuracy than unmixing with image-based endmembers.	algorithm;compiler;data cube;experiment;map;pixel;propagation of uncertainty;software propagation;sparse matrix;type signature	Marian-Daniel Iordache;Nitin Bhatia;Jos&#x00E9; M.

692a90fac69edf0fe3e0d31a0613b1b3d22b9df7	investigating the relationship between x-band sar data from cosmo-skymed satellite and ndvi for lai detection	cosmo skymed;deimos 1;normalized difference vegetation index ndvi;cross polarized backscattering;lai	Monitoring spatial and temporal variability of vegetation is important to manage land and water resources, with significant impact on the sustainability of modern agriculture. Cloud cover noticeably reduces the temporal resolution of retrievals based on optical data. COSMO-SkyMed (the new Italian Synthetic Aperture RADAR-SAR) opened new opportunities to develop agro-hydrological applications. Indeed, it represents a valuable source of data for operational use, due to the high spatial and temporal resolutions. Although X-band is not the most suitable to model agricultural and hydrological processes, an assessment of vegetation development can be achieved combing optical vegetation indices (VIs) and SAR backscattering data. In this paper, a correlation analysis has been performed between the crossed horizontal-vertical (HV) backscattering (°HV) and optical VIs (VIopt) on several plots. The correlation analysis was based on incidence angle, spatial resolution and polarization mode. Results have shown that temporal changes of °HV (Δ°HV) acquired with high angles (off nadir angle; θ > 40°) best correlates with variations of VIopt (ΔVI). The correlation between ΔVI and Δ°HV has been shown to be temporally robust. Based on this experimental evidence, a model to infer a VI from ° (VISAR) at the time, ti + 1, once known, the VIopt at a reference time, ti, and Δ°HV between times, ti + 1 and ti, was implemented and verified. This approach has led to the development and validation of an algorithm for coupling a VIopt derived from DEIMOS-1 images and °HV. The study was carried out over the Sele plain (Campania, Italy), which is mainly characterized by herbaceous crops.

Concerning this last application, several techniques compete to ensure the best possible result. In this paper, we aim first at developing an automatic detection procedure to compare between similarity measures. Then we propose a change detection technique based on the fusion of two similarity measures. The first one is the Contrast (C) measure [1] and the second one is the Rayleigh Distribution Ratio (RDR) measure [2]. The proposed method has been validated on simulated data and then applied on three radar images.	3d reconstruction;cartography;radar;rayleigh–ritz method;restrictive design rules	Sami Benzid;Charles Deledalles;Riadh Abdelfattah;Ferdaous Chaabane;Florence Tupin	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5653127	computer vision;computer science;optics;radar imaging;remote sensing	Embedded	73.09458930909044	-63.946365062598474	123628

We focus on detection algorithms derived using established statistical techniques and whose performance is predictable under reasonable assumptions about hyperspectral imaging data. We show that the family of elliptically contoured distributions (ECDs), in general, and the t-ECD, in particular, provide a more accurate model for hyperspectral backgrounds, compared to the widely used multivariate normal distribution. Since many detection algorithms derived for normal distributions apply to ECDs as well, the ECD models provide a better framework for modeling and analyzing hyperspectral imaging data.	algorithm;explanatory combinatorial dictionary	Dimitris Manolakis	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2004.1326495	normal distribution;medical imaging;probability distribution;computer vision;multivariate normal distribution;computer science;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	71.61841336333259	-62.67074006550278	123681

The ability to model the timing and routing of surface water and erosion is affected by the resolution of the digital elevation model (DEM). High resolution ground-based Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR) technology can be used to collect detailed topographic and land cover characteristic data. In this study, a method was developed to remove vegetation from ground-based LiDAR data to create high resolution DEMs. Research was conducted on intensively studied rainfall–runoff plots on the USDA-ARS Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in Southeast Arizona. LiDAR data were used to generate 1 cm resolution digital surface models (DSM) for 5 plots. DSMs created directly from LiDAR data contain non-surface objects such as vegetation cover. A vegetation removal method was developed which used a slope threshold and a focal mean filter method to remove vegetation and create bare earth DEMs. The method was validated on a synthetic plot, where rocks and vegetation were added incrementally. Results of the validation showed a vertical error of ±7.5 mm in the final DEM.	champion of the raj;consortium;digital elevation model;digital geometry;erosion (morphology);focal (programming language);high-resolution scheme;image resolution;routing;sensor;simulation;synthetic data;typset and runoff;topography;watershed (image processing)	Maneesh Sharma;Ginger B.

372d2b47521e0b2fa964e60bf578487507fe04a9	influence of multi-source and multi-temporal remotely sensed and ancillary data on the accuracy of random forest classification of wetlands in northern minnesota	decision tree;classification;random forest;wetland;data integration	Wetland mapping at the landscape scale using remotely sensed data requires both affordable data and an efficient accurate classification method. Random forest classification offers several advantages over traditional land cover classification techniques, including a bootstrapping technique to generate robust estimations of outliers in the training data, as well as the capability of measuring classification confidence. Though the random forest classifier can generate complex decision trees with a multitude of input data and still not run a high risk of over fitting, there is a great need to reduce computational and operational costs by including only key input data sets without sacrificing a significant level of accuracy. Our main questions for this study site in Northern Minnesota were: (1) how does classification accuracy and confidence of mapping wetlands compare using different remote sensing platforms and sets of input data; (2) what are the key input variables for accurate differentiation of upland, water, and wetlands, including wetland type; and (3) which datasets and seasonal imagery yield the best accuracy for wetland classification. Our results show the key input variables include terrain (elevation and curvature) and soils descriptors (hydric), along with an assortment of remotely sensed data collected in the spring (satellite visible, near infrared, and thermal bands; satellite normalized vegetation index and Tasseled Cap greenness and wetness; and horizontal-horizontal (HH) and horizontal-vertical (HV) polarization using L-band satellite radar). We undertook this exploratory analysis to inform decisions by natural resource OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2013, 5 3213 managers charged with monitoring wetland ecosystems and to aid in designing a system for consistent operational mapping of wetlands across landscapes similar to those found in Northern Minnesota.	aerial photography;bootstrapping (compilers);cpu cache;computation;data acquisition;decision tree;ecosystem;google summer of code;image analysis;image segmentation;l band;motorola canopy;multi-source;object-based language;overfitting;polarization (waves);radar;random forest;topography	Jennifer Marie Corcoran;Joseph F.

Size distributions of particles with 0.5-10.0 mum were examined and the daily mean number concentration of aerosols for the situ periods on non-dusty days was 86.7 cm-3. It was 1333.08 cm-3 on windblown dust (WD), 2817.09 cm-3 on light dust storm (LDS) and 4372.58 cm-3 on severe dust storm (SDS). Comparing with Sanggen Dalai (SD), which lies in the inner of HDS, observed during IMGRASS (inner-Mongolia semi-arid grass-land atmosphere surface study) of 2001, the average number concentrations of dust aerosol was 3039.5 cm-3 on SDS , 659.7 cm-3 on LDS, 198.3 cm-3 on WD and 27.7 cm-3 on ND of the inner HDS. The results show that there are more dust aerosols over the board than the inners both on dusty days and non-dusty days, but the mean particles diameter over the inner is larger than the boards.	a history of tibet by the fifth dalai lama of tibet;dust racing 2d;holographic data storage;norsk data;semiconductor industry;storm botnet;wario land: shake it!

Threshold values of these criteria were chosen according to the rate of misclassification set by the experimenter after classification of a training subset of data on the basis of the atmospheric conditions as observed by a variety of rain sensors. A comparison of the discrimination performances indicates that SSI detects light rain events that are missed by both the rain-gauge and TB30 but it suffers from the intrinsic response time of the brightness temperature in the presence of rain. The analysis is referred to 1 year of measurements collected at the ARM SGP facility in Oklahoma.	metric;performance;response time (technology);sensor;server side includes;symposium on geometry processing	Ada Vittoria Bosisio;Maria P.

The classified area in classifications only carried out with radiometric variables or with NDVI and humidity (for crops) increases as image compression increases, although the increase is smaller for JPEG2000 formats and for crops.

Overall image accuracy diminishes at high compression ratios (CR), although the point of inflection occurs at different CR depending on the compression format.

The mapping of impervious surface and its spatial distributions is of significance for the ecological study of urban environment. Currently, the integration of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has shown advantages in accurately characterizing impervious surface. However, the fusion mainly occurs at the pixel and feature levels which are subject to influences of data noises and feature selections, respectively. In this paper, an innovative and effective method was developed to extract urban impervious surface by synergistically utilizing optical and SAR images at the decision level. The objective of this paper was to obtain an accurate urban impervious surface map based on the random forest classifier and the evidence theory and to provide a detailed uncertainty analysis accompanying the fused impervious surface maps. In this study, both the GaoFen (GF-1) and Sentinel-1A imagery were first used as independent data sources for mapping urban impervious surfaces. Then additional spectral features and texture features were extracted and integrated with the original GF-1 and Sentinel-1A images in generating impervious surfaces. Finally, based on the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory, impervious surfaces were produced by fusing the previously estimated impervious surfaces from different datasets at the decision level. Results showed that impervious surfaces estimated from the combined use of original images and features yielded a higher accuracy than those from the original optical or SAR data. Further validations suggested that optical data was better than SAR data in separating impervious surfaces from non-impervious surfaces. The fused impervious surfaces at the decision level had a higher overall accuracy than those produced independently by optical or SAR data. It was also highlighted that the fusion of GF-1 and Sentinel-1A images reduced the amount of confusions among the low reflectance of impervious surface and water, as well as for low reflectance of bare land. An overall accuracy of 95.33% was achieved for extracting urban impervious surfaces by fused datasets. The spatial distributions of uncertainties provided by the evidence theory displayed a confidence level of at least 75% for the impervious surfaces derived from the fused datasets.	algorithm;aperture (software);direct3d;effective method;pixel;radio frequency;random forest;synergy;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence	Zhenfeng Shao;Huyan Fu;Peng Fu;Li Yin	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8110945	hydrology;impervious surface;remote sensing	Vision	80.61740511873522	-58.00802019486148	124743
9728a84808f55d91556a4fdd06d579fc2a67efb2	an efficient algorithm for assignment of flow direction over flat surfaces in raster dems based on distance transform		Flat surfaces or areas with no local gradient are general types of terrain in raster Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). When a DEM is used for automated hydrological analysis, it is necessary to assign flow directions over flat surfaces. This paper presents an improved algorithm for assigning flow directions over flat surfaces that builds on earlier work and offers efficiency improvements. The improved algorithm use distance transform method to calculate the distance values of cells in flat surfaces towards lower terrain and away from higher terrain, which can replace the recursive process in the earlier algorithm by a linear process, and reduce random data access. Furthermore, the improved algorithm assigns weights with different values and signs to the two distance values to guarantee that all flat surfaces are drained, which avoids the need to label each flat surface using the flood-fill algorithm in the earlier work. Comparisons of speed indicate that the improved algorithm is more efficient in assigning flow directions over flat surfaces.	algorithm;data access;digital elevation model;distance transform;experiment;feature extraction;flood fill;gradient;iterative method;randomness;recursion;topography	Cheng Su;Cun-Jun Feng;Xi-Zhi Wang;Zhi-cai Huang;Xiao-Can Zhang	2016	Earth Science Informatics	10.1007/s12145-016-0249-3	mathematical optimization;mathematics;geometry	Visualization	75.24538739414582	-53.61731410575451	124993

The spatial resolution of such spatially sharpened images, such as for the MODIS and Landsat sensors, however, may not be sufficient to provide the required detailed land-cover/land-use information. This paper proposes an area-to-point regression kriging (ATPRK)-based geostatistical solution to increase the spatial resolution of remote sensing images beyond that of any input images, including the PAN band. The new approach is a two-stage approach, including covariate downscaling and ATPRK-based image fusion. The new approach treats the PAN band as the covariate and takes advantages of its textural information. It explicitly accounts for the size of support, spatial correlation, and the point spread function of the sensor and has the characteristic of perfect coherence with the original coarse data. Moreover, the new downscaling approach can be extended readily by incorporating other ancillary information. The proposed approach was examined using both Landsat and MODIS images. The results show that it can produce more accurate sharpened images than four benchmark approaches.	benchmark (computing);downscaling;experiment;high performance fortran;image fusion;kriging;mos technology sid;sam;sensor;wavelet	Qunming Wang;Wenzhong Shi;Peter M.

For the Magellan project, this analysis is complicated by the facts that the Magellan radar is operated in a burst mode, and the Magellan radar maps the surface of Venus from a highly elliptical orbit. An analysis that is general enough so that both the strip mapping mode SAR system and the burst mode SAR system are considered is presented. The final result indicates that the ephemeris data obtained from the Magellan navigation system provides sufficient accuracy for meeting the Magellan image resolution requirement. >		Michael Y.

The bispectral composite threshold (BCT) technique uses only the 11 mum and 3.9 mum channels, and composite imagery generated from these channels, in a four-step cloud detection procedure to produce a binary cloud mask at single pixel resolution. A unique aspect of this algorithm is the use of 20-day composites of the 11 mum and the 11-3.9 mum channel difference imagery to represent spatially and temporally varying clear-sky thresholds for the bispectral cloud tests. The BCT cloud detection algorithm has been applied to GOES and MODIS data over the continental United States over the last three years with good success. The resulting products have been validated against """"truth"""" datasets (generated by the manual determination of the sky conditions from available satellite imagery) for various seasons from the 2003-2005 periods. The day and night algorithm has been shown to determine the correct sky conditions 80-90% of the time (on average) over land and ocean areas. Only a small variation in algorithm performance occurs between day-night, land-ocean, and between seasons. The algorithm performs least well during the winter season with only 80% of the sky conditions determined correctly. The algorithm was found to under-determine clouds at night and during times of low sun angle (in geostationary satellite data) and tends to over-determine the presence of clouds during the day, particularly in the summertime. Since the spectral tests use only the short- and long-wave channels common to most multispectral scanners, the application of the BCT technique to a variety of satellite sensors including SEVERI should be straightforward and produce similar performance results."""	algorithm;day and night (cellular automaton);geosynchronous satellite;köppen climate classification;multispectral image;pixel;sensor	Gary Jedlovec;Stephanie L.

The effect results from atmospheric scattering, depends on the reflectance contrast between a target pixel and its large-scale neighborhood, and decreases with wavelength. Recently, ground reflectance field measurements were published, claiming a substantial influence of the adjacency effect at short distance measurements (< 2 m), and an increase of the effect with wavelength. The authors repeated similar field measurements and found that the adjacency effect usually has a negligible influence at short distances, decreasing with wavelength in agreement with theory, but can have a small influence in high-reflectance contrast environments. Radiative transfer calculations were performed to quantify the influence at short and long distances for cases of practical interest (vegetation and soil in a low-reflectance background). For situations with large reflectance contrasts, the atmospheric backscatter component of the adjacency effect can influence ground measurements over small-area targets, and should therefore be taken into account. However, it is not possible to draw a general conclusion, since some of the considered surfaces are known for exhibiting strong directional effects	airborne ranger;garden of eden (cellular automaton);meadow;paul h. cress;pixel;sensor	Rudolf Richter;Martin Bachmann;Wouter Dorigo;Andreas Müller	2006	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2006.882146	meteorology;radiative transfer;diffuse sky radiation;reflectivity;optics;physics;vegetation;remote sensing	Vision	82.71812168347844	-65.54381448627277	125849

This approach achieves a balance between modeling accuracy and modeling speed. A terrain complexity index is defined to represent a terrain's complexity. A support vector machine (SVM) classifies terrain surfaces into either complex or moderate based on this index associated with the terrain elevation range. The classification result recommends a terrain modeling method for a given data set in accordance with its required modeling accuracy. Sample terrain data from the lunar surface are used in constructing an experimental data set. The results have shown that the terrain complexity index properly reflects the terrain complexity, and the SVM classifier derived from both the terrain complexity index and the terrain elevation range is more effective and generic than that designed from either the terrain complexity index or the terrain elevation range only. The statistical results have shown that the average classification accuracy of SVMs is about 84.3% ± 0.9% for terrain types (complex or moderate). For various ratios of complex and moderate terrain types in a selected data set, the DEM modeling speed increases up to 19.5% with given DEM accuracy.	complexity index;digital elevation model;experiment;support vector machine;test set	Guimin Jia;Xiangjun Wang;Hong Wei	2013	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2012.2226429	support vector machine;computer vision;contextual image classification;digital elevation model;computer science;machine learning;remote sensing	Robotics	78.26711576452354	-57.717060955674526	126374
48787009abd242e4ed9c3118427fefd0dd4f29c6	gunshot residues analysis by endmembers extraction method on hyperspectral images		In crime scene involving gunshot wound, the experts of forensic science analyze the gunshot residues to determine the kind of gun used or muzzle-to-target distance. Sometimes these signs are invisible to the naked eye, for example on dark or coloured fabrics. In this perspective, the SYLLABES project has been proposed to design a multispectral laser imaging device that can be set up on crime scene or in laboratory. The first stage before developing this device is to acquire and analyze hyperspectral images. In order to reveal the gunshot residue on fabrics, endmembers extraction methods have been tested. In this paper, two geometrical methods (OSP and N-FINDR) and a statistical one (ICE) are used and compared on fabric samples provided by forensic experts. The potential of endmembers extraction and unmixing methods to enhance residues, either because they can appear as pure components or because they are revealed by the image of reconstruction error, is assessed.	multispectral image	Celine Meillier;Véronique Achard;Ph.

Hyperspectral datasets acquired over a variety of land cover types are extremely useful in attempting to resolve spectral differences in the global datasets from different sensors. The datasets from the Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) Hyperion sensor are very suitable for this purpose, as is airborne hyperspectral data. In this paper, we examine the possibility of translating vegetation index (VI) data between two sensors by using imagery from the Hyperion sensor and utilizing the vegetation isoline concept. The objectives of this paper are to introduce and test a VI translation technique, focused on the spectral differences associated with sensor spectral bandpass filters. The translation of global VI datasets from one sensor to another requires a methodology applicable over various land cover types and throughout the wide ranges in VI values. To meet these requirements, a technique is proposed that utilizes adjustable translation coefficients, based on an estimation of the leaf area index value relative to a numerical canopy model. The theoretical basis of the proposed translation algorithm is explained in terms of the vegetation isoline concept. Its performance was tested through a numerical experiment with a Hyperion image, focusing on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a representative vegetation index. The results indicate the potential of the isoline-based translation technique for stable translation throughout wide ranges of NDVI values.	airborne ranger;algorithm;coefficient;contour line;hyperion;motorola canopy;numerical analysis;requirement;scott continuity;sensor	Hiroki Yoshioka;Tomoaki Miura;Alfredo R.

aa012bb1f3107f3ed8603654f82aa1cc21cea529	use of unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) for updating farmland cadastral data in areas subject to landslides		The purpose of this study was to verify the applicability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to update cadastral records in areas affected by landslides. Its authors intended to compare the accuracy of coordinates determined using different UAV data processing methods for points which form the framework of a cadastral database, and to find out whether products obtained as a result of such UAV data processing are sufficient to define the extent of changes in the cadastral objects. To achieve this, an experiment was designed to take place at the site of a landslide. The entire photogrammetry mission was planned to cover an area of more than 70 ha. Given the steep grade of the site, the UAV was flown over each line at a different, individually preset altitude, such as to ensure consistent mean shooting distance (height above ground level), and thus, appropriate ground sample distance (GSD; pixel size). The results were analyzed in four variants, differing from each other in terms of the number of control points used and the method of their measurement. This allowed identification of the factors that affect surveying accuracy and the indication of the cadastral data updatable based on an UAV photogrammetric survey.	aerial photography;conceptualization (information science);control point (mathematics);data validation;ground sample distance;height above ground level;orthophoto;p (complexity);photogrammetry;pixel;real time kinematic;requirement;satellite navigation;switzerland;unmanned aerial vehicle	Edyta Puniach;Agnieszka Bieda;Pawel Cwiakala;Anita Kwartnik-Pruc;Piotr Parzych	2018	ISPRS Int.

A dual-frequency CW radar, which estimates the range of a target based on the phase difference between two closely spaced frequencies, has been shown to be a cost-effective approach for range estimation of a moving target. Previous work has shown that the use of Fourier transform and time-frequency analysis techniques provides an estimate of Doppler signature and enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thereby enabling the range estimation of moving targets and significantly improving the estimation accuracy. In this paper, we consider the combined use of these technologies with a synthetic aperture array for the localization of inanimate moving targets. The synthetic array aperture provides the capability of high-resolution spatial localization of inanimate moving targets, as well as determining the orientation of the rotation or vibration.	clutter;displacement mapping;frequency analysis;image resolution;radar;signal-to-noise ratio;synthetic intelligence;time–frequency analysis	Yimin Zhang;Moeness G.

The aim is to be able to detect not only urban extent expansion/shrinking phenomena, but changes that may affect both the two- and the three-dimensional landscape. For fully polarized SAR, we further validate and refine a recently introduced approach based on superpixel segmentation followed by the computation of selected polarimetric parameters and the analysis of the difference among feature vectors using specialized distance metrics. As for dual polarized SAR data, a combination of interferometric and polarimetric features within the same framework is proved to perform decently, but no real advantage if using polarimetry is obtained. Test cases using UAVSAR and Sentinel-l data are presented in support of the proposed techniques.	computation;feature vector;polarimetry	Meiqin Che;Paolo Gamba	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8519237	computer vision;computation;test case;artificial intelligence;polarimetry;feature vector;interferometry;change detection;computer science;coherence (physics)	Embedded	76.10942918896343	-59.2801537365345	128162

Projection-onto-convex-sets (POCS) interpolation can gradually recover missing traces with an iterative algorithm, but its computational cost in a 3D CPU-based implementation is too high for practical applications. We present a computing scheme to speedup 3D POCS interpolation with graphics processing units (GPUs). We accelerate the most timeconsuming part of the 3D POCS algorithm (i.e. Fourier transforms) by taking advantage of a GPU-based Fourier transform library. Other parts are fine-tuned to maximize the utilization of GPU computing resources. We upload the whole input data set to the global memory of the GPUs and reuse it until the final result is obtained. This can avoid low-bandwidth data transfer between CPU and GPUs. We minimize the number of intermediate 3D arrays to save GPU global memory by optimizing the algorithm implementation. This allows us to handle a much larger input data set. When reducing the runtime of our GPU implementation, the coalescing of global memory access and the 3D CUFFT library provides us with the greatest performance improvements. Numerical results show that our scheme is 3–29 times faster than the optimized CPU-based implementation, depending on the size of 3D data set. Our GPU computing scheme allows a significant reduction of computational cost and would facilitate 3D POCS interpolation for practical applications. & 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in many applications, such as flood modeling and landslide prediction, digital terrain models (DTMs), the topography of the bare-Earth surface, are needed. This paper introduces a novel machine learning approach to automatically extract DTMs from their corresponding DSMs. We first classify each point as being either ground or nonground, using supervised learning techniques applied to a variety of features. For the points which are classified as ground, we use the LiDAR measurements as an estimate of the surface height, but, for the nonground points, we have to interpolate between nearby values, which we do using a Gaussian random field. Since our model contains both discrete and continuous latent variables, and is a discriminative (rather than generative) probabilistic model, we call it a hybrid conditional random field. We show that a Maximum a Posteriori estimate of the surface height can be efficiently estimated by using a variant of the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that the accuracy of this learning-based approach outperforms the previous best systems, based on manually tuned heuristics.	airborne ranger;conditional random field;digital elevation model;digital geometry;expectation–maximization algorithm;heuristic (computer science);interpolation;latent variable;machine learning;point cloud;statistical model;supervised learning;term (logic);topography	Wei-Lwun Lu;Kevin P.

However, as LiDAR systems use a single light wavelength, the intensity has had little value for advanced material classification. With the advent of multispectral LiDAR systems, it may be possible to use the LiDAR intensity in multiple spectral bands to assist in automated target recognition. Towards this end, we present a comparison between LiDAR intensity images and passive reflectance from a hyperspectral imaging system in the same spectral bands. Although qualitatively the LiDAR intensity and hyperspectral imagery show good agreement, a quantitative analysis shows there are significant deviations between their respective reflectance measurements, particularly for complex features such as trees.	multispectral image;oren–nayar reflectance model;synthetic intelligence;tree (data structure)	Preston J.

The mission goal is to be able to provide CLARREO reference observations that are matched in temporal and angular domains with measurements from the aforementioned instruments, with sampling sufficient to overcome the random error sources from imperfect data matching. The inter-calibration method is to monitor changes in targeted sensor response function parameters: effective offset, gain, nonlinearity, spectral response function, and sensitivity to polarization. In this paper, we focus on estimating uncertainty for inter-calibration of imaging sensors such as VIIRS.	angularjs;frequency response;lutz pathfinder;nonlinear system;polarization (waves);sampling (signal processing);sensor	Constantine Lukashin;D.

As part of this role, continual improvements are made to techniques that are employed in monitoring compliance of seismic field operations with environmental requirements. An innovative airborne video monitoring system has been developed to improve the effectiveness of assessing seismic field outcomes on the environment. This system increases the efficiency and effectiveness of monitoring extensive seismic lines in often environmentally sensitive or logistically challenging areas. This system complements traditional ground-based methods of inspecting seismic operations. The aim of the system is to ensure that correct procedures are employed during seismic line preparation and that appropriate restorative work is carried out, to facilitate natural recovery of seismic lines. The primary characteristics of the surveillance system are that it enables a stable and continuous video recording of large amounts of seismic lines in a short time, observations are environmentally non-invasive and observations can be made over terrain that may otherwise be difficult to access by ground-based systems. The airborne system has been developed using low-cost, compact, readily available and proven technologies and equipment.

Key to their success is the accurate and rapid characterisation of physical features (i.e., hydromorphology) along the river. Image pattern recognition techniques have been successfully used for this purpose. The reliability of the methodology depends on both the quality of the aerial imagery and the pattern recognition technique used. Recent studies have proved the potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to increase the quality of the imagery by capturing high resolution photography. Similarly, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been shown to be a high precision tool for automated recognition of environmental patterns. This paper presents a UAV based framework for the identification of hydromorphological features from high resolution RGB aerial imagery using a novel classification technique based on ANNs. The framework is developed for a 1.4 km river reach along the river Dee in Wales, United Kingdom. For this purpose, a Falcon 8 octocopter was used to gather 2.5 cm resolution imagery. The results show that the accuracy of the framework is above 81%, performing particularly well at recognising vegetation. These results leverage the use of UAVs for environmental policy implementation and demonstrate the potential of ANNs and RGB imagery for high precision river monitoring and river management.	aerial photography;artificial neural network;cpu (central processing unit of computer system);central processing unit;ecology;environmental policy;falcon;guided imagery;image resolution;level of detail;pattern recognition;unmanned aerial vehicle	Monica Rivas Casado;Rocio Ballesteros Gonzalez;Thomas Kriechbaumer;Amanda Veal	2015		10.3390/s151127969	feature recognition;text mining;telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;data mining;nanotechnology;artificial neural network;photogrammetry;remote sensing	Vision	79.01484394646094	-56.044565288972834	129761

Firstly, the basic characteristics of the radargrammetry are described. Thus, we present the results of the radargrammetric processing using the ZNCC procedure and applied to radar images. These images are recorded by the SIR-C mission over the French Alps. The results show that the image matching can fail, especially in foreshortened areas. So, we expose two different improvement methods using several correlation windows in order to cancel the reconstruction errors. The first improvement take advantage of a multi-window approach to combine information multiplying the correlation surfaces obtained for each correlation window size. The second improvement is based on another multi-window approach that makes it possible to get correlation windows adapted to the foreshortened areas. Finally, we combine these two improvement methods to show that it's possible to make the disparity map more reliable for the first step of the pyramidal scheme.	binocular disparity;image registration;microsoft windows;radar;relevance;stereoscopy	Franck Fayard;Stephane Meric;Eric Pottier	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5653408	iterative reconstruction;database index;computer vision;computer science;optics;radar imaging;correlation;pixel;remote sensing	Robotics	75.84665841248768	-64.72487860848787	129852

This framework is based on a processing which provides highly sparsifiable representations of data. This processing is called turbo-median and is a combination of the sample median robustness and the turbo principle for iteratively correcting errors. The turbo-median processing of a scene is an homogenized representation based on an iterative median and which consists in spreading the statistically more robust measurements of the scene under consideration over the size of the image representing this scene. It allows for reducing the change detection problem into the problem of detecting a signal, with unknown distribution, in additive noise.	additive white gaussian noise;collision detection;iterative method;radar;sensor;sparse matrix;turbo code;utility functions on indivisible goods	Abdourrahmane M.

A remote watershed on Mindanao (Philippines) is used to showcase the approach, which hypothesizes that the accuracy of expert knowledge gained from remote sensing techniques can be further enhanced by inputs from vernacular knowledge when attempting to understand complex land mosaics and past land-use changes. Six participatory sessions based on focus-group discussions were conducted. These were enhanced by community-based land-use mapping, resulting in a final total of 21 participatory land-use maps (PLUMs) co-produced by a sample of stakeholders with different sociocultural and ecological perspectives. In parallel, seven satellite images (Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+, and SPOT4) were classified following standard techniques and provided snapshots for the years 1976, 1996, and 2010. Local knowledge and collective memory contributed to define and qualify relevant land-use classes. This also provided information about what had caused the land-use changes in the past. Results show that combining PA with remote-sensing analysis provides a unique understanding of land-cover change because the two methods complement and validate one another. Substantive qualitative information regarding the chronology of land-cover change was obtained in a short amount of time across an area poorly covered by scientific literature. The remote sensing techniques contributed to test and to quantify verbal reports of land-use and land-cover change by stakeholders. We conclude that the method is particularly relevant to data-poor areas or conflict zones where rapid reconnaissance work is the only available option. It provides a preliminary but accurate baseline for capturing land changes and for reporting their causes and consequences. A discussion of the main challenges encountered (i.e. how to combine different systems of knowledge), and options for further methodological improvements, are also provided. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

5c1126b86499ec8deb064783fe8ba61286e1ade4	impact of wavelength shift in relative spectral response at high angles of incidence in landsat-8 operational land imager and future landsat design concepts		The Landsat program plays an important role in providing continuous long-term multispectral moderate resolution observations of the earth’s surface. There is an interest by the community to improve the temporal sampling in future generations of the sensors. One way to achieve higher sampling is to collect imagery with a wider swath. For future instruments using multilayer dielectric filters for band selection, this has the further implication that light may enter the filters on the detectors at a higher angle of incidence, which will shift the center wavelength of the spectral bandpasses. Through simulation of a forest environment this paper explored the impact of this effect on measured spectral radiance and the normalized vegetation difference index. The effect is quantified both for angles of incidence seen in the current Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager as well as for pushbroom designs with up to 13° off-axis imaging. Results indicate the effect will be significant compared to instrument noise and comparable to the limit of current requirements on filter manufacturing tolerances.	image sensor;incidence matrix;multispectral image;optic axis of a crystal;requirement;sampling (signal processing);simulation	Zhaoyu Cui;John P.

This paper investigates in the polarimetric scattering of several types of ships like hospital ship, LPD (Landing Platform Dock), container ship and oil tanker. The scattering characteristics of every ships pixel is got by using polarimetric decompositions such as Pauli decomposition, SDH (Sphere-Dihedral-Helix) decomposition, Freeman-Durden decomposition, Moriyama decomposition, Yamaguchi decomposition and Cameron decomposition. Then the scattering types of every pixel are fused by voting mechanism. Based on scattering mechanism, the scatterings are merged to four scattering types: sphere scattering, diplane scattering, volume scattering and other scattering. So the polarimetric scattering information of ships has been got. It is shown that hospital ship, LPD, container ship and oil tanker have different polarimetric scattering information. This is useful for ship classification and ship identification.

It can significantly suppress the spikes induced by periodical data gaps and, at the same time, enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the obtained ScanSAR imagery. This approach has a great potential in the interferometric context. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by both simulated and real ScanSAR data with different types of terrain. All the experimental data were acquired by the C-band SAR system with a bandwidth of 200 MHz, which was developed by the Department of Space Microwave Remote Sensing System, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.	academy;advanced intelligent tape;algorithm;aperture (software);holographic interferometry;interpolation;longest prefix match;microwave;signal-to-noise ratio;synthetic data	Ning Li;Robert Wang;Yunkai Deng;Jiaqi Chen;Zhimin Zhang;Yabo Liu;Zhihuo Xu;Fengjun Zhao	2015	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2014.2384594	medical imaging;aperture;computer vision;synthetic aperture radar;interpolation;azimuth;optics;radar imaging;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	77.31196504331331	-65.80382726829525	130379
5c95e2b044288c85d1bc255036f72d80887d4412	mapping land cover from remotely sensed data with a softened feedforward neural network classification	feedforward neural network;fuzzy classification;remote sensing data;remote sensing;land cover mapping;land cover;soft classification;neural network	Remote sensing has considerable potential as a source of data for land cover mapping. This potential remains to be fully realised due, in part, to the methods used to extract land cover information from the remotely sensed data. Widely used statistical classifiers provide a poor representation of land cover, make untenable assumptions about the data and convey no information on the quality of individual class allocations. This paper shows that a softened classification, providing information on the strength of membership to all classes for each image pixel, may be derived from a neural network. This information may be used to indicate classification quality on a per-pixel basis.

Hence, the computational load associated with interpolation is also reduced. For the case where no restrictions are placed on the sampling rates of the scanner, a set of projection angles along with their corresponding sampling rates are derived such that no interpolation is required to calculate the final image points for the display grid. From this result a reduced interpolation scheme is developed for the case when upper and lower bounds exist on the sampling rates. A discussion is presented on the choice of an optimal set of projection angles that will maintain an image quality comparable to a sampling scheme of regular measurement geometry, while minimizing the computational load. The Cartesian-grid scanning and sampling (CGSS) scheme developed here is compared to a sampling scheme of regular measurement geometry through a computer simulation. The results demonstrate that for higher sampling rates and images of limited pixel dimension, the CGSS scheme can reduce the computational load of the reconstruction process and maintain comparable image quality.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;ct scan;computer simulation;image quality;interpolation;pixel;regular grid;sampling (signal processing);tomography	Kevin D.

2dad80229ecf2feab6ff141dab657f1cd35d46ad	bidirectional reflectance and texture database of printed special effect colors		A research project is underway to create a bidirectional reflectance and texture database of printed special effect colors. Such data is needed in the printing industry to determine the required measuring geometries characterizing the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) and texture function (BTF), to develop quality measures for process control, and to simulate the prints’ appearance on displays (soft proofing). Flexo printing was used to apply 28 special effect inks with three tonal values on a matt and glossy paper substrate. The inks were selected to cover a wide range of different pigment classes and with respect to their demand in the printing market. To allow for multiple usage scenarios the inks were printed on a black and white background and partly finished with a glossy varnish resulting in a total of 672 different samples. The patches were measured in a preliminary stage with the BYK-mac multi-angle spectrophotometer. Evaluations on the diversity of the samples in terms of selected appearance parameters such as color flop or sparkle intensity are determined based on these measurements. The data is provided on our website and will be supplemented with additional measurements performed by a gonio-imaging system. Introduction In high-quality printing, e.g. in packaging, special effect inks are applied more frequently. The unique visual appearance, such as sparkle or geometry-induced color shifts, is caused by the optical properties of the comprised special effect pigments. Printing on top of particular background colors or applying gloss varnish might further boost these features. A major problem in the industry is the absence of a quality measure for process control if special effect inks are used. Desired effects are realized in a try-and-error manner that is time consuming and costly. Much research effort is needed to find the relevant appearance dimensions and to establish a visual distance measure for defining tolerances and to control the printing process. Furthermore, measuring geometries need to be determined that allow a sufficiently accurate estimation of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) or the Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF) of special effect prints. A database with BRDFs and BTFs of printed special effect prints covering a large number of pigment types and usage scenarios is required for this research. This paper describes an ongoing project of creating such a database including the selection of pigments and additional process steps for modifying the appearance of the final print. Bidirectional spectral and color data of the samples as well as texture parameters measured with a commercial multi-angle spectrophotometer are provided on our website. In addition to the needs in the printing industry, this database could be an interesting source for computer graphic rendering and complement existing databases such as MERL [1], CUReT [2] or the Artist Material BRDF Database [3].	bidirectional reflectance distribution function;bidirectional texture function;color;database;flops;gloss (annotation);pigment;printing;simulation;sparkle;web colors	Katharina Kehren;Philipp Urban;Edgar Dörsam	2011			computer graphics (images)	Graphics	70.53201257769355	-55.92738330512101	131384

We analyze JERS-1 SAR data pairs straddling the occurrence of the 1995 Hyogoken-nanbu earthquake. The distribution patterns of the pixels which indicated interferometric decorrelation correspond well with the building damaged area reported by the ground survey. The degree of decorrelation shows obvious correlation with the damaged building ratio on the area in each block and measured seismic intensity from strong motion data. The result of this study indicates a fact that the building damage causes the interferometric decorrelation. We also try to extract the urban area damaged by the 2001 Gujrat (western India) earthquake using Radarsat data. For practical use of interferometric decorrelation to detect the urban damage, effect of building type and urban concentration should be examined. These results show the applicability for interferometric analysis of SAR data to urban disaster management.	decorrelation	Chinatsu Yonezawa;Nobuhiro Tomiyama;Shoji Takeuchi	2002		10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1026441	seismology;disaster;synthetic aperture radar;decorrelation;geodesy;computer science;data analysis;emergency management;remote sensing	ML	81.22167502113972	-58.6810681700682	132128

To improve the quality of results in the high-noise low-signal environment, we introduce a temporal correlation averaging (TCA) scheme that merges a small number of correlation surfaces in the time domain. The TCA scheme is combined with a multi-size macroblock (MMB) sampling method that provides correlation scores from four different macroblock sizes. The TCA scheme is also used in conjunction with a signal-level indicator computed on the macroblock. The signal-level indicator is used to reject correlation scores prior to computation and helps to keep noisy results out of the TCA. These modifications were tested by comparing LSPIV calculations to Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler measurements. The percent difference of measured velocity between LSPIV with TCA and MMB and without TCA and MMB when compared to the ADCP was reduced by as much as 30%. The low processing cost of our modifications along with an efficient multithread implementation of LSPIV facilitates high speed processing of up to a few thousand vector points at rates that exceed the capture speed of common hardware. HighlightsWe introduce a modified LSPIV method that uses temporal correlation averaging.Results from the modified LSPIV method were compared with ADCP results.Agreement between ADCP and LSPIV is improved when using our modifications.Processing speed remains consistent with unmodified LSPIV.	velocity (software development)	David W.

However, the SAR image provides an incomplete information (as roads) of the observed scene leading thus to an ambiguous interpretation. In order to compensate the lack of features, the high spatial resolution panchromatic (P) image is often used as a complementary data for improving the quality of the SAR image. The concept is based on the extraction of features (details) from the P image in order to incorporate into the SAR image. Therefore, we propose an approach based on the use of the à trous wavelet decomposition (ATWD) for extracting features from the P image. Experimental results show that the SAR-P composite image allows a better detection of lines, edges, and field boundaries.	coefficient;high performance fortran;image fusion;image sensor;interpretation (logic);singular value decomposition;synthetic data;wavelet transform	Youcef Chibani	2005	EURASIP J.

0edf61c3bff34942b80e539d6bb9cf23bd49bb44	rapid dehazing algorithm based on large-scale median filtering for high-resolution visible near-infrared remote sensing images	median filtering;dehazing;high resolution remote sensing image	In recent years, China’s demand for satellite remote sensing images increased. Thus, the country launched a series of satellites equipped with high-resolution sensors. The resolutions of these satellites range from 30m to a few meters, and the spectral range covers the visible to the near-infrared band. These satellite images are mainly used for environmental monitoring, mapping, land surface classification and other fields. However, haze is an important factor that often affects image quality. Thus, dehazing technology is becoming a critical step in high-resolution remote sensing image processing. This paper presents a rapid algorithm for dehazing based on a semi-physical haze model. Largescale median filtering technique is used to extract large areas of bright, low-frequency information from images to estimate the distribution and thickness of the haze. Four images from different satellites are used for experiment. Results show that the algorithm is valid, fast, and suitable for the rapid dehazing of numerous large-sized high-resolution remote sensing images in engineering applications.	algorithm;circuit restoration;computation;effective method;experiment;homomorphic filtering;image processing;image quality;image resolution;image restoration;median filter;semiconductor industry;sensor;thickness (graph theory);wavelet transform	Chang-Miao Hu;Ping Tang	2014	IJWMIP	10.1142/S0219691314610104	median filter;computer vision	Graphics	76.8375807014563	-61.36456445223957	132444

The instrument is operating in a noncryogenic balancing calibration mode. Since its deployment, features have been observed in the spectrum which can be attributed to resonant variations of the antenna pattern of the corrugated horn. This paper presents copolar and crosspolar antenna pattern measurements of two sister antennas of the SWARA horn, as well as water vapor measurements from both antennas on the ground-based microwave radiometer MI ddle Atmospheric WAter vapor RA diometer. We show that small irregularities in the frequency spectrum at the -20-dB level are visible in the copolar pattern, which, due to the balancing operation scheme used for the radiometer, lead to features in the spectrum that have the same or even higher brightness temperature as the line of interest.	chemical vapor deposition;microwave;radiation pattern;software deployment;spectral density;traffic collision avoidance system	Evelyn De Wachter;Axel Murk;Corinne Straub;Alexander Haefele;Soohyun Ka;Jung Jin Oh;Niklaus Kämpfer	2009	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2008.2005851	meteorology;spectrum;atmospheric temperature;frequency spectrum;calibration;radiometry;atmospheric sciences;resonance;water vapor;radiometer;microwave radiometer;brightness temperature;stratosphere;mesosphere;physics;remote sensing	Mobile	81.9675305033492	-64.72085084392073	132543
7b71224fa13b4b57045ebc358853796badf0781c	matched filtering method for separating magnetic anomaly using fractal model	fractal multifractal;spectral analysis;matched filtering;magnetic field separation	Fractal/scaling distribution of magnetization in the crust has found with growing body of evidences from spectral analysis of borehole susceptibility logs and magnetic field data, and fractal properties of magnetic sources have already been considered in processing magnetic data such as the Spector and Grant method for depth determination. In this study, the fractal-based matched filtering method is presented for separating magnetic anomalies caused by fractal sources. We argue the benefits of considering fractal natures of source distribution for data processing in magnetic exploration: the first is that the depth determination can be improved by using multiscaling model to interpret the magnetic data power spectrum; the second is that the matched filtering can be reconstructed by employing the difference in scaling exponent together with the corrected depth and amplitude estimates. In the application of synthetic data obtained from fractal modeling and real aeromagnetic data from the Qikou district of China, the proposed fractal-based matched filtering method obtains more reliable depth estimations as well as improved separation between local anomalies (caused by volcanic rocks) and regional field (crystalline basement) in comparison with the conventional matched filtering method. Fractal-based matched filtering method is proposed for separating magnetic anomalies.Multifractal model is used to improve depth determination when using spectral method.Fractal-based MF is used to identify volcanic magnetic anomalies in Dagang oilfield.	anomaly detection;fractal;matched filter	Guo-Xiong Chen;Qiuming Cheng;Henglei Zhang	2016	Computers & Geosciences	10.1016/j.cageo.2016.02.015	statistics	AI	74.23594208608138	-64.86876827217093	132701

Cloud monitoring is a prime method to observe, describe and understand present climate on Titan. Unlike our previous detection method, which was based on manual control of threshold, we investigate here the possibility of a fully automated methodology based on blind source separation to analyzing years of Cassini near-infrared cloud images. Since the spectral signature of Titan clouds are diverse and not known a priori, the choice of a blind source separation seems to be appropriate. Preliminary results show that Titan's cloud detection is possible using the recent implementation of a Bayesian source separation method.	algorithm;blind signal separation;huygens software;source separation;tag cloud;titan	Sébastien Rodriguez;Frédéric Schmidt;Saïd Moussaoui;Stéphane Le Mouélic;Pascal Rannou;Jason W.

We used the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to extract water features and we also used spatial differentiation and thresholding techniques to remove clouds and associated shadows from the scene that were then passed through gap filling algorithms to complete and extract the lake extent polygons. We also explored the challenges that arrive from trying to combine RS-based Digital Elevation Model data with locally collected bathymetric data to yield a seamless representation of the topographic features of the rift valley that contains the two lakes. This “bathtub” model was then meshed with the lake extent polygons to compute lake volumes, maximum depths, and geospatially referenced lake levels rating curves. We used this data to examine the lakes and their geospatial characteristics in the context of the lakes’ growth/shrinking patterns. While we did not carry out a full hydrologic analysis we attempted to illuminate how specific lake levels cause what type of flooding and especially answered the questions if (a) Lake Azuei would ever spill into Lake Enriquillo, and (b) what the maximum lake levels need to be before spilling into neighboring watersheds.	algorithm;bathymetry;body identification;digital elevation model;emoticon;seamless3d;thresholding (image processing);time series;topography	Mahrokh Moknatian;Michael Piasecki;Jorge Gonzalez	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9060510	rating curve;hydrology;bathymetry;ecology;remote sensing	Visualization	81.9510035203869	-56.91069069940829	133157

In such circumstances, it may be difficult to ascertain whether a change in a metric is due to landscape pattern change or due to the inherent variability in multi-temporal data. This study builds on this important consideration and proposes a rank-based metric selection process through computation of four difference-based indices (β, γ, ξ and θ) using a Max–Min/Max normalization approach. Land cover classification was carried out for two contrasting provinces, the Liverpool Range (LR) and Liverpool Plains (LP), of the Brigalow Belt South Bioregion (BBSB) of NSW, Australia. Landsat images, Multi Spectral Scanner (MSS) of 1972–1973 and TM of 1987–1988, 1993–1994, 1999–2000 and 2009–2010 were classified using object-based image analysis methods. A total of 30 landscape metrics were computed and their sensitivities towards variation in spatial and temporal resolutions, number of land cover classes and dominant land cover categories were evaluated by computing a score based on Max–Min/Max normalization. The landscape metrics selected on the basis of the proposed methods (Diversity index (MSIDI), Area weighted mean patch fractal dimension (SHAPE_AM), Mean core area (CORE_MN), Total edge (TE), No. of patches (NP), Contagion index (CONTAG), Mean nearest neighbor index (ENN_MN) and Mean patch fractal dimension (FRAC_MN)) were successful and effective in identifying changes over five different change periods. Major changes in land cover pattern after 1993 were observed, and though the trends were similar in both cases, the LP region became more fragmented than the LR. The proposed method was straightforward to apply, and can deal with multiple metrics when selection of an appropriate set can become difficult.	apply;computation;core (optical fiber);experiment;fractal dimension;heart rate variability;image analysis;lr parser;landscape ecology;liverpool;maxima and minima;object-based language;sensor;test engineer;topography	Priyakant Sinha;Lalit Kumar;Nick Reid	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8020107	contextual image classification;image resolution;temporal resolution;landscape;ecology;correlation;change detection;statistics;remote sensing	ML	81.51050263897919	-56.38306825436828	133469

The voxel-based technique offers accurate 3D shape reconstruction by integrating information obtained from multiple images; however, it requires huge computation time for the reconstruction. Our main approach is parallel processing by voxel space division, which divides the voxel space by planes along with the lines passing through a virtual view point and assigns the process for each divided voxel space to a processing element (PE) individually. This makes it possible to reduce the amount of inter-PE communication. In addition to this, we introduce a method to decrease the amount of computation by controlling iteration count of iterative process for each voxel. Experimental results show that our method more efficiently reduces the computation time than simple horizontal domain division method.	computation;iteration;parallel computing;time complexity;voxel space	Naoki Sekiguchi;Masaru Fukushi;Toru Abe;Tetsuo Kinoshita	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2010.5652277	iterative reconstruction;parallel processing;computer vision;surface reconstruction;shape;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;accuracy and precision;statistics;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	68.91834231099307	-53.976767147715954	133696

The noise injection method, known from its inherent stability, was selected in order to meet the challenging requirement. An additional challenge is the fact that in orbit the NIR has only one really well known external target, namely the deep space. With the noise injection method one-point calibration is in principle possible, since the noise injection level can be determined with one known target. A series of measurements over relevant temperature ranges were carried out with the prototype in order to establish the temperature dependence, which is a critical factor of the overall stability. The results show that after the losses of the antenna and its connecting network are accounted for, due to the one-point calibration, an additional correction algorithm is needed to compensate for the thermal variations. Various correction algorithms were utilized and evaluated. It was shown that by using a well-designed correction algorithm the required performance is indeed achievable	algorithm;microwave imaging radiometer with aperture synthesis;noise generator;prototype	Andreas Colliander;Simo Tauriainen;Tuomo Auer;Josu Uusitalo;Martti Toikka;Martti Hallikainen	2004	IGARSS 2004. 2004 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1368518	meteorology;near-infrared spectroscopy;radiometry;water content;temperature;aperture synthesis;optics;physics;remote sensing	EDA	82.06557632245145	-64.97100525662285	133779

It is the next satellite mission to obtain global precipitation measurements following success of TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission). The GPM core satellite is equipped with a dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) operating at Ku- (13.6 GHz) and Ka- (35.5 GHz) band. DPR on aboard the GPM core satellite is expected to improve our knowledge of precipitation processes relative to the single-frequency (Ku-band) radar used in TRMM by providing greater dynamic range, more detailed information on microphysics, and better accuracies in rainfall and liquid water content retrievals. New Ka- band channel observation of DPR helps to improve the detection thresholds for light rain and snow relative to TRMM PR [1]. The dual-frequency signals allow us to distinguish regions of liquid, frozen, and mixed-phase precipitation. In this paper, an evaluation of the profile classification module is presented.

Simultaneous measurements of ice sheet elevation were also made using a laser altimeter. In outlet glacier areas along the ice sheet margin, the ice surface is characterized by a very rough, crevassed surface near the calving front. The rough ice surface generates signal clutter, which can mask the bottom echo. We are developing a technique to remove the surface clutter component from the signal to reveal the bottom echo, providing a complete ice thickness survey to the calving front of outlet glaciers. This technique makes use of a dense array of ice surface elevation measurements provided by the laser altimeter to characterize surface roughness. Surface roughness parameters are then used in a backscatter model to characterize the clutter waveform, which can be subsequently removed from the radar signal.	airborne ranger;backscatter (email);clutter;coherence (physics);radar;rough set;thickness (graph theory);waveform	David Braaten;Sivaprasad Gogineni	2002		10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1026488	meteorology;lidar;sea ice thickness;geomorphology;glaciology;surface roughness;elevation;geology;ice sheet;sea ice concentration;clutter;remote sensing	Graphics	81.3243589416333	-64.63478127849643	134658

63ab9a2a1f53d0f982b684f0c47afece48498e0b	blind spatial unmixing of multispectral images: new methods combining sparse component analysis, clustering and non-negativity constraints	blind source separation;sparse component analysis;clustering;correlation;non negativity constraints;multispectral spatial unmixing	Remote sensing has become an unavoidable tool for better managing our environment, generally by realizing maps of land cover using classification techniques. Traditional classification techniques assign only one class (e.g., water, soil, grass) to each pixel of remote sensing images. However, the area covered by one pixel contains more than one surface component and results in the mixture of these surface components. In such situations, classical classification is not acceptable for many major applications, such as environmental monitoring, agriculture, mineral exploration and mining, etc. Most methods proposed for treating this problem have been developed for hyperspectral images. On the contrary, there are very few automatic techniques suited to multispectral images. In this paper, we propose new unsupervised spatial methods (called 2D-CorrNLS and 2D-Corr-NMF) in order to unmix each pixel of a multispectral image for better recognizing the surface components constituting the observed scene. These methods are related to the blind source separation (BSS) problem, and are based on sparse component analysis (SCA), clustering and non-negativity constraints. Our approach consists in first identifying the mixing matrix involved in this BSS problem, by using the first stage of a spatial correlation-based SCA method with very limited source sparsity constraints, combined with clustering. Non-negative least squares (NLS) or non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) methods are then used to extract spatial sources. An important advantage of our proposed methods is their applicability to the possibly globally underdetermined, but locally (over)determined BSS model in multispectral remote sensing images. Experiments based on realistic synthetic mixtures and real multispectral images collected by the Landsat ETM+ and the Formosat-2 sensors are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. We also show that our methods significantly outperform the sequential maximum angle convex cone (SMACC) method.	blind signal separation;cluster analysis;convex cone;map;mean squared error;multispectral image;negativity (quantum mechanics);non-negative least squares;non-negative matrix factorization;pixel;sensor;source separation;sparse matrix;statistical classification;synthetic data;unsupervised learning	Moussa Sofiane Karoui;Yannick Deville;Shahram Hosseini;Abdelaziz Ouamri	2012	Pattern Recognition	10.1016/j.patcog.2012.05.008	computer vision;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;multispectral pattern recognition;blind signal separation;cluster analysis;correlation	ML	69.43027041127506	-65.94237841250694	134740
3c96f7d49054d2cb26be118cd63e4c4ed36d51ef	drift removal by means of alternating least squares with application to herschel data	image formation;least squares;infrared imaging	We consider the problem of reconstructing an image observed with a linear, noisy instrument, the output of which is affected by a drift too, causing a slowly varying deviation of the readouts from the baseline level. Since the joint estimation of the image and the drift, which is the optimal approach, is demanding for large data, we consider an alternative approach, where we remove the drift and the noise in two separate steps. In particular, we remove the drift by means of Least Squares (LS) and the noise by means of Generalised Least Squares (GLS). Moreover, we introduce an efficient drift removal algorithm, based on Alternating Least Squares (ALS), and carry out an analysis which proves convergence and gives geometrical insight. Finally, we apply the approach to the Herschel satellite data, discussing the performance and showing that nearly optimal results are achieved. HighlightsWe consider the image formation problem for a large dataset, affected by drift and correlated noise.We present an efficient, near optimal approach, based on drift estimation and removal.We introduce an efficient, iterative algorithm to carry out the drift removal.We carry out an analysis of the algorithm, proving convergence and giving geometrical insight.We discuss the application of the approach to the ESA Herschel satellite data.	herschel graph;least squares	Lorenzo Piazzo;Pasquale Panuzzo;Michele Pestalozzi	2015	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2014.09.039	computer vision;econometrics;mathematical optimization;computer science;engineering;mathematics;least squares;image formation;statistics	ML	71.23379878020754	-65.98486866725665	134802

The JSEG segmentation method has been found to produce meaningful image segmentation results. Nevertheless, its outcome turned out not to be sufficient to match the semantic meaning required for forest vegetation. To overcome this conceptual limitation the combination with wavelet transformation gives access to additional texture features and leads to robust forest boundaries. Preliminary results are encouraging, especially without any subjective decisions. The ongoing research focuses on the integration of digital terrain and surface data and other texture features in order to increase accuracy and robustness of forest delineation.

The PATH mission will place a microwave atmospheric sounder, operating in the same temperature and water vapor bands used by the low-earth-orbiting Advanced Microwave Sounding Units (AMSU), into geostationary orbit. The objective is to enable time-continuous observations of severe storms, tropical cyclones and atmospheric processes associated with the hydrologic cycle under all weather conditions. The ultimate goal is to improve models in these areas, provide initial conditions and assimilation data for improved forecasts, and develop long time series to support climate studies. Both NOAA and NASA have long sought to develop such a sensor, but it is only recently that new techniques have emerged that enable such a mission. The Geostationary Synthetic Thinned Aperture Radiometer (GeoSTAR) is a microwave sounder concept based on aperture synthesis that has been developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A small proof-of-concept prototype was completed in 2006 under the NASA Instrument Incubator Program, and this demonstrator proves that the aperture synthesis method is a feasible approach for attaining the very large aperture required for adequate spatial resolution. The performance of the prototype and projections to a full-scale space version indicate that GeoSTAR, unlike alternative approaches, can meet all measurement requirements. It is therefore now considered the baseline PATH payload and is expected to be implemented by NASA in the next decade.	automatic sounding;baseline (configuration management);data assimilation;full scale;geo (microformat);initial condition;microwave;numerical aperture;prototype;requirement;scale space;sensor;synthetic data;time series	Bjorn H Lambrigtsen;Shannon T.

How and why did it all go wrong for Venus? What lessons can be learned about the life story of terrestrial planets in general, in this era of discovery of Earth-like exoplanets? Were the radically different evolutionary paths of Earth and Venus driven solely by distance from the Sun, or do internal dynamics, geological activity, volcanic outgassing and weathering also play an important part? EnVision is a proposed ESA Medium class mission designed to take Earth Observation technology to Venus to measure its current rate of geological activity, determine its geological history, and the origin and maintenance of its hostile atmosphere, to understand how Venus and Earth could have evolved so differently. EnVision will carry three instruments: the Venus Emission Mapper (VEM); the Subsurface Radar Sounder (SRS); and VenSAR, a world-leading European phased array synthetic aperture radar that is the subject of this article. VenSAR will obtain images at a range of spatial resolutions from 30 m regional coverage to 1 m images of selected areas; an improvement of two orders of magnitude on Magellan images; measure topography at 15 m resolution vertical and 60 m spatially from stereo and InSAR data; detect cm-scale change through differential InSAR, to characterise volcanic and tectonic activity, and estimate rates of weathering and surface alteration; and characterise of surface mechanical properties and weathering through multi-polar radar data. These data will be directly comparable with Earth Observation radar data, giving geoscientists unique access to an Earthsized planet that has evolved on a radically different path to our own, offering new insights on the Earth-sized exoplanets across the galaxy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Nowadays, with the rapid development in airborne LiDAR techniques, extraction of the multi-scale topographical features from high-resolution topographic data acquired via airborne LiDAR would lead to fundamentally new understandings of earth essential to mapping flood, landslide and mud-rock flow hazards for decision makers. In this paper, we define topographic features in a multi-scale manner using a center-surround operator on Gaussian-weighted mean curvatures. These multi-scale topographical features would allow improved detecting, understanding and prediction of flood inundation, landslide and mud-rock flow likelihood. For example, experimental results identify that proposed method can be employed for detecting landslide.	airborne ranger;feature extraction;flood fill;image resolution;mud;sensor;topography	Zhi Wang;Huiying Li;Lixin Wu	2010	2010 18th International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567875	geomorphology;geography;hydrology;remote sensing	Robotics	74.91862039923669	-58.94952811396946	135679

However, their quality depends on the reference datasets used for training the classifier. In remote sensing, reference data may lack of timeliness and accuracy which leads to the presence of mislabeled data degrading the classification performances. This work presents an iterative learning framework to deal with noisy instances, that can be seen as outliers. Several outlier detection strategies, based on the well-known Random Forests (RF) ensemble classifier, are proposed, evaluated quantitatively, and then compared with traditional methods.

ABSTRACT In April and October 1994 the X-SAR was own as part of the SIR-C/X-SAR space radar laboratory missions (SRL-1/2) on the Space Shuttle. Amongst other activities DLR is responsible for the calibration of all X-SAR data products and is running the German Processing and Archiving Facility (D-PAF). Calibration activities included three major parts. Before the rst mission we performed a detailed analysis of the overall system to localize the main error sources and developed algorithms and procedures to correct these errors. During the missions we concentrated our eorts on calibration campaigns at the Oberpfaf-fenhofen super test site. Post mission activities included the determination of the antenna pattern and the absolute calibration factor as well as detailed performance analyses. This paper describes the overall approach to radiometrically calibrate the X-SAR and provides information on system performance and data quality to users in the dierent application elds. 2 1 INTRODUCTION The X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR) is an imaging radar designed to complement the SIR-C Land C-band systems [1]. It is operated at a frequency of 9.6 GHz under vertical polarization. The shorter wavelength (0.03122 m) of the X-SAR system has particularly favorable capabilities for several applications in the area of vegetation, oceanography, snow/ice and geology. Its weak penetration into the surface and its high sensitivity to surface roughness and associated phenomena can be seen as a signicant enhancement to the Land C-band measurements of SIR-C.

2d4dae0d6e353f5d1f52da4c9f7278aa91c20f2e	single channel circular sar moving target detection based on logarithm background subtraction algorithm		In this paper, a new moving target detection algorithm for single channel circular Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is presented. Circular SAR can perform observation with circular trajectory and retrieve multiaspect information. Due to the circular trajectory, the moving target has long and complex apparent trace (smear trajectory), while the background (clutter) has relatively slow changing characteristic in limited azimuth integration. Thus, the background image can be filtered by using radiometric adjusted overlap subaperture images. Then, the Signal-to-Clutter Ratio (SCR) of the region where the strong backscattering clutter exists is enhanced with logarithm background subtraction technique. In the real data experiment, the maximum SCR improvement is 13 dB. Finally, the moving target can be detected using a Constant False Alarm (CFAR) detector. The algorithm is evaluated with one channel data of three channel GOTCHA-GMTI dataset.	algorithm;background subtraction	Wenjie Shen;Yun Lin;Lingjuan Yu;Feiteng Xue;Wen Hong	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10050742	computer vision;artificial intelligence;geology;logarithm;clutter;algorithm;constant false alarm rate;trajectory;detector;synthetic aperture radar;communication channel;background subtraction	Mobile	75.61994433403969	-65.68878701206604	136886

The detection, discrimination, and remediation of unexploded ordnance (UXO) and other munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) using the currently available detection and geolocation technologies often yield unsatisfactory results, failing to detect all MEC present at a site or to discriminate between MEC and nonhazardous items. Thus, the goal of this paper is to design and demonstrate a high-accuracy geolocation methodology that will address centimeter-level relative accuracy requirements of a man-portable electromagnetic (EM) sensor system in open and impeded environments. The proposed system design is based on the tight quadruple integration of the Global Positioning System (GPS), the inertial measurement unit (IMU) system, the terrestrial radio-frequency (RF) system pseudolite (PL), and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to support high-accuracy geolocation for a noncontact EM mapping system in GPS-challenged environments. The key novel component of the proposed multisensor system is the integration of TLS that can provide centimeter-level positioning accuracy in a local frame and thus enables a GPS/IMU/PL-based navigation system to achieve both high absolute and relative positioning accuracy in GPS-impeded environments. This paper presents the concept design of the quadruple integration system, the algorithmic approach to data integration with a special emphasis on TLS integration with GPS/IMU/PL, and the performance assessment based on real data, where centimeter-level relative geolocation accuracy is demonstrated during the GPS signal blockage.	airborne ranger;failure;gps signals;geolocation;global positioning system;ibm naval ordnance research calculator;quadruple-precision floating-point format;radio frequency;requirement;serial digital video out;systems design;terrestrial television	Dorota A.

0d76bd113d24922c4a49ce7b9a65e54487f7d546	ray-based image generation for advanced medical applications		This thesis discusses real-time issues of ray-based image generation beyond known Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) algorithms in a medical context. Medical diagnostics highly depends on volumetric images methods. Image processing and representation of this data must become more accurate and comprehensible and image investigation must be as fast as possible; ultimately not only because of cost reasons. Therefore, the overall benefit of 3D image synthesis for medicine along with related research is discussed in the first part of this thesis. During the last years the author and his colleagues have developed algorithms for 3D raybased image synthesis which overcome the problems caused by the restrictions of shaders in a fixed function graphics pipeline. Ray-based volume rendering algorithms have besides their high computation complexity often an inherent algorithmic problem. Intersecting two or more datasets requires ray setup algorithms which do not scale efficiently enough with an increasing number of objects. Volumetric and hybrid volumetric-geometric visualization of medical multi-modal conditions is therefore sparsely covered by related work from computer science and not present in clinical practice without extensive preprocessing. To overcome these problems we have developed a completely flexible rendering engine, fully exploiting the possibilities of modern GPUs and discuss that system in the second part of this work. With different novel algorithms we show how to implement basically a software rendering engine, executed in the GPU. This approach is comparable to shader based approaches for simple scenes but much more efficient for highly complex scenes which may contain dozens editable and intersecting volumetric and translucent geometric objects. Further on we discuss options for applications with hard real-time constraints where pure algorithmic optimization is not sufficient anymore. Inter-operative applications must not hinder smooth operation of a surgeon with low frame rates and the resulting juddering. To overcome these problems most applications use either very basic visualization or sacrifice indiscriminately image quality for rendering speed. Therefore, we show a way to utilize the abilities of the human visual system to perceive incomplete images by introducing well known 3D object features as paradigm for ray importance sorting. As final contribution we show also how conventional ray-based approaches can be improved in terms of calculation accuracy and speed for special use-cases by incorporating automatic code differentiation, which is useful as input for special registration tasks. The last part of this thesis shows how our novel algorithms can be applied to practical applications. Therefore we present multi-volume rendering for medical tumor accessibility planning, raycasting kernel specialization for a real 2D-3D image registration problem during prostate surgery and automatic transfer-function generation for unskilled users. All parts of this thesis have been fully evaluated by experts from the medical domain and computer science. These parts show furthermore strong evidence, that our hypothesis in this thesis are not only valid but also directly applicable in many real-world medical rendering environments.	accessibility;algorithm;computation;computer science;glossary of computer graphics;graphics pipeline;graphics processing unit;image processing;image quality;image registration;layout engine;mathematical optimization;modal logic;partial template specialization;preprocessor;programming paradigm;ray casting;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;rendering (computer graphics);shader;software rendering;sorting;transfer function;volume rendering	Bernhard Kainz	2011			computer science	Graphics	70.0630532260946	-52.56489469409073	137084

Pansharpening is also expressed as resolution merge, image integration, and multisensor data fusion. Some of the applications of pansharpening are to improve geometric correction, enhance certain features that are not visible in the data, change detection using temporal data sets, and enhance classification. There is an increasing use of these different pansharpening methods as a preprocessing step for feature enhancement and improved classification accuracy [Pohl and Van Genderen, 1998]. The quality of the sharpened images is to be evaluated using quantitative metrics. Accordingly, a user-friendly pansharpening and image quality interface (PSIQI) is developed to benchmark the performance of different pansharpening algorithms.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);image quality;multispectral image;preprocessor;usability	Veeraraghavan Vijayaraj;Charles G.

The practice of using linear array whiskbroom Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) arrays to image the Earth can help get thermal-infrared images of a large breadth with high spatial resolutions. Focusing on the whiskbroom characteristics of equal time intervals and unequal angles, the present study proposes a spaceborne linear-array-scanning imaging geometric model, whilst calibrating temporal system parameters and whiskbroom angle parameters. With the help of the YG-14-China's first satellite equipped with thermal-infrared cameras of high spatial resolution-China's Anyang Imaging and Taiyuan Imaging are used to conduct an experiment of geometric calibration and a verification test, respectively. Results have shown that the plane positioning accuracy without ground control points (GCPs) is better than 30 pixels and the plane positioning accuracy with GCPs is better than 1 pixel.	airborne ranger;angularjs;calibration;charge-coupled device;communications satellite;detectors;distortion;geometric modeling;numerical analysis;pixel;velocity (software development);verification of theories;while;sensor (device)	Qinghong Sheng;Qi Wang;Hui Xiao;Qing Wang	2018		10.3390/s18010247	pixel;electronic engineering;calibration;geometric modeling;computer vision;engineering;image resolution;artificial intelligence	HCI	78.59703193712826	-65.27122818416686	137337

In each case, these have been observed directly over strong current convergences. Progress has been made in understanding the origin of these signatures through simulations that incorporate environmental forcing from the winds and currents. These simulations significantly underestimate the backscatter unless wave-breaking (WB) effects are included at least approximately. Using a new, quasistatistical procedure that generalizes and quantifies earlier procedures for including WB effects, we have been able to successfully simulate the magnitude and behavior of these signatures. The approach combines the statistically based, composite model of radar backscatter with a deterministic feature model that relates backscatter from breaking waves to a particular geometrical model of a spilling breaker. This is accomplished using localized criteria, defined by local wave crest acceleration, to determine the probability of breaking, and by extending the feature model so that its unknown parameters may be evaluated directly from wave–current interaction calculations. The new approach provides an estimate of the critical crest acceleration of a potentially breaking wave, as a function of wind speed, that agrees with independent measurements.	antivirus software;backscatter (email);feature model;gulf of evaluation;radar;roland gs;simulation	Scott R.

3cdbbaec49c9adcceb410e007b0e6427e7bf72da	mapping forest degradation due to selective logging by means of time series analysis: case studies in central africa	sma;time series analysis;redd monitoring system;forest degradation;gap detection	Detecting and monitoring forest degradation in the tropics has implications for various fields of interest (biodiversity, emission calculations, self-sustenance of indigenous communities, timber exploitation). However, remote-sensing-based detection of forest degradation is difficult, as these subtle degradation signals are not easy to detect in the first place and quickly lost over time due to fast re-vegetation. To overcome these shortcomings, a time series analysis has been developed to map and monitor forest degradation over a longer period of time, with frequent updates based on Landsat data. This time series approach helps to reduce both the commission and the omission errors compared to, e.g., bior tri-temporal assessments. The approach involves a series of pre-processing steps, such as geometric and radiometric adjustments, followed by spectral mixture analysis and classification of spectral curves. The resulting pixel-based classification is then aggregated to degradation areas. The method was developed on a study site in Cameroon and applied to a second site in Central African Republic. For both areas, the results were finally evaluated against visual interpretation of very high-resolution optical imagery. Results show overall accuracies in both study sites above 85% for mapping degradation areas with the presented methods.	ap 42 compilation of air pollutant emission factors;data acquisition;elegant degradation;image resolution;login;microsoft outlook for mac;motorola canopy;pixel;preprocessor;random forest;spectral method;time series;triangular function	Manuela Hirschmugl;Martin Steinegger;Heinz Gallaun;Mathias Schardt	2014	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs6010756	time series;ecology;statistics;remote sensing	ML	81.6832627198635	-56.8741353029429	137713

This paper proposes a novel high resolution optical SAR processor which is based on the Range Doppler Algorithm. The processor includes two main elements: the optical one-dimensional Fourier transformation element and the spatial light modulator (SLM).

486667553d7fbdf90993486e70a650066ef8a4c2	multi-temporal land-cover classification of agricultural areas in two european regions with high resolution spotlight terrasar-x data	high resolution;land cover classification;multi temporal classification;land use;agriculture;european regions;radar	Functioning ecosystems offer multiple services for human well-being (e.g., food, freshwater, fiber). Agriculture provides several of these services but also can cause negative impacts. Thus, it is essential to derive up-to-date information about agricultural land use and its change. This paper describes the multi-temporal classification of agricultural land use based on high resolution spotlight TerraSAR-X images. A stack of l4 dual-polarized radar images taken during the vegetation season have been used for two different study areas (North of Germany and Southeast Poland). They represent extremely diverse regions with regard to their population density, agricultural management, as well as geological and geomorphological conditions. Thereby, the transferability of the classification method for different regions is tested. The Maximum Likelihood classification is based on a high amount of ground truth samples. Classification accuracies differ in both regions. Overall accuracy for all classes for the German area is 61.78% and 39.25% for the Polish region. Accuracies improved notably for both regions (about 90%) when single vegetation classes were merged into groups of classes. Such regular land use classifications, applicable for different European agricultural sites, can serve as basis for monitoring systems for agricultural land use and its related ecosystems.	dbpedia;dynamic language runtime;fiber to the x;freshwater ecosystem;ground truth;image resolution;object-based language;radar;random forest	Damian Bargiel;Sylvia Herrmann	2011	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs3050859	agriculture;land use;radar;remote sensing	ML	80.58657860387372	-57.28493135624687	138302

Traditionally spectral narrow band ratios have been used to quantify key diagnostic features in the remote sensing signal to estimate concentrations of optically active water quality constituents. However, they cannot cope easily with shifts in reflectance features caused by multiple interactions between variable absorption and backscattering effects that typically occur in optically complex waters. We use continuous wavelet analysis to detect Chl-a features at various wavelengths and frequency scales. Using the wavelet decomposition, we build a 2-D correlation scalogram between in situ pond reflectance spectra and in situ Chl-a concentration. By isolating the most informative wavelet regions via thresholding, we could relate all five regions to known inherent optical properties. We select the optimal feature per region and compare them to three well-known narrow band ratio models. For this experimental application, the wavelet features outperform the NIR-red models, while fluorescence line height (FLH) yield comparable results. Because wavelets analyze the signal at different scales and synthesize information across bands, we hypothesize that the wavelet features are less sensitive to confounding factors, such as instrument noise, colored dissolved organic matter, and suspended matter.	continuous wavelet;information;interaction;optical rotation;scaleogram;semiconductor industry;thresholding (image processing)	Eva M.

Although the spatial enhancement of the IHS-merged images is high, the distortion of its spectral information may also be important. In recent years, several methods have been developed to minimize this problem, being those based on wavelets widely used. However, the high computational cost of these approaches makes them unattractive to applications that involve fast merging of very large volumes of data. In this paper, we present a low computational-cost image fusion method based on the fast IHS transform, which uses the information of the spectral response functions of the low-resolution multispectral (LRM) and high-resolution panchromatic (HRP) sensors to minimize the spectral distortion problem. Using this information, we directly obtain from the HRP image the intensity image that the LRM sensor would observe if it worked at a spatial resolution similar to that of the HRP image. The experimental results carried out on IKONOS images demonstrate that the proposed approach can perform as well as wavelet-based approaches with a lower computational cost.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation;computation;computational complexity theory;distortion;frequency response;human race machine;image fusion;image resolution;learning relationship management;multispectral image;sensor;wavelet	María González-Audícana;Xavier Otazu;Octavi Fors;Jesús Álvarez-Mozos	2006	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2005.863299	computer vision;image resolution;distortion;image processing;optics;image fusion;physics;remote sensing	Vision	69.8088439411864	-63.194584504513365	138857

The method determines automatically the number of committee members required and is not dependent upon user specified parameters. Examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the method using both model data and satellite remote sensing image data . Committee classifier Seniority logic Remote sensing Piecewise linear vv ti,4-r I . INTRODUCTION Multispectral remote sensing data is commonly classified using the maximum likelihood decision rule based upon multivariate normal probability functions. This rests upon modelling classes in spectral space by unimodal distribution functions or so-called spectral classes . Information classes of interest must therefore be represented suitably by a set of unimodal distributions if acceptable classification accuracies are to be obtained using this approach . Resolution of information classes into these spectral modes is performed usually with clustering algorithms ; this can represent a significant cost penalty prior to the actual classification. A further cost imposition associated with maximum likelihood classification is related to the dependence of classification time upon the number of (spectral) features used since classification time increases as the square of the dimensionality of the pattern space"""" 21 With data such as Landsat multispectral scanner imagery this is not a major consideration . However, when several images of the same region at different dates are combined into a higher dimensional mufti-temporal sequence, the quadratic cost increase can be particularly significant (unless feature reduction techniques are applied beforehand), as is also the situation with high dimensionality data such as thematic moppet imagery . Both this cost * To whom correspondence should be addressed . behaviour and the need to cluster data beforehand are the result of using classification based upon a multidimensional normal class model . If classification is performed using non-parameteic procedures, and in particular using linear nonparametric methods, classification cost dependence on pattern space dimensionality will be linear and a priori resolution of classes into specific modes is not necessary. Parallelepiped classification is of this nature and is often used as an alternative to maximum likelihood classification in remote sensing applications . Its effectiveness is limited, however, since it is based upon segmenting the pattern space by sets of mufti-dimensional parallelepipeds with sides that are parallel to feature (spectral) axes . Efficient use of the method may therefore demand a large number of parallelepipeds to be used to separate classes in a nonoverlapping fashion, akin to the spectral modes of maximum likelihood classification . This paper is addressed to finding a viable nonparametric linear classification technique that does not suffer the restrictions of parallelepiped methods . In particular, it presents a piecewise linear classifier that is able to segment a pattern space in a very general manner. It is not dependent on predetermined class models and has a classification time that increases linearly with pattern space dimensionality . A training procedure is described that is as straightforward as the training procedures used with the maximum likelihood and parallelepiped approaches . It is therefore 453"""	algorithm;cluster analysis;decision boundary;linear classifier;multispectral image;piecewise linear continuation;sed;stellar classification	T. Lee;J. A.

The present study describes a methodology for the detection and characterization of Nitrogen (N) deficiencies in corn fields. Current methods of field surveillance are either completed manually or with the assistance of satellite imaging, which offer infrequent and costly information to the farmers about the state of their fields. The proposed methodology promotes the use of small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Computer Vision algorithms that operate with information in the visual (RGB) spectrum. Through this implementation, a lower cost solution for identifying N deficiencies is promoted. We provide extensive results on the use of commercial RGB sensors for delivering the essential information to farmers regarding the condition of their field, targeting the reduction of N fertilizers and the increase of the crop performance. Data is first collected by a UAV that hovers over a stressed area and collects high resolution RGB images at a low altitude. A recommendation algorithm identifies potential segments of the images that are candidates exhibiting N deficiency. Based on the feedback from experts in the area a training set is constructed utilizing the initial suggestions of the recommendation algorithm. Supervised learning methods are then used to characterize crop leaves that exhibit signs of N deficiency. The performance of 84.2% strongly supports the potential of this scheme to identify N-deficient leaves even in the case of images where the unhealthy leaves are heavily occluded by other healthy or stressed leaves.	aerial photography;algorithm;angular defect;automation;computer vision;elegant degradation;image resolution;motion planning;robot;robotics;sensor;supervised learning;test set;the current;unmanned aerial vehicle	Dimitris Zermas;Da Teng;Panagiotis Stanitsas;Mike Bazakos;Daniel Kaiser;Vassilios Morellas;David Mulla;Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7354309	medical imaging;computer vision;simulation;computer science;engineering;sensor;precision agriculture;image segmentation;remote sensing	Robotics	77.8528982489557	-56.0869796010334	138946

Multispectral and high-resolution remote sensing images are able to provide sufficient information for a more accurate segmentation, nevertheless, the classification algorithms applied to images with high spatial resolution requires many computational cycles, even for modern computers. This paper explores the effectiveness of a novel approach developed for supervised segmentation and classification of high-resolution remote sensing images using distributed processing techniques to improve the computational time required. This is referred to as the distributed pixel statistics method. Examples of remote sensing signatures extracted from real world and high-resolution remote sensing images are reported to probe the efficiency of the developed technique.		Ivan E.

Imaging spectroscopy provides a way to examine surface mineralogy in order to better understand how this mineralogy might have resulted from past fluid flow and diagenesis. Aerially-acquired spectral data, along with spectral data from field samples, are used to help map the mineralogy of a site located within the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone in southern Utah. This site, “Mollies Nipple”, is unusual as it is a butte containing jarosite; an atypical mineral for this area. Mapping the butte's mineralogy in conjunction with its morphology may help provide additional knowledge as to the geologic history of this area. In addition, the presence of hematite concretions as well as the mineral jarosite may potentially make this butte a terrestrial analog for sediments on Mars.	galaxy morphological classification;terrestrial television	Julianne Bell;Brenda Beitler Bowen;Brigette Martini	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5650431	absorption;diagenesis;imaging spectroscopy;spectroscopy;geology;geochemistry;manganese;mineralogy;iron;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	80.57981582346163	-61.305830053517816	139494

Our approach is divided into three main steps which build the whole image interpretation gradually. The first step consists of applying low-level detectors taking the speckle statistics into account and extracting some raw information from the scene. The detector responses are then fused in a second step using Dempster–Shafer theory, thus allowing the modeling of the knowledge that we have about operators, including possible ignorance and their limits. A third step gives the final image interpretation using contextual knowledge between the different classes.

e294ea9563f98c2c4dad284fd3dc35ed5012aee1	gpu parallel implementation of gas plume detection in hyperspectral video sequences		Gas plume detection is a challenging task in the field of remote sensing. Due to sensor development, it is now possible to detect and track chemical gas plumes with hyperspectral video sequences (HVS). For the purpose of high detection accuracy, it is important to explore spectral characteristic, and take full advantages of spatial continuity and temporal consistency in HVS. However, the high computational complexity and the large amount of data limit its application in time-critical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a GPU parallel implementation of gas plume detection in HVS, which properly exploits shared memory and intrinsic concurrency of the CUDA blocks, as well as parallel workload assignment and resource allocation. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed GPU parallel method has a considerable acceleration factor while retaining the same detection accuracy compared with the serial and multicore version.	cuda;computational complexity theory;concurrency (computer science);graphics processing unit;human visual system model;multi-core processor;plume (fluid dynamics);scott continuity;shared memory;window of opportunity	Huimin Yu;Zenbin Wu;Jie Wei;Yang Xu;Jocelyn Chanussot;Andrea L.

The aim of this work is to improve the contextual reconstruction process by opportunely capturing spatial and spectral correlations characterizing the considered image. In addition, we propose a novel procedure to generate an error map for providing the end-user with helpful indications about the reconstruction reliability.

Therefore, to improve the accuracy of PV power forecasting, a detailed study on the influence of clouds in different movement and evolution patterns on solar irradiance is very necessary. The classification and recognition of different kinds of clouds are the basic of the study on the effect between the cloud and irradiance. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) based cloud classification model using the high temporal and spatial resolution sky images captured via the total sky imager installed in the PV plant is established in this paper. Firstly, the influence on irradiance under clouds of different shapes and distributions in a sky image is analyzed and four different classes of clouds are distinguished taking into account the meteorology standard as well as the preceding analysis. Secondly, the spectral and textural features are extracted by the statistical tonal analysis and gray level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) of the sky image. Finally, a c-support vector classification (C-SVC) model with radial basis function (RBF) kernel function is built to classify the different clouds in the sky images. The experimental results show that the proposed SVM model can make reasonable classification and efficient identification for the various clouds in the sky images of PV plant.	cloud computing;grayscale;image sensor;page view;radial (radio);radial basis function;skybox (video games);support vector machine;uninterruptible power supply;universal conductance fluctuations	Zhao Zhen;Fei Wang;Yujing Sun;Zengqiang Mi;Chun Liu;Bo Wang;Jing Lu	2015	2015 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)	10.1109/ISGT.2015.7131784	meteorology;computer vision;geography;remote sensing	ML	80.54222723503666	-54.17448297671241	140081

Several methods have been widely applied for estimating the parameters of ISWs. Most of these methods assume that the ISW signals are corrupted by additive receiver noise. However, the ISW signals in SAR images suffer from both additive (thermal) and multiplicative (speckle) noises. Therefore, the estimation accuracy of previously proposed methods could not reach the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB). This paper proposes an optimal parameter estimation method of ISWs and derives the CRB for parameter estimation of ISWs. The variances of the estimated ISW parameters are shown to reach the CRB. This optimum estimator is validated using ISW SAR signals taken from simulation data and European Remote Sensing 2 (ERS-2) images. The results show that the proposed method is more accurate and effective than other methods. In addition, it should be noted that this optimality could also refer to parameter estimation of other SAR extended targets with an analytical expression.	aperture (software);estimation theory;simulation;soliton;synthetic data;utility functions on indivisible goods	Xiaoqing Wang;Jinsong Chong;Yilong Lu	2016	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2015.2512264	speckle pattern;estimation;synthetic aperture radar;food additive;optics;estimation theory;signal-to-noise ratio;backscatter;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Robotics	77.46832452295111	-66.08563546226473	140678

The high-resolution satellite imagery provides a new data source to detect vehicles. Meanwhile, Satellite image covers large areas instantaneously, providing a possibility for snapshotting road traffic conditions. In this paper, we proposed an approach based on watershed image segmentation to detect the urban road vehicles from GF-2 imagery. The vehicles detection involves the two main steps: Firstly, a GIS road vector map and vegetation masks were applied to the image to guide vehicle detection by restricting the roads only. Secondly, watershed image segmentation was performed to separate bright and dark vehicles from the background in the road region. Then, a rule-based classifier was established to classify the image objects into the vehicle and the non-vehicle objects by using the spectral and shape feature information of image objects. Finally, the overall performance of the vehicle detection were compared with the manually counts, yielding overall accuracy of 81% with 93% classification accuracy. This detection accuracy may be considered acceptable for operational use in traffic monitoring.	geographic information system;image resolution;image segmentation;logic programming;snapshot (computer storage);vector map;watershed (image processing);website monitoring	Guofeng Wang;Yu Meng;Hichem Sahli;Anzhi Yue;Jiansheng Chen;Jingbo Chen;Dong-xu He;Bin Wu	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729974	computer vision;image resolution;computer science;image segmentation;physics;satellite;remote sensing	Vision	76.70060935013238	-58.74220584923973	140711
78aa475eea1d1dc7ccd33e789d9dae249c7bed7b	assessment of electrical and infrastructure recovery in puerto rico following hurricane maria using a multisource time series of satellite imagery		Puerto Rico suffered severe damage from the category 5 hurricane (Maria) in September 2017. Total monetary damages are estimated to be ~92 billion USD, the third most costly tropical cyclone in US history. The response to this damage has been tempered and slow moving, with recent estimates placing 45% of the population without power three months after the storm. Consequently, we developed a unique data-fusion mapping approach called the Urban Development Index (UDI) and new open source tool, Comet Time Series (CometTS), to analyze the recovery of electricity and infrastructure in Puerto Rico. Our approach incorporates a combination of time series visualizations and change detection mapping to create depictions of power or infrastructure loss. It also provides a unique independent assessment of areas that are still struggling to recover. For this workflow, our time series approach combines nighttime imagery from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP VIIRS), multispectral imagery from two Landsat satellites, US Census data, and crowd-sourced building footprint labels. Based upon our approach we can identify and evaluate: 1) the recovery of electrical power compared to pre-storm levels, 2) the location of potentially damaged infrastructure that has yet to recover from the storm, and 3) the number of persons without power over time. As of May 31, 2018, declined levels of observed brightness across the island indicate that 13.9% +/~5.6% of persons still lack power and/or that 13.2% +/~5.3% of infrastructure has been lost. In comparison, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority states that less than 1% of their customers still are without power.	category 5 cable;crowdsourcing;cyclone;multispectral image;open-source software;rico;time series;uniform driver interface	Jacob Shermeyer	2018	CoRR	10.1117/12.2325585	machine learning;tropical cyclone;cartography;computer science;artificial intelligence;satellite imagery;change detection;electric power;storm;urban planning;population;visible infrared imaging radiometer suite	HCI	82.31093863903891	-57.6838867234715	140716

The proposed pixel-based algorithm explores spatio-temporal contextual information and thus could effectively improve the classification accuracy while simultaneously avoids the pepper-salt results which often occurs on the SAR images. Moreover, owing to the multiscale analysis, MPAC could adaptively preserve the detailed features comparing with other non-adaptive contextual methods. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and requires less parameter to be estimated. Properties of the proposed algorithm including the MRF impact, multiscale efficiency, computational performance and the initialization influence were investigated. Six-date RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR data over the Greater Toronto Area were used for validation. The results show that this algorithm could generate homogenous and detailed mapping results with fair accuracy for complex urban land cover classification.	algorithmic efficiency;cluster analysis;computation;expectation–maximization algorithm;markov random field;pixel;polarimetry;semi-supervised learning;successive approximation adc	Xin Niu;Yifang Ban	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351171	computer vision;contextual image classification;synthetic aperture radar;geology;pattern recognition;radar imaging;scanning electron microscope;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	70.58159647202187	-64.67045319743569	140882

The FTS onboard GOSAT satellite primarily aims at observing CO2 over the land and oceanic sun glint in shortwave infrared.

An important international element of NASA’s earth observing system (EOS), SeaWinds is an advanced follow-on to the NASA scatterometer (NSCAT) on the first ADEOS platform. Unlike previous operational spaceborne scatterometer systems, SeaWinds employs a scanning “pencilbeam” antenna rather than a “fan-beam” antenna, making the instrument more compact and yielding greater ocean coverage. The goals of this paper are twofold. First, the overall SeaWinds functional design and backscatter measurement approach are described, and the relative advantages of the pencil-beam technique are outlined. Second, the unique aspects of measurement accuracy optimization and signal processing for the SeaWinds instrument are discussed. Applying the results of a separate companion paper [11], a technique to significantly improve measurement accuracy by modulating the transmit pulse is described. Trade-offs to optimize the transmit modulation bandwidth are presented.	eos;functional design;mathematical optimization;modulation;signal processing	Michael W. Spencer;Chialin Wu;David G.

Generally, the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm is applied, which is based on the assumption that clutter background can be modeled using a Gaussian distribution, generating a high level of false alarms in presence of non Gaussian clutter. This problem has been addressed under two independent approaches: modeling the environment noise (sea clutter) with independent non Gaussian models or using variations of CFAR detection algorithm. Both approaches provide good results only for specific characteristics of clutter. We discuss a hybrid approach for target detection that use three probabilistic models of clutter associated to sea state (Gauss, Weibull and K distributions), detection algorithms with adaptive threshold for CFAR, classification algorithms that associate a noise model with a specific CFAR algorithm according to the sea state, and low level morphological operations to generate an image of targets. The goal of this approach is provide an automatic mechanism to associate a clutter model with a specific CFAR algorithm according to sea state in order to obtain radar images without clutter. The proposed detection approach is evaluated by high level simulation. Results are presented and discussed.	algorithm;clutter;constant false alarm rate;high-level programming language;image processing;mathematical morphology;reflection (computer graphics);simulation	Santos López-Estrada;René Cumplido;César Torres-Huitzil	2004	Proceedings of the Fifth Mexican International Conference in Computer Science, 2004.

The choice of threshold is often arbitrary however. The purpose of this paper is to offer a statistical framework for the selection of thresholds. The framework accounts for the facts that one carries out multiple tests of the null hypothesis of no change, when searching for regions of change over an image with a large number of pixels. Special attention is given to global spatial autocorrelation, which can affect the selection of appropriate threshold values.	autocorrelation;pixel;spatial analysis	Peter A.

If endmembers are assumed to be pure pixels present in an image scene, endmember extraction is to search the most distinctive pixels. Popular algorithms using the criteria of simplex volume maximization (e.g., N-FINDR) and spectral signature similarity (e.g., Vertex Component Analysis) belong to this type. If pure pixel assumption is not imposed, endmember extraction usually is conducted by searching the signatures that can circumscribe the data cloud with the minimum volume. Both types of algorithms are affected by anomalous pixels since such outliers are very different from other pixels and act as interferers during simplex volume evaluation. In this paper, we propose a new approach that separates the endmember searching in normal and anomalous pixels. Real data experiments show that it can improve the quality of extracted endmembers.	electronic signature;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;keyword extraction;pixel;tag cloud	Qian Du;Liangpei Zhang;Nareenart Raksuntorn	2009	2009 First Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing	10.1109/WHISPERS.2009.5289104	computer vision;geography;pattern recognition;remote sensing	AI	70.6176918628614	-64.00584326932487	141643

The TerraSAR-X data set consisted of seven dual-polarized (HH/HV or VH/VV) Stripmap mode images from all seasons of the year. We were especially interested in distinguishing between the tree species. The dependent variables estimated included mean volume, basal area, mean height, mean diameter and tree species-specific mean volumes. Selection of best possible feature set was based on a genetic algorithm (GA). The nonparametric k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) algorithm was applied to the estimation. The research material consisted of 124 circular plots measured at tree level and located in the vicinity of Espoo, Finland. There are large variations in the elevation and forest structure in the study area, making it demanding for image interpretation. The best feature set contained OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2010, 2 433 12 features, nine of them originating from the ALS data and three from the TerraSAR-X data. The relative RMSEs for the best performing feature set were 34.7% (mean volume), 28.1% (basal area), 14.3% (mean height), 21.4% (mean diameter), 99.9% (mean volume of Scots pine), 61.6% (mean volume of Norway spruce) and 91.6% (mean volume of deciduous tree species). The combined feature set outperformed an ALS-based feature set marginally; in fact, the latter was better in the case of species-specific volumes. Features from TerraSAR-X alone performed poorly. However, due to favorable temporal resolution, satellite-borne radar imaging is a promising data source for updating large-area forest inventories based on low-pulse ALS.	airborne ranger;basal (phylogenetics);circular convolution;genetic algorithm;image resolution;inventory;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;radar;verification and validation	Markus Holopainen;Reija Haapanen;Mika Karjalainen;Mikko Vastaranta;Juha Hyyppä;Xiaowei Yu;Sakari Tuominen;Hannu Hyyppä	2010	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs2020432	laser scanning;image analysis;genetic algorithm;basal area;laser;forest;hydrology;forest inventory;deciduous;diameter;radar imaging;woody plant;feature selection;physics;radar;remote sensing	ML	80.0419595504196	-57.18231854053034	141666

First, we detect the dominant tree crowns by using both the image derived from the LiDAR data and the LiDAR point cloud. Hence, the detected crowns are delineated directly in the LiDAR point cloud by means of a radial angular analysis. Second, the dominated crowns are detected by analyzing the vertical profile of the dominant trees. Finally, we extract the dominated trees, thus reconstructing the structure of the forest. Experiments carried out in a forest area located in the Southern Italian Alps by using very high density LiDAR data (up to 50 points/m2) point out the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	angularjs;point cloud;radial (radio);the forest	Claudia Paris;Davide Valduga;Lorenzo Bruzzone	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325698	lidar;shape;hydrology;level set;vegetation;remote sensing	Robotics	76.23846092563747	-58.71535870320621	141845

Ground-based AERONET and lidar measurements were performed and further processed with the GRASP algorithm to get spectrally-resolved profiles of extinction and single scattering albedo. Furthermore, the research aircraft ATR-42 made two flights above Granada providing vertical profiles of aerosol optical and microphysical properties together with measurements of broadband radiative fluxes. All of the ground-based and aircraft aerosol properties are used as input in the radiative transfer model GAME in order to evaluate its sensitivity to different input datasets. The aircraft fluxes are used for validation of the modelled ones.	algorithm;grasp;granada	María-José Granados-Muñoz;Michaël Sicard;Roberto Román;José Antonio Benavent-Oltra;Rubén Barragán;Gérard Brogniez;Cyrielle Denjean;Lucas Alados-Arboledas;Constantino Muñoz-Porcar;Alejandro Rodríguez-Gómez;Adolfo Comerón	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517278	remote sensing;radiative transfer;atmospheric sciences;atmospheric radiative transfer codes;aerosol;aeronet;computer science;lidar;atmospheric model;radiative forcing;single-scattering albedo	Embedded	82.03216101763792	-62.7800555045731	141868

In particular, the spectral similarity between soil and dry vegetation has been primary concern to correctly appraise the surface conditions during the non-growing seasons in temperature region. This study analyzes the spectral characteristics of the mixture of dry vegetation and soil. The reflectance spectra were obtained from laboratory spectroradiometer measurement and from EO-1 Hyperion image data. The reflectance spectra of several samples having different level of dry vegetation fractions show similar pattern from both lab measurement and hyperspectral image. Shortwave IR wavelengths, in particular at wavelength near 2200nm, are more sensitive to the fraction of dry vegetation. The reflectance spectra of bare soil could be distinguished from the other surfaces covered by dry vegetation during the leaf-off season.	hyperion;persistent vegetative state;spatial variability	Kyu-Sung Lee;Sun-Hwa Kim;Jeong-Rim Ma;Min-Jung Kook;Jung-Il Shin Inha;Yang-Dam Eo;Yong-Woong Lee	2005	Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2005.

For developing a credible and effective response to oil spill in ice-infested waters, a field experiment was performed on spectrum of oil film in waters with sea ice. In this experiment, four groups of spectrum samples were collected, which were clean sea water, brash ice and even ice and sea water /brash ice /even ice contaminated by diesel and crude oil. The experiment results indicated that: the same sort of oil with different background had different reflectance at the same wavelength, so did the same sort of oil with the same background but different distribution state; nevertheless there were some common characteristics within the same oil. For example, diesel had two apparent characteristics, no matter on the surface of sea water or brash ice or even ice, the first of which was that the reflectance curves of diesel film were first lower and then higher than that of clean sea water, brash ice or even ice according to the wavelength; the second was that the reflectance curves of diesel film were almost equaled to that of the background between 400nm and 510nm in sea water, 410nm and 510nm in brash ice and 490nm and 510nm in even ice. The spectrum curves of crude oil had a representative sphenoid reflectance-peak which appeared between 750nm and 770nm. These characteristics of oil film in terms of ice and oil type could be effectively used to distinct the oil with sea water and sea ice, meanwhile this experiment would improve and facilitate the detecting and monitoring proposal of oil which had been spilled in moving, broken pack ice and fast-ice environment in the ocean.	dead sea scrolls;diesel;sensor;spectrum analyzer	Bingxin Liu;Wei-hua Zhu;Ying Li	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326562	meteorology;sea ice thickness;water;oceanography;reflectivity;sea ice;physics;water pollution	Vision	81.43825463906258	-59.674778158168166	141982

The characterization is conducted at object level, corresponding to land cover objects. At the local urban level, a VHR image is dominated by buildings. Therefore, the characterization of spatial arrangement of land cover elements is mainly conducted on building objects. Since building objects have different functional properties in urban areas, we classify them into a set of different types according to their geometrical, morphological, and contextual properties. The spatial arrangement is characterized by considering the composition of different building types. Regarding the integration of land use indicators and spatial arrangement information, we construct a Bayesian network, in which the spatial arrangement is served as a latent variable, and the land use indicators calculated according to existing studies are treated as the nodes of this Bayesian network. This is followed by urban land use classification. We applied our proposed method to a subset of a Pleiades image for an urban area of Wuhan, China. We conclude that our proposed method can provide an effective means for urban land use extraction.	band i;bayesian network;coefficient;convex function;convex hull;energy minimization;fuzzy set;image resolution;image segmentation;kinetic data structure;latent variable;maxdiff;minimum bounding box;object-based language;pleiades (supercomputer);solidity;statistical classification;support vector machine	Mengmeng Li;Alfred Stein;Wietske Bijker	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729862	database index;feature extraction;computer science;remote sensing	Robotics	73.51133325788075	-60.493156451862596	142192

Using weak returns of atmospheric CAE, the radars have been applied to wind findings in a short radar range in a fair weather, in particular S-band radars. Long wavelength radars perform good to observe air motion, because a detectable turbulent scale depends on the wavelength and large-scale turbulences cause strong refractive index perturbations. C-band radars occasionally observe atmospheric CAE at a cloud edge and the thin layer between the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and the free atmosphere, where are characterized by a strong moisture (refractive index) gradient. Sometimes accurate wind estimates are difficult, because biological echoes could contaminate the atmospheric echoes. Conversely, these biological echoes have been applied to monitoring bird migrations and conservations [1]. Polarimetric radars are a powerful tool to discriminate biological echoes using dual polarized returns; the radar measures the differential reflectivity Zdr and the copolar correlation coefficient ρhv between horizontal and vertical polarized returns, and other parameters [2]. Zdr represents a mean axis ratio of scatterers; spherical scatterers are characterized by a value of zero dB and horizontally (vertically) long scatterers generate positive (negative) signatures. Atmospheric CAE mostly generate signatures of |Zdr | ≤ 1.5 dB. In this paper, we classify the signatures of Zdr exceeding (below) 1.5 dB as P-type (N-type) and |Zdr | ≤ 1.5 dB as A-type. ρhv expresses a stability and regularity of scattering cross-sections; atmospheric echoes indicate almost unity (stable and uniform cross-sections),	antivirus software;apache axis;coefficient;gradient;openedge advanced business language (abl);radar;television antenna;turbulence;type signature;x/open	Haruya Minda;Fumie A.

7eaa95c52289dff5f7eb7756b16281c80c9835db	measurements on the absolute 2-d and 3-d localization accuracy of terrasar-x		The German TerraSAR-X radar satellites TSX-1 and TDX-1 are well-regarded for their unprecedented geolocation accuracy. However, to access their full potential, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based location measurements have to be carefully corrected for effects that are well-known in the area of geodesy but were previously often neglected in the area of SAR, such as wave propagation and Earth dynamics. Our measurements indicate that in this way, when SAR is handled as a geodetic measurement instrument, absolute localization accuracy at better than centimeter level with respect to a given geodetic reference frame is obtained in 2-D and, when using stereo SAR techniques, also in 3-D. The TerraSAR-X measurement results presented in this study are based on a network of three globally distributed geodetic observatories. Each is equipped with one or two trihedral corner reflectors with accurately (<5 mm) known reference coordinates, used as a reference for the verification of the SAR measured coordinates. Because these observatories are located in distant parts of the world, they give us evidence on the worldwide reproducibility of the obtained results. In this paper we report the achieved results of measurements performed over 6 1/2 years (from July 2011 to January 2018) and refer to some first new application areas for geodetic SAR.	aperture (software);color;cylinder-head-sector;exptime;emoticon;experiment;geodetic datum;geolocation;out of the box (feature);radio frequency;reference frame (video);satellite navigation;sensor;signal processing;software propagation;synergetics (fuller);terrestrial television;thinking outside the box;tomography;william m. ulrich	Ulrich Balss;Christoph Gisinger;Michael Eineder	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10040656	remote sensing;centimeter;geology;reference frame;geodetic datum;radar;satellite;geolocation;synthetic aperture radar	Vision	79.46511032067198	-65.38398863540277	142295

Satellite images are routinely used in media reports, virtual globes and interactive maps. The increased exposure, and familiarization, of the general public to satellite data and products is leading to greater expectations about what data should be available and how they should be packaged. To meet these expectations, NASA's Land Atmosphere Near-real time Capability for EOS (LANCE) has refined the way in which users can browse, filter and retrieve satellite imagery for a particular area of interest. The developments on LANCE, part of the NASA Earth Data website, are largely user-driven based on interviews and interactions with end users.

The real and imaginary parts of the ECRI were retrieved using the statistical averages of phase difference and logarithmic amplitude attenuation of the GPS signals. For this purpose the interferometer having two arms was developed. It was formed with three identical receivers located on a straight line, with the length of each arm being equal to 8 m. Two receives were placed in such a way as to avoid wave propagation through the forest canopy, while the wave path related to the third receiver crossed the forest canopy. Field measurements were carried out in a pine forest area near the city of Krasnoyarsk Russia, with the height, trunk thickness, and spacing of trees being of 10-15 m, 0,2-0,35 m, and 3-7 m, respectively. As a result, the equivalent refractive index and normalized attenuation coefficient concerning the forest stand were found to be of 0.00228plusmn0.00021 and 0.00183, respectively	coat of arms;coefficient;experiment;gps signals;global positioning system;imaginary time;motorola canopy;software propagation;the forest;thickness (graph theory)	Valery L.

In the present work, we developed and tested the performance of a method based on low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery for the estimation of olive crown parameters (tree height and crown diameter) in the framework of olive tree breeding programs, both on discontinuous and continuous canopy cropping systems. The workflow involved the image acquisition with consumer-grade cameras on board a UAV and orthomosaic and digital surface model generation using structure-from-motion image reconstruction (without ground point information). Finally, geographical information system analyses and object-based classification were used for the calculation of tree parameters. Results showed a high agreement between remote sensing estimation and field measurements of crown parameters. This was observed both at the individual tree/hedgerow level (relative RMSE from 6% to 20%, depending on the particular case) and also when average values for different genotypes were considered for OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2015, 7 4214 phenotyping purposes (relative RMSE from 3% to 16%), pointing out the interest and applicability of these data and techniques in the selection scheme of breeding programs.	aerial photography;airborne ranger;cooperative breeding;crown group;digital elevation model;digital geometry;geographic information system;iterative reconstruction;motorola canopy;object-based language;structure from motion;tree (data structure);unmanned aerial vehicle	Ramón A.

Hence, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has developed the Urban Footprint Processor (UFP) that represents an operational framework for the mapping of built-up areas based on a mass processing and analysis of TSX imagery. The UFP includes functionalities for data management, feature extraction, unsupervised classification, mosaicking, and post-editing. Based on >180.000 TSX StripMap scenes, the UFP was used in 2016 to derive a global map of human presence on Earth in a so far unique spatial resolution of 12 m per grid cell: the Global Urban Footprint (GUF). This work provides a comprehensive summary of the major achievements related to the Global Urban Footprint initiative, with dedicated sections focusing on aspects such as UFP methodology, basic product characteristics (specification, accuracy, global figures on urbanization derived from GUF), the user community, and the already initiated future roadmap of follow-on activities and products. The active community of >250 institutions already working with the GUF data documents the relevance and suitability of the GUF initiative and the underlying high-resolution SAR imagery with respect to the provision of key information on the human presence on earth and the global human settlements properties and patterns, respectively.	dynamic language runtime;feature extraction;image resolution;image stitching;postediting;relevance;unsupervised learning;virtual community	Thomas Esch;Felix Bachofer;Wieke Heldens;Andreas Hirner;Mattia Marconcini;Daniela Palacios-Lopez;Achim Roth;Soner Üreyen;Julian Zeidler;Stefan W.

Mining activities have dominated in the region till the closure of the mines in 2002 and alternative land use has gained importance after the mining activities ceased. The rehabilitation of areas affected by the mining are the main priority within the region. The objective is to identify and monitor abiotic and biotic characteristics of the region affected by mining activities as well as alternative human-induced activities. Multi-senor data are implemented to carry out a regional characterization. Advanced image processing procedures obtain detailed information from hyperspectral data and this information is implemented in the multispectral data to monitor the different land uses. Monitoring results show that the distribution of areas affected by mining activities is rapidly diminishing in the most recent years.	image processing;mercury;multispectral image;situated	Celia Rico;Thomas Schmid;Rocío Millán;María José Sierra;Sandra Carrasco	2008	IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4780064	probability density function;land use;mining;mining engineering;image processing;hydrology;soil contamination;mercury;statistics;remote sensing	Embedded	80.6667782005334	-58.53595512030901	143433

The assessment is made during the rice cultivation period, from transplanting to harvesting time (May to October) for fields around Gala lake (Turkey), one of the largest and most productive paddy rice planting area in the country. Detailed ground truth measurements describing biophysical parameters are collected in a dedicated campaign. A stack of 16 dual-pol TanDEM-X images is used for the generation of 32 digital elevation models (DEMs) over the studied area. The quality of the data allows the use of the interferometric phase as a state variable capable to estimate crop heights for almost all the growing stages. The early vegetative rice stage, which is characterized by flooded fields, cannot be represented by the interferometric phase due to a low signal-to-noise ratio but can be easily detected by amplitude and interferometric coherence thresholding. A study on the impact of the polarization in the signal backscatter is also performed. An analysis of the differences between HH and VV DEMs shows the varying signal penetration for the two polarizations at different growing stages. The validation with reference data demonstrates the capability to establish a direct relationship between interferometric phase and rice growth. The very high coherence of TanDEM-X data yields elevation estimates with root-mean-square error in a decimetric level, supporting temporal change analysis on a field-by-field basis.	digital elevation model;file spanning;ground truth;persistent vegetative state;polarization (waves);signal-to-noise ratio;synthetic data;tandem computers;thresholding (image processing);verification and validation	Cristian Rossi;Esra Erten	2015	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2014.2330377	meteorology;hydrology;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;remote sensing	Visualization	81.82354739598766	-60.4010311491053	143609

In this configuration, several spectroscopic imagers are placed on the ground to achieve multiple perspectives of the emission as it is perturbed by gravity waves. The classical way to analyze this data is to use a tomographic approach to estimate the wave parameters. In this paper, a strategy is developed to estimate the wave parameters directly from the data without using tomography. This approach is then demonstrated with a simulation.	autostereogram;camera resectioning;simulation;tomography	D. Scott Anderson;Farzad Kamalabadi;Gary R.

Standard satellite burned area and active fire products derived from the 500-m MODIS and SPOT are avail able to this end. However, prior research caution on the use of these global-scale products for regional and sub-regional applica tions. Consequently, we propose a novel algorithm for automated identification and mapping of burned areas at regional scale in semi-arid shrublands. The algorithm uses a set of the Normalized Burned Ratio Index products derived from MODIS time series; using a two-phased cycle, it firstly detects potentially burned pixels while keeping a low commission error (false detection of burned areas), and subsequently labels them as seed patches. Region growing image segmentation algorithms are applied to the seed patches in the second-phase, to define the perimeter of fire affected areas while decreasing omission errors (missing real burned areas). Independently-derived Landsat ETM+ burned-area reference data was used for validation purposes. The correlation between the size of burnt areas detected by the global fire products and independently-derived Landsat reference data ranged from R2 = 0.01 0.28, while our algorithm performed showed a stronger correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.96). Our findings confirm prior research calling for caution when using the global fire products locally or regionally.	algorithm;cartography;circuit restoration;coefficient;ecosystem;image segmentation;perimeter;pixel;region growing;semiconductor industry;smart personal objects technology;time series	Leonardo A.

Six of a planned ten planned receiver bands will be built during the construction phase; eventually ALMA will cover all atmospheric windows in the spectral wavelength ranging from 7 mm to 0.3 mm. The combination of sensitivity, directivity, full UV coverage, precision calibration and the breadth of coverage, along with the extremely dry Chajnantor site at 16500 feet, will enable the creation of superb images of the celestial structures which emit mm and sub-mm photons. Equipment will continuously monitor atmospheric parameters, in particular the water vapor content along the telescopes' line of site, to permit real time correction of atmospheric perturbations to the observed wavefront. The observer will have a range of sophisticated data analysis techniques to be able to compensate for atmospheric and instrumental perturbations to the raw data.	celestial coordinate system;microsoft windows;spatial scale	Alwyn Wootten;Darrel Emerson	2005	Proceedings.

The objective is to overcome previous approaches that prevented the extraction of information about the sample eigenvectors or restricted the analysis to simulated data. This paper considers a perturbation analysis of the eigendecomposition of the coherency matrix, making it possible to obtain analytical expressions for the sample eigenvalues and their means and variances, the sample mean entropy and anisotropy, the sample eigenvectors and the sample αi angles, as well as for the sample mean alpha angle α̅. All the parameters are shown to be estimated asymptotically non-biased with respect to the number of averaged samples. It is also demonstrated that the sample eigenvectors are more robust than the sample eigenvalues to the presence of speckle. Finally, a simple technique for the precise removal of the entropy bias is presented.	information extraction;perturbation theory;polarimetry;radar;synthetic data	Carlos López-Martínez;Alberto Alonso-González;Xavier Fàbregas	2014	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2013.2257802	speckle pattern;computer vision;eigendecomposition of a matrix;synthetic aperture radar;polarimetry;perturbation theory;optics;information extraction;physics;remote sensing	ML	74.05706360659102	-65.27829532509618	144394

This paper addresses the problem of the built-up areas extraction in high-resolution (HR) SAR images, which can provide a wealth of information to characterize urban environments. Strong backscattering behavior is one of the distinct characteristics of built-up areas in a SAR image. However, in practical applications, only a small portion of pixels characterizing the built-up areas appears bright. Thus, specific texture measures should be considered for identifying these areas. This paper presents a novel texture measure by combining the proposed labeled co-occurrence matrix technique with the specific spatial variability structure of the considered land-cover type in the fuzzy set theory. The spatial variability is analyzed by means of variogram, which reflects the spatial correlation or non-similarity associated with a particular terrain surface. The derived parameters from the variograms are used to establish fuzzy functions to characterize the built-up class and non built-up class, separately. The proposed technique was tested on TerraSAR-X images acquired of Nanjing (China) and Barcelona (Spain), and on a COSMO-SkyMed image acquired of Hangzhou (China). The obtained classification accuracies point out the effectiveness of the proposed technique in identifying and detecting built-up areas.

b403aabcd48a22c520f3f688ec01b7c853bdad9a	an integrated spatio-spectral–temporal sparse representation method for fusing remote-sensing images with different resolutions		Different spectral, spatial, and temporal features have been widely used in the remote-sensing image analysis. The further development of multiple sensor remote-sensing technologies has made it necessary to explore new methods of remote-sensing image fusion using different optical image data sets which provide complementary image properties and a tradeoff among spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. However, due to problems in assessing correlations between different types of satellite data with different resolutions, a few efforts have been made to explore spatio-spectral–temporal features. For this purpose, we propose a novel sparse representation model to generate synthesized frequent high-spectral and high-spatial resolution data by blending multiple types: spatio-temporal data fusion, spectral–temporal data fusion, spatio-spectral data fusion, and spatio-spectral–temporal data fusion. The proposed method exploits high-spectral correlation across spectral domains and high self-similarity across spatial domains to learn the spatio-spectral fusion basis. Then, it associates temporal changes using a local constraint sparse representation. The integrated spatio-spectral–temporal sparse representation model based on the learned spectral–spatial and temporal change features strengthens the model’s ability to provide high-resolution data needed to address demanding work in real-world applications. Finally, the proposed method is not restricted to a certain type of data, but it can associate any type of remote-sensing data and be applied to dynamic changes in heterogeneous landscapes. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.	algorithmic efficiency;alpha compositing;feature extraction;feature learning;image analysis;image fusion;image resolution;mathematical optimization;pixel;radar;real-time computing;real-time locating system;self-similarity;sensor;sparse approximation;sparse matrix	Chongyue Zhao;Xinbo Gao;William J.

In this letter, a novel and practical method is presented for aerial object localization by using gravity and gravity gradient anomaly. Different from the state-of-the-art methods, such as GPS, radar, and laser, the proposed method runs in a passive manner and achieves AUV invisibility without energy emission. Compared with the object localization methods based on gravity and gravity gradient inversion, the proposed method is more practical as no large area gravity and gravity gradient measurements are needed to estimate the object mass. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than the existing methods.	aerial photography;algorithm;anomaly detection;experiment;global positioning system;gradient;gradient descent;object detection;radar;stationary state	Zu Yan;Jie Ma;Jinwen Tian	2015	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2015.2388772	lidar;navigation;gravity;geodesy;mathematics;optics;physics;statistics;remote sensing;observational error	Robotics	75.68894934750354	-63.75712976201197	145250

These frequency shifts are most obvious in fast moving point targets such as ships. However, an area target such as the sea surface can also cause a measurable Doppler shift from which ocean surface currents can be estimated. We compare surface currents derived from three standard mode Radarsat-1 scenes over the Scotian Shelf to in situ currents measured with 21 self-locating datum marker buoys (SLDMBs). The SLDMBs drift with the local surface current, and their locations, obtained every 30 minutes via Argos satellite, are used to calculate the current. Three Radarsat-1 scenes were processed by Atlantis Scientific of Ottawa, Canada, to obtain the component of the surface current vector perpendicular to the path of the satellite. The results show that the noise in the derived Doppler shift was comparable to the Doppler shift expected from the relatively low surface currents prevalent on the Scotian Shelf. While it was concluded that present space-based SAR technology cannot provide accurate surface current data for Scotian Shelf conditions, the methodology and results provide a useful metric by which future SAR systems can be evaluated.

130a8b7fa87b62f3ddee2a57954e547ed85e04a8	aster/tir vicarious calibration activities in us and japan validation sites for 14 years	sensors;black bodies;total internal reflection;physical oceanography;satellites;equipment and services;water;calibration	The ASTER instrument onboard the NASA’s Terra satellite launched in December 1999 has three subsystems divided by the spectral regions. ASTER thermal infrared (TIR) subsystem has five TIR bands with a spatial resolution of 90 m. Since March 2000 after the initial checkout period, many vicarious calibration (VC) experiments have been conducted for ASTER/TIR in lakes such as Lake Tahoe (NV/CA), Salton Sea (CA), and Lake Kasumigaura (Japan), and in dry lakes such as Railroad Valley (NV), Alkali Lake (NV), and Coyote Lake (CA). In the present paper, 307 VC matchup data obtained by three organizations were analyzed. Overall results show that a typical difference between the at-sensor radiance acquired by onboard calibration (OBC) and that predicted by VC is about 0.5 to 1 K in the water sites and about 1 to 2 K in the land sites. The results of the responsivity analysis indicate that VC is well tracking the responsivity changes measured by OBC, though the recent discrepancy at band 10 should be investigated with more VC results. The results of the offset analysis indicate that the short term calibration (STC) which is performed at a blackbody temperature of 270 K before every Earth observation has worked normally. It is therefore concluded that the ASTER/TIR instrument has been keeping the designed accuracy (1 K for the temperature range of 270 to 340 K) since the launch. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Hence, a polarimetric calibration tool based on the algorithm proposed by Quegan has been developed and analyzed with data coming from TerraSAR-X and INTASAR RIX prototype. The final aim of this work is to obtain a ready to use polarimetric calibration software not only for these sensors but also for the future earth observation satellite PAZ. The results obtained are analyzed for both sensors. The tool seems to have good performance for TerraSAR-X data and is less effective for the INTASAR RIX prototype data.	algorithm;polarimetry;prototype;sensor	Nuria Gimeno Martínez;Beatriz Gómez Miguel;Adolfo López Pescador;Patricia Cifuentes Revenga;Jose Carlos Nieto-Borge	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352275	computer vision;calibration;synthetic aperture radar;geodesy;geology;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	78.51652560446958	-63.85767437774256	146052

Both will be examined by this paper in terms of how GIS data at the point level can assist the identification and interpretation of urban land use patterns from classified land cover. Specifically, how spatial statistics can be used to summarise the two-dimensional patterns of point data representing residential and commercial buildings. In this paper point data refer to the location of postal addresses known as ADDRESS-POINT^T^M and collected by the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain and COMPAS^T^M in Northern Ireland. Groups of these postal points are characterised using standard nearest-neighbour and linear nearest-neighbour indices in terms of the spacing and arrangement of residential and commercial buildings. The indices then form the basis for the interpretation of urban pixels classified from IKONOS imagery at the 4m spatial resolution. In addition, the paper will outline an agenda for constructing an automated pattern recognition system that would ultimately identify and characterise the physical arrangement of buildings in terms of density (compactness versus sparseness) and linearity. Preliminary results so far are most encouraging. Using ground truth from aerial photographs at 15cm spatial resolution, classified IKONOS imagery representing two cities in the United Kingdom, Bristol and Belfast, have been investigated. In both, spatial patterns have demonstrated the ability to identify misclassified urban pixels and characterise a variety of building arrangements. Also, using the software e-Cognition, a spatial classification based on nearest neighbour contextual rules produced accuracies of 95.4% compared to 90.7% from a multispectral-only classification. Further, more extensive testing is continuing.	postal	Victor Mesev	2007	Information Fusion	10.1016/j.inffus.2005.05.004	land use;common spatial pattern;image resolution;ground truth;computer science;spatial analysis;aerial photography;remote sensing	Vision	78.46988400847582	-57.60599818478006	146453

There are three types of stripe noises in MODIS data: detector-to-detector stripes, mirror side stripes, and noisy stripes. Without correction, stripe noises will cause processing errors to the other MODIS products. In this paper, a noise-reduction algorithm is developed to reduce the stripe noise effects in both Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS data by combining a histogram-matching algorithm with an iterated weighted least-squares (WLS) facet filter. Histogram matching corrects for detector-to-detector stripes and mirror side stripes. The iterated WLS facet filter corrects for noisy stripes. The method was tested on heavily striped Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS images. Results of Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS data show that the proposed algorithm reduced stripes noises without degrading image quality. To evaluate performance of the proposed method, quantitative and qualitative analyses were carried out by visual inspection and quality indexes of destriped images	algorithm;aqua;circuit complexity;computer vision;filter (signal processing);histogram matching;image quality;iteration;least squares;noise reduction;numerical analysis;stellar classification;stripes;visual inspection	Preesan Rakwatin;Wataru Takeuchi;Yoshifumi Yasuoka	2007	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2007.895841	image quality;filter;computer vision;radiometry;image processing;qualitative research;noise;noise reduction;histogram;optics;imaging spectrometer;least squares;physics;statistics;remote sensing;visual inspection	Visualization	70.11667154399446	-63.22650629429713	146981
a2a1c5f17c4f9db9e5f18565433a0d1da4f18826	pitfalls in gpr data interpretation: false reflectors detected in lunar radar cross sections by chang’e-3		Chang’e-3 (CE-3) has been the first spacecraft to soft land on the moon since the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 in 1976. The spacecraft arrived at Mare Imbrium on December 14, 2013, and the same day, Yutu lunar rover separated from lander to start its exploration of the surface and the subsurface around the landing site. The rover was equipped, among other instruments, with two lunar penetrating radar systems having a working frequency of 60 and 500 MHz. The radars acquired data for about two weeks while the rover was slowly moving along a path of about 114 m. At navigation point N0209, the rover got stacked into the lunar soil and after that only data at a fixed position could be collected. The low-frequency radar data have been analyzed by different authors and published in two different papers, which reported totally controversial interpretations of the radar cross sections. This paper is devoted to resolve such controversy by carefully analyzing and comparing the data collected on the moon by Yutu rover and on earth by a prototype of LPR mounted onboard a model of the CE-3 lunar rover. Such analysis demonstrates that the deep radar features previously ascribed to the lunar shallow stratigraphy are not real reflectors, rather they are signal artifacts probably generated by the system and its electromagnetic interaction with the metallic rover.	google lunar xprize;kriging;luna;lunar lander (video game series);moon;noise (electronics);prototype;radar;robustness (computer science);rover (the prisoner);terrestrial television;tracing (software)	Chunlai Li;Shuguo Xing;Sebastian Emanuel Lauro;Yan Su;Shun Dai;Jianqing Feng;Barbara Cosciotti;Federico Di Paolo;Elisabetta Mattei;Yuan Xiao;Chunyu Ding;Elena Pettinelli	2018	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2017.2761881	lunar soil;mathematics;remote sensing;ground-penetrating radar;radar;geodesy;spacecraft	Robotics	80.51566135148572	-63.56441504938058	146986

In this isolated region remote sensing techniques can provide an effective measurement of dust storms. Brightness temperature channels 4, 5 of AVHRR/NOAA satellite data, emissive bands of MODIS/TERRA satellite data, and meteorological station measurement data were used and tested for dust and sandstorm mapping in the desert area of Mongolia and northern China. The differences between thermal bands in combination with GIS layers were used for mapping in this study. The results show that dust and sand storm maps can be achieved from emissive bands for monitoring of dust and sandstorms. Most active dust storm sources can occur in truly remote areas where there is little or no human activity though many sources are associated with areas where human impacts are well documented. Thus on a regional scale dust mobilization appears to be dominated by natural sources.	geographic information system;source-to-source compiler	Renchin Tsolmon;Lkhamjav Ochirkhuyag;Troy Sternberg	2008	Int.

The difficulty of detecting targets in remotely sensed images with spatial image analysis arises from the fact that the ground sampling distance is generally larger than the size of targets of interest in which case targets are embedded in a single pixel and cannot be detected spatially. Under this circumstance target detection must be carried out at subpixel level and spectral analysis offers a valuable alternative. In this paper, the problem of subpixel spectral detection of targets in remote sensing images is considered, where two constrained target detection approaches are studied and compared. One is a target abundance-constrained approach, referred to as nonnegatively constrained least squares (NCLS) method. It is a constrained least squares spectral mixture analysis method which implements a nonnegativity constraint on the abundance fractions of targets of interest. Another is a target signature-constrained approach, called constrained energy minimization (CEM) method. It constrains the desired target signature with a specific gain while minimizing effects caused by other unknown signatures. A quantitative study is conducted to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of both methods. Some suggestions are further proposed to mitigate their disadvantages.	antivirus software;embedded system;energy minimization;ground sample distance;image analysis;linear least squares (mathematics);pixel;sampling (signal processing);sensor;spectral density estimation	Chein-I Chang;Daniel C.

c0085559064662234b0785f9a3fb62b92db7e641	edge detection in radar images using weibull distribution		Radar images can reveal information about the shape of the surface terrain as well as its physical and biophysical properties. Radar images have long been used in geological studies to map structural features that are revealed by the shape of the landscape. Radar imagery also has applications in vegetation and crop type mapping, landscape ecology, hydrology, and volcanology. Image processing is using for detecting for objects in radar images. Edge detection; which is a method of determining the discontinuities in gray level images; is a very important initial step in Image processing. Many classical edge detectors have been developed over time. Some of the well-known edge detection operators based on the first derivative of the image are Roberts, Prewitt, Sobel which is traditionally implemented by convolving the image with masks. Also Gaussian distribution has been used to build masks for the first and second derivative. However, this distribution has limit to only symmetric shape. This paper will use to construct the masks, the Weibull distribution which was more general than Gaussian because it has symmetric and asymmetric shape. The constructed masks are applied to images and we obtained good results.	edge detection;grayscale;image processing;landscape ecology;prewitt operator;radar;sensor;smoothing;sobel operator;variable shadowing;whole earth 'lectronic link	Ali El-Zaart;Wafaa Kamel Al-Jibory	2013	CoRR		computer vision	Vision	72.18294303215137	-61.998530762134585	147818

The main idea is that, given a binary change detection map obtained with any literature technique applied to the considered pair of images, we can identify possible change detection errors exploiting other images in the time series. This can be done by considering other pairs of images in the time series that, jointly with the analyzed one, can define a closed circular path in time. Then we model the binary change variable as a conservative field along circular paths within the time series. If for a pixel the circular path does not satisfy the conservativeness property an error is detected. Accordingly, the change detection label on that pixel is considered unreliable Experimental results obatined on a time series of ASAR Envisat images point out the effectiveness of the approach in detecting unreliable pixels.	pixel;sensor;time series	Lorenzo Bruzzone;Francesca Bovolo	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946631	computer vision;hydrology;remote sensing	Vision	74.39120694414704	-60.519118416377125	148366

The IFSAR utilizes microwave interference for precise measurement of small linear displacements related to the surface topography. It is similar to a traditional SAR system except that it has two receive antennas (with essentially the same boresight) and the single recording channel is replaced by two independent channels one for each antenna. From each imaging pass, the IFSAR measures (in addition to the backscattered power) the relative range distance from each antenna to the target pixel. The direct measurement is a relative phase difference which is related to the range diversity between the two antennas and the target area by the wavenumber. Using the relative phase difference in conjunction with the ranging and Doppler information, one can solve directly for the 3-D target location to produce an 3-D map of the target area without any Earth model assumption.	synthetic data	John C.

In this letter, a coarse-to-fine method for building reconstruction from high-resolution (HR) SAR layover map using restricted parametric geometrical models is presented. First, we propose a new restricted parametric geometrical model for building layover and for corner line, respectively. Under the guidance of these models, a hierarchical coarse-to-fine layover estimation scheme is designed. Owning to the coarse-to-fine scheme, this method is resistant to various flaws of layover. At last, the building is reconstructed from the well-estimated layover. Experiments on HR TanDEM-X data demonstrate the effectiveness and precision of our method.	experiment;gable cad;high-resolution scheme;image resolution;radar;synthetic data;whole earth 'lectronic link	Kun Fu;Yue Zhang;Xian Sun;Feng Li;Hongqi Wang;Fangzheng Dou	2016	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2016.2621054	iterative reconstruction;data modeling;computer vision;estimation;synthetic aperture radar;mathematics;azimuth;optics;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Vision	75.6808606671274	-63.83208051524322	148633

411885da307a127a4a16a9bbd83cf3658ee9e92a	semi-automated detection of fragmented rectangular structures in high resolution remote sensing images with application in archaeology	doctoral_thesis	Automated visual analysis has substantially advanced in recent years, allowing a variety of targets to be automatically detected. Remarkably successful algorithms and technologies have been developed, e.g., for face detection and for obstacle detection for autonomous car navigation. In archaeology, however, remote sensing images are still analyzed in the traditional way, by a visual inspection. Such a visual inspection is performed prior to a field survey in order to identify potential sites that may guide later fieldwork. Though this approach saves fieldwork time, visual inspection remains very time consuming and requires the highly concentrated attention of an expert. Due to human fatigue, this approach might be unreliable. Moreover, the visual inspection of image data over vast unexplored areas is not feasible at all. This is especially frustrating, since a large amount of high resolution image data has become available due to recent developments of satellite technology. It is, therefore, very appealing to automate screening of large datasets of remote sensing images. An automated screening does not aim at replacing visual image interpretation by an archaeologist. Though machine vision algorithms have already become quite powerful at some visual tasks, human vision and its ability to interpret scenes and recognize objects is clearly superior in general. On the other hand, in contrast to a human expert, machine vision algorithms are capable of routinely screening a large amount of imagery and generating plausible candidate locations. These findings can be verified easily and timely by an archaeologist, who can also estimate their potential significance. Such a semi-automated approach can increase the efficiency of an archaeological survey of vast unexplored areas. In this thesis we develop a semi-automated methodology for detecting unknown rectangular structures, such as archaeological remains of livestock enclosures (LSE), in wide alpine areas covered by high resolution remote sensing images (HRRSI). The LSE structures were of a special interest in several recent archaeological studies, because such architectural remains offer important insights into the origins and historical development of alpine pasture economy. The LSEs have varying sizes and aspect ratios, may be heavily ruined, and may have spectral properties similar to the surrounding terrain and rocks. They appear in HRRSI images as faint fragmented usually approximately rectangular contours on a complex background.	algorithm;alpine;automotive navigation system;autonomous car;face detection;field research;image resolution;livestock branding;machine vision;semiconductor industry;sensor;visual inspection	Igor Zingman	2016			engineering;archaeology;cartography;remote sensing	Vision	76.92390673484662	-56.349727107208146	148709
5ebb03532276af3dd90b4d9869680fdd3ae50a10	leaf area index estimation using chinese gf-1 wide field view data in an agriculture region	gf-1 satellite;leaf area index;neural networks;radiative transfer model;wide field view	Leaf area index (LAI) is an important vegetation parameter that characterizes leaf density and canopy structure, and plays an important role in global change study, land surface process simulation and agriculture monitoring. The wide field view (WFV) sensor on board the Chinese GF-1 satellite can acquire multi-spectral data with decametric spatial resolution, high temporal resolution and wide coverage, which are valuable data sources for dynamic monitoring of LAI. Therefore, an automatic LAI estimation algorithm for GF-1 WFV data was developed based on the radiative transfer model and LAI estimation accuracy of the developed algorithm was assessed in an agriculture region with maize as the dominated crop type. The radiative transfer model was firstly used to simulate the physical relationship between canopy reflectance and LAI under different soil and vegetation conditions, and then the training sample dataset was formed. Then, neural networks (NNs) were used to develop the LAI estimation algorithm using the training sample dataset. Green, red and near-infrared band reflectances of GF-1 WFV data were used as the input variables of the NNs, as well as the corresponding LAI was the output variable. The validation results using field LAI measurements in the agriculture region indicated that the LAI estimation algorithm could achieve satisfactory results (such as R² = 0.818, RMSE = 0.50). In addition, the developed LAI estimation algorithm had potential to operationally generate LAI datasets using GF-1 WFV land surface reflectance data, which could provide high spatial and temporal resolution LAI data for agriculture, ecosystem and environmental management researches.	algorithm;artificial neural network;ecosystem;electrophoresis, gel, pulsed-field;environmental resource management;global change;hypothalamic area, lateral;motorola canopy;neural network simulation;numerous;population parameter;silo (dataset)	Xiangqin Wei;Xingfa Gu;Qingyan Meng;Tao Yu;Xiang Zhou;Zheng Wei;Kun Jia;Chunmei Wang	2017		10.3390/s17071593	atmospheric radiative transfer codes;vegetation;leaf area index;engineering;remote sensing;temporal resolution;reflectivity	ML	81.98626353074094	-58.295639723580024	148845
d2bae8e28441fa34f316ac8bb54bfdc636e5dcac	unmanned aerial vehicles in geomatics	n a	Geomatics as a geospatial science, including technologies and processes, has experienced a boost in recent years with the development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with sensing instruments [1]. In this regard, specific geographical information can be achieved with sufficient accuracy because of the autonomy and abilities of UAVs, including the advantage of providing access to hidden areas that are difficult otherwise to observe. This Special Issue addresses the use of UAVs in geomatics where four important applications in different fields have been proposed with successful results. Bulanon et al. [2] proposed a method for monitoring and assessment of crops by using a multispectral camera (near-infrared, green, blue) onboard an eight-rotor UAV in an experimental apple orchard. Vegetation indices based on near-infrared (NIR), green (G), and blue (B) spectral channels were used for image segmentation, where canopy identification was the main goal. Coastal morphology was the approach addressed by Papakonstantinou et al. [3], for the classification of the coastline and coastal zones; Digital Surface Models (DSMs) and orthophotos were generated for this purpose. A commercial high resolution camera was installed onboard a quad-rotor as the imaging sensor. The images were processed by applying Structure from Motion (SfM) methods. Orthophotos and Digital Elevation Models (DSMs), also based on SfM with SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) as features for image-to-image registration, were the photogrammetric products used in Jaud et al.’s research [4] to monitor sedimentary hydrodynamics at different erg scales, in a silty estuary with intertidal mudflats connecting marine and continental supplies of nutrients and sediments. They used a hexacopter UAV equipped with a high resolution digital camera with fixed focal length of 35 mm. Capolupo et al. [5] compared two regression methods based on vegetation indices for predicting bio-physical and bio-chemical plant traits of grasslands assessing different fertilizer levels. They used an octocopter UAV equipped with a photogrammetric camera, a global position system and a hyperspectral camera, with a wavelength operation range of 400–950 nm. Based on this information, ortho-mosaic, DSMs and hyperspectral data sets were obtained for analysis. In short, UAVs and sensory technologies onboard such platforms facilitate usage in different applications for efficient Earth observation. This Special Issue covers four areas where observations were carried out for very different purposes, e.g., for agriculture and farming or ecosystem dynamics in intercostal areas. These are clear examples of geomatics applications using UAVs conveniently equipped with appropriate sensory technologies. This only covers some of the many possibilities of using UAVs in geomatics as expressed in [1], as their evolution continues. Geomatics will undoubtedly benefit from the use of UAVs.	aerial photography;autonomy;british informatics olympiad;digital camera;digital elevation model;digital geometry;ecosystem;focal (programming language);galaxy morphological classification;geomatics;global positioning system;image registration;image resolution;image segmentation;image sensor;köppen climate classification;motorola canopy;multispectral image;ncsa mosaic;orchard;photogrammetry;r.o.t.o.r.;scale-invariant feature transform;structure from motion;unmanned aerial vehicle	Gonzalo Pajares	2016	ISPRS Int.

In this study, we use satellite imagery to map the coastline changes due to land elevation or subsidence after the earthquake in the Andaman Islands. The NIR band of SPOT-5 images before and after the earthquake was used to delineate coastlines. Images with similar tide levels were chosen for comparison. Elevation or subsidence is indicated by the emergence or submersion of corals and mud flats in the preand post-earthquake images. Our results indicate a general tilt of the main Andaman Islands in a direction in agreement with seismological estimates of the thrustfaulting between the Burma and Indian plates. Changes in coastal bathymetry were estimated using a shallow water reflectance model. The vertical displacement is estimated to be about 1 m for the uplifted areas on the northwestern coast.

In this paper, we compared the performance of CCD image with ETM image from 4 key aspects in order to accelerate its application for agriculture monitoring. These 4 key aspects are geometric correction, typical surface features identification, land target area measurement, image classification and interpretation. The results show that CCD image can be geometrically corrected with high accuracy, is better than ETM+ image for typical surface features identification, records the small land targets in detail, can be more suit for recognition by eyes, can be used for measuring land targets area with high accuracy, has the same good performance as ETM image for image classification and interpretation.

6578904b6816ebe7c66a2757d608db96b622a21b	location of radio-frequency interference sources using the smap l-band radiometer		The Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) satellite mission measures Earth’s radiation in the protected portion of the spectrum at 1.413 GHz (L-band) to retrieve geophysical quantities of the surface, such as soil moisture and the frozen/thawed state of the soil. The presence of radio-frequency interference (RFI) in this band is significant and impacts the quality of SMAP measurements. Knowing the location of the sources of RFI is important, because it can help to identify the source itself and also be used to develop strategies to mitigate its impact of the RFI on the data. This paper presents an algorithm that takes advantage of the viewing geometry of SMAP to locate sources of RFI. The results are validated using known locations of RFI sources and by comparison with the measurements of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Aquarius, two other satellite missions with L-band microwave radiometers operating in the protected band. Comparison with RFI of known location suggests that the algorithm is accurate to 1–2 km. The median distance between the locations reported by SMOS and this algorithm is 2.27 km. A study of the relationship between the localization error and the number of observations of RFI sources shows that the median localization error is about 2 km with 12 observations and about 1 km with 30 observations.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;algorithm;cluster analysis;computation;dbscan;interference (communication);internationalization and localization;l band;map;microwave;radio frequency;sensor	Yan Soldo;David M.

a4d984ee30188bb0b8fe3d8906d3bee18423b1be	segmentation-based filtering of airborne lidar point clouds by progressive densification of terrain segments	filtering;airborne lidar;object based point cloud analysis;point cloud segmentation;progressive tin densification	Filtering is one of the core post-processing steps for Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) point clouds. A segmentation-based filtering (SBF) method is proposed herein. This method is composed of three key steps: point cloud segmentation, multiple echoes analysis, and iterative judgment. Moreover, the third step is our main contribution. Particularly, the iterative judgment is based on the framework of the classic progressive TIN (triangular irregular network) densification (PTD) method, but with basic processing unit being a segment rather than a single point. Seven benchmark datasets provided by ISPRS Working Group III/3 are utilized to test the SBF algorithm and the classic PTD method. Experimental results suggest that, compared with the PTD method, the SBF approach is capable of preserving discontinuities of landscapes and removing the lower parts of large objects attached on the ground surface. As a result, the SBF approach is able to reduce omission errors and total errors by 18.26% and 11.47% respectively, which would significantly decrease the cost of manual operation required in post-processing.

We found that the probability of multiple gradient orientations is greater in a local area within a damaged building than that in a local area within an intact building. Therefore, a new feature (Local Gradient Orientation Entropy, LGOE) was put forward to determine whether a building was damaged. First, gradient information was obtained by Prewitt gradient operator. Second, the gradient orientation entropy of one pixel was calculated in a local 3 ×3 window. Last, average LGOE value within a building boundary was counted. In general, damaged buildings have higher LGOE values because of their irregular texture. Therefore, an optimum LGOE threshold value (LGOET) was set to detect damaged buildings. The experiment results of Yushu earthquake using a Quickbird image demonstrated that our method was effective. Of the total 101 buildings, 87 were detected correctly, the overall accuracy was 86.14%, and the overall kappa coefficient is 72.25%.	attribute–value pair;coefficient of determination;gradient descent;pixel;prewitt operator;sensor	Xin Ye;Qiming Qin;Jun Wang;Jianhua Wang;Xiucheng Yang;Xuebin Qin	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326592	entropy;image resolution;geodesy;optical imaging;accuracy and precision;physics;remote sensing	Vision	74.99685820747754	-58.77802665182381	149432

Our growing archive of observations -- which include high frequency navigation and environmental records, video frame grabs, sampling events, annotations of the video record, and multi-beam sonar bathymetric maps of the dive areas -- represents a rich resource for scientific studies. Recent advances in commodity 3D computer graphics hardware and tools created by the GeoVRML working group have enabled efficient and easy-to-use visualizations of these data via a standard web browser. Visualizations of MBARI's 3,000-plus ROV dives are now available via our internal web-based Expedition database. The GeoVRML implementation allows for geospatially accurate representation of any ROV dive made anywhere on the globe. The system has been in place at MBARI for over two years and use of it is growing. According to people who have used it the system is not just cool but also useful.	3d computer graphics;archive;bathymetry;carlson's theorem;graphics hardware;graphics processing unit;interaction;linear algebra;map;sonar (symantec);sampling (signal processing);vrml;web application	Michael P.

65607f3a327767fc4e969ff4ffa5e50c08d30e3f	a fast iterative features selection for the k-nearest neighbor		Recently, multi-source remote sensing data and their derived features such as vegetation indices, texture metrics have been frequently applied to quantitatively estimate forest above-ground biomass (AGB). However, it is still challenging to efficiently select the optimal features for modeling the forest AGB. In this study, a fast, efficient and automatic method has been proposed, called as k-nearest neighbor with fast iterative features selection (KNN-FIFS). This method iteratively pre-select the optimal features which determined by the minimum root mean square error (RMSE) between the forest field data and the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) estimates based on the leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. By use of KNN-FIFS and multisource data, including Landsat-8 OLI (operational land imager) and its vegetation indices, texture metrics, HV polarization of P-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (PHV), and forest inventory data, were applied to estimate forest AGB over Genhe forest reserve located in Inner Mongolia, China. Afterwards, the model behaviors between KNN-FIFS and stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) methods were compared, which showed that the KNN-FIFS method (R2 = 0.77 and RMSE = 22.74 t·ha−1) was superior to the SMLR method (R2 = 0.53 and RMSE = 32.37 t·ha−1).	aperture (software);cross-validation (statistics);image sensor;iterative method;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;mean squared error;multi-source;polarization (waves);stepwise regression;synapomorphy;the forest	Zongtao Han;Wei Wang;Zengyuan Li;Erxue Chen;Qiuping Wang;Hong Jiang;Xin Tian	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128329	vegetation;artificial intelligence;computer vision;statistics;computer science;forest inventory;linear regression;feature extraction;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;synthetic aperture radar;mean squared error	Robotics	80.39428362556136	-58.32600122861116	150528

This article presents a fuzzy expert system that improves conventional desk studies. The evaluation process is referred to as a ''multi-temporal desk study'' (MTDS) and is similar to the conventional approach, falling back on existing maps, building permits, production data and aerial photos. As backward-looking appraisal it documents the spatio-functional and temporal changes of degraded terrain with regard to physico-chemical hazards present in the form of soil and groundwater contamination. The fuzzy approach differs from the conventional desk study in that it incorporates the semiotic-interpretative character of a MTDS in a rigid mathematical framework that is based on fuzzy set theory. By doing so, the interpretative grey zone inherent to all hazard assessments becomes more transparent and - above all - is not lost or forced into a inflexible ''yes-no'' or ''1/0'' scheme. The fuzzy expert system (FES) increases the quality of the desk study and reduces the costs for field campaigning, lab analyses and remediation work. The validity of the approach was confirmed by comparing a hazard map for a degraded harbour terrain produced by means of the FES with a hazard map reflecting ground truth based on a traditional field campaign. For the fuzzy analysis the only source of information were official building permits and aerial photographs taken at different time steps.	expert system;terrain rendering	Dieter D.

In is known that height field ray-tracing efficiency can be improved by traversing rays in steps across inverted cones of empty space. However, steps across inverted cones of empty space along rays close to the base of a steep ridge will be short, even if there are no obstructions along the line of sight, because the cones will be narrow. This weakness can be virtually eliminated by allowing the opening angles of the inverted cones of empty space to vary between sectors, i.e., by directionalizing the linear PPT. An efficient algorithm for computing the linear directional PPT of a height field is given and its properties are investigated.	algorithm;apex (geometry);bitmap;complex quadratic polynomial;computational complexity theory;heightmap;inverted index;peres–horodecki criterion;pixel;raster graphics;rasterisation;ray tracing (graphics)	David W.

A novel application of the method to the processing steps of image coregistration and equalization is illustrated, using a test European Remote Sensing Satellite dataset. Widespread methods used for these two operations rely on the computation of the amplitude cross correlation over a large number of corresponding tie patches distributed over the scene. Geometric shift and radiometric equalization parameters are estimated over the patches and used, respectively, within a polynomial warp model and a radiometric correction scheme. The number of reliable patches available behaves similarly to the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence with respect to the baselines, and can be assimilated to a quality figure for the derivation of the MST.

Persistent scatterer (PS) and small baseline (SB) methods, which identify areas where the surface is least affected by geometric and temporal decorrelation, represent two families of time-series InSAR techniques to study successfully a wide spectrum of ground deformation phenomena worldwide. However, little is known comparatively about the performance of PS and SB techniques applied to the same region. Here, we compare quantitatively and cross validate the time-series InSAR results generated using two representative algorithms-the maximum likelihood PS method and the small baseline subset algorithm-in selected test sites, over the San Francisco Bay Area imaged by European Remote Sensing (ERS) sensors during 1995-2000. We present line of sight (LOS) velocities and deformation time series using both techniques and show that the root mean squared differences of the estimated mean velocities and deformation from each method are about 1 mm/year and 5 mm, respectively. These values are within expected noise levels and a characteristic of the pixel selection parameters for both the time-series techniques. We validate our deformation estimates against creep measurements from alignment arrays along the Hayward Fault and show that our estimates agree to within 0.5 mm/year LOS velocity and 1.5 mm LOS displacement.	algorithm;aperture (software);baseline (configuration management);decorrelation;displacement mapping;instruction creep;mean squared error;pixel;sandy bridge;sensor;synthetic data;time series;velocity (software development)	Piyush Shanker;Francesco Casu;Howard A.

c276c3fdee06bacf51e9bf0525550659ea9da6a1	semiautomatic construction of isobase surfaces: a case study from the central western carpathians	western carpathians;geomorphological information system;automatic construction;digital terrain model;isobase surface;server processing	This article describes a method for semiautomated construction of isobase surfaces in the environment of a Geomorphological Information System (GmIS). The motivation to automate the process is that the manual construction of isobase surfaces involves several decision procedures, and also a lot of manual vectorization which can be time-consuming if the area of interest is large.A (semi-)automated process of isobase surface construction could accelerate the process of morphostructural analysis. Therefore, the contribution focuses on design, development and testing of such a method. The developed tools were compared to an expert driven construction of isobase surfaces. The automatically constructed data layers were compared to the layers that were constructed manually in the southwest part of the study area (Turcianska kotlina basin (Western Carpathians) and surrounding area in Slovakia). Three different statistical methods were used (correlation, linear regression and DTM volume difference checking). All three methods proved very high similarity of automatically created isobase surfaces to expert driven isobase surfaces creation. The results show that the method of semiautomated creation can be used in morphostructure analysis and save the time needed for manual isobase surface creation.The method's technological background is based on the ESRI platform. The original desktop solution has been developed for use on a client/server architecture that is able to present the capabilities of GmIS to a wider geomorphological audience. Display Omitted The analysis of isobase surfaces extends possibilities of morphostructural research.A semi-automated method was developed to replace manual construction of isobase surfaces.The analysis runs in a server environment, everyone can try it in web browser using own data.A comparison with the manually constructed isobase surfaces successfully verified the algorithm's results.

According to the clustering results of rainfall temporal distribution features, variation trend of watershed runoff under different temporal distribution pattern has been studied. Furthermore, the impact of human activities on watershed runoff has been analyzed quantitatively. Taking annual precipitation and the proportion of flood season rainfall into account for annual precipitation as characteristic criterion, the fuzzy clustering results show that the temporal distribution of annual rainfall in upstream of Fengman watershed could be divided into two categories. The watershed runoff under different precipitation categories decreased year by year due to the impact of human activities. The less and more dispersive the rainfall, dramatically stronger the influence of human activities is.	cluster analysis;dispersive partial differential equation;fuzzy clustering;iterative and incremental development;iterative method;typset and runoff;watershed (image processing)	Hui-yun Li;Guo-li Wang;Ben-de Wang;Chi Zhang	2009	2009 Sixth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/FSKD.2009.62	water resources;runoff model;fuzzy clustering;computer science;machine learning;mathematical model;fuzzy set;seasonality;statistics	Robotics	82.84793279880975	-55.13551232111714	151113

f3212deef7632c1985921e3d7559c4b62c336c90	a hybrid approach for three-dimensional building reconstruction in indianapolis from lidar data	3d city model;lidar ndsm;lod2;hybrid approach;building reconstruction	3D building models with prototypical roofs are more valuable in many applications than 2D building footprints. This research proposes a hybrid approach, combining the dataand model-driven approaches for generating LoD2-level building models by using medium resolution (0.91 m) LiDAR nDSM, the 2D building footprint and the high resolution orthophoto for the City of Indianapolis, USA. The main objective is to develop a GIS-based procedure for automatic reconstruction of complex building roof structures in a large area with high accuracy, but without requiring high-density point data clouds and computationally-intensive algorithms. A multi-stage strategy, which combined step-edge detection, roof model selection and ridge detection techniques, was adopted to extract key features and to obtain prior knowledge for 3D building reconstruction. The entire roof can be reconstructed successfully by assembling basic models after their shapes were reconstructed. This research finally created a 3D city model at the Level of Detail 2 (LoD2) according to the CityGML standard for the downtown area of Indianapolis (included 519 buildings).The reconstruction achieved 90.6% completeness and 96% correctness for seven tested buildings whose roofs were mixed by different shapes of structures. Moreover, 86.3% of completeness and 90.9% of correctness were achieved for 38 commercial buildings with complex roof structures in the downtown area, which indicated that the proposed method had the ability for large-area building reconstruction. The major contribution of this paper lies in designing an efficient method to reconstruct complex buildings, such as those with irregular footprints and roof structures with flat, shed and tiled sub-structures mixed together. It overcomes the limitation that building reconstruction using coarse resolution LiDAR nDSM cannot be based on precise horizontal ridge locations, by adopting a novel ridge detection method.	3d city models;algorithm;citygml;compiler;computation;correctness (computer science);edge detection;geographic information system;image resolution;level of detail;model selection;model-driven architecture;model-driven engineering;orthophoto;pixel;point cloud;ridge detection;robustness (computer science);sensor;shading;tiling window manager	Yuanfan Zheng;Qihao Weng;Yaoxing Zheng	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9040310	remote sensing	Vision	75.98324854448893	-57.266780837937674	151930

Classes of polarimetric backscatter are selected based on a multidimensional fuzzy clustering of the logarithm of the parameters composing the polarimetric covariance matrix. The clustering procedure uses both polarimetric amplitude and phase information, is adapted to the presence of image speckle, and does not require an arbitrary weighting of the different polarimetric channels; it also provides a partitioning of each data sample used for clustering into multiple clusters. Given the classes of polarimetric backscatter, the entire image is classified using a Maximum A Posteriori polarimetric classifier. Fourlook polarimetric SAR complex data of lava flows and of sea ice acquired by the NASNJPL airborne polarimetric radar (AIRSAR) are segmented using this technique.

The DInSAR analysis can be considered as potential tool to monitor the mud volcano eruption disaster with low cost, especially to detect ground deformation as an impact of such phenomenon which may occurred in remote area or dangerous area in such wide spreading area. The observation continuation becomes important to monitor the ground deformation and to prevent further human severe. In the future, multiple aperture technique and GPS measurement will be applied to get a better result and analysis.	continuation;global positioning system	Luhur Bayuaji;Josaphat Tetuko Sri Sumantyo;Hiroaki Kuze	2011	2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6050205	seismology;synthetic aperture radar;global positioning system;geodesy;geology;interferometry;data acquisition;volcano;java;physics;satellite;remote sensing;mud volcano;volcanology	Arch	81.11188499122967	-58.957763480315045	152142

On the other hand the increase of remote sensing space missions can definitely improve our capabilities in this kind of activity. In this paper we consider the dramatic Gulf of Mexico oil spill event of 2010 to investigate on the types of information that could be provided by the available SAR images collection which included different polarizations and bands.

The method uses a Feedforward Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for supervised change detection that operates on multi-spectral time series extracted with a sliding window from the dataset. The method was evaluated on both real and simulated land cover change examples. The simulated land cover change comprises of concatenated time series that are produced by blending actual time series of pixels from human settlements to those from adjacent areas covered by natural vegetation. The method employs an iteratively retrained MLP to capture all local patterns and to compensate for the time-varying climate change in the geographical area. The iteratively retrained MLP was compared to a classical batch mode trained MLP. Depending on the length of the temporal sliding window used, an overall change detection accuracy between 83% and 90% was achieved. It is shown that a sliding window of 6 months using all 7 bands of MODIS data is sufficient to detect land cover change reliably. Window sizes of 18 months and longer provide minor improvements to classification accuracy and change detection performance at the cost of longer time delays.		Brian P. Salmon;J.

ba4535993b1a62d3597ea6967f28b6bab76b0fb5	the analysis of veritas muon images using convolutional neural networks		Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) are sensitive to rare gamma-ray photons, buried in the background of charged cosmic-ray (CR) particles, the flux of which is several orders of magnitude greater. The ability to separate gamma rays from CR particles is important, as it is directly related to the sensitivity of the instrument. This gamma-ray/CR-particle classification problem in IACT data analysis can be treated with the rapidly-advancing machine learning algorithms, which have the potential to outperform the traditional box-cut methods on image parameters. We present preliminary results of a precise classification of a small set of muon events using a convolutional neural networks model with the raw images as input features. We also show the possibility of using the convolutional neural networks model for regression problems, such as the radius and brightness measurement of muon events, which can be used to calibrate the throughput efficiency of IACTs.	artificial neural network;convolutional neural network	Qi Feng;Tony T.

5d499eaa9c81490d1c6505a1697fdeaa27178fc7	can we trust our maps? an evaluation of road changes and a dataset for map validation		Detailed high-precision maps have proven to be essential for highly automated driving (HAD). Nevertheless, the issue of validation of such a detailed map has hardly been covered yet. To be a reliable complement for noisy sensors and probabilistic algorithms, a map has to be validated on the fly using data from onboard sensors on a level of detail much higher than previously tried. For detailed high-precision maps, needed for HAD tasks such as localization, the issue of outdated maps has not been examined yet. To estimate its extent, we reason why some road changes matter more than others and use this distinction to analyze almost 80 km of German highways for changes that render a map outdated. Our evaluation reveals almost 200 major road changes, outdating the maps of more than 32 km (41 %). Observed changes include renewals of lane markings, guardrails and whole road surfaces as well as comnlete reconstructions. Further on, to facilitate the research of map validation concepts, we publish a dataset consisting of major map features of the more than 80 km of German highways which we examined for changes. Finally, we propose the idea of using high-resolution aerial images as easily accessible source for geo-referenced data.		J.

Combining τs with an independent estimate of the layer's average microwave index of refraction ns yields a measure of layer thickness whose accuracy is primarily limited by the accuracy of ns. The technique requires that four conditions be met: 1) The correlation time of the radiometric signal must be less than the time difference at the radiometer between an upwelling ray that traverses the quasi-transparent layer once and a multiply reflected ray that traverses the quasi-transparent layer three times; 2) interfaces at the top and bottom of the layer must be effectively specular at the frequency of the radiometer; 3) dielectric transitions at the top and bottom of the layer must be distinct; and 4) rays transiting the layer must not be significantly absorbed or scattered. The performance of wideband AR for sensing dry snowpacks is governed by the relationship between system bandwidth and minimum snowpack thicknesses that can be sensed, the microwave indices of refraction of snowpacks and their underlying media, and the integration time required to depress the autocorrelation noise floor below the autocorrelation signal. Findings of this paper are that microwave travel times within dry snowpacks over frozen or thawed soils, or over ice, could be deterministically measured for snowpack thicknesses between 10 cm and 2 m using wideband AR sensors having 10-GHz center frequencies, 1-GHz bandwidths, and 1-ms integration times.	autocorrelation;autoregressive model;microwave;noise floor;planetary scanner;ray (optics);sensor;thickness (graph theory)	Anthony W.

We formulated a generic rule for estimating salinity of different vegetation types by studying the relationship between Cl/Na and different spectral slopes in the visible–near infrared–shortwave infrared (VIS–NIR–SWIR) spectral range using both field measurements and satellite imagery (Sentinel-2). For the field study, the slope-based model was integrated with conventional partial least squares (PLS) analyses. Differences in 14 spectral ranges, indicating changes in salinity levels, were identified across the VIS–NIR–SWIR region (350–2500 nm). Next, two different models were run using PLS regression: (i) using spectral slope data across these ranges; and (ii) using preprocessed spectral reflectance. The best model for predicting Cl content was based on continuum removal reflectance (R2 = 0.84). Satisfactory correlations were obtained using the slope-based PLS model (R2 = 0.77 for Cl and R2 = 0.63 for Na). Thus, salinity contents in fresh plants could be estimated, despite masking of some spectral regions by water absorbance. Finally, we estimated the most sensitive spectral channels for monitoring vegetation salinity from a satellite perspective. We evaluated the recently available Sentinel-2 imagery’s ability to distinguish variability in vegetation salinity levels. The best estimate of a Sentinel-2-based vegetation salinity index was generated based on a ratio between calculated slopes: the 490–665 nm and 705–1610 nm. This index was denoted as the Sentinel-2-based vegetation salinity index (SVSI) (band 4 − band 2)/ (band 5 + band 11).	field research;fingerprint;image resolution;inverted index;numerical aperture;partial least squares regression;population;potentially visible set;robustness (computer science);semiconductor industry;spatial variability;spectral slope;stellar classification;triune continuum paradigm;uncanny valley	Rachel Lugassi;Naftaly Goldshleger;Alexandra Chudnovsky	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9020122	enhanced vegetation index;oceanography;hydrology;cotton;ecology;remote sensing;salinity	ML	81.86104646917785	-58.762607133460136	153150

One of interesting application is for detection and monitoring ship mobility in harbor. Monitoring the ship in harbor may not need a large monitoring system such as satellite and radar because of limited area. In this paper, we propose a ship detection using IoT. We use four sensors to observe ship-generated waves and combine them using our proposed formula to detect location of the ship real time. We measure radius detection as the average distance from point of interest. We conduct experiments based on two variables, i.e.: sensor distance and ship speed. We show that as the sensor distance increases, the radius detection increases. Moreover, as the ship speed increases, the radius detection decreases. The increasing of sensor distance causes decreasing the amplitude of ship-generated waves. Otherwise, the increasing ship speed improves amplitude of the ship-generated waves. We can see that radius detection is 0.5 m when ship speed is 3 m/s.	experiment;internet of things;point of interest;radar;sensor	Ajib Setyo Arifin;Muhammad Suryanegara;Teguh Samudra Firdaus;Muhammad Asvial	2017		10.1145/3175684.3175729	point of interest;remote sensing;artificial intelligence;machine learning;amplitude;radar;computer science;internet of things	Robotics	77.07951464923188	-63.93951805548794	153325

The estimation of freeboard, the height of sea ice floating above the water level, is one the main goals of the CryoSat-2 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) in order to investigate sea ice volume changes on an Arctic wide scale. Freeboard retrieval requires precise radar range measurements to the ice surface, therefore we investigate the penetration of the Ku-Band radar waves into the overlying snow cover as well as the effects of sub-footprint-scale surface roughness using airborne radar and laser altimeters. We find regional variable penetration of the radar signal at late spring conditions, where the difference of the radar and the reference laser range measurement never agrees with the expected snow thickness. In addition, a rough surface can lead to biases of the airborne validation dataset, since the radar overestimates the amount of open water and thin ice as well the freeboard of heavy ice deformation zones.	airborne ranger;esa;ku band;radar;thickness (graph theory)	Stefan Hendricks;Lars Stenseng;Veit Helm;Christian Haas	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5654350	meteorology;lidar;sea ice thickness;snow;synthetic aperture radar;atmospheric sciences;water level;surface roughness;geology;sea ice concentration;sea ice;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	82.45532535233296	-62.62121025750751	153587

6bbbaaad318c9c29d9de045b6a5313c42d249c99	exploring the relationship between landsat-8/oli remote sensing reflectance and optically active components in the surface water at the uhe maua/pr		The quality and quantity of water available for both economic growth and life sustainability is one of the major challenges for the sustainable development in the 21st century. This challenge requires research focused on the monitoring of time changes in water properties in several spatial scales. Satellite remote sensing has been applied as an alternative for providing information on optically active components, which act as indicators of water quality. Satellite remote sensing performance, however, varies from one aquatic system to another depending on several factors, such as size, depth, optical properties. This study, therefore, aims to explore the viability of applying remote sensing for monitoring the UHE Mauá reservoir, located in Paraná State. For that, an experiment was carried out to obtain water samples at 24 random samples distributed into the reservoir. Those samples were analyzed in laboratory and optically active components, namely, total suspended solids (TSS) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration determined. Surface remote sensing reflectance provided by Landsat/OLI images almost concurrently to satellite overpass was computed for each sample in order to assess the best set of spectral bands and band combinations for estimating the concentrations of TSS and Chl-a. Results indicate that Chl-a was the optically active component spanning the widest range of variability in the Mauá reservoir and having the highest potential to be estimated using remote sensing OLI band 3 (green) explained more than 70 % in chlorophyll-a concentration.	aquatic ecosystem;file spanning;optical rotation;reservoir computing;spatial scale;spatial variability	Adriana Castreghini de Freitas Pereira;Evlyn M.

985adf454594175afebdc5cbf975f215d2d23515	extended kalman filter for multichannel insar height reconstruction		One of the main challenges in Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is the accurate height reconstruction of the observed scene. Recently, approaches based on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) have been proposed. Most of them are based on the hypothesis of height profile continuity. Such condition greatly reduces their applicability, being only valid for particular scenarios. Within this paper, we present a novel Kalman-based height reconstruction approach, specifically designed to work with multichannel data related to any type of scenario, both smooth or sharp. The novelty of the technique consists in its ability in detecting and correctly handling sharp height discontinuities while regularizing smooth areas. The approach is able to maintain the high computational efficiency typical of EKF and to work in an almost unsupervised way. The methodology has been tested and validated on both simulated and real X-band (TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed) high-resolution data sets.

The quality of interferometric products is strongly influenced by the specific characteristics of the illuminated land cover type. Over forested areas the presence of multiple scatterers at different heights and within a single resolution cell results in an increase of the interferometric phase uncertainty (the so-called volume decorrelation), whose intensity depends on several factors, such as the acquisition geometry, the sensor parameters, and the canopy density. From each TanDEM-X coherence map the volume decorrelation contribution can be estimated, leading to the derivation of a forest/non-forest map. This paper shows the developed approach for discriminating between forested and non-forested areas from TanDEM-X interferometric data, and presents some examples aimed at verifying the validity of the proposed method. From this, mosaics can be generated from the TanDEM-X quicklook data set at a final resolution up to 25 m × 25 m.	authentication;decorrelation;map;motorola canopy	Michele Martone;Paola Rizzoli;Benjamin Bräutigam;Gerhard Krieger	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326353	synthetic aperture radar;decorrelation;coherence;hydrology;optical imaging;optics;signal-to-noise ratio;physics;remote sensing	Robotics	78.73656825417362	-64.20758997842465	154666

As much of the pre-launch calibration is performed under laboratory ambient conditions, accurately accounting for the absorption, and thereby ensuring the transfer of the sensor calibration to on-orbit operations, is necessary to generate science quality data products. This work is focused on the response versus scan angle (RVS) measurements, which characterize the relative scan angle dependent reflectance of the JPSS-2 VIIRS instrument optics. The spectral band of interest, centered around 1378 nm, is within a spectral region strongly effected by water vapor absorption. The methodology used to model the absolute humidity and the atmospheric transmittance under the laboratory conditions is detailed. The application of this transmittance to the RVS determination is then described including an uncertainty estimate; a comparison to the pre-launch measurements from earlier sensor builds is also performed.

The study area covers the wider region of the urbanized environment of Chania, Greece. Different textural features including Entropy and Asm (angular second moment) were extracted based on GLCM (Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix) texture feature and used as the distinct feature value in classification procedures. The classification was performed on the texture image that was produced by the synthesis of the original image with vegetation index BRI (band ratio index) extracted from the original datasets. Results indicate that the proposed approach brings significant improvement of the classification rate based on the different texture feature images of various bands, allowing a better discrimination and mapping of mixed land cover types.	angularjs;co-occurrence matrix;image resolution	Guangrong Shen;Apostolos Sarris	2008	2008 Fifth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/FSKD.2008.241	statistical classification;image texture;computer vision;image resolution;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	Robotics	73.31135575617026	-60.32958694711742	154980
5b52922203b2fd26a5c940cb175abd73d94910d7	sentinel-2 based temporal detection of agricultural land use anomalies in support of common agricultural policy monitoring		The European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) post-2020 timeframe reform will reshape the agriculture land use control procedures from a selected risk fields-based approach into an all-inclusive one. The reform fosters the use of Sentinel data with the objective of enabling greater transparency and comparability of CAP results in different Member States. In this paper, we investigate the analysis of a time series approach using Sentinel-2 images and the suitability of the BFAST (Breaks for Additive Season and Trend) Monitor method to detect changes that correspond to land use anomaly observations in the assessment of agricultural parcel management activities. We focus on identifying certain signs of ineligible (inconsistent) use in permanent meadows and crop fields in one growing season, and in particular those that can be associated with time-defined greenness (vegetation vigor). Depending on the requirements of the BFAST Monitor method and currently time-limited Sentinel-2 dataset for the reliable anomaly study, we introduce customized procedures to support and verify the BFAST Monitor anomaly detection results using the analysis of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) object-based temporal profiles and time-series standard deviation output, where geographical objects of interest are parcels of particular land use. The validation of land use candidate anomalies in view of land use ineligibilities was performed with the information on declared land annual use and field controls, as obtained in the framework of subsidy granting in Slovenia. The results confirm that the proposed combined approach proves efficient to deal with short time series and yields high accuracy rates in monitoring agricultural parcel greenness. As such it can already be introduced to help the process of agricultural land use control within certain CAP activities in the preparation and adaptation phase.

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery with large swaths can provide the needed coverage at a reduced resolution. The development of ship detection methods that can effectively detect ships despite the reduced image resolution is an important area of research. A novel ship detection method is introduced that makes use of a standard constant false alarm rate (FAR) prescreening step followed by a cascade classifier ship discriminator. Ships are identified using Haar-like features using adaptive boosting training on the classifier with an accuracy of 89.38% and FAR of  $1.47 \times 10^{-8}$  across a large swath Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 newly created SAR data set.

Operation IceBridge is using airborne instruments to map Arctic and Antarctic areas once a year, building on two decades of repeat airborne measurements of rapidly changing areas in the Arctic. Operation IceBridge is also producing critical data that cannot be measured from space such as ice thickness measurements. The first Operation IceBridge flights were conducted in boreal spring 2009 over Greenland and the boreal fall 2009 over Antarctica.

Reactions to such stress depend on the phylogeny of forest species or communities and the characteristics of their impacting drivers and processes. There are many approaches to monitor indicators of FH using in-situ forest inventory and experimental studies, but they are generally limited to sample points or small areas, as well as being timeand labour-intensive. Long-term monitoring based on forest inventories provides valuable information about changes and trends of FH. However, abrupt short-term changes cannot sufficiently be assessed through in-situ forest inventories as they usually have repetition periods of multiple years. Furthermore, numerous FH indicators monitored in in-situ surveys are based on expert judgement. Remote sensing (RS) technologies offer means to monitor FH indicators in an effective, repetitive and comparative way. This paper reviews techniques that are currently used for monitoring, including close-range RS, airborne and satellite approaches. The implementation of optical, RADAR and LiDAR RS-techniques to assess spectral traits/spectral trait variations (ST/STV) is described in detail. We found that ST/STV can be used to record indicators of FH based on RS. Therefore, the ST/STV approach provides a framework to develop a standardized monitoring concept for FH indicators using RS techniques that is applicable to future monitoring programs. It is only through linking in-situ and RS approaches that we will be able to improve our understanding of the relationship between stressors, and the associated spectral responses in order to develop robust FH indicators.	airborne ranger;device driver;ecosystem;inventory;list of sega arcade system boards;personal knowledge base;phylogenetic tree;radar;reed–solomon error correction;shin megami tensei: persona 3	Angela Lausch;Stefan Erasmi;Douglas J.

The computational power of modern graphics processing units (GPUs) has been harnessed to provide impressive acceleration of 3D volume image reconstruction. For extra large data volume exceeding the physical graphic memory of GPU, a straightforward compromise is to divide data volume into blocks. Different from the conventional Octree partition method, a new partition scheme is proposed in this paper. This method divides both projection data and reconstructed image volume into subsets according to geometric symmetries in circular cone-beam projection layout, and a fast reconstruction for large data volume can be implemented by packing the subsets of projection data into the RGBA channels of GPU, performing the reconstruction chunk by chunk and combining the individual results in the end. The method is evaluated by reconstructing 3D images from computer-simulation data and real micro-CT data. Our results indicate that the GPU implementation can maintain original precision and speed up the reconstruction process by 110-120 times for circular cone-beam scan, as compared to traditional CPU implementation.	algorithm;cpu (central processing unit of computer system);ct scan;central processing unit;computer graphics;computer simulation;cone beam computed tomography;graphics processing unit;image quality;iterative method;iterative reconstruction;octree;pet/ct scan;set packing;tomography, spiral computed;x-ray microtomography	Xing Zhao;Jingjing Hu;Peng Zhang	2009		10.1155/2009/149079	iterative reconstruction;text mining;computer science;bioinformatics;data science;theoretical computer science;data mining	Visualization	69.76766600291319	-53.35553050211688	155538
6ff8677a36e001a61a28ebd68b8314913cd08d13	the temporal-spatial distribution of shule river alluvial fan units in china based on sar data and osl dating	fan unit mapping;paleoenvironment;tectonics;sar;shule;alluvial fan	Alluvial fans in arid and semi-arid regions can provide important evidence of geomorphic and climatic changes, which reveal the evolution of the regional tectonic activity and environment. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing technology, which is sensitive to geomorphic features, plays an important role in quickly mapping alluvial fan units of different ages. In this paper, RADARSAT-2 (Canada’s C-band new-generation radar satellite) and ALOS-PALSAR (Japan’s advanced land observing satellite, phased array type L-band SAR sensor) data, acquired over the Shule River Alluvial Fan (SRAF), are used to extract backscattering coefficients, scattering mechanism-related information, and polarimetric characteristic parameters. The correlation between these SAR characteristic parameters and fan units of the SRAF of different ages was studied, and the spatial distribution of fan units, since the Late Pleistocene, was extracted based on the Maximum Likelihood classification method. The results prove that (1) some C-band SAR parameters can describe the geomorphic characteristics of alluvial fan units of different ages in the SRAF; (2) SAR data can be used to map the SRAF’s surface between the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene and to extract the spatial distribution of fan units; and (3) the time-spatial distribution of the SRAF can provide valuable information for tectonic and paleoenvironmental research of the study area.	arid;aperture (software);coefficient;l band;open shading language;phased array;polarimetry;semiconductor industry;synthetic intelligence	Lu Zhang;Huadong Guo	2013	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs5126997	geomorphology;alluvial fan;geology;hydrology;tectonics	AI	82.83929620189247	-58.28615726204743	155657

Prior research using these signals has been limited by the low signal power of the bistatic GPS signals. NAVSYS Corporation has developed an advanced bistatic GPS receiver that uses a 109-element GPS antenna array and digital beam steering to provide gain to increase the ability to detect the weak bistatic GPS signals. This provides up to 20 dB of gain over previous receivers. In this paper, the design of the digital beam-steering receiver is described and data collected during flight tests with the array are presented. The data was collected with the antenna array installed on a Cessna aircraft. Flights were conducted over terrain and water and the data was recorded for post-test analysis. The results of the flight test show the increase in fidelity and observability of the bistatic GPS signals by using digital beam steering. The digital scanning capability of the receiver also increases the area of coverage over which data can be collected from a single aircraft pass. The enhanced data collected will be of benefit for all remote sensing applications using bistatic GPS signals.	decibel;gps signals;global positioning system	Alison K.

In this study, we selected Fengning County, in China’s Hebei Province, as a case study area. Using satellite data, we generated fused normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) data with high spatial and temporal resolution by utilizing the STARFM algorithm to produce a fused GF-1 and MODIS NDVI dataset. We extracted seven phenological parameters (including the start, end, and length of the growing season, base value, mid-season date, maximum NDVI, seasonal NDVI amplitude) from a fused NDVI time-series after reconstruction using the TIMESAT software. We developed four classification scenarios based on different combinations of GF-1 spectral features, the fused NDVI time-series, and the phenological parameters. We then classified the land cover using a support vector machine and analyzed the classification accuracies. We found that the proposed method achieved satisfactory classification results, and that the combination of the fused NDVI data with the extracted phenological parameters significantly improved classification accuracy. The classification accuracy based on the composited GF-1 multi-spectral bands combined with the phenological parameters was the highest among the four scenarios, with an overall classification accuracy of 88.8% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.8714, which represent increases of 9.3 percentage points and 0.1073, respectively, compared with GF-1 spectral data alone. The producer’s and user’s accuracy for different land cover types improved, with a few exceptions, and cropland and broadleaf forest had the largest increase.	algorithm;coefficient of determination;matthews correlation coefficient;multispectral image;random forest;statistical classification;support vector machine;time series	Fanjie Kong;Xiaobing Li;Hong Wang;Dengfeng Xie;Xiang Li;Yunxiao Bai	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8090741	meteorology;phenology;support vector machine;normalized difference vegetation index;biological classification;hydrology;time series;statistics;remote sensing	ML	82.05563920960702	-57.66193809901171	156670

Over the last decade, several algorithms have been developed for automatic extraction of spectral endmembers from hyperspectral data, with many of them relying exclusively on the spectral information. In this letter, we develop a novel unsupervised spatial preprocessing (SPP) module which adopts a region-based approach for the characterization of each endmember class prior to endmember identification using spectral information. The proposed approach can be combined with any spectral-based endmember extraction technique. Our method is validated using both synthetic scenes constructed using fractals and a real hyperspectral data set collected by NASA's Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer over the Cuprite Mining District in Nevada and further compared with previous efforts in the same direction such as the spatial-spectral endmember extraction, automatic morphological endmember extraction, or SPP methods.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;fractal;information extraction;pixel;preprocessor;self-propelled particles;spectrogram;stellar classification;synthetic data	Gabriel Martín;Antonio J.

Efficient information management in orchard characterization leads to more efficient agricultural processes. In this brief, a set of computational geometry methods are presented and evaluated for orchard characterization; in particular, for the estimation of canopy volume and shape in groves and orchards using a LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) sensor mounted on an agricultural service unit. The proposed approaches were evaluated and validated in the field, showing they are convergent in the estimation process and that they are able to estimate the crown volume for fully scanned canopies in real time; for partially observed tree crowns, accuracy decreases up to 30% (the worst case). The latter is the major contribution of this brief since it implies that the automated service unit does not need to cover all alley-ways for an accurate modeling of the orchard, thus saving valuable resources.	real-time transcription	Fernando Alfredo Auat Cheeín;José E.

One of the challenges is that there is no general agreement on the definition of noise that can be universally applied to all different domains. This paper proposes a novel technique called Visualization-Informed Noise Elimination (VINE) to support a customized noise removal through incorporation of domain knowledge. The VINE technique consists of three steps of consecutive operations. First, a k-mutual neighbor graph is derived from a spatial data set to model the spatial proximity among data points. Next, a fast partitioning method is employed to reassemble graph nodes into groups. Last, a 3-dimensional (3D) visualization model is created to provide a layered view of the partitioned data, which allows an informed identification and elimination of noise by tailoring to the requirements of a specific domain. The flexibility and customizability provided by this novel technique ensures an effective differentiation of noise from valid data and demonstrates various advantages over traditional methods with improved results. When adapted in post-classification smoothing of high-spatial-resolution remotely sensed images, this approach was able to discover and reassign noise (such as shadows often seen in high-spatial-resolution images) to its proper target class. By incorporating domain knowledge and making use of spatial contextual information, the VINE technique could produce results significantly superior to existing approaches such as majority filter and size-based noise removal. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the difficulties in assessing these clouds with routine observations the next-generation aircraft remote-sensing for validation campaign with the German High Altitude and LOng range research aircraft (HALO) took place in December 2013. Here we take advantage of the synergy of the HALO active and passive microwave package as well as spectrally resolved solar radiation (SR) measured by HALO-SR to characterize shallow clouds in the Caribbean. Based on a cloud mask developed from HALO-SR, about 12 000 cloudy profiles within <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\sim 4100$ </tex-math></inline-formula> individual clouds could be detected with about <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX""""> $70\,\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> of them having a length of less than 2  km.

We show that these small and thin clouds are difficult to characterize with satellite observations by the special sensor microwave imager/sounder due to its coarse resolution. Moderate imaging spectroradiometer measurements are able to identify the smaller clouds but suffer in terms of LWP when clouds start precipitating, which is the case for about 7% of the clouds as detected by the airborne 35 GHz radar."""	airborne ranger;climate model;ethanol 0.62 ml/ml topical solution;image sensor;imager device component;largest;less than;light-weight process;microwave;occur (action);radiation;small;synergy;vapor	Sabrina Schnitt;Emiliano Orlandi;Mario Mech;A.

The problem which will be solved in this paper is how to get the state of every cell at next moment when remote sensing images, vector data, elevation data and point data measured by Geographic Position System (GPS) at the same wetland district in different times have been known. 3S data reflect spatial object from different angles so it is necessary to fuse the data. While 3S spatial data imply abundant information and they are expressed and stored in various forms, so before 3S data are fused features of the relative data are first extracted. Neural network can map any complicated relations even the inner mechanism is not known. Using neural network to fuse 3S data at feature-level is proposed for mapping the complex transition rules of CA in this paper. The interpreted remote sensing images in 1998 and 1999 are tessellated into cells. The land-use state of every cell of image in 1999 is considered as the output of the neural network. There are 11 inputs for the neural network. The first input is the land-use state of a cell in 1998. The second input is the distance between the cell and the centroid of the land-use patch in which the cell is located. The third input is the slope of the cell which is got from elevation data. The land-use change probabilities of the cell are as residual inputs. According to the information of every grid in two remote sensing images a set of samples is got to train the neural network. The neural network that has been trained well will complete the 3S data feature-level fusion. And it provides the state transition of every cell for spatio-temporal evolution of wetland by cellular automata model.

da2a7f4c27fc0b03f0c7dda1e2037ecac04d8b2c	the usgs prism system for spectral analysis — an envi/idl-based software		The identification of materials by measuring and analyzing their reflectance spectra has been an important method used in the physical sciences for well over a century. Modern airborne and space-based imaging spectrometers give scientists the opportunity to detect materials and map their distributions across the landscape. With new satellite-borne sensors planned for the future, for example, EnMap (Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program) and HyspIRI (Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager), robust methods are needed to fully exploit the information content in hyperspectral remote sensing data. In this paper, a software package written in Interactive Data Language (IDL) called PRISM (Processing Routines in IDL for Spectroscopic Measurements) is described. The core functions of PRISM are algorithms for spectral feature analysis and spectral feature comparison, permitting identification of and mapping of materials in hyperspectral remote sensing data.	airborne ranger;algorithm;idl (interactive data language);prism (surveillance program);self-information;sensor;spectral density estimation	Raymond F.

In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect outliers in radar returns, based on modelling the background using an empirical distribution rather than a parametric distribution. The key innovation lies in the use of the Characteristic Function (CF) to describe the distribution. The experimental results show a promising performance improvement in terms of detection rate and lower false alarm rate, compared with the conventional Gaussian model which employs the Mahalanobis metric as a distance function.	automatic target recognition;radar	Mohammad Hamiruce Marhaban;Josef Kittler	2003		10.5244/C.17.31	econometrics;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	AI	73.02576073446788	-64.42414976261855	158311

Since then, a series of software packages for Computer Assisted Visualization and Analysis (CAVA ) of images came out from our group, 3DVIEWNIX released in 1993, being the most recent, and all were distributed with source code. CAVASS , an open source system, is the latest in this series, and represents the next major incarnation of 3DVIEWNIX . It incorporates four groups of operations: IMAGE PROCESSING (including ROI , interpolation, filtering, segmentation, registration, morphological, and algebraic operations), VISUALIZATION (including slice display, reslicing, MIP , surface rendering, and volume rendering), MANIPULATION (for modifying structures and surgery simulation), ANALYSIS (various ways of extracting quantitative information). CAVASS is designed to work on all platforms. Its key features are: (1) most major CAVA operations incorporated; (2) very efficient algorithms and their highly efficient implementations; (3) parallelized algorithms for computationally intensive operations; (4) parallel implementation via distributed computing on a cluster of PCs; (5) interface to other systems such as CAD/CAM software, ITK , and statistical packages; (6) easy to use GUI . In this paper, we focus on the image processing operations and compare the performance of CAVASS with that of ITK . Our conclusions based on assessing performance by utilizing a regular (6 MB), large (241 MB), and a super (873 MB) 3D image data set are as follows: CAVASS is considerably more efficient than ITK , especially in those operations which are computationally intensive. It can handle considerably larger data sets than ITK . It is easy and ready to use in applications since it provides an easy to use GUI . The users can easily build a cluster from ordinary inexpensive PCs and reap the full power of CAVASS inexpensively compared to expensive multiprocessing systems which are less efficient for CAVA operations.© (2007) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

An increasing number of satellite missions are capable of delivering data that can be used to monitor geophysical processes, mining and construction activities, public infrastructure, or even individual buildings. The parameters estimated from these data are used to better understand various natural hazards, improve public safety, or enhance asset management activities. Yet, the mathematical estimation of kinematic parameters from interferometric data is an ill-posed problem as there is no unique solution, and small changes in the data may lead to significantly different parameter estimates. This problem results in multiple possible outcomes given the same data, hampering public acceptance, particularly in critical conditions. Here, we propose a method to address this problem in a probabilistic way, which is based on multiple hypotheses testing. We demonstrate that it is possible to systematically evaluate competing kinematic models in order to find an optimal model and to assign likelihoods to the results. Using the B-method of testing, a numerically efficient implementation is achieved, which is able to evaluate hundreds of competing models per point. Our approach will not solve the nonuniqueness problem of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), but it will allow users to critically evaluate (conflicting) results, avoid overinterpretation, and thereby consolidate InSAR as a geodetic technique.	aperture (software);b-method;geodetic datum;numerical analysis;radar;synthetic data;well-posed problem	Ling Chang;Ramon F.

In this framework, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was recently proposed as an alternative method to Eigenvector decomposition to better interpret non-Gaussian heterogeneous clutter (inherent to high resolution SAR systems). Until now, the two main drawbacks reported of the aforementioned method are the greater number of samples required for an unbiased estimation, when compared to classical Eigenvector decomposition and the inability to be employed in scenarios under Gaussian clutter assumption. First, a Monte Carlo approach is performed in order to investigate the bias in estimating the Touzi Target Scattering Vector Model (TSVM) parameters when ICA is employed. A RAMSES X-band image acquired over Brétigny, France is taken into consideration to investigate the bias estimation under different scenarios. Finally, some results in terms of POLinSAR coherence optimization [1] in the context of ICA are proposed.	blind signal separation;cache coherence;clutter;image resolution;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;polarimetry;source separation	Gabriel Vasile;Leandro Pralon	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730476	algorithm design;estimation;coherence;computer science;clutter;blind signal separation;optics;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Vision	72.97543269987143	-65.02352950600246	158526

Models predict a significant reduction in reef spatial extension together with a decline in biodiversity in the relatively near future. In this context, monitoring programs to detect changes in reef ecosystems are essential. In recent years, coral reef mapping using remote sensing data has benefited from instruments with better resolution and computational advances in storage and processing capabilities. However, the water column represents an additional complexity when extracting information from submerged substrates by remote sensing that demands a correction of its effect. In this article, the basic concepts of bottom substrate remote sensing and water column interference are presented. A compendium of methodologies developed to reduce water column effects in coral ecosystems studied by remote sensing that include their salient features, advantages and drawbacks is provided. Finally, algorithms to retrieve the bottom reflectance are applied to simulated data and actual remote sensing imagery and their performance is compared. The available methods are not able to completely eliminate the water column effect, but they can minimize its influence. Choosing the best method depends on the marine environment, available input data and desired outcome or scientific application.	anisotropic band;compendium;coral reefs;ecosystem;estimated;guided imagery;instrument - device;interference (communication);linear algebra;matching;pixel;symbolic computation;algorithm;wavelength	Maria Laura Zoffoli;Robert Frouin;Milton Kampel	2014		10.3390/s140916881	oceanography;bioinformatics;attenuation coefficient;physics;remote sensing	AI	80.62816952444405	-59.803880833863055	158716

There are several land cover data sets at regional or global scales. However, in the Southwestern China where are the typical mountainous regions, it is usually more difficult to map land cover products because of the high proportion of complex terrain area, conspicuous landscape heterogeneity and difficult image acquisition and preprocessing. Supported by Land Cover Monitoring Project (CLCP) funded by Chinese Academy of Sciences, land cover product of Southwestern China in 2010 was mapped through an object-oriented method combined with the decision tree rules, and the land cover products in 2000 and 2005 were obtained by the change detection. The validation shows that the overall accuracies of the primary and secondary classes reach 95.09% and 90.34% respectively. Taking Sichuan province and Tibet autonomous region as case, the CLCP product analysis indicates that a total of 14,580 km2 and 8,174 km2 area, accounting for 3.04% and 0.68% of the region respectively, had changed in the last 20 years.

While a number of volumetric rendering techniques have been widely used, ray casting has been recognized as an effective approach for generating high quality visualization. However, for most users, the use of ray casting has been limited to datasets that are very small because of its high demands on computational power and memory bandwidth. However the recent introduction of the Cell Broadband Engine (Cell B.E.) processor, which consists of 9 heterogeneous cores designed to handle extremely demanding computations with large streams of data, provides an opportunity to put the ray casting into practical use. In this paper, we introduce an efficient parallel implementation of volume ray casting on the Cell B.E. The implementation is designed to take full advantage of the computational power and memory bandwidth of the Cell B.E. using an intricate orchestration of the ray casting computation on the available heterogeneous resources. Specifically, we introduce streaming model based schemes and techniques to efficiently implement acceleration techniques for ray casting on Cell B.E. In addition to ensuring effective SIMD utilization, our method provides two key benefits: there is no cost for empty space skipping and there is no memory bottleneck on moving volumetric data for processing. Our experimental results show that we can interactively render practical datasets on a single Cell B.E processor. e-mail: jusub@umd.edu †e-mail: joseph@umiacs.umd.edu	cell (microprocessor);computation;display resolution;email;interactivity;memory bandwidth;simd;volume ray casting;volume rendering;von neumann architecture	Jusub Kim;Joseph JáJá	2009	Scientific Programming	10.3233/SPR-2009-0267	parallel computing;simulation;computer science;operating system;algorithm;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	69.10660489484827	-52.14168552025306	158781

One general solution to alleviate this problem is to apply volume compression on volume datasets. However, as volume rendering is often the most important reason why a volume dataset was generated in the first place, we must take into account how a volume dataset could be efficiently rendered when it is stored in a compressed form. Our previous work [21] has shown that it is possible to perform an on-the-fly direct volume rendering from irregular volume data. In this paper, we further extend that work to demonstrate that a similar integration can also be achieved on iso-surface extraction and volume decompression for irregular volume data. In particular, our work involves a dataset decomposition process, where instead of a coordinate-based decomposition used by conventional out-of-core iso-surface extraction algorithms, we choose to use a layer-based structure. Each such layer contains a collection of tetrahedra whose associated scalar values fall within a specific range, and can be compressed independently to reduce its storage requirement. The layer structure is particularly suitable for out-of-core iso-surface extraction, where the required memory exceeds the physical memory capacity of the machine that the process is running on. Furthermore, with this work, we can perform on-the-fly iso-surface extraction during decompression, and the computation only involves the layer that contains the query value, rather than the entire dataset. Experiments show that our approach can improve the performance up to ten times when compared with the results based on traditional coordinate-based approaches.	accessibility;binary space partitioning;computation;computer data storage;cubic function;data compression;disk storage;experiment;isosurface;national supercomputer centre in sweden;neural coding;out-of-core algorithm;overhead (computing);requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);volume rendering;voxel	Chuan-Kai Yang;Tzi-cker Chiueh	2006	The Visual Computer	10.1007/s00371-006-0003-9	out-of-core algorithm;computer science;theoretical computer science;volume rendering;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	69.50966348810552	-52.20083694308064	159010
7f0e75e41a3ec9432ff01c2dd131a059fdf57839	evaluation of a new visiometer for automated visibility observation		The traditional Instrumental observation (or traditional optical instrument) is difficult to obtain correct visibility information in a complicated atmospheric (e.g. rainy and foggy) environment. We developed a new visibility instrument, digital photography visiometer system (DPVS), equipped with advanced digital photographic technology. We compared the results of the new DPVS with those from a forward-scattering visibility instrument (FD12) and manual visibility observations in various (rainy, non-rainy, foggy) weather conditions. The comparative results show that the new DPVS, FD12, and manual observation have the same trend of change, but the observation from the new DPVS is closer to that from the manual observations in rainy days or complicated weather conditions. Our study demonstrates that the new DVPS is superior to the optical visibility instrument and can be used for automated visibility observations under all weather conditions.	digital photography	Jiang Wang;X.

Conventional techniques cannot fully exploit the coherent information due to limited application of few products or indicators, e.g., correlation factor and phase maps. Also, considering the lack of a systematic formulation of change observables and their nature, unsupervised change detection or classification is not feasible. To address this, an analytic framework is established by taking advantage of the analogy to partially polarized electromagnetic fields to introduce vectors and observables that can establish a complete change space. Decomposition of the coherent correlation or change characteristics into this basis set can provide a better understanding of the associated change phenomenology.	basis set (chemistry);charge-coupled device;coherence (physics);coherent information;map;observable;semantics (computer science);statistical classification;synthetic intelligence;unsupervised learning	Ramin Sabry	2009	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2009.2016359	functional analysis;computer vision;electromagnetic field;optics;information extraction;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	Vision	78.09873266965435	-62.141807643152575	159173

Agricultural researchers use ground-based observations to identify, select and develop crops with favourable genotypes and phenotypes; however, the ability to collect rapid, high quality and high volume phenotypic data in open fields is restricting this. This study develops and assesses a method for deriving crop height and growth rate rapidly from multitemporal, very high spatial resolution (1 cm/pixel), 3D digital surface models of crop field trials produced via Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry using aerial imagery collected through repeated campaigns flying an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a mounted Red Green Blue (RGB) camera. We compare UAV SfM modelled crop heights to those derived from terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and to the standard field measurement of crop height conducted using a 2 m rule. The most accurate UAV-derived surface model and the TLS both achieve a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.03 m compared to the existing manual 2 m rule method. The optimised UAV method was then applied to the growing season of a winter wheat field phenotyping experiment containing 25 different varieties grown in 27 m2 plots and subject to four different nitrogen fertiliser treatments. Accuracy assessments at different stages of crop growth produced consistently low RMSE values (0.07, 0.02 and 0.03 m for May, June and July, respectively), enabling crop growth rate to be derived from differencing of the multi-temporal surface models. We find growth rates range from −13 mm/day to 17 mm/day. Our results clearly display the impact of variable nitrogen fertiliser rates on crop growth. Digital surface models produced provide a novel spatial mapping of crop height variation both at the field scale and also within individual plots. This study proves UAV based SfM has the potential to become a new standard for high-throughput phenotyping of in-field crop heights.	aerial photography;autoregressive integrated moving average;digital geometry;display resolution;high-throughput computing;image resolution;mean squared error;photogrammetry;pixel;spatial variability;structure from motion;terrestrial television;throughput;topography;unmanned aerial vehicle;while	Fenner H.

Although there are some GPU algorithms for K-means training, their implementations suffer from a large amount of data transfer between CPU and GPU, and a large number of rendering passes. By utilizing the random write ability of vertex shaders, we can reduce the overheads mentioned above. However, this vertex shader based approach can handle low dimensional data only. This paper presents a GPU-based training implementation for spherical K-means for high dimensional data. We utilizes the feature of geometry shaders to generate new vertices to handle high-dimensional data.	graphics processing unit;k-means clustering	Yi Xiao;Ruibin Feng;Andrew Chi-Sing Leung;John Sum	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-42042-9_49	parallel computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;computer graphics (images)	Vision	69.94259817925827	-53.7477856185891	159416
70289dc340078e53e284be6ae2738f723b8b00dc	island coastline change detection based on image processing and remote sensing		As an island ecosystem, Djerba, a region of Tunisia located on the southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, is characterized by limited natural resources and threatened by land degradation due to rapid socio-economic development and heavy human-induced changes to the landscape. The objective of this study is to build a system based on computer vision and remote sensing data for monitoring changes in the coastal zones of an island. We employed monthly Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite images of the study area ranging from 1984 to 2009. The images were preprocessed using the Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm to superimpose remote sensing images at exactly the same coordinates. We then used two comparison techniques to auto-validate the detection of changes. The first technique is based on a window-to-window comparison of the coastal zones and the second technique compares shoreline changes using edge detection. Three highly affected regions were identified. The Bin El-Ouidiane (in the southeast) and Rass Errmal (in the north) regions underwent deposition during the study period, whereas the region of Rass El Kastil (in the north) underwent high erosion.	algorithm;chemical vapor deposition;computer vision;data pre-processing;edge detection;elegant degradation;field research;heart rate variability;image processing;mapper;speeded up robust features	Majed Bouchahma;Wanglin Yan;Mohammed Ouessar	2012	Computer and Information Science	10.5539/cis.v5n3p27	image processing;mediterranean sea;shore;remote sensing;change detection;ranging;erosion;edge detection;geology;thematic mapper	EDA	81.51787816995062	-56.404847781603706	159446

Thresholding on ensemble coherence is a common practice for identifying radar scatterers that are less affected by decorrelation noise. Thresholding on coherence might, however, cause loss of information over the areas undergoing more complex deformation scenarios. If the discrepancies in the areas of moderate coherence share similar behavior, it appears important to take into account their spatial correlation for correct inference. The information over low-coherent areas might then be used in a similar way the coherence is used in thematic mapping applications such as change detection. We propose an approach based on data mining and statistical procedures for mitigating the impact of outliers in MTI results. Our approach allows for minimization of outliers in final results while preserving spatial and statistical dependence among observations. Tests from monitoring slope failures and undermined areas performed in this work have shown that this is beneficial: 1) for better evaluation of low-coherent scatterers that are commonly discarded by the standard thresholding procedure, 2) for tackling outlying observations with extremes in any variable, 3) for improving spatial densities of standard persistent scatterers, 4) for the evaluation of areas undergoing more complex deformation scenarios, and 5) for the visualization purposes.	anomaly detection;coherence (physics);data mining;decorrelation;displacement mapping;imagery;inference;moving target indication;noise-induced hearing loss;radar;slope number;thresholding (image processing);density	M.

This communications highlights sources of error that do not appear to have been accounted for in these analyses, namely, errors caused by differences in antenna beamwidths, antenna pointing angles, and stabilities. I. DESCRIPTION OF THEPROBLEM In recent years, a number of workers have begun to use satellite altimeters from different missions to monitor surface heights and the positions of features, particularly related to the terrestrial ice sheets as in, for example, [1]–[3]. This communications draws attention to sources of error that appear to have been neglected or at least not treated explicitly in these studies. For many researchers, the real strength of satellite altimeters lies in their ability to monitorchangesin surfaces. However, there is a problem with monitoring surface changes using different instruments, and this lies in the relative calibration of data from the different instruments. In this technical note, a few problems are identified, namely, those of biases in height or positioning of features brought about by differences in instrument antenna beamwidths, mean antenna pointing angles, and pointing stabilities (Table I). The following errors can, potentially, be present in time sequences of altimeter observations derived from instruments with different altitudes, antenna beamwidths, pointing angles, and pointing stabilities. • Relative retracking errors over penetrable surfaces (e.g., terrestrial ice sheets) as a result of differences in mean-instrument antenna-pointing angle and stability-causing differences in relative contributions of surface and volume scattering in the received waveforms [4]. • Relative ranging errors where surface slopes are larger than the half beamwidth (over a scale larger than the beam footprint, e.g., ice sheet margins) or where the satellite altitudes are different. • Relative errors in horizontal positioning of a change in slope (e.g., ice sheet grounding line).

Current multichannel least squares restoration filters utilize the assumption that the signal autocorrelation, describing the between-channel and within-channel relationship, is separable. We propose a Wiener solution for a multichannel restoration scheme, the Adaptive-3D-Wiener filter, based on a local signal model, without using the assumption of spectral and spatial separability. Moreover, when the number of channels is superior to 3, the restoration is in many cases the preprocessing to a given application such as classification, segmentation or detection, so it seems to be important to perform a restoration which suits to the application in fine. In this aim, the proposed filter is developed to be used as a preprocessing step for detection in hyperspectral imagery. Tests on real data show that the proposed filter enables to enhance detection performance in target detection and anomaly detection applications with two well-known detection algorithms in hyperspectral imagery.	action message format;algorithm;anomaly detection;autocorrelation;circuit restoration;decorrelation;filter (signal processing);horizontal situation indicator;image restoration;kalman filter;least squares;linear separability;performance;preprocessor;standard widget toolkit;statistical classification;wiener filter	Jean-Michel Gaucel;M.

Five Rivers in Qingkou Region were selected for our research, change information such as length and width was extracted separately. On this basis, the driving factors of evolution were analyzed. The riverway gradually become steady due to effective river rectification, the influence caused by man-made factors was greater than natural factors in the evolution.	evolution;rectifier	Qiang Hu;Feng Mao;Jianxi Huang;Weijun Sun;Qiang Li;Wensheng Zhou	2008	IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4778890	morphology;geology;variational method;evolution;irrigation;china;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	82.89271566963541	-55.492120403630196	160128

Although ASCAT uses a linear frequency modulated pulse with a centre frequency of 5.255 GHz (C Band), it is subject to Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) which causes, as it is shown in this paper, an increase of the number of noise outliers and an increase of the noise background level over specific land areas. This suggests that the outliers are not a natural occurrence, but are due to RFI from ground based equipments.	esa;interference (communication);modulation;radar;radio frequency	Francesca Ticconi;Craig Anderson;Julia Figa-Saldana;Julian J.

Unlike previous methods, all the DDM points with normalized power higher than a threshold are used in the LS fitting. To reduce the computational cost of the fitting process, a variable step-size iteration is employed. Three GNSS-R data sets that were collected at two different sea-surface regions by the UK-Disaster Monitoring Constellation satellite are used to validate the proposed approach. An 18-s incoherent correlation processing is applied to each data set to reduce the noise level, and ad hoc correction is made on the simulated antenna pattern. The retrieved wind results are compared with the in situ measurements provided by the National Data Buoy Center. The results show that an error of 1 m/s in the wind speed and 30° in the wind direction can be obtained with a lower threshold set as 30% to 42% of the peak DDM point.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;hoc (programming language);iteration;least squares;map;noise (electronics);radiation pattern;reflectometry;satellite navigation	Chen Li;Weimin Huang	2014	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2014.2320852	wind speed;meteorology;global positioning system;geodesy;physics;remote sensing	ML	80.83089659326797	-64.39103370288345	160600

Differently from the traditional oil spill detection methods that mainly carried out on a monotemporal image, the proposed approach opens a new perspective to solve the considered oil spill detection problem in a multitemporal domain by investigating the potential capability of change detection (CD) techniques. A coarse to fine multitemporal change analysis is defined to analyze the spectral-temporal variation of change targets that present in the oil spill scenario. Suspected oil spills and non-relevant changes are identified and discriminated according to a multiple-change detection in the proposed technique. The proposed approach provides a quick, yet effective oil spill detection solution in an unsupervised way, which is valuable and important in practical oil spill detection applications. Experimental results obtained on real HJ-1 satellite images presenting the oil spill event in northern Gulf of Mexico in 2010 confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.	unsupervised learning	Sicong Liu;Mingmin Chi;Yangxiu Zou;Alim Samat	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7731013	meteorology;synthetic aperture radar;hydrology;optical imaging;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	74.59500762617141	-61.10563522740694	160863

In this context, solid ship detection algorithm plays a vital role to execute expected performance. Most of conventional algorithms utilize a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) technique, and have achieved great success. However, there has been no solid procedure to select an appropriate CFAR threshold for various area. In this paper, based on physical scattering theory we proposed a brand-new Standard Deviation (STD) filter by which a dependency to CFAR threshold can be significantly decreased. Validation of the technique was also conducted using Pi-SAR image provided by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).	algorithm;clock rate;clutter;constant false alarm rate;scattering theory	Motofumi Arii	2011	2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049208	meteorology;early-warning radar;man-portable radar;computer vision;continuous-wave radar;radar tracker;radar engineering details;synthetic aperture radar;radar lock-on;decision support system;computer science;fire-control radar;passive radar;radar horizon;bistatic radar;constant false alarm rate;pulse-doppler radar;3d radar;standard deviation;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar;radar;remote sensing	EDA	78.42324634116737	-63.10343730847521	161074

While there have been studies relating such measurement-while-drilling (MWD) parameters to rock properties, none of them has attempted to model context, that is, to associate local measurements with measurements obtained in neighbouring regions. This paper proposes a novel approach to infer geology from drill measurements by incorporating spatial relationships through a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework. A boosting algorithm is used as a local classifier mapping drill measurements to corresponding geological categories. The CRF then uses this local information in conjunction with neighbouring measurements to jointly reason about their categories. Model parameters are learned from training data by maximizing the pseudo-likelihood. The probability distribution of classified borehole sections is calculated using belief propagation. We present experimental results of applying the method to MWD data collected from a semi-autonomous drill rig at an iron ore mine in Western Australia.	algorithm;autonomous robot;belief propagation;boosting (machine learning);conditional random field;semiconductor industry;software propagation	Sildomar T.

In order to optimize the accuracy of the change maps, a multiscale approach can be adopted that jointly exploits observations at coarser and finer scales. In this letter, a multiscale contextual unsupervised change-detection method is proposed for optical images. It is based on discrete wavelet transforms and Markov random fields. Wavelets are applied to the difference image to extract multiscale features, and Markovian data fusion is used to integrate both these features and the spatial context in the change-detection process. Expectation-maximization and Besag's algorithms are used to estimate the model parameters. The selection of the optimal wavelet-transform operator within a predefined dictionary is automated by a minimum-energy criterion. Experiments on real optical images point out the effectiveness of this method as compared with state-of-the-art techniques.	dictionary;discrete wavelet transform;expectation–maximization algorithm;map;markov chain;markov random field;unsupervised learning	Elena Angiati;Sebastiano B.

To scale spectral information from the leaf to the sensor level, the canopy architecture of a forest, illumination conditions and the viewing geometry have to be taken into account. Therefore, a new airborne image simulation approach is being developed for the 3D radiative transfer model DART to model individual viewing angles for each pixel of a scene. A first comparison to actual imaging spectrometer data showed promising results, mainly because the atmosphere simulation could be improved compared to previous versions of the DART model.	airborne ranger;dart (programming language);ecosystem;motorola canopy;pixel;simulation	Fabian D Schneider;T.

Advances in the experiments of these new frameworks are presented for complex multiple scattering scenarios, also with temporal signal variations, both from scatterer deformation motions and temporal decorrelation. Results are reported of Tomo/Diff-Tomo single-look superresolution and light-burden processing in urban areas, with the new generation high-resolution COSMO-SkyMed data. Moreover, new results are shown concerning the innovative capability of Diff-Tomo of analyzing volumetric forest scenarios, based on the original concept of the “space-time” signatures of temporal decorrelation.

A series of multitemporal Landsat imageries obtained during the period from 1995 to 2015 were used to evaluate deforestation in Central Kalimantan REDD+ boundaries. By using support vector machine (SVM) classification method, the LULC types was mapped with a kappa coefficient greater than 0.8 facilitated a reliable interpretation of LULC changes. In 1995, the forest occupied the total area at around 72.6% while it decreased dramatically to a level of 59.5% and 53.8% in 2005 and 2015.

0f1d51a5da1600b5e2a9d281325f27fb4a25e7e9	histogram-based spatio-temporal feature classification of vegetation indices time-series for crop mapping		Abstract Classification of time-series of vegetation indices (VIs) can be a reliable strategy for identifying and monitoring different crop types. Recently, with the advent of new sensors, the time-series data with high spatial and temporal resolutions have become widely available and used for constructing various VIs time-series. These high-resolution time-series, in addition to temporal information about the crops’ phenology, contain valuable information about the spatial patterns of croplands. This information can be used to increase the performance of crop classification. In order to properly extract both spatial and temporal information from the time-series of VIs, we proposed the concept of histogram-based spatio-temporal (HST) features. These features represent each pixel in a time-series by the histogram of its spatio-temporal neighborhood. The HST features, like any other histogram-based features, are characterized by high dimensionality and sparseness. Consequently, the common classification algorithms cannot be employed for their classification. To address this issue, we presented Support Vector Machines (SVM) using an intersection kernel, which is specifically proposed for classification of histogram-based features. Time-series of three different vegetation indices, namely, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI RE ) were considered to evaluate the performance of the HST features. The results of experimental tests showed that the HST features by yielding the overall accuracy of 88.31%, 87.27% and 84.36% for NDVI RE , NDVI, and SAVI respectively are much more informative than other textural features used for comparison. Moreover, we provided a detailed analysis of the performance of the HST features concerning the size of the spatio-temporal neighborhood and the number of histogram’s bins.	statistical classification;time series	Saeid Niazmardi;Saeid Homayouni;Abdolreza Safari;Heather McNairn;Jiali Shang;Keith Beckett	2018	Int.

Although largely overshadowed by Landsat 5 which was launched in 1984, Landsat 4 TM imagery extends the TM-based record of the Earth back to 1982 and also substantially supplements the image archive collected by Landsat 5. To provide a consistent calibration record for the TM instruments, Landsat 4 TM was cross-calibrated to Landsat 5 using nearly simultaneous overpass imagery of pseudo-invariant calibration sites (PICS) in the time period of 1988-1990. To determine if the radiometric gain of Landsat 4 had changed over its lifetime, time series from two PICS locations (a Saharan site known as Libya 4 and a site in southwest North America, commonly referred to as the Sonoran Desert site) were developed. The results indicated that Landsat 4 had been very stable over its lifetime, with no discernible degradation in sensor performance in all reflective bands except band 1. In contrast, band 1 exhibited a 12% decay in responsivity over the lifetime of the instrument.

CERES Flight Model 6 was placed in orbit in November 2017 aboard the NOAA-20 spacecraft. FM-6 joined the FM-1 and FM-2 aboard the Terra, FM-3 and −4 aboard the Aqua, and FM-5 aboard the S-NPP spacecraft to continue the Earth radiation budget CDR. FM-6 is the most highly calibrated CERES instrument due to improvements in the extensive ground calibration campaign. Operations in orbit began with functional check-outs followed immediately by a period of intensive calibrations and validation checks. Results demonstrate agreement with ground calibrations within 1 %. Operations to inter-calibrate with other CERES instruments will commence in the Spring of 2018. These comparisons are necessary to assure a seamless Earth radiation budget CDR.	aqua;ceres (workstation);radiant ai;scott continuity;seamless3d	Kory J. Priestley;Susan Thomas;G.

40969b8269602264c1377493555a1ba4c5595cfd	radar detection schemes for joint temporal and spatial correlated clutter using vector arma models		Adaptive radar detection and estimation schemes are often based on the independence of the training data used for building estimators and detectors. This paper relaxes this constraint and deals with the non-trivial problem of deriving detection and estimation schemes for joint spatial and temporal correlated radar measurements. In order to estimate these two joint correlation matrices, we propose to use the Vector ARMA (VARMA) methodology. The estimation of the VARMA model parameters are performed with Maximum Likelihood Estimators in Gaussian and non-Gaussian environment. These two joint estimates of the spatial and temporal covariance matrices leads to build Adaptive Radar Detectors, like Adaptive Normalized Matched Filter (ANMF). Their corresponding performance are analyzed through simulated datasets. We show that taking into account the spatial covariance matrix may lead to significant performance improvements compared to classical procedures ignoring the spatial correlation.	adaptive filter;clutter;expectation–maximization algorithm;matched filter;radar;sensor;simulated annealing;tyler oakley	Wajih Ben Abdallah;Jean Philippe Ovarlez;Pascal Bondon	2017	2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081373	spatial correlation;estimator;clutter;statistics;radar;matrix (mathematics);covariance function;covariance;pattern recognition;matched filter;mathematics;artificial intelligence	Vision	72.91287397736814	-64.9437717617038	162796

There are strong coherent scattering for the fields whose aligning direction is perpendicular to radar's light of sight (LOS). Enhanced backscattering coefficients induced by coherent scattering on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images hinder the retrieval of soil moisture. The paper investigated the capability of different retrieval models in the inversion of soil moisture for bare periodic fields. The results show that the copolarized ratio and HV backscattering coefficient, which are less affected by the periodic structure, can be used to reduce the effect of coherent scattering on soil moisture inversion.	coefficient;coherence (physics);polarimetry;radar;synthetic data	Lingli Zhao;Jie Yang;Pingxiang Li;Wenjun Han;Xiaoli Ding;Weidong Sun;Lei Shi	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8518025	remote sensing;backscatter;radar;polarimetry;surface roughness;scattering;synthetic aperture radar;water content;inversion (meteorology);computer science	Embedded	79.98714723774168	-64.95011543834573	163411

One of the major concerns about the feasibility of this new concept is related to the ability of the sensor to cope with the failure of one or several of its single receivers/antennas. This letter shows that the inclusion of a small percentage of additional antennas significantly reduces the degradation of radiometric resolution caused by such receiver failure. Impact of antenna failure is analyzed, taking into account two test images with very different spatial harmonic content. A tradeoff analysis of several array topologies is performed so as to minimize the number of additional antennas while keeping worst case radiometric error within a reasonable level	automatic sounding;best, worst and average case;elegant degradation;microwave;passive optical network	Francesc Torres;Alan B.

The paper makes the second national land survey as research basis for change monitoring. According to the differences of indicator monitoring periods, authors introduce the concept of volatile indicators. Change monitoring indicators are divided into volatile and non-volatile indicators. This way updates non-volatile indicators only when monitor can improve the efficiency of monitoring. For the region data is missing, this paper suggests filling the missing data through spatial correlation. In order to unify monitoring units, authors propose a new methodBe postgrading units as monitoring units, convert pre-grading values to post-grading units by area-weighted. Finally, we analyze the monitoring result by calculating the quantity, quality, layout, production levels and other aspects. The analysis will play a role in early warning for the quality of cultivated land.	effective method;index (publishing);interpolation;missing data;non-volatile memory;volatile memory;volatility	Yanqing Chen;Jianyu Yang;Chao Zhang;Zhouting Sun;Dongping Ming	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27275-2_49	environmental engineering;geography;environmental resource management;remote sensing	AI	82.865721345899	-56.16491435526118	163602

Given the diversity of available anomaly detectors, froman operational viewpoint it is interesting to determine an efficient strategy to find the best suited detector for a given application. This is not obvious, especially in scenes with a highly structured background. The work presented here proposes a generic approach to the problem by examining the following questions: How different are the results of the various anomaly detectors ? Are the parameters influencing the results significantly ? Are there classes of methods sufficiently similar so that one can test only one of each class and see which results are most adequate for a given application ? What are the spectral/spatial characteristics of the differences between methods ? Can one predict which detector will give the best results for a given application ? The current paper tries to answer the first three questions by comparing results of different types of anomaly detectors applied to different complex (urban, industrial and harbor) scenes. The comparison is not in absolute terms because it does not rely on a priori ground truth. In stead the detectors are compared relative to one another, the aim being to evaluate the similarities between the performance of the detectors and the dependency of their results on the used parameters, i.e. the inter- and intra method consistency.	anomaly detection;ground truth;sensor	Dirk Borghys;E.

04d2cdb5bc899c24936c076ff7360760aa6b32d3	triple collocation to assess classification accuracy without a ground truth in case of earthquake damage assessment		The assessment of satellite image classifications is usually carried out using a test sample assumed as the ground truth, from which a confusion matrix is derived. There are cases where the reference data, even those coming from a ground survey, are affected by errors and do not represent a reliable truth. In the field of geophysical parameter retrieval, the triple collocation (TC) technique is applied for validating remotely sensed products when the source of test data (e.g., ground data) does not represent a reliable reference. TC is able to retrieve the error variances of three systems observing the same target parameter, assuming that their errors are independent. In this paper, we exploit the same idea to test the classification accuracy in cases where the ground truth is not available. We extend the TC approach to the classification problem for a general number of classes, but we solve it numerically for a two-class problem (i.e., collapsed and noncollapsed buildings). The specific case refers to the detection of L’Aquila 2009 earthquake damage from very high-resolution optical data. The image classification, performed by exploiting an object-based analysis, is compared with those from two different ground surveys carried out after the earthquake by different teams and with different purposes. This paper demonstrates the power of the TC approach for assessing the classification accuracy with no reliable ground truth available, and provides an insight into the problem of assessing damage, from satellite and on ground, in a very critical and unsafe situation, like the one occurring after an earthquake. Moreover, it was found that the remotely sensed product can have an order of accuracy comparable to that of at least one of the ground surveys.	collocation;computer vision;confusion matrix;ground truth;image resolution;numerical analysis;object-based language;order of accuracy;test data	Nazzareno Pierdicca;Roberta Anniballe;Fabrizio Noto;Christian Bignami;Marco Chini;Antonio Martinelli;Antonio Mannella	2018	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2017.2750770	remote sensing;mathematics;ground truth;order of accuracy;collocation;test data;reference data (financial markets);monad (category theory);contextual image classification;confusion matrix	Vision	75.21611850070524	-60.36758042300152	163739

Volcanic ash particles from different fragmentation mechanisms have different surface textures and morphologies. The analysis of the volcanic clast shape remained largely qualitative. A new method for ash particle characterization based on quadtree decomposition and surface gradient analysis is introduced. The approach is applied for assessing fragmentation mechanisms operating during eruptions. The surface descriptor variables like the number of quadtree blocks (nQT), the mean block size (mQT), the standard deviation of block sizes (sQT) and the surface descriptors derived from gradient analysis seem to be suitable for quantifying the structural changes of the ash surface due to variable explosion conditions. These parameters are presented in volcanology as distinctive key parameters for different eruption types. This may enrich our capabilities for effective prediction for the basis of planning to overcome the impending danger of eruptions. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A single-pass SAR-interferometer with adjustable baselines in across- and in along-track directions is formed by adding a second (TDX), almost identical spacecraft to TerraSAR-X (TSX) and flying the two satellites in a closely controlled formation. TDX has SAR system parameters which are fully compatible with TSX, allowing not only independent operation from TSX in a mono-static mode, but also synchronized operation (e.g. in a bi-static mode). With typical across-track baselines of 200-600 m DEMs with a spatial resolution of 12 m and relative vertical accuracy of 2 m will be generated. The Helix concept provides a save solution for the close formation flight by combining a vertical separation of the two satellites over the poles with adjustable horizontal baselines at the ascending/descending node crossings.	add-ons for firefox;baseline (configuration management)	Irena Hajnsek;Thomas Busche	2015	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326419	meteorology;early-warning radar;continuous-wave radar;space-based radar;radar engineering details;synthetic aperture radar;radar lock-on;image resolution;radar configurations and types;geodesy;interferometry;bistatic radar;pulse-doppler radar;3d radar;accuracy and precision;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar;shuttle radar topography mission;physics;radar;satellite;remote sensing	Embedded	79.91613644437746	-64.05262984831057	163832
dbdf2489823abc7de19dc77bdebb7694874ffee8	generating topographic map data from classification results	classification;accuracy;topographic mapping;machine learning;cartographic enhancement;assessment	The use of classification results as topographic map data requires cartographic enhancement and checking of the geometric accuracy. Urban areas are of special interest. The conversion of the classification result into topographic map data of high thematic and geometric quality is subject of this contribution. After reviewing the existing literature on this topic, a methodology is presented. The extraction of point clouds belonging to line segments is solved by the Hough transform. The mathematics for deriving polygons of orthogonal, parallel and general line segments by least squares adjustment is presented. A unique solution for polylines, where the Hough parameters are optimized, is also given. By means of two data sets land cover maps of six classes were produced and then enhanced by the proposed method. The classification used the decision tree method applying a variety of attributes including object heights derived from imagery. The cartographic enhancement is carried out with two different levels of quality. The user’s accuracies for the classes “impervious surface” and “building” were above 85% in the “Level 1” map of Example 1. The geometric accuracy of building corners at the “Level 2” maps is assessed by means of reference data derived from ortho-images. The obtained root mean square errors (RMSE) of the generated coordinates (x, y) were RMSEx = 1.2 m and RMSEy = 0.7 m (Example 1) and RMSEx = 0.8 m and RMSEy = 1.0 m (Example 2) using 31 and 62 check points, respectively. All processing for Level 1 (raster data) could be carried out with a high degree of automation. Level 2 maps (vector data) were compiled for the classes “building” and “road and parking lot”. For urban areas with numerous classes and of large size, universal algorithms are necessary to produce vector data fully automatically. The recent progress in sensors and machine learning methods will support the generation of topographic map data of high thematic and geometric accuracy.	cpu cache;cartography;compiler;decision tree;hough transform;least squares adjustment;machine learning;map;mean squared error;point cloud;raster data;root-finding algorithm;sensor;topography	Joachim Höhle	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9030224	computer vision;topographic map;biological classification;machine learning;data mining;accuracy and precision;educational assessment;statistics;remote sensing	ML	78.0185016268931	-57.5793683900924	163893

This paper proposes a method for correcting deviations caused by topography based on individual tree crown segmentation. The point cloud of an individual tree was extracted according to crown boundaries of isolated individual trees from digital orthophoto maps (DOMs). Normalized canopy height was calculated by subtracting the elevation of centres of gravity from the elevation of point cloud. First, individual tree crown boundaries are obtained by carrying out segmentation on the DOM. Second, point clouds of the individual trees are extracted based on the boundaries. Third, precise DEM is derived from the point cloud which is classified by a multi-scale curvature classification algorithm. Finally, a height weighted correction method is applied to correct the topological effects. The method is applied to LiDAR data acquired in South China, and its effectiveness is tested using 41 field survey plots. The results show that the terrain impacts the canopy height of individual trees in that the downslope side of the tree trunk is elevated and the upslope side is depressed. This further affects the extraction of the location and crown of individual trees. A strong correlation was detected between the slope gradient and the proportions of returns with height differences more than 0.3, 0.5 and 0.8 m in the total returns, with coefficient of determination R2 of 0.83, 0.76, and 0.60 (n = 41), respectively.	2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine;airborne ranger;algorithm;classification;coefficient of determination;crown group;depressive disorder;document object model;extraction;frontotemporal dementia, chromosome 3-linked;gradient;gradient;greater than;large;map;motorola canopy;numerous;orthophoto;point cloud;prostheses, dental, fixed, crown, total, temporary;random forest;star height;topography axis;trees (plant);algorithm;biologic segmentation;slope	Zhugeng Duan;Dan Zhao;Yuan Zeng;Yujin Zhao;Bingfang Wu;Jianjun Zhu	2015		10.3390/s150612133	lidar;topography;remote sensing	Vision	80.77049841120926	-56.63316160972456	164182

In this paper, we present a new retracking method that exploits the spatial contextual information from neighboring footprints along the satellite ground track, in addition to the waveform information as in the standard MAP retracking method. Our method utilizes a probabilistic relaxation algorithm to integrate the spatial contextual information with the waveform geometric information to identify the waveform peak that is most likely represent the true surface elevation, rather than simply detecting the peak with the largest magnitude. Our analysis demonstrates that the new probabilistic relaxation retracking method is able to correct the measurement errors of the standard MAP retracking method and produce much more reasonable and consistent elevation measurements for different types of land surfaces (i.e., inland lakes, coastal zones/beaches, deserts, ice sheet, etc.).	algorithm;linear programming relaxation;relaxation (iterative method);sensor;standard map;waveform	Hongxing Liu;Song Shu	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517985	observational error;elevation;remote sensing;computer science;ground track;surface wave;waveform	Vision	77.07134753113804	-64.36649833267603	164273

Three different cross validation algorithms are applied for comparison, which are the dispersion measure method, the V-fold cross validation (VFCV) and the Monte-Carlo cross validation (MCCV). Our current experiments show that the dispersion measure method appears generally unable to provide a reliable estimation. The VFCV and the MCCV algorithms seem to be more effective than the dispersion measure method. Moreover, the VFCV is much faster than the MCCV, but the MCCV may be able to provide better estimation than the VFCV.	algorithm;cross-validation (statistics);experiment;monte carlo method;polarimetry;unsupervised learning	Fang Cao;Wen Hong;Yirong Wu;Eric Pottier	2007	2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423347	computer vision;optics;statistics;remote sensing;monte carlo method	Robotics	72.43156112341602	-64.29330014507094	165167

For the complexity of the coastal zone targets which contains shoreline, vegetation and coastal zone types and so on, users can not extract information automatically by computers, so users need operate extraction by comparing to interpreting marks and remote sense images frequently. In other side, when users classify the information, they have to look through the information type code table to get the code value firstly. In one word, the current coastal zone remote sensing information extraction is very complicated and low efficient. In view of the characteristics of coastal zone information extraction, this article analyzes the requirements of coastal zone information extraction software, designs the coastal zone information extraction software. The function of the software includes management of the targets interpreting marks and displaying in extracting procession, management of target type codes and evaluation code value automatically, editing coastal zone vector data, shorelines extraction automatically, 3D terrain displaying and reference for the information etc. At last, this article builds coastal zone remote sensing information extraction platform based on .NET and ArcEngine development platform. The software is applied in the project of offshore islands and coastal zones remote sensing survey and research of China.	code;computer;information extraction;requirement	Ruifu Wang;Quanbo Xin;Aichao Liu;Shaojie Zhao	2011	JSW		computer science;data mining;information extraction	HCI	76.86409285869459	-57.32467850390984	165984

But this improvement in accuracy is not easy to achieve due to the great amount of data which makes diff cult any treatment over it and it’s redundancies. To solve this problem, a pick selection based on principal component analysis has been adopted in order to make the mandatory feature selection over the different channels. In this paper, the capability to retrieve the temperature prof le in a combustion environment using neural networks jointly with this spectral high resolution feature selection method is studied.	artificial neural network;diff utility;feature selection;principal component analysis	Esteban García-Cuesta;Inés María Galván;Antonio J. de Castro	2006		10.1007/11875581_91	radiative transfer;energy transfer;image resolution;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;redundancy;feature selection;spectral resolution;physical property;artificial neural network;combustion;principal component analysis	AI	69.95198786166142	-62.61738417136859	166127

We analyze the range data produced by an amplitude-modulated continuous wave (AMCW) light detection and ranging sensor and show that by physically modeling such sensors, we not only can produce reliable range estimates, but can also quantify our certainty in each range data point. We discuss the noise in the sensor and show the importance of using both phase and intensity data for calibration and data interpretation. We consider in detail the phenomenon of mixed pixel points whereby false range measurements occur when the light beam transmitted is split between two or more surfaces of differing range and/or reflectivity. We describe a new algorithm capable of detecting sudden changes in surface reflectance and/or range in order to identify these spurious data points. We quantify the regions over which the detection method will work, as we consider its sensitivity to changes in range and surface reflectance, while also quantifying the possibility of falsely predicting a discontinuity.	sensor	Martin David Adams;Penny Probert Smith	1996	I.

8099174ba6a9e922c8f5e7238bd17c5cb201b559	graphical processing units and scientific applications	scientific application;graphic processing unit	This special issue of the International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications collects extended versions of the best three papers presented at the International Workshop on GPUs and Scientific Applications (GPUScA 2010) held in Vienna in September 2010, in conjunction with PACT 2010 – the Annual International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques. GPUs are cost-effective platforms for computationally intensive applications, providing tremendous peak performance. However, it is a major challenge to deliver the intrinsic performance of such architectures to end applications. The workshop addressed programming approaches and key techniques to leverage the computing power of GPUs. The paper Fast GPU perspective grid construction and triangle tracing for exhaustive ray tracing of highly coherent rays from Lancelot Perrotte and Guillaume Saupin, CEA-LIST (France), addresses the problem of computing, storing and sorting, at an interactive rate, all of the intersections between millions of triangles (a 3D scene) and millions of rays starting from the same point. This paper focuses on the fast GPU construction of a grid in projective space referencing the triangles of a 3D scene. It introduces a fast GPU algorithm which is used to build a grid of the rays constituting the scene, in the same projective space. This ray-based grid is computed during the initialization of the scene, which allows higher performance to be achieved, and the construction of a triangle-based grid in distinct passes for very large scenes, without having to manage memory transfers between CPUs and GPUs. This algorithm works the same way for both static and dynamic scenes, allowing interactive processing of complex and dynamic scenes to be achieved. These optimizations are used to speed up the geometrical computations used in the nuclear field to evaluate the impact of radiative sources on an operator. These geometrical computations are similar to those of traditional ray tracing, except that only highly coherent rays are thrown. The paper A framework for GPU accelerated deformable object modeling from Aria Shahingohar and Roy Eagleson, University of Western Ontario (Canada), describes a framework that uses multi-core CPUs and GPUs found in personal computers to accelerate the computations needed for a class of deformable object modeling algorithms. In recent years there has been growing interest in using deformable objects in computer applications such as animation, video games, garment CAD, and surgical simulation. Deformable object modeling is quite computationally expensive. However, since most of the related calculations can be parallelized, the authors have developed a framework that utilizes NVIDIA’s CUDA technology to accelerate a set of deformable object modeling algorithms by transferring their core computations to the GPU. Their results show that frame rates can be improved more than 20 times using GPU compared with using a multi-core CPU. In addition, they have developed a method called ‘Local Shape Matching’ which is an extension of the ‘Shape Matching’ method. Using this new method they have achieved fast and robust simulations. The paper Combining lattice Boltzmann and discrete element methods on a graphics processor from Andreas Monitzer, University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien (Austria), deals with an original GPU-based implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method. It allows the simulation of fluids using basic arithmetic operations with a linear complexity, as is demonstrated in the paper. Additionally, the discrete element method can also be adapted to the new model. After outlining the method themselves and the integration of these two into a single simulation, this article shows a way to implement it on graphics cards using the CUDA platform.	computer graphics	Beniamino Di Martino;Eduard Mehofer;Daniel J.

However, the carrier phase multipath effect is the main error source with double difference (DD) processing. There are lots of methods to deal with the multipath errors of Global Position System (GPS) carrier phase data. The BeiDou navigation satellite System (BDS) multipath mitigation is still a research hotspot because the unique constellation design of BDS makes it different to mitigate multipath effects compared to GPS. Multipath error periodically repeats for its strong correlation to geometry of satellites, reflective surface and antenna which is also repetitive. We analyzed the characteristics of orbital periods of BDS satellites which are consistent with multipath repeat periods of corresponding satellites. The results show that the orbital periods and multipath periods for BDS geostationary earth orbit (GEO) and inclined geosynchronous orbit (IGSO) satellites are about one day but the periods of MEO satellites are about seven days. The Kalman filter (KF) and Rauch-Tung-Striebel Smoother (RTSS) was introduced to extract the multipath models from single difference (SD) residuals with traditional sidereal filter (SF). Wavelet filter and Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) were also used to mitigate multipath effects. The experimental results show that the three filters methods all have obvious effect on improvement of baseline accuracy and the performance of KT-RTSS method is slightly better than that of wavelet filter and EMD filter. The baseline vector accuracy on east, north and up (E, N, U) components with KF-RTSS method were improved by 62.8%, 63.6%, 62.5% on day of year 280 and 57.3%, 53.4%, 55.9% on day of year 281, respectively.	antenna device component;bds c;bds-i antiviral protein, anemonia sulcata;baseline dental cement;baseline (configuration management);beidou navigation satellite system;cdisc basic data structure dataset;dna breaks, double-stranded;diamond-blackfan anemia 1;galileo (satellite navigation);genetic hotspot;geosynchronous orbit;geosynchronous satellite;global positioning system;gray platelet syndrome;hilbert–huang transform;kalman filter;kosterlitz–thouless transition;molecular orbital;multipath mitigation;multipath propagation;precise point positioning;requirement;satellite viruses;satellite navigation;tomography, emission-computed, single-photon;vernicia fordii;wavelet	Qiuzhao Zhang;Wei Yang;Shubi Zhang;Xin Liu	2018		10.3390/s18010198	global positioning system;multipath propagation;electronic engineering;remote sensing;satellite;multipath mitigation;engineering;geostationary orbit;beidou navigation satellite system;gnss applications;geosynchronous orbit	Mobile	80.08704625202897	-65.6347417423236	166782

It is true that the people and businesses are returning to southeastern Louisiana, but some effects experienced by the coastline are irreversible and permanent. In addition to the major impact during the considerably short time period of the storm, Louisiana was already on pace of losing its wetlands.

The collective impact of harvest decisions by many small forest owners can be substantial at the landscape scale, yet monitoring harvests and regrowth in these forests is challenging. Remote sensing is an obvious route to detect and monitor small-scale land use dynamics over large areas. Using an annual series of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images and a GIS shapefile of property boundaries, we identified units where harvests occurred from 2005 to 2011 using an Object-Based Change Detection (OBCD) approach. Percent of basal area harvested was verified using stand-level harvest data. Our method detected all harvests above 20% basal area removal in all forest types (northern hardwoods, mixed deciduous/coniferous, coniferous), on properties as small as 10 acres (0.4 ha; approximately four Landsat pixels). Our results had a resolution of about 10% basal area (that is, a selective harvest removal of 30% could be distinguished from one of OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2015, 7 7810 40%). Our method can be automated and used to measure annual harvest rates and intensities for large areas of the United States, providing critical information on land use transition.	basal (phylogenetics);geographic information system;mapper;mysql;pixel;shapefile	Riccardo Tortini;Audrey L.

Calibration of the ASCAT retrieved winds over the ocean is done by comparing the backscatter measurement with backscatter values derived from collocated NWP winds. Using calibration corrections, ASCAT winds are produced routinely at KNMI since March 2007 as the first MetOp-A geophysical product.

Because hyperspectral reflectance can obtain the diagnostic spectrum characteristic, which show a good prospective for environmental problems monitoring that are impossible for multispectral remote sensing. This paper uses the ASD spectrometer to collect the spectrum reflectance of Nanhu lake water body in Changchun. Studies on the relationship between the water body spectrum reflectance and chlorophyll-a concentrations were carried out. It was found that spectra reflectance in green, red and near infrared have a close relationship with chlorophyll-a concentration. Finally spectral ratio, ANN-BP model were applied for chlorophyll-a concentration estimation in Nan Lake with eutrophic water body. Analyses result show that ratio spectrum model obtain determination coefficient (R) about 0.6778, while ANN-BP model’s estimation determination coefficient is greater than 0.970. It can be seen that ANN-BP inversion model play better in accuracy for chlorophyll determination with hyperspectral reflectance data collected in-situ than spectral ratio model. Still future work need to be done to test the result of our model for eutrophic lake water quality monitoring with hyperspectral reflectance data, as for inversion the spatial variation of chlorophyll distribution in the surface of Nanhu Lake with remotely sensed imagery data, there is even more work and effort should be carried out.	coefficient;multispectral image;nan;prospective search	Kaishan Song;Bai Zhang;Hongtao Duan	2005	Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2005.

We also describe methods for training the classifiers, which involves determining dependencies amongst predictor patterns and estimating conditional probability of each predictor pattern given the target deposit-type. The output of a trained classifier determines the extent to which an input feature vector belongs to either the mineralized class or the barren class and can be mapped to generate a favorability map. The procedures are demonstrated by an application to base metal potential mapping in the proterozoic Aravalli Province (western India). The results indicate that although the naive Bayesian classifier performs well and shows significant tolerance for the violation of the conditional independence assumption, the augmented naive Bayesian classifier performs better and exhibits finer generalization capability. The results also indicate that the rejection of conditionally dependent predictor patterns degrades the performance of a naive classifier. r 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;bayesian network;dynamic energy budget;emoticon;feature vector;john d. wiley;kerrison predictor;köppen climate classification;linear algebra;netware;r language;rejection sampling	Alok Porwal;Emmanuel John M.

Indeed, at the region level, these algorithms handle irregular (and sometimes strongly dynamic) data-structures. Moreover, they often lead to an unbalanced amount of computations, which is quite impossible to foresee offline. This paper focus on the parallelization of the ANET image analysis programming environment. Thanks to graph related data structures and efficient computing primitives, ANET allows rapid image algorithm prototyping. But in return, these primitives are difficult to parallelize. We present a solution for powerful implicit parallelization of the ANET environment, without any change in the application programming interface. The ANET API is summarized and illustrated with some examples. Several parallelization experimentations are reported. The solution we propose is detailed, and results are given on complete image analysis applications. ANET appears as a powerful environment, both for its expressiveness that allows rapid prototyping and for its implicit parallelization that allows good computation time.	algorithm;application programming interface;automatic parallelization;computation;data structure;dynamization;image analysis;integrated development environment;online and offline;parallel computing;performance;rapid prototyping;time complexity;unbalanced circuit	Bertrand Ducourthial;Alain Mérigot;Nicolas Sicard	2005	Seventh International Workshop on Computer Architecture for Machine Perception (CAMP'05)	10.1109/CAMP.2005.39	computer architecture;parallel computing;computer science;theoretical computer science	Arch	70.15485870606328	-52.97074587292064	167870

We investigate the application of what we term “proximate sensing” to the problem of land cover classification for a large geographic region. We show that our approach is able to achieve almost 75% classification accuracy in a binary land cover labelling problem using images from a photo sharing site in a completely automated fashion. We also investigate 1) how existing geographic knowledge can be used to provide labelled training data in a weakly-supervised manner; 2) the effect of the photographer's intent when he or she captures the photograph; and 3) a method for filtering out non-informative images.	binary land;information;lithosphere;map;supervised learning	Daniel Leung;Shawn D.

It is shown that such radar data lies on two-dimensional surfaces in n-space. A bilinear approximation for these surfaces is described. Surface intersections using this approximation can be found simply and directly without solving a system of n simultaneous nonlinear equations. This intersection information can be used to show separability and effect feature reduction. The approximation is utilized to construct a modified nearest neighbor algorithm, which is evaluated by computer simulation experiments. These experiments showed a phenomenon of""""bias"""", where one aircraft data surface is more susceptible to misclassification in the presence of noise than the surface corresponding to another aircraft.

We investigate the utility of several variants of a recently introduced covariance estimator-the sparse matrix transform (SMT), a shrinkage-enhanced SMT, and a graph-constrained SMT-in the context of several of these problems. In addition to two more generic measures of quality based on likelihood and the Frobenius norm, we specifically consider weak signal detection, dimension reduction, anomaly detection, and anomalous change detection. The estimators are applied to several hyperspectral data sets, including some randomly rotated data, to elucidate the kinds of problems and the kinds of data for which SMT is well or poorly suited. The SMT is based on the product of K pairwise coordinate (Givens) rotations, and we also introduce and compare two novel approaches for estimating the most effective choice for K .	anomaly detection;detection theory;dimensionality reduction;image processing;matrix multiplication;randomness;sparse matrix;transformation matrix	James Theiler;Guangzhi Cao;Leonardo R.

Such variations in the gravitational field may be due to the presence of bodies of higher or lower density relative to the surrounding rock. Recent technological advances have made airborne measurement of FTG data possible, resulting in the rapid collection of vast quantites of data particularly for mineral, oil and gas exploration purposes. As the gravity tensor contains 5 independent components, effective visualisation of this high-dimensional dataset is advantageous for efficient processing of the FTG data. We present an algorithm for visualising FTG gravity datasets which displays local lateral orientations encoded in the FTG data. It uses a colour map to highlight geologically significant structures such as linear features and radially symmetric points by identifying different geological features and using colour components to represent different feature types. We demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on two datasets: one synthetic dataset with various levels of noise, and one real-world dataset.	airborne ranger;algorithm;gradient;lateral thinking;preprocessor;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence	Daniel Wedge;Yathunanthan Sivarajah;Paul Johnston;Chris Wijns;Eun-Jung Holden;Peter Kovesi	2012	2012 International Conference on Digital Image Computing Techniques and Applications (DICTA)	10.1109/DICTA.2012.6411716	image texture;computer vision;tensor;gravity;computer science;data visualization	Visualization	74.40376844479408	-61.785106575915385	168193

Crucial information is the identification of the disaster areas and the estimation of the number of people involved. Satellite imageries are mainly used as input data for early impact analysis in medium and large scale map. Analyses aimed at defining the damages of infrastructure and/or to facilities require suitable data, such as high resolution satellite images. Unfortunately, satellite images are not always available in a few days after the event. Therefore in situ surveys are preferred. Innovations in Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) have allowed them to become valuable tools in capturing and assessing the extents and amount of damages. Flexibility, safety, ease of operation, and relatively low-cost of ownership and operation facilitate UAS implementation in disaster situations. In this paper, an example of UAS was developed for rapidly obtaining disaster information. Data acquisition at specified scales was successfully performed with the chosen fixed-wing UAS. For the image analysis, a photogrammetric workflow was applied to cope with the very high resolution of the images acquired without ground control points. Tests showed that the system plays an important role in the work of investigating and gathering information about disaster in epicentral areas of the earthquake, such as road detection, secondary disaster investigation, and rapid disaster evaluation. It can effectively provide earthquake information to salvation headquarters for swiftly developing the relief measures and improving the efficiency of emergency rescue. & 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

620786b75856a9465dcff6faec1e2f90149de0c0	an improved cfar scheme for man-made target detection in high resolution sar images		CFAR is a widely used algorithm for target detection in SAR images. The simplicity of computation and stable performance make it a key role in practice. However, for man-made target detection, conventional CFAR has a limited performance because of the non-adaptive processing window and the varieties of categories, sizes and structures of targets. In order to detect man-made targets with different size and complex structures in high resolution SAR images, an improved CFAR algorithm with an adaptive processing window named Adaptive-Window CFAR is proposed. A global guard window obtained by pre-detection adaptively is used to take place of the guard window in conventional CFAR makes AW -CFAR an algorithm with both adaptive threshold and adaptive processing window. In this case, the size of detectable targets is not fixed anymore and targets of different sizes and complex structures are detectable in AW-CF AR. Images with different resolutions and environments, which contain different categories of man-made targets, are used in the experiments. The experimental results show that the AW -CFAR inherits the simplicity of computation and stable performance of the conventional CFAR and has a better performance of man-made target detection in high resolution SAR images.	adjusted winner procedure;algorithm;computation;constant false alarm rate;experiment;image resolution	Weike Li;Bin Zou;Yu Xin;Zhilu Wu	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517994	artificial intelligence;computer vision;clutter;object detection;feature extraction;synthetic aperture radar;computer science;constant false alarm rate;image resolution	Robotics	74.71779964994634	-61.34834200363122	168554

The importance of this type of data in rock-mass classifications and structural geology has led to the development of new techniques, in which the application of photogrammetric 3D digital models has had an increasing use. In this paper we present two algorithms for extraction of attitudes of geological discontinuities from virtual outcrop models: ply2atti and scanline, implemented with the Python programming language. The ply2atti algorithm allows for the virtual sampling of planar discontinuities appearing on the 3D model as individual exposed surfaces, while the scanline algorithm allows the sampling of discontinuities (surfaces and traces) along a virtual scanline. Application to digital models of a simplified test setup and a rock cut demonstrated a good correlation between the surveys undertaken using traditional field compass reading and virtual sampling on 3D digital models.	3d modeling;algorithm;digital outcrop model;distortion;level of detail;photogrammetry;programming language;python;sampling (signal processing);scan line;scanline rendering;tracing (software)	Camila Duelis Viana;Arthur Endlein;Ginaldo Ademar da Cruz Campanha;Carlos Henrique Grohmann	2016	Computers & Geosciences	10.1016/j.cageo.2016.02.017	computer vision;structure from motion;simulation;python;computer science;programming language;remote sensing	Visualization	71.1814746821067	-55.97324953813594	168807

One of its major limitations is the atmospheric variability, and in particular the high water vapor spatial and temporal variability, which introduces an unknown delay in the signal propagation. On the other hand, these effects might be exploited, so as InSAR could become a tool for highresolution water vapor mapping. This paper describes the approach and some preliminary results achieved in the framework of an ESA funded project devoted to the mitigation of the water vapor effects in InSAR applications. Although very preliminary, the acquired experimental data and their comparison give a first idea of what can be done to gather valuable information on water vapor, which play a fundamental role in weather prediction and radio propagation studies.	aperture (software);digital elevation model;esa;image resolution;numerical weather prediction;simulation;software propagation;spatial variability	Nazzareno Pierdicca;Fabio Rocca;Björn Rommen;Patrizia Basili;Stefania Bonafoni;Domenico Cimini;Piero Ciotti;Fernando Consalvi;Rossella Ferretti;Willow Foster;Frank S.

The design goal of the system is to generate realistic images of three-dimensional environments on a raster-scan video display in real-time. In order to achieve this goal, the system is constructed as a two-level hierarchical multi-processor system which is particularly suited to incorporate scan-line algorithm for hidden surface elimination. The system consists of several Scan-Line Processors (SLPs), each of which controls several slave PiXel Processors (PXPs). The SLP prepares the specific data structure relevant to each scan line, while the PXP manipulates every pixel data in its own territory. Internal hardware structures of the SLP and the PXP are quite different, being designed for their dedicated tasks.  This system architecture can easily execute scan-line algorithm in parallel by partitioning the entire image space and allotting one processor element to each partition. The specific partition scheme and some new data structures are introduced to exploit as much parallelism as possible. In addition, the scan-line algorithm is extended to include smooth-shading and anti-aliasing with the aim of rendering more realistic images. These two operations are performed on a per-scan-line basis so as to preserve scan-line and span coherence.  Performance estimation of the system shows that a typical system consisting of 8 SLPs and 8×8 PXPs can generate, in every 1/15th of a second, the shadowed image of a three-dimensional scene containing about 200 polygons.	algorithm;aliasing;apple ii graphics;cache coherence;data structure;display device;hidden surface determination;multiprocessing;parallel computing;pixel;raster scan;real-time clock;scan line;scanline rendering;shading;spatial anti-aliasing;superword level parallelism;systems architecture	Haruo Niimi;Yoshiro Imai;Masayoshi Murakami;Shinji Tomita;Hiroshi Hagiwara	1984		10.1145/800031.808580	three-dimensional space;computer vision;real-time computing;data structure;computer hardware;image processing;computer science;operating system;hardware architecture;octree;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	68.78910514789013	-53.21475778631404	169628

The validation results for segmentation using sensitivity, positive predictive value and dice coefficient show a significant improvement over supervised classification results of a commercial software.

These X-SAR sensors, able to image the Earth's surface at metric resolution, may provide a unique opportunity to measure rainfall over land with spatial resolution of about a few hundred meters due to the moving-target degradation effects. This work is devoted to experimentally demonstrate this X-SAR capability, which can also be exploited to correct synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery for rainfall attenuation effects. Several case studies, selected from TerraSAR-X (TSX) overpasses over Europe and the southern U.S. in 2008, are qualitatively analyzed in terms of rainfall signatures. Visual validation of these rainfall SAR signatures is carried out by using available data from ground-based weather radars. A detailed data analysis for the case study of Hurricane ¿Gustav¿ on September 2, 2008, is carried out to assess a quantitative correlation among X-SAR response and near-surface precipitation rain rate. Two simplified empirical inversion algorithms, based on statistical regression and probability matching, are developed to retrieve rain rate from TSX cross-track ground-range measurements. The TSX-retrieved rain fields are compared to those estimated from the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) in Mobile (Alabama, U.S.), showing a root-mean-square error less than 15 mm/h and a correlation of about 0.7.	algorithm;antivirus software;aperture (software);colocation centre;decibel;dynamic range;elegant degradation;experiment;geolocation;heart rate variability;image registration;polarimetry;probability matching;radar;sensor;snapshot (computer storage);spatial variability;synthetic data;time-of-flight camera;type signature;phpmyadmin	Frank S.

This approach consists of three digitizing steps during the raster to vector convening: pre-processing, processing and postprocessing. First, all image pixels are categorized to some different types according to the characteristics of raster data. Then, polygons are generated by tracing these typed image pixels, with topological attribute built-in. Finally, the vector data are post-processed to reduce the redundancy and stored to GIS’s based file. Compared to traditional methods this approach creates topological information of vector data automatically during converting. It has high performance, and could be implemented step by step. The result vector data could be applied and used directly in the geographical information system. An example is used to illustrate this approach with classified Landsat TM image.

In this method, the probability measure of the gray image of micro surface topography is counted in the improved box-counting method, and the multi-fractal spectrums are extracted by the Legendre transformation of scale exponent. Based on the multi-fractal spectrum, the spectrum width, height interval and asymmetry degree are extracted, and micro surface topography are evaluated according to the parameters. Evaluation experiments of surface topographies are carried out to prove the value of multi-fractal spectrums, and the result shows that multi-fractal spectrum can overcome the deficiency of traditional method, and surface topography can be evaluated accurately by its parameters.	angular defect;experiment;fractal;legendre transformation;topography	Mingwei Chui;Youqian Feng;Wei Wang;Peilin Li;Xiaodong Xu	2011	2011 Fourth International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design	10.1109/ISCID.2011.191	computer vision;surface roughness;fractal;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;probability;geometry;statistics	Arch	72.78571711229692	-59.69235429017696	170272
4f6668b5ea9d05b49a8fb5b1be59703f790ef0c3	self-adaptive gradient-based thresholding method for coal fire detection based on aster data - part 2, validation and sensitivity analysis	spontaneous combustion of coal seam validations;advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster;simultaneous field measurement;thermal infrared remote sensing	The self-adaptive gradient-based thresholding (SAGBT) method is a simple non-interactive coal fire detection approach involving segmentation and a threshold identification algorithm that adapts to the spatial distribution of thermal features over a landscape. SAGBT detects coal fire using multispectral thermal images acquired by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor. The method was detailed by our previous work “Self-Adaptive Gradient-Based Thresholding Method for Coal Fire Detection Based on ASTER Data—Part 1, Methodology”. The current study evaluates the performance of SAGBT and validates its results by using ASTER thermal infrared (TIR) images and ground temperature data collected at the Wuda coalfield (China) during satellite overpass. We further analyzed algorithm performance by OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2015, 7 2603 using nighttime TIR images and images from different seasons. SAGBT-derived fires matched fire spots measured in the field with an average offset of 32.44 m and a matching rate of 70%–85%. Coal fire areas from TIR images generally agreed with coal-related anomalies from visible-near infrared (VNIR) images. Further, high-temperature pixels in the ASTER image matched observed coal fire areas, including the major extreme high-temperature regions derived from field samples. Finally, coal fires detected by daytime and by nighttime images were found to have similar spatial distributions, although fires differ in shape and size. Results included the stratification of our study site into two temperature groups (high and low temperature), using a fire boundary. We conclude that SAGBT can be successfully used for coal fire detection and analysis at our study site.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;algorithm;gradient;interactivity;multispectral image;pixel;thermal head;thresholding (image processing)	Xiaomin Du;Sergio Bernardes;Daiyong Cao;Thomas R.

From these signals, scene depth profiles along each pulse path can be readily constructed. By emitting a series of pulses toward a scene using a predefined scanning pattern and with the appropriate sampling and processing, an image-like depth map can be generated. Unfortunately, massive amounts of data are typically acquired to achieve acceptable depth and spatial resolutions. The sampling systems acquiring this data, however, seldom take into account the underlying low-dimensional structure generally present in FW signals and, consequently, they sample very inefficiently. Our main goal and focus here is to develop efficient sampling models and processes to collect individual time-resolved FW LIDAR signals. Specifically, we study sub-Nyquist sampling of the continuous-time LIDAR FW reflected pulses, considering two different sampling mechanisms: 1) modeling FW signals as short-duration pulses with multiple band-limited echoes; and 2) modeling them as signals with finite rates of innovation.	algorithm;bandlimiting;computational complexity theory;computer data storage;depth map;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;point of view (computer hardware company);sampling (signal processing);waveform	Juan Castorena;Charles D.

Multispectral WorldView-3 at 1.6m spatial resolution and LANDSAT8 images covering an extent of 100Km2 in humid ecology of Nigeria were used for crop and landcover identification. Three supervised classification techniques (maximum likelihood(MLC), Neural Net clasifier(NNC) and support vector machine(SVM)) were used to classify WorldView-3 and LANDSAT8 into four crop classes and seven non-crop classes. For accuracy assessment, kappa coefficient, producer and user accuracies were used to evaluate the performance of all three supervised classifiers. NNC performed best with an overall accuracy(OA) of 92.20, kappa coefficient(KC) of 0.83 in landcover identification using WorldView-3. This was closely followed by SVM with an OA of 91.77%, KC of 0.83. MLC performed slightly lower at an OA of 91.25% and KC of 0.82. Classification of crops and landcover with LANDSAT8 was best with MLC classifier with an OA of 92.12% , KC of 0.89. Cassava at younger than 3 months old could not be identified correctly by all classifiers using WorldView-3 and LANDSAT8 products. In summary WorldView-3 and LANDSAT8 data had satisfactory performance in identifying different crop and landcover types though at varying degrees of accuracies.	artificial neural network;ecology;kappa calculus;machine learning;matthews correlation coefficient;multi-level cell;multispectral image;supervised learning;support vector machine	Tunrayo Alabi;Michael Haertel;Sarah Chiejile	2016		10.5220/0005767301090120	geography;agronomy;horticulture;remote sensing	ML	80.089374565452	-56.61614915203363	170798

The settlement in Beijing is very serious, producing adverse environmental impacts. Excessive groundwater withdrawal is the most direct cause of land subsidence.In this paper, a spatial-temporal analysis of the land subsidence in Beijing was performed using one of the MT-InSAR techniques, referred to as Small Baseline Subset (SBAS). This technique allows monitoring the temporal evolution of a deformation phenomenon, via the generation of mean deformation velocity maps and displacement time series from a data set of acquired SAR images. 52 C-band ENVISAT ASAR images acquired from June 2003 to August 2010 were used to produce a linear deformation rate map and to derive time series of ground deformation. The results show that there are three large subsidence funnels within this study area, which separately located in Balizhuang-Dajiaoting in Chaoyang district, Wangjing-Laiguangying Chaoyang district, Gaoliying Shunyi district. The maximum settlement center is Wangsiying-Tongzhou along the Beijing express; the subsidence velocity exceeds 110 mm/y in the LOS direction. In particular, we compared the achieved results with leveling measurements that are assumed as reference. The estimated long-term subsidence results obtained by SBAS approach agree OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2014, 6 3649 well with the development of the over-exploitation of ground water, indicating that SBAS techniques is adequate for the retrieval of land subsidence in Beijing from multi-temporal SAR data.	baseline (configuration management);displacement mapping;gnss augmentation;land administration;map;time series;velocity (software development)	Bo Hu;Hansheng Wang;Yongling Sun;Jian-Guo Hou;Jun Liang	2014	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs6053648	hydrology;time series;statistics;remote sensing	ML	82.52008739277231	-59.491659757578915	170983

The workflow was exemplified on crop yield data, which is assumed to represent a proxy for soil productivity. Focal mean statistics were used to generate different scale levels of terrain derivatives by increasing the neighborhood size in calculation. The degree of association between each terrain derivative and crop yield values was established iteratively for all scale levels through correlation analysis. The first peak of correlation indicated the scale level to be further retained. To select the best combination of terrain parameters that explains the variation of crop yield, we ran stepwise multiple regressions with appropriately scaled terrain parameters as independent variables. These techniques proved that the mean curvature, filtered over a neighborhood of 55 m, together with slope, made up the optimal combination to account for patterns of soil productivity. To illustrate the importance of scale, we compared the regression results of unfiltered and filtered mean curvature vs. crop yield. The comparison shows an improvement of R from a value of 0.01 when the curvature was not filtered, to 0.16 when the curvature was filtered within 55 55 m neighborhood	browser user interface;cluster analysis;digital elevation model;environment variable;focal (programming language);geometric primitive;hadamard transform;kerrison predictor;norm (social);proxy server;schmidt decomposition;stepwise regression;tessellation (computer graphics);topography;word lists by frequency	Lucian Dragut;Thomas Schauppenlehner;Andreas Muhar;Josef Strobl;Thomas Blaschke	2009	Computers & Geosciences	10.1016/j.cageo.2008.10.008	parametrization;terrain;image analysis;data processing;hydrology;mathematics;geometry;landscape	Vision	78.45536443084133	-54.83807784615876	171019
617f3c555d90b30ee32665c1745d4ca929fbc064	a machine learning approach for automatic land cover mapping from dslr images over the maltese islands		High resolution raster data for land cover mapping or change analysis are normally acquired through satellite or aerial imagery. Apart from the incurred costs, the available files might not have the required temporal resolution. Moreover, cloud cover and atmospheric absorptions may limit the applicability of existing algorithms or reduce their accuracy. This paper presents a novel technique that is capable of mapping garrigue and/or phrygana vegetation as well as karst or ground-armour terrain in photos captured by a digital camera. By including a reference pattern in every frame, the automated method estimates the total area covered by each land type. Pixel based classification is performed by supervised decision tree methods. Although the intention is not to replace traditional surface cover analysis, the proposed technique allows accurate land cover mapping with quantitative estimates to be obtained. Since no expensive hardware or specialised personnel are required, vegetation monitoring of local sites can be carried out cheaply and frequently. The developed proof of concept is tested on photos taken in thirteen different sites across the Maltese Islands. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Technology, USA Abstract: Interpolation of scattered data is an essential procedure to produce a map, especially a digital elevation model (DEM) generation from stereo-matched scattered data. However, the interpolation intrinsically produces extrapolation off the bound aries of the scattered data, and in the case of a DEM, into water areas . We present novel schemes to detect the extrapolation and thereby water boundaries. As a first step, we devise point distribution criteria, namely COG (Center of Gravity) and ECI (Empty Center Index). The criteria exploit th e characteristics of extrapolation, that scattered points are di stributed unevenly or on the edge of a search disc of interp olation. Next, the hole-fill segmentation counterbalances exces sive elimination by the COG and ECI elimination. Finally, t he noise-remove classification compensates for incomplete per formance of the COG and ECI elimination. The elimination schemes are verified using four DEMs derived from SPOT s tereo-pairs. The qualitative and quantitative assessments of t he DEM’s water boundaries after removing the extrapolation re veal that the water boundaries are restored successfully.	algorithms for recovery and isolation exploiting semantics;cog (project);digital elevation model;economic complexity index;extrapolation;multivariate interpolation	Seung-Bum Kim	2005	Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2005.

Specifically, the demand for a high-resolution (HR) optical images is gradually increasing, and hence the generation of a high-quality mosaic image is being magnified as an interesting issue. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient mosaic algorithm for HR optical images that are significantly different due to seasonal change. The algorithm includes main steps such as: (1) seamline extraction from gradient magnitude and seam images; (2) histogram matching; and (3) image feathering. Eleven Kompsat-2 images characterized by seasonal variations are used for the performance validation of the proposed method. The results of the performance test show that the proposed method effectively mosaics Kompsat-2 adjacent images including severe seasonal changes. Moreover, the results reveal that the proposed method is applicable to HR optic images such as GeoEye, IKONOS, QuickBird, RapidEye, SPOT, WorldView, etc.	algorithm;eye;feathering;gradient;half rate;high-resolution scheme;histogram matching;image resolution;mosaic - computer software;ncsa mosaic;satellite viruses	Jaewon Choi;Hyung-Sup Jung;Sang-Ho Yun	2015		10.3390/s150305649	text mining;medical research;telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;remote sensing	Vision	79.91324912178771	-59.008569997183606	171374

The method uses stable external calibration sources to permit an end-to-end calibration of the complete radiometer, including its primary antenna. Both gain and offset corrections to the radiometer calibration can be computed since vicarious reference points at both the cold and warm ends of the measurement range are available. The method is demonstrated using the WindSat radiometer. Calibration errors are found which vary with azimuthal scan position in a manner that suggests that the cause is beam spoiling from on-board spacecraft obstructions. The impact on gain and offset calibration errors of the on-board obstructions can be determined from the vicarious calibration. This information is used to characterize the beam spoiling-specifically to determine the decrease in the antenna's beam efficiency and the mean brightness temperature entering the far sidelobes of the antenna, both as functions of azimuthal scan position. With this characterization available, a calibration correction algorithm can be constructed that is based on the root cause of the problem.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;algorithm;end-to-end principle;microwave;on-board data handling	Darren McKague;Christopher S Ruf;John J.

00fa431cdfa224d2b687fcb4fe587bc526290ec2	a novel hybrid swarm optimized multilayer neural network for spatial prediction of flash floods in tropical areas using sentinel-1 sar imagery and geospatial data	gis;levenberg–marquardt backpropagation;sentinel-1;artificial neural network;firefly algorithm;flash floods	Flash floods are widely recognized as one of the most devastating natural hazards in the world, therefore prediction of flash flood-prone areas is crucial for public safety and emergency management. This research proposes a new methodology for spatial prediction of flash floods based on Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and a new hybrid machine learning technique. The SAR imagery is used to detect flash flood inundation areas, whereas the new machine learning technique, which is a hybrid of the firefly algorithm (FA), Levenberg⁻Marquardt (LM) backpropagation, and an artificial neural network (named as FA-LM-ANN), was used to construct the prediction model. The Bac Ha Bao Yen (BHBY) area in the northwestern region of Vietnam was used as a case study. Accordingly, a Geographical Information System (GIS) database was constructed using 12 input variables (elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, topographic wetness index, stream power index, toposhade, stream density, rainfall, normalized difference vegetation index, soil type, and lithology) and subsequently the output of flood inundation areas was mapped. Using the database and FA-LM-ANN, the flash flood model was trained and verified. The model performance was validated via various performance metrics including the classification accuracy rate, the area under the curve, precision, and recall. Then, the flash flood model that produced the highest performance was compared with benchmarks, indicating that the combination of FA and LM backpropagation is proven to be very effective and the proposed FA-LM-ANN is a new and useful tool for predicting flash flood susceptibility.

Fires in tropical forests, though not devastating on a large scale as compared to large and infrequent fires in boreal or Mediterranean systems, still cause loss to biodiversity and economic and monetary value. In India, human-induced forest fires increasingly affect legally protected nature conservation areas. An array of satellite sensors that are now available can be deployed to monitor such events on a global and local scale. The present study uses night-time Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (A)ATSR satellite data from the last nine years to identify high fireprone zones, fire affected areas in protected zones and the distribution of these incidents in relation to bio-geographic zones. Central India, with its vegetation type that is just right for fire ignition and spread, was observed to be the most severely affected area with maximum fire incidences. The bio-geographic zone comprising this area–such as the Deccan peninsula, which includes provinces like Central Highlands, Eastern Highlands, Central OPEN ACCESS Remote Sensing 2010, 2 592 Plateau and Chhota Nagpur–was observed to be the most affected, accounting for approximately 36% of the total fire occurrences during the period 1997–2005. In protected areas, 778 fire incidents were observed within the last eight years. Comparison of (A)ATSR fire locations with MODIS active fire data for the Western Ghats (mainly of tropical evergreen forests and savannahs) and the Eastern Ghats (tropical deciduous) showed a spatial agreement of 72% with a minimum distance between the two products of 100 m. This study focuses on regions in India that are vulnerable to forest fires during specific time-frames and appraises the situation with an aim to minimize such incidents, if not completely stop the fire spread and its consequent destruction and loss.

The drilling of seven wells for the geothermal heating of the city hall in 2007 is thought to have disturbed the existing hydro-geological system in the complex structured transition zone of the Upper Rhine Graben and the Schwarzwald massif. This event has led to uplift, related to the transformation of anhydrite to gypsum, which affects the infrastructure of the city centre via the generation of large cracks. This study focuses on the application of the InSAR Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) approach using 50 X-band radar images from the German TerraSAR-X satellite (TSX) to map the spatial and temporal patterns of the deformation field in detail. X-band InSAR time series analysis for the three-year time period from July 2008 through May 2011 indicates maximum velocities of ~12 cm/yr in the line of sight (LOS) direction, from the ground to the satellite, approximately 50 m northeast of the drilling field. In comparison with leveling data for the same time period, TSX data analysis better delineates the border of the deformation area, and it is able to map the amount of deformation associated with different parts of the city. Moreover, this comparison indicates contributions of horizontal motion, as is expected for uplift patterns.	command & conquer:yuri's revenge;gnss augmentation;time series	Christin Lubitz;Mahdi Motagh;Hans-Ulrich Wetzel;Hermann Kaufmann	2013	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs5063082	seismology;gnss augmentation;geology;hydrology;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;geotechnical engineering;remote sensing	HCI	82.28733579715232	-59.174597849611736	171781

It is obvious that cloud masking has been a challenging risk in receiving the information from the satellite sensor images. For instance, in-paint and multitemporal averaging method, which are existing approaches implemented against the cloud masking but still the requirement has been found inadequate as it has partially contributed to its removal. Hence, the proposed ECDR algorithm paves the way to find accurate information. The cloud-obscured area reconstructed by the ECDR algorithm involves two steps: detecting the cloudy region by pixels values and reconstruction of cloudy regions. For cloud masking, the algorithm calculates the percentage of variance in earlier remote sensing information and, based on the percentage, the cloud pixel value is replaced. Thus, the found ECDR algorithm accuracy is much better than the existing algorithms for deducing information.	algorithm;image resolution	E. Menaka;S. Suresh Kumar;M.

The Hyperion image data was acquired at the beginning of the agricultural season, May 20 2002, as well as ground reference measurements for validation purposes. In this period, there is mainly only the presence of bare soil and crop residue before any crop cover development. The image data were corrected for the sensor artifacts: a spatial misregistration between the VNIR and SWIR data, and striping, and, in addition, the noise was reduced. The data were atmospherically corrected and then transformed to surface reflectance and, subsequently, corrected for sensor smile/frown and post-processed to remove residual errors. In order to extract the crop residue fraction (percent cover), the image was unmixed using the pure spectra (endmember) collected in the field simultaneously with Hyperion data from different targets (dry and wet wheat residue, and bright and dark soil) with a GER-3700 spectroradiometer. In order to represent the existing trees and all the photosynthetically targets in the scene, a vegetation endmember was selected from our spectral library. Correlation between ground references measurements and extracted fractions from Hyperion data using CLSMA showed that the method satisfactorily predicts crop residues percent cover (D of 0.94, R2 of 0.73 and RMSE of 8.7%) and soil percent cover (D of 0.91, R2 of 0.70 and RMSE of 10.03%).	data striping;hyperion;in the beginning... was the command line	Abdou Bannari;Karl Staenz;K.

The method is based on the assumptions that the linear mixing model is valid and that, due to the resolution of the image, most pixels are mixtures of common substances, of which pure pixels (not mixtures) are rare. In the first stage of the algorithm, the classes associated with the background, which are the dominant classes in the image, are found by clustering the image pixels. The resulting clusters may be considered as representatives of the background classes in the image. In order to determine the anomalous pixels, a threshold may be applied to the distance between the pixel spectrum and the cluster centers. However, pixels corresponding to anomalies and pure substances will both show high distances. If we consider that the background classes are themselves most likely mixtures of other materials, the pixels within the convex hull formed by the background classes will have positive fractions that are smaller than one. The pure substances, however, will be outside such a convex hull and will show negative or superunity fractions. Pixels with such mixing proportions are explained as linear combinations of the background classes and, therefore, as not true anomalies. Pixels corresponding to anomalies, however, when expressed as linear combinations of the background classes, show high residual error even with negative and superunity mixing proportions. We use the unmixing spectral linear model without the nonnegativity constraint to distinguish between false anomalies corresponding to pure substances and real man-made anomalies.	algorithm;anomaly detection;cluster analysis;convex hull;linear model;mixing (mathematics);pixel	Olga Duran;Maria Petrou	2009	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2008.2009952	computer vision;anomaly detection;image processing;computer science;hyperspectral imaging;pattern recognition;remote sensing	Vision	70.96275139450753	-63.3717724748538	172223

However, it is simple to show that the data are typically not multivariate Gaussian or are not well defined by linear geometries when considering the entire image, particularly as the spatial resolution improves and the scene becomes more cluttered. Here, we use the concept of a convex hull that encloses the data to rank local regions within an image by an estimate of their complexity. The complexity as defined here is directly related to the volume of the hull in n dimensions that encloses the data under the assumptions that less complex data will have fewer distinct materials and more complex data will have more materials. They will also be more widely separated in the hyperspace. The method uses the Gram Matrix approach to estimate the volume of the hull and is applied to an image that has been tiled. The complexity of each tile is then estimated showing the relative changes in complexity over a large area spectral image. Results will be shown for reflective hyperspectral imagery over different scene contents with resolutions of ≈2–3 m. Ultimately this methodology can be used to develop localized models of an image and may provide insight into the large area search problem.	convex hull;gramian matrix;image processing;search problem;spatial anti-aliasing	David W.

d0570f6e669b96940f6011ceb27598e783937843	rfi statistical distribution and missed detection in aquarius radiometer measurements		Aquarius is an microwave active/passive sensor whose main goal is to globally estimate sea surface salinity from space [1, 2]. Two instruments, a radar scatterometer and a radiometer, operate at L-band observing the same surface footprint almost simultaneously. The sensitivity to sea surface salinity (SSS) is given by the radiometer, while the scatterometer measurements provide a correction for sea surface roughness. Although the primary objective is the measurement of SSS, the instrument combination operates continuously, acquiring data over land and sea ice as well. Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) can occur in both the radiometer and the scatterometer bands of operation, and for this reason detection and mitigation of RFI was included in the data processing of both active and passive instruments. This paper will focus on the RFI processing for the Aquarius radiometer only and provide an update on the efforts to reduce the amount of missed RFI detection.	interference (communication);l band;microwave;radar;radio frequency	Paolo de Matthaeis;David M.

This is in addition to wind driven roughness, atmospheric reflectivity and attenuation that affect the measured normalized radar cross section (NRCS). Numerous surface-based studies, using ocean platforms and wind-wave tanks, have shown the increase in the total NRCS can be significant and strongly dependent on radar frequency, incidence angle, polarization and wind speed [1],[2],[3]. Herein is the first study combining satellite based Ku-band data with high- resolution 3-D volumetric rain measurements, from simultaneous collocated NEXRAD data. The results to be presented were acquired during a significant rain event in the Gulf of Mexico just south of Houston, TX in May 2005. They are directly applicable to questions that are important to the interpretation of satellite derived wind vector estimates in the presence of rain of varying intensity and spatial distribution. This project is developing techniques to correct scatterometer derived wind- vector estimates. The acquisition of new knowledge on rain- splash effects is a necessary part of this effort.	cross section (geometry);incidence matrix;ku band;polarization (waves);radar	David E. Weissman;Mark A.

60741886ab9c92225bc3711bceadce9884a9e412	spatio-temporal autocorrelation analysis for regional land-cover change detection from remote sensing data		Of the various applications of remote sensing data, characterizing the land-cover dynamics is of utmost significance, providing insights into science, management policy, and several regulatory actions. Recent research works indicate that there is a need to understand and monitor land-cover dynamics at regional scale rather than local scale. However, the regional change is a more generalized concept and therefore, the use of pixel based analysis alone may not be sufficient to get proper insights regarding the land-cover change in remotely sensed imagery. Moreover, higher spectral variation and mixed pixels are two key challenges imposed by satellite imagery, resulting into poor performance of existing pixel-based methods for regional land-cover change detection. In this work, we have proposed a novel approach for detecting regional land-cover changes in satellite imagery using spatio-temporal autocorrelation analysis. Autocorrelation among the neighborhood pixels at various spatio-temporal lags has been utilized here to address the problem of mixed pixel and spectral variation. An index (γ), based on the estimated autocorrelations, has been proposed to classify the regions as 'change' and 'no-change' regions. Moreover, a parameter (σ) has been introduced to provide the measure of regional change significance. The method has been evaluated with Landsat ETM+ imagery (30m resolution) of four zones in and around Kolkata (India), comprising a total of 430 sq. km area (ã 4.8 × 105 pixels). The experimental results are encouraging, with an overall accuracy of 90.66%.	autocorrelation;binary land;matthews correlation coefficient;pixel;sensor	Monidipa Das;Soumya K.

During the growing season of fruit trees, the bloom period has increased photosynthetic rates that correlate with the fruiting process. This paper presents the development of an image processing algorithm to detect peach blossoms on trees. Aerial images of peach (Prunus persica) trees were acquired from both experimental and commercial peach orchards in the southwestern part of Idaho using an off-the-shelf unmanned aerial system (UAS), equipped with a multispectral camera (near-infrared, green, blue). The image processing algorithm included contrast stretching of the three bands to enhance the image and thresholding segmentation method to detect the peach blossoms. Initial results showed that the image processing algorithm could detect peach blossoms with an average detection rate of 84.3% and demonstrated good potential as a monitoring tool for orchard management.	aerial photography;algorithm;image processing;image stitching;imaging phantom;multispectral image;normalization (image processing);orchard;peach;thresholding (image processing);unmanned aerial vehicle	Ryan Horton;Esteban Cano;Duke M.

Remote sensing data provides an opportunity to automatically detect and monitor land-cover changes. Although changes in land cover can be observed from remote sensing time series, most traditional change point detection algorithms do not perform well due to the unique properties of the remote sensing data, such as noise, missing values and seasonality. We propose an online change point detection method that addresses these challenges. Using an independent validation set, we show that the proposed method performs better than the four baseline methods in both of the two testing regions, which has ecologically diverse features.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);earth system science;ecology;missing data;seasonality;time series	Xi C.

This method is introduced in the context of precision farming. GP-SVI derives a regression model describing a specific crop biophysical variable from hyperspectral images (verified with in situ observations). GP-SVI performed better than other methods [multiple regression, tree-based modeling, and genetic algorithm-partial least squares (GA-PLS)] on the task of correlating canopy nitrogen content in a cornfield with pixel reflectance. It is also shown that the band selection performed by GP-SVI is comparable with the selection performed by GA-PLS, a method that is specifically designed to deal with hyperspectral data.	genetic algorithm;genetic programming;information extraction;motorola canopy;pari/gp;partial least squares regression;pixel;software release life cycle	Clément Chion;Jacques-André Landry;Luis E.

By placing radar transmitter/receiver in near-space platforms, many functions that are currently performed with satellites or airplanes could be performed in a cheaper way. Inspired by these advantages, this paper introduces several near-space vehicle-based radar configurations, such as near-space passive bistatic radar and high-resolution wide-swath (HRWS) synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Their potential applications, technical challenges and possible solutions are investigated. It is shown that near-space is a satisfactory solution to some specific remote sensing applications. Firstly, near-space passive bistatic radar using opportunistic illuminators offers a solution to persistent regional remote sensing, which is particularly interest for protecting homeland security or monitoring regional environment. Secondly, near-space provides an optimal solution to relative HRWS SAR imaging. Moreover, as motion compensation is a common technical challenge for the described radars, an active transponder-based motion compensation is also described.	aperture (software);image resolution;molecular orbital;motion compensation;radar;remote sensing application;synthetic data;technical standard;transmitter;transponder	Wen-Qin Wang;Jingye Cai;Qicong Peng	2010	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs2030717	meteorology;early-warning radar;radar masint;man-portable radar;continuous-wave radar;radar engineering details;synthetic aperture radar;radar lock-on;radar configurations and types;telecommunications;fire-control radar;passive radar;bistatic radar;pulse-doppler radar;3d radar;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;motion compensation;side looking airborne radar;wave radar;physics;radar;remote sensing;low-frequency radar	Mobile	77.31590796032704	-65.69999786656865	173199

In this study, we applied the IPTA technique to monitor the ground deformation of Shenzhen urban area and along the Shenzhen metro lines. The available SAR dataset consists of 20 images from the satellite mission ENVISAT between January 2008 and July 2010. The maximum subsidence rate reaches up to -17.9 to -10 mma-1. The maximum rise rate reaches up to 6 to 9.8 mma-1. The Point Target velocity map shows that there is a strong subsidence in Shenzhen urban area, and the subsidence rate is larger than -10 mma-1. There is also severe subsidence along the metro lines, especially at the stations. The subsidence in the first phase of the Shenzhen metro project is less than the second phase of metro project.

Two scenes have been selected from sites of the EVEOSD (Evaluation and Validation of EO-1 for Sustainable Development of Forests) project. One site is the Greater Victoria Watershed District (GVWD) located on south Vancouver Island, BC and the other is Hoquiam located in southwestern Washington State. Ground Control Point (GCP) collection has been performed using a feature fitting method in which high accuracy, orthorectified photo-derived polygons of features are used for tie-down. For example lakes are adjusted to match the same feature obvious in the hyperspectral imagery. This technique allows for easier estimation of a GCP’s precise fit to the imagery. A third (11) of the GCPs were identified as check points to validate the geometric models. GCPs were collected independently from both the VNIR and SWIR arrays of the Hyperion sensor to determine the adjustment factor required to remove the displacement and skew between these arrays. The adjustment can then be applied to GCPs collected from one array to make a compatible geometric correction model for both arrays. The polynomial and rational function correction methods have been applied to both scenes with various orders applied to each function. The effect of terrain distortion removal is evaluated in using the rational function method. Hyperion data can be geocorrected with surprising accuracy. For example, we obtained 10 m RMS on check points with the rational function. With a second order polynomial we achieved 13 m RMS without terrain correction. The accuracy of this latter result is due to the small swath width of the sensor. Applying terrain correction does improve the accuracy of geometric correction in areas with high relief. A similar procedure was applied to EO-1’s ALI sensor and this paper compares the results for Hyperion and ALI geometric fidelity.		Andrew Dyk;David G. Goodenough;A. S. Bhogal;Jay S.

We present a method to adapt conventional distributed detection schemes to the scenario when no a priori knowledge about image statistics from any view is available. Further, a new scheme for estimating quality information of local detectors in a distributed detection scenario is proposed. We apply bootstrap techniques to draw inference from the radar measurements of the behind the wall scene.

This study relies on the use of a coherent and full polarimetric scattering model, which simulates the backscattered fields by a forested area. In a first part, we study the frequential behavior of the interferometric phase center heights and in the second part, we focus on the attenuation coefficients. The behaviors of these two quantities are compared and in a third part, we propose to empirically derive a relation between these two quantities and the mean forest height. Finally, we investigate if a change of the incidence angle has an impact on the determination of this relation.	behavior;coefficient;coherence (physics);forests;height;incidence matrix;l band;motorola canopy;polarimetry;quantity;simulation;the forest	L.

f56c446a0ea4ca9bf3f6d3c00d3fc8d1bf486ff4	the cross-calibration of spectral radiances and cross-validation of co2 estimates from gosat and oco-2		The Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) launched in January 2009 has provided radiance spectra with a Fourier Transform Spectrometer for more than eight years. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) launched in July 2014, collects radiance spectra using an imaging grating spectrometer. Both sensors observe sunlight reflected from Earth’s surface and retrieve atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, but use different spectrometer technologies, observing geometries, and ground track repeat cycles. To demonstrate the effectiveness of satellite remote sensing for CO2 monitoring, the GOSAT and OCO-2 teams have worked together preand post-launch to cross-calibrate the instruments and cross-validate their retrieval algorithms and products. In this work, we first compare observed radiance spectra within three narrow bands centered at 0.76, 1.60 and 2.06 μm, at temporally coincident and spatially collocated points from September 2014 to March 2017. We reconciled the differences in observation footprints size, viewing geometry and associated differences in surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). We conclude that the spectral radiances measured by the two instruments agree within 5% for all bands. Second, we estimated mean bias and standard deviation of column-averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction (XCO2) retrieved from GOSAT and OCO-2 from September 2014 to May 2016. GOSAT retrievals used Build 7.3 (V7.3) of the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) algorithm while OCO-2 retrievals used Version 7 of the OCO-2 retrieval algorithm. The mean biases and standard deviations are −0.57 ± 3.33 ppm over land with high gain, −0.17 ± 1.48 ppm over ocean with high gain and −0.19 ± 2.79 ppm over land with medium gain. Finally, our study is complemented with an analysis of error sources: retrieved surface pressure (Psurf), aerosol optical depth (AOD), BRDF and surface albedo inhomogeneity. We found no change in XCO2 bias or standard deviation with time, demonstrating that both instruments are well calibrated.	algorithm;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;sensor	Fumie Kataoka;David Crisp;Thomas E.

Possessing knowledge of air quality and sources of air pollution is crucial for managing air pollution and providing early warning so that a swift counteractive response can be carried out. An optical prototype sensor (AtmOptic) capable of scattering and absorbance measurements has been developed to target in situ sensing of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). For particulate matter testing, a test chamber was constructed and the emission of PM2.5 from incense burning inside the chamber was measured using the AtmOptic. The weight of PM2.5 particles was collected and measured with a filter to determine their concentration and the sensor signal-to-concentration correlation. The results of the AtmOptic were also compared and found to trend well with the Dylos DC 1100 Pro air quality monitor. The absorbance spectrum of VOCs emitted from various laboratory chemicals and household products as well as a two chemical mixtures were recorded. The quantification was demonstrated, using toluene as an example, by calibrating the AtmOptic with compressed gas standards containing VOCs at different concentrations. The results demonstrated the sensor capabilities in measuring PM2.5 and volatile organic compounds.	accident caused by cyclone;air pollution;airborne particulate matter;cessation of life;cyclonic storms;discharger;household products;interference (communication);large;organic chemicals;organometallic compounds;particulate (substance);prototype;quantitation;sensor;swift (programming language);toluene;volatile organic compounds;world health organization;algorithm;mixture;standards characteristics	Chee-Loon Ng;Fuu-Ming Kai;Ming-Hui Tee;Nicholas Tan;Harold F.

The supervised classification was performed using Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are supervised non-parametric statistical learning techniques. To select the most suitable SMV classifier and the related parameter settings, we used the training data and performed a two-dimensional grid search with a three-fold internal cross-validation. We worked in seven Landsat footprints and found the linear kernel to be the most suitable for all footprints, but the most suitable regularization parameter C varied across the footprints. We distinguished a total of 41 LCLUCs (13 to 31 classes per footprint) in very dynamic and heterogeneous landscapes. The approach proved useful for distinguishing subtle changes over time and to map a variety of land covers, tree crops, and transformations as long as sufficient training points could be collected for each class. While to date, this approach has only been applied to mapping urban extent and expansion, this study shows that it is also useful for mapping change in rural settings, especially when images from phenologically relevant acquisition dates are included.	code;comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;confusion matrix;cross-validation (statistics);digital footprint;feature vector;interaction;inventory;machine learning;map;metabolite set enrichment analysis;semiconductor industry;statistical classification;supervised learning;support vector machine	Kaspar Hurni;Annemarie Schneider;Andreas Heinimann;Duong H.

The interferometric processing that can exploit the full bandwidth of the available GNSS signals without the knowledge of the actual ranging codes was proposed for the PARIS IoD mission to improve the ranging precision. This letter presents a novel on-board processing method which utilizes the interferometry of partial GNSS signal components to explore a further improvement of the altimetry precision. The scheme of extracting partial signal components and interferometry procedure, for GPS L1 band as an example, are illustrated. The assessment and comparison of achievable altimetric performance of the proposed method including the altimetric sensitivity, the resolution per pulse, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the overall altimetric precision are also introduced. The extension of the proposed method to other existing and planned GNSS systems and signals would guarantee an improvement in the overall performance of the PARIS concept.	autocorrelation;code;global positioning system;l band;on-board data handling;satellite navigation;signal-to-noise ratio	Weiqiang Li;Dongkai Yang;Salvatore D'Addio;Manuel Martín-Neira	2014	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2013.2297697	meteorology;geodesy;interferometry;physics;remote sensing	EDA	79.41872496301629	-65.60460659219287	175510

EnMAP is a German imaging spectroscopy satellite mission with the declared goal to investigate the Earth's surface with a so far surpassing quality. The key scientific questions to which EnMAP will contribute are related to climate change impacts, land cover changes and processes, natural resources, biodiversity and ecosystems, water availability and quality, geohazards and risk management. The satellite operates in a sun synchronous orbit in 650 km height with a local time of the descending node set to 11:00 and an across tilt opportunity to improve the local revisit time. Two pushbroom spectrometers with 242 channels in total cover the spectral range from 420 nm to 2450 nm with a mean resolution of 6.5 nm in the visible and 10 nm in the shortwave-infrared. The ground nadir pixel size is 30 m and 1000 spatial pixels generate a swath with of 30 km. For the CalVal activities, the routine calibration is conducted within the ground segment of DLR, while the independent validation activities are lead by GFZ. Data is operationally processed on-ground to standardized calibrated products and delivered to the international user community [1]. Standardized data products will comprise radiance and reflectance products that make use of calibration information gained pre- and inflight. To ensure high quality standards, additional independent product validation activities are planned.	display resolution;dynamic language runtime;ecosystem;pixel;risk management;virtual community	Andre Hollstein;Christian Rogaß;Karl Segl;Luis Guanter;Martin Bachmann;Tobias Storch;Rupert Müller;Harald Krawczyk	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326398	meteorology;atmospheric model;calibration;radiometry;optics;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	81.38117131693693	-61.145801480919474	175628

Whereas shape analysis has largely been addressed over the last decades, the multiscale analysis of the geometry of opened planar curves has received little attention. We here show that classical multiscale techniques cannot properly address this issue and propose an original wavelet-based scheme. To highlight the generic nature of our multiscale wavelet technique, we report applications to two different observation data sets, namely, wild animal movement paths recorded by electronic tags and satellite observations of sea-surface geophysical fields.	closed-circuit television;global positioning system;information extraction;relevance;scale space;shape analysis (digital geometry);spatial scale;wavelet;wigner distribution function	Ronan Fablet;Alexis Chaigneau;Sophie Bertrand	2014	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2013.2274157	computer vision;global positioning system;mathematics;physics;remote sensing;wavelet transform	Visualization	76.75107096212612	-64.79948888646844	175781

A time series of 33 TerraSAR-X StripMap SAR data, collected over a well-known oil seep in Gulf of Mexico, is exploited to analyze the influence of incidence angle and wind conditions on the co-polarized phase difference (CPD). Furthermore, the benefits of using phase information for oil seep observation are assessed. Experimental results show that: i) incidence angle has a remarkable effect in broadening/shrinking the CPD statistical distribution and, ii) the CPD provides spatial information on the oil seep damping properties.	aperture (software);coherent;collaborative product development;incidence matrix;synthetic intelligence;time series	Carina R. de Macedo;Andrea Buono;Ferdinando Nunziata;Maurizio Migliaccio;Domenico Velotto	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8518000	backscatter;remote sensing;wind speed;petroleum seep;synthetic aperture radar;angle of incidence;spatial analysis;computer science;scattering;signal-to-noise ratio	Embedded	79.35722286560619	-62.478370066704414	175785

Researches have been continuously conducted on increasing the data coverage at non-PS-rich areas. The recently developed SqueeSAR™ technique has validated the potential of extracting useful information from distributed scatterers. With the availability of high resolution TerraSAR-X spotlight data, this technique can benefit greatly from its higher data density and quality. This article presents an algorithm of parameter estimation at distributed scatterers by maximum likelihood estimator in high resolution TS-X spotlight data. Different to SqueeSAR™, this article pays particular attention to the accurate covariance matrix estimation for phase history retrieval on each individual distributed scatterer. Solutions are presented for adaptive sample selection by a different statistical test (Anderson-Darling). An adaptive multi-resolution defringe algorithm is introduced to cope with the problem of accurate fringe removal and in turn accurate covariance matrix estimation. And finally maximum likelihood estimator was employed to estimate the model parameters by weighting each measurement according to its coherence. By combining both the persistent scatterers and distributed scatterers, the increase in the capable monitoring area is phenomenal.	algorithm;areal density (computer storage);dbpedia;estimation theory;image resolution;line-of-sight (missile)	Yuanyuan Wang;Xiaoxiang Zhu;Richard Bamler	2011	2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049967	econometrics;decision support system;maximum likelihood;statistics;remote sensing	Visualization	74.85460988455306	-65.79497726595338	175876

Because of near-daily global coverage, MODIS data are beneficial to applications that require timely information about vegetation condition related to drought, flooding, or fire danger. Rapid satellite data streams in operational applications have clear benefits for monitoring vegetation, especially when information can be delivered as fast as changing surface conditions. An “expedited” processing system called “eMODIS” operated by the U.S. Geological Survey provides rapid MODIS surface reflectance data to operational applications in less than 24 h offering tailored, consistently-processed information products that complement standard MODIS products. We assessed eMODIS quality and consistency by comparing to standard MODIS data. Only land data with known high quality were analyzed in a central U.S. study area. When compared to standard MODIS (MOD/MYD09Q1), the eMODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maintained a strong, significant relationship to standard MODIS NDVI, whether from morning (Terra) or afternoon (Aqua) orbits. The Aqua eMODIS data were more prone to noise than the Terra data, likely due to differences in the internal cloud mask used in MOD/MYD09Q1 or compositing rules. Post-processing temporal smoothing decreased noise in eMODIS data.	aqua;compositing;display resolution;smoothing;video post-processing	Jesslyn F. Brown;Daniel M. Howard;Bruce K.

This remarkable collection of spatially referenced information offered an opportunity to advance our understanding of the nature and extent of environmental change that has taken place with the construction of the military airbase at Diego Garcia. Changes assessed included movements of the lagoon rim shorelines, changes in the terrestrial vegetation on the lagoon rim and amendments to the bathymetry of the lagoon basin through dredging activities. Data compiled included detailed shoreline and vegetation maps produced as part of the H.M.S. Vidal Indian Ocean Expedition (1967), three Ikonos satellite images acquired in 2005 that collectively covered the complete Atoll area, a ground truthing field dataset collected in the northern section of the lagoon for the purpose of seafloor mapping (2005), observational evidence of shoreline erosion including photographs and descriptions of seawater inundations and bathymetric soundings from five independent surveys of the lagoon floor (1967, 1985, 1987, 1988 and 1997). Results indicated that much of the change along the lagoon rim is associated with the expansion of the inner lagoon shoreline as a result of the construction of the military airbase, with an estimated increase in land area of 3.01 km2 in this portion of the atoll rim. Comparisons of 69 rim width transects measured from 1967 and 2005 indicated that shorelines are both eroding (26 transects) and accreting (43 transects). Within a total vegetated area of 24 km2, there was a notable transition from Cocos Woodland to Broadleaf Woodland for a land area of 5.6 km2. From the hydrographic surveys, it was estimated that approximately 0.55 km3 of carbonate sediment material has been removed from the northwest quadrant of the lagoon, particularly in the vicinity of the Main Passage. As no previous record of benthic character exists, a complete benthic habitat map of the atoll was derived through classification of the three IKONOS satellite images. Management implications arising from this overall appraisal of geomorphic and ecological change at Diego Garcia included the need for ongoing monitoring of shoreline change at a representative set of sites around the atoll rim, monitoring of the water flow regime through the northern channels between the open ocean and the lagoon basin and an ongoing mapping campaign to record periodic changes in the character of the benthic surface ecology.	bathymetry;cocos2d;compiler;ecology;map;null character;terrestrial television	Sarah M.

Most of the solutions proposed to date are mainly focused on the problem of surface fires, and very few research works have been performed to develop techniques for the subsurface fire problem. Although few algorithms based on the fixed-thresholding approach have been proposed for subsurface hotspot detection, however, for each application, thresholds have to be specifically tuned to cope with unique environmental conditions. The main objective of this paper is to develop an instrument-independent adaptive method by which direct threshold or multithreshold can be avoided. The proposed contextual algorithm is very helpful to monitor subsurface hotspots with operational satellite data, such as the Jharia region of India, without making any region-specific guess in thresholding. Novelty of the proposed work lies in the fact that once the algorithmic model is developed for the particular region of interest after optimizing the model parameters, there is no need to optimize those parameters again for further satellite images. Hence, the developed model can be used for optimized automated detection and monitoring of subsurface hotspots for future images of the particular region of interest. The algorithm is adaptive in nature and uses vegetation index and different NOAA/AVHRR channel's statistics to detect hotspots in the region of interest. The performance of the algorithm is assessed in terms of sensitivity and specificity and compared with other well-known thresholding techniques such as Otsu's thresholding, entropy-based thresholding, and existing contextual algorithm proposed by Flasse and Ceccato. The proposed algorithm is found to give better hotspot detection accuracy with lesser false alarm rate.	algorithm;java hotspot virtual machine;mike lesser;otsu's method;region of interest;sensitivity and specificity;subsurface scattering;thresholding (image processing)	Rohit Singh Gautam;Dharmendra Singh;Ankush Mittal	2008	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2008.916631	meteorology;entropy;image analysis;image resolution;performance;image processing;hydrology;accuracy and precision;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Vision	76.89670996937762	-61.54998184604797	176078

A significant issue is the presence of a fungal pathogen Sphaeropsis sapinea which is present in many softwood plantations. In this research we investigate the use of CASI-2 imagery to detect Sphaeropsis sapinea infestation using linear spectral mixture analysis approaches. Results indicate that four fraction endmember images could be reliably extracted from the 12 channel CASI-2 imagery with sunlit canopy, soil, shadow, and nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV) all well estimated. Using multiple linear stepwise regression, models were developed using mixed fractional abundances with model predictions found to be highly significant. The NPV and shadow endmembers, in order, were consistently identified as important in the regression models and confirm their importance in crown condition modelling.	british national vegetation classification;crown group;motorola canopy;stepwise regression	Nicholas C.

This is a problem of high importance in the field of Lighting Engineering, more specifically for Luminaire Design. Light propagation inside and outside the optical set must be computed and the resulting radiance distribution compared to the desired one in an iterative process. Constraints on the shape imposed by industry needs must be taken into account, bounding the set of possible shape definitions. A general approach is based on a minimization procedure on the space of possible reflector shapes, starting from a generic or a user-provided shape.  This minimization techniques are usually known also as inverse problems, and are very expensive in computational power, requiring a long time to reach a good solution. To reduce this high resource needs we propose a parallel approach, based on SMP and clustering, that can bring the simulation times to a more feasible level.		Juan A.

39e95e89c2a415c321652454a7eb55de8b44a90c	classification and anomaly detection algorithms for weak hyperspectral signal processing		In applications involving weak light signal like hyperspectral or time distributed signals obtained in applications involving laser induced fluorescence spectral detection, fluorescence lifetime imaging, Raman Spectroscopy or hyperspectral imaging in low light environment, the photons arrive at such a rate that they can be counted or have to be intensified to obtain a usable signal. Detection and classification algorithms need to be designed and evaluated for weak hyperspectral signal processing. A new algorithm, Adaptive Shot Noise (ASN) based on the assumption that a signal respects the Poisson multivariate distribution has been developed using the method of the maximum likelihood. This algorithm demonstrates the capability to be used for detection and classification. Using Monte Carlo simulations its performances are compared with the Adaptive Coherence Estimator (ACE) classification and with an Integrated Signal Algorithm (ISA) and ACE for detection. This new algorithm provides a small increase in performance compared to ACE in very weak signal conditions for classification and in some conditions better performance over both ACE and ISA in detection. The algorithm behavior like ACE shows sensitivity to assumption on the spectral characteristics of the source for the detection, which is not the case for ISA.	ace;adaptive filter;algorithm;anomaly detection;monte carlo method;performance;raman scattering;shot noise;signal processing;simulation	Pierre Lahaie	2016	2016 8th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)	10.1109/WHISPERS.2016.8071758	shot noise;anomaly detection;estimator;signal processing;monte carlo method;algorithm;statistical classification;computer vision;artificial intelligence;hyperspectral imaging;coherence (physics);computer science	ML	71.50343119913474	-65.01118532257654	176542

After orthocorrection and atmospheric correction, we analyzed the directional reflectance (HDRF) of a dense conifer forest to get two CSI, i.e. effective value of re-collision probability, pr, and escape probability R1 at different angles. These two invariants at all five angles were regressed to LVIS_H100 data, which is relevant to canopy height, and demonstrated a comparable statistics to the regression with spectral reflectances. In this sense, CSI method can act as an effective tool to reduce the dimension of hyperspectral remote sensing data by a ratio of N/2 (N is the number of spectral bands). Re-collision probability, pr, and escape probability R1 can be understood as two principle components in PCA, however, they are superior to principle components because the transformation is based on radiation transfer physics and reduction result have explicit interpretation. In similar consideration to reduce the redundancy as above, we also calculated the deviation of each spectral band to the fitted value from pr and R1 and make a statistics for all the sampling pixels. We picked out the best fitted bands, as most of them locate in NIR range, we employed statistics to determine which to supplement in visible range, and discussed the potential of these bands to be selected as optimal VNIR bands combination of future vegetation sensor design.	dimensionality reduction;mathematical model;motorola canopy;pixel;principal component analysis;sampling (signal processing);transmission coefficient	Dianzhong Wang;Guoqing Sun;Shengli Wu;Yong Pang;Zhifeng Guo	2008	IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779987	meteorology;spectroscopy;hyperspectral imaging;reflectivity;optics;physics;statistics;remote sensing;principal component analysis	Embedded	80.58345094089306	-61.53749670086319	176648

The aim is to reconstruct the positions, sizes and crown shapes of trees. This amounts to simultaneous tree localization and estimation of tree shapes by fitting multiple CHMs to ALS data. This estimation problem is written in Bayesian inversion framework. The benefit of the Bayesian approach is that it enables accounting for statistical prior information on the unknown parameters in the estimation. The prior information is explicitely written in the form of a probability distribution that models the unknowns. Here, the prior information is associated with the statistics of tree height, crown height and crown width. We hypothesize that utilizing such information in the estimation improves the detection of trees in dense forests, i.e. cases where the existing reconstruction methods usually fail. The feasibility of the proposed approach is tested with ALS data. The estimates are compared with field measurements. The preliminary results demonstrate that the positions and sizes of the trees can be tracked relatively well, even if tree crowns are interlaced.	airborne ranger;crown group;interlaced video;tree (data structure)	Timo Lähivaara;Aku Seppänen;Jari P.

Accurate modeling of the statistics is critical in the determination of Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) CFAR detection rules in along-track interferometry, and the estimation of topography accuracy in across-track interferometry. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating n and /spl rho/ based on the interferometric phase density function. We validate the robust, real-time implementable method with real SAR data in various types of terrain. Particularly, we show how the method can be extended to model the phase distribution even in extremely heterogeneous terrain. We show that the estimation relies only upon the multi-looked interferogram, without reference to the individual channels thereby reducing data storage requirements.		Ishuwa C. Sikaneta;Christoph H.

4cb8266727476656cb2267a76d7abffb93d0d925	cropland use change analysis in shaanxi province of china based on the shape-matching cropping index mapping method		Timely and accurately monitoring of cropland use is of critical significance to ensure food security. Shaanxi province of China has experienced major land use and land cover changes due to the rapid urban sprawl and the implement of the Grain for Green Project. This paper aimed to investigate cropland use changes in Shaanxi from 2000 to 2015 based on MODIS EVI time-series data by utilizing shape-matching cropping index mapping method. The shape-matching method we formerly developed was proved to be an efficient method in mapping cropland use intensity. We firstly divided the study area into six different geomorphic zones, and then randomly selected training samples in each zone. After that, the cropping status for each sample was visually interpreted and used as reference data to train the optimal thresholds for detect cropping index in each zone with the shape-matching cropping index mapping model. Then the cropland use maps for 2000 and 2015 was derived. Finally, the cropland use changes were obtained by spatial analysis of these two cropland use maps. Results show that: (1) The dominant land use is double cropping and non-grain crop production in Guangzhong Plain both in 2000 and 2015. And most cropland in other zones was used for non-grain crop production in the two study years. (2) There were totally 2 585.3 km2 cropland newly developed and 7 042.8 km2 cropland lost in the past fifteen years. Areas with increased use intensity is 4 084.9 km2, while areas with decreased use intensity is 10 889.3 km2 during this period. (3) Extensive cropland use changes were taken places in the Wind Drift Sand Region, the Loess Plateau, the Guanzhong Plain and the Hanjiang Basin. Our findings could provide great support for local agriculture management.	index mapping;map;randomness;spatial analysis;time series	Jianhong Liu;Xuyang He;Fan Liang;Tongsheng Li	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8519399	index mapping;food security;remote sensing;land use;loess;land cover;multiple cropping;cropping;agroforestry;computer science;agriculture	Embedded	82.38678790040392	-56.45602178189113	177070

An improved S-NMF (Sparseness-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization) for ship detection according to the nonnegative and sparseness characteristics of eigenvalues is proposed in this paper. The first two eigenvalues are used for NMF decomposition since they take most of the energy of the targets, and then we combine the advantage of the third eigenvalue which could get rid of the false alarms for ship detection with the OS-CFAR method. The proposed method is validated using Radarsat-2 fully polarimetric images with the corresponding AIS data. Results show that it cannot only detect most of the ships, but also reduce the false alarms effectively, and has good ability when the detection conditions change.	non-negative matrix factorization;polarimetry	Bingjie Wu;Bo Zhang;Hong Zhang;Fan Wu	2012		10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351166	computer vision;eigendecomposition of a matrix;synthetic aperture radar;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;noise;pattern recognition;clutter;scattering;radar imaging;physics;remote sensing	NLP	71.44930365340038	-66.11088602931397	177486

The main contribution of the present road detection method consists of an effective enhancement technique and an efficient segmentation technique that removes non-road pixels step by step from the image where parameters involved: in each step images are determined by the sensor characteristics (like spatial resolution and spectral range) of the satellite. Also, the segmentation process depends not only on the road contrast but also on the road length. Thus, a low contrast but long road segment does not get removed. We have tested the algorithm on a number of images from IRS and SPOT satellites and the results are satisfactory.	algorithm	Amar Mukherjee;Swapan K. Parui;D. Chaudhuri;Bidyut Baran Chaudhuri;R.

23753fc3679c5e55bf1aea2fd6da3c14a4ef2286	an angular vegetation index for imaging spectroscopy data - preliminary results on forest damage detection in the bavarian national park, germany	tai;vegetation indices;angular index;forest damage mapping;hyperspectral remote sensing;imaging spectroscopy data;genetic algorithm	A vegetation index (VI) is presented which is calculated as the inner angles of a triangle. The triangle is spanned between three distinct points (on a spectral curve of imaging spectroscopy data) which are defined for each individual pixel by the wavelength (x-axis) and the reflection value (y-axis). The ideal wavelengths of the three points are dependent on the response variable investigated. The case-study within this paper in which this angular VI is applied, aims at the development of an index to automatically detect spruce bark beetle infections in the Bavarian National Park, Germany. In order to determine the optimum wavelengths to separate damaged from non-damaged trees the three-angle-indices (TAIs) for all possible combinations of available wavelengths of HyMap imaging spectroscopy data in the vis–NIR-region (0.455–0.986 μm) were calculated. The resulting 27,417 images served as input predictor variables to a genetic algorithm (GA) which used nearest centroid classifier as fitness functions to detect the most stable predictors and separate the six classes (three damage classes) defined within the study area.#R##N##R##N#The fitness functions integrated in the GA reached classification accuracies of up to 94.8% when using forward selection models of the most stable genes featuring maximum 50 predictors. Based on those results, three from the original 27,417 predictors were extracted to map forest damages over the full image extent based on a support vector machines (SVMs) classification. We conducted the same experiment with 82 vegetation indices described in literature and achieved slightly lower GA overall accuracies of 86.8% using the nearest centroid classifier. The SVM maps produced with the three best VI predictors were comparable to the TAI results.	angularjs	Fabian Ewald Fassnacht;Hooman Latifi;Barbara Koch	2012	Int. J.

During the initial phase of this mission, many validation procedures were implemented to verify the accuracy associated with a variety of altimetry-derived data products. Of specific interest was the need to validate the geodetic position of the ICESat footprints, which is a convolution of laser-pointing determination, satellite position, and ranging measurements. This paper describes the methodology and implementation of one effort using aerial photography to image the laser spots on the surface during a satellite overflight. The spot locations are determined based on the relative positions of accurately placed geodetic infrared-emitting markers within the overflight area and apparent in the aerial photograph. One specific overflight opportunity captured six successive ICESat footprints with the airborne camera system. The mean geolocation predictions of those spots using the ground fiducial placement in the image provide a data product validation to better than 3.1-m rms on the surface with an estimated accuracy of ±3.6 m when compared to the ICESat solution. These results are within the ICESat mission requirement of 4.5 m on the surface (1.5-arcsecond pointing knowledge) for geodetic position determination.	aerial photography;airborne ranger;ambiguous grammar;charge-coupled device;convolution;data acquisition;focal (programming language);fiducial marker;geodetic datum;geolocation;image analysis;reference ellipsoid	Lori A.

It's based on 1D geometry projection using a digital elevation model (DEM) and considering the corresponding georeferenced SAR image. The DEM to be processed is firstly rotated into the radar geometry so that each row would be suitable for a radar line of sight. Then, the extraction of shadow would be done per row. The proposed method is tested on DEMs as well as on a simulated hilly modeled by Gaussian functions. The obtained results are very interesting, especially for simulated data with high resolution.	3d projection;digital elevation model;image resolution;radar;simulated annealing	Oussama Haddad;Riadh Abdelfattah;Hachem Ajili	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350740	medical imaging;computer vision;digital elevation model;geology;optics;radar imaging;remote sensing	Robotics	75.77071924804878	-63.835056649849925	177945

While there are many algorithms designed for SAR image pairs and also some first approaches for multi-temporal satellite data stacks, no method suitable to airborne single-pass stacks that typically contain just a small number of multi-baseline acquisitions has been proposed yet. This paper presents an adaptive procedure to determine regions of homogeneous backscattering in heterogeneous scenes such as urban areas. Based on these regions, the complex covariance matrices can be estimated for all pixels in the stack. This step enables the retrieval of all relevant information of the multi-baseline InSAR data set, e.g., despeckled intensity images, interferometric phase observations, and related coherence maps. The denoising efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated and compared to different algorithms. Furthermore, the detail preservation is analyzed in order to prove the validity of the homogeneity assumption.	airborne ranger;algorithm;baseline (configuration management);map;noise reduction;pixel;stack (abstract data type);synthetic data;thresholding (image processing)	Michael Schmitt;Uwe Stilla	2014	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2013.2238947	computer vision;continuous-wave radar;synthetic aperture radar;bistatic radar;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;optics;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar;physics;remote sensing	Vision	74.12636729526204	-65.41447250289158	178209

This causes differences in the composition and structure of the soil. These influence the development and health of the vegetation on the surface which may be detectable remotely. Indeed much work has been conducted using aerial photography indicating that the use of current remote sensing technologies could lead to improved detection. This paper explores the potential of hyperspectral and full waveform LiDAR data for the mapping of archaeology at an arable site in the UK. It is demonstrated that the archaeological features are detectable by both sensor types most successfully when looking at products that pertain to biomass. This means there is great potential for data fusion approaches using these products. These could be used to improve the spatial resolution of the hyperspectral data and potentially to improve the analysis of biomass in spectra analysis of vegetation parameters.	aerial photography;interference (communication);waveform	David Stott;Doreen S.

We generated 3D models 32 of three different outcrops exposed in a marble quarry and two solids: a volcanic bomb 33 and a stalagmite. Comparison of the models obtained in this study using the presented 34 method with those obtained by using a precise laser scanner shows that multiview 3D 35 reconstruction yields models that present a root mean square error/average linear 36 dimensions between 0.11 and 0.68%.

1becbebb9daf7d946dd7ea8b7798813e9c9be7cb	issues with large area thematic accuracy assessment for mapping cropland extent: a tale of three continents		Accurate, consistent and timely cropland information over large areas is critical to solve food security issues. To predict and respond to food insecurity, global cropland products are readily available from coarse and medium spatial resolution earth observation data. However, while the use of satellite imagery has great potential to identify cropland areas and their specific types, the full potential of this imagery has yet to be realized due to variability of croplands in different regions. Despite recent calls for statistically robust and transparent accuracy assessment, more attention regarding the accuracy assessment of large area cropland maps is still needed. To conduct a valid assessment of cropland maps, different strategies, issues and constraints need to be addressed depending upon various conditions present in each continent. This study specifically focused on dealing with some specific issues encountered when assessing the cropland extent of North America (confined to the United States), Africa and Australia. The process of accuracy assessment was performed using a simple random sampling design employed within defined strata (i.e., Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZ’s) for the US and Africa and a buffer zone approach around the cropland areas of Australia. Continent-specific sample analysis was performed to ensure that an appropriate reference data set was used to generate a valid error matrix indicative of the actual cropland proportion. Each accuracy assessment was performed within the homogenous regions (i.e., strata) of different continents using different sources of reference data to produce rigorous and valid accuracy results. The results indicate that continent-specific modified assessments performed for the three selected continents demonstrate that the accuracy assessment can be easily accomplished for a large area such as the US that has extensive availability of reference data while more modifications were needed in the sampling design for other continents that had little to no reference data and other constraints. Each continent provided its own unique challenges and opportunities. Therefore, this paper describes a tale of these three continents providing recommendations to adapt accuracy assessment strategies and methodologies for validating global cropland extent maps.

The Spinning Enhanced Visible Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) sensor onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) geostationary satellite can also contribute to this task thanks to its adequate spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, four years of MSG-SEVIRI Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) daily time series have been retrieved, which were then gap-filled with the help of an algorithm based on the iterative Interpolation for Data Reconstruction [Julien and Sobrino, 2010]. Finally, phenological parameters have been retrieved from the reconstructed time series, and compared with independent MODIS (Moderate resolution Imaging Spectrometer) data, showing differences for specific land covers although the stability of the retrieved phenophases over the year is surprisingly good for MSG data. This approach can be applied to other geostationary satellites worldwide to obtain quick remotely sensed estimates of vegetation phenology at global scale.	algorithm;geosynchronous satellite;image sensor;interpolation;iterative method;second generation multiplex plus;time series	Yves Julien;José A.

Features to be used for image registration are those contours in both images that have been classified as coastline (reliable information). The automatic contour-based approach is summarized by the following steps: (i) reference image coastline extraction; (ii) sensed image gradient energy map estimation; (iii) contour matching, mapping function estimation and transformation of the sensed images. The algorithm proposed is automatic and of significant value in an operational context. Several experimental results for single sensor imagery (AVHRR) from different viewpoints and dates as well as multisensor imagery (AVHRR-SeaWiFS) have verified the robustness and accuracy of the proposed automatic registration algorithm, demonstrating its capability of registering satellite images of coastal areas within one pixel.

Observations were made using the University of Massachusetts' Imaging Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler radar system installed on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's WP-3D research aircraft during several winter storm events to determine the high-wind response of the sea surface NRCS for both horizontal and vertical polarizations. During the flights, the aircraft performed several constant-roll circle maneuvers to allow collection of NRCS over a range of incidence angles. We find consistency with prior reports in the polarization ratio observed at moderate incidence angles at the winds encountered. For larger incidence angles, we observe a measurable decrease in polarization ratio with increasing wind speed.	airborne ranger;cross section (geometry);decibel;extrapolation;incidence matrix;polarization (waves);radar	Joseph W.

This paper provides a new approach to characterize the spatial structures within remote sensing imagery using stochastic models and geostatistic metrics. Up to now, the second-order variogram has been widely used to describe the spatial variations within an image. In this paper, we demonstrate its limitation to discriminate distinct image spatial structures. We introduce a different geostatistic metric, the first-order variogram, which used in combination with the second-order variogram, will prove its efficiency to describe the image spatial structures. We then develop a method based on the simultaneous use of both first- and second-order variogram metrics to model the image spatial structures as the weighted linear combination of two stochastic models: a Poisson line mosaic model and a multi-Gaussian model. The image spatial structures are characterized by the variance weight and the variogram range related to each model. This method is applied to several SPOT-HRV Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images from the VALERI database in order to characterize the nature of the processes structuring different types of landscape. The mosaic model is an indicator of strong NDVI discontinuities within the image mainly generated by anthropogenic processes such as the mosaic pattern of crop sites. The multi-Gaussian model shows evidence of diffuse and continuous variation of NDVI generally engendered by ecological and environmental processes such as the fuzzy pattern observed over forest and natural vegetation sites	f-spot;first-generation programming language;first-order predicate;heart rate variability;software metric;stochastic process	Sébastien Garrigues;Denis Allard;Frédéric Baret	2007	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2007.894572	normalized difference vegetation index;image processing;hydrology;stochastic modelling;mathematics;landscape;statistics;remote sensing;geostatistics	Vision	82.33398416884712	-53.77732683274477	178831

Each of these orbiting synthetic aperture radars provide somewhat complementary information since data is collected using significantly different frequencies, polarizations, and look angles (ERS-1: C-band, VV polarization, 23""""; JERS-1: L-band, HH polarization, 35""""). This results in a classification procedure for the composite image (a co-registered pair from the same season) that is superior to that obtained from either of the two sensors alone. A conceptual model is presented to show how simple structural attributes of terrain surfaces and vegetation cover relate to the data from these two sensors. The conceptual model is knowledgebased; and it is supported by both theoretical considerations and experimental observations. The knowledge-based, conceptual model is incorporated into a classifier that uses hierarchical decision rules to differentiate land-cover classes. The land-cover classes are defined on the basis of generalized structural properties of widespread applicability. The classifier operates sequentially and produces two levels of classification. At Level-1, terrain is structurally differentiated into man-made features (urban), surfaces, short vegetation, and tall vegetation. At Level-2, the tall vegetation class is differentiated on the basis of plant architectural properties of the woody stems and foliage. Growth forms of woody stems include excurrent (Le., pines), decurrent (Le., oaks), and columnar (i.e., palm) architecture. Two classes of leaves are considered: broadleaf and needle-leaf. The composite classifier yields overall accuracies in excess of 90% for a test site in northern Michigan located along the southern ecotone of the boreal forest. For the area examined, the SAR-based classification is superior to unsupervised classification of multitemporal AVHRR data supplemented with a priori information on elevation, climate, and ecoregion."""	l band;offset binary;polarization (waves);radar;sensor;statistical classification;synthetic intelligence;terrain rendering;unsupervised learning;verification and validation	M.

The characterization of urban objects requires powerful methods combined with high resolution imagery, in this study we present an object characterization method that takes into consideration the spatial and spectral characteristics of remote sensing imagery, using an airborne hyperspectral image. The method consists of two mains steps; 1) a spectral classification of the objects using an external spectral library combined with image collected spectra, 2) a morphological classification of the objects using their geometric attributes. The goal is to provide an efficient objects characterization method that takes advantage of both spatial and spectral dimensions of hyperspectral imagery, and to improve classification methods efficiency.	airborne ranger;galaxy morphological classification;image resolution;ncsa mosaic;stellar classification	Sebastien Gadal;Walid Ouerghemmi	2016	2016 8th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)	10.1109/WHISPERS.2016.8071762	spectral line;remote sensing;computer vision;hyperspectral imaging;artificial intelligence;computer science	Vision	76.25879800657212	-59.25450090324821	179057

A new parametric model for local two-point statistics of the image is introduced, in order to characterize the spatially nonstationary and anisotropic behavior of the image. The texture is first modeled by a nonstationary Gaussian process resulting from the convolution of a Gaussian white noise with a field of anisotropic Gaussian kernel with spatially varying parameters. Hence, under the hypothesis of locally stationary signal, the analytic expression of the local autocovariance is derived. It is then explained how to simulate nonstationary K-distributed random fields by combining the new model with an already existing simulation method. A method for parameter estimation is then introduced. This method, based on the statistical product model, first corrects the speckle contribution to the local autocovariance and estimates the parameters of the model by analyzing the shape of the autocovariance. The algorithm is then evaluated over simulated and experimental data. Stationary simulations permit to show that, for a sufficient sample size, the estimator is unbiased. A test over a nonstationary simulation proves the ability of the algorithm to capture the spatial fluctuations of the texture. Finally, the method is applied to the experimental SAR data, and it is shown that a large amount of spatial information may be retrieved from the data.	algorithm;convolution;estimation theory;gaussian process;parametric model;simulation;spatial analysis;stationary process;synthetic intelligence;white noise	Olivier D'Hondt;Carlos López-Martínez;Laurent Ferro-Famil;Eric Pottier	2007	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2007.908877	stochastic process;computer vision;econometrics;gaussian process;mathematics;spatial analysis;white noise;anisotropy;statistics	Vision	70.56774732684187	-59.700181217181076	179087

Secondly, the correlation coefficient (CC) between the extracted signal and the mineral spectra is treated as a detection value to make a judgment. Compared with Clark's mapping, the experiment result shows that MSCPE_BSE method highlights the desired signal and suppresses the backgrounds.

Then, difference image is generated from the change detection method-image differencing for further analysis, in which an unsupervised threshold selection algorithm based on Bayesian decision theory is used, aiming at extracting the changed information automatically from the images. This algorithm is suitable for those images which have great radiometric difference as well as great changes from each other. The experimental result of the proposed algorithm compared with the traditional way of CD is presented, which indicate that the proposed method improves the result effectively and is superior to the traditional one.	autoregressive integrated moving average;bayesian information criterion;decision theory;histogram matching;image differencing;iteration;metric;pixel;selection algorithm;thresholding (image processing)	Qiongcheng Xu;Wei Wang;Yunchen Pu;Huamin Zhong	2012	2012 Fifth International Joint Conference on Computational Sciences and Optimization	10.1109/CSO.2012.90	algorithm design;computer vision;calibration;radiometry;bayes estimator;decision theory;feature extraction;bayesian probability;computer science;histogram matching;machine learning;pattern recognition;balanced histogram thresholding;histogram;mathematics;iterative method;image segmentation;change detection;statistics	Robotics	70.89149307364097	-63.088363956356694	179409
917e4e85443a2377e9d1d8492b2f98fe383aecaa	radiometric evaluation of an airborne single photon lidar sensor		Lidar intensity is correlated with illuminated target physical properties, particularly target reflectance, making it a valuable quantity for applications, such as land cover classification, data registration, structural damage detection, and qualitative point cloud interpretation. In contrast to traditional linear-mode lidar (LML) hardware, single photon lidar (SPL) detectors produce a binary response to impinging photons and therefore do not provide an intensity measure for each detected return. This is a significant drawback but can be addressed by computing a measure of local point cloud density for each point. Since the arrival and detection of single photon are governed by statistics such that the observations of brighter surfaces are more probable to generate a detection event than darker surfaces, a local point cloud density metric can be used as a proxy for traditional LML intensity. We define the relationship between target reflectance and photon detection probability and compare the predicted relationship with empirical observations of ground reflectance and an estimate of detection probability generated from local point cloud density. We also examine a pulsewidth measure provided by the SPL sensor used for this letter, as well as the influence of neighborhood radius on variance in the probability estimates and a filtered version of the hardware-supplied pulsewidth.	density matrix;point cloud;sensor	Preston J.

Various methods of agricultural production estimation, particularly food crops, provide different information. It can be a source of error in decision making. Satellite data, provides information periodically, wide coverage area, can be used as a source of information on the condition of agricultural lands and even remote areas. The advantages of SAR data that does not depend on sunlight and can penetrate of clouds and fog can fill the lack of optical data. ALOS PALSAR data has been used for analysis and ALOS AVNIR-2 is for checking of land cover visually, with acquisition date on 10 May 2007. Sampling of each rice crop growth period used several of rice field conditions in each period, on one scene data. Results showed a possibility to use soil moisture conditions derived from ALOS PALSAR for estimating rice planting area. On a scatter diagram between backscatter of ALOS PALSAR and near infrared of ALOS AVNIR-2 showed a specific pattern for each growing period of paddy. The results of the analysis produce distribution maps of the rice planting area Subang area, West Java Province. However, validation of the method used remains to be done. Remote sensing results of this study are expected to provide better information and can contribute in the planning of higher quality agricultural land.	diagram;information source;java	Rizatus Shofiyati;Ishak Hanafiah Ismullah;Dan Dudung Muhally Hakim	2011	J.

Microwave sensors are typically favored as they deliver data enabling water detection independent of solar illumination or cloud cover conditions. However, scale issues play an important role in radar based flood mapping. Depending on the flood related phenomenon under investigation, some sensors might be more suitable than others. In this study, we elucidate flood mapping at different spatial scale investigating the capability of Envisat ASAR Wide Swath Mode data at 150 m spatial resolution, as well as TerraSAR-X Scansar and Stripmap data at 8.25 m and 2.5 m resolution to especially assess urban flooding. For this purpose, we evaluate the results of automated multi-temporal water extraction from data sources of different scale against other parameters, such as settlement density, also taking a highly accurate building layer digitized from Quickbird data into consideration. Results reveal that while Envisat ASAR WSM derived flood maps are suitable to support the understanding of general flood patterns in a larger region, high resolution data of sensors OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2013, 5 5123 such as TerraSAR-X is needed to truly assess urban flooding. However, even radar data of high spatial resolution still shows limitations; mainly in regions with a dense accumulation of corner reflectors leading to effects of layover, foreshortening, and shadowing, and hence the “over radiation” of flood affected areas.	file shadowing;flood;image resolution;map;microwave;radar;sensor;spatial scale;tree accumulation;water model	Claudia Kuenzer;Huadong Guo;Inga Schlegel;Vo Quoc Tuan;Xinwu Li;Stefan W.

The automated processing system, implemented by using commercial GIS and a number of Perl scripts and C/C++ programs, allows for rapid data display, requires less storage capacity, and provides the analytical and data visualization tools inherent in GIS as compared to traditional methods. In this paper, we illustrate the development of automatic techniques to preprocess raw NEXRAD Stage III data, transform the data to a GIS format, select regions of interest, and retrieve statistical rainfall analysis over userdefined spatial and temporal scales. Computational expense is reduced significantly using the GIS-based automated techniques. For example, 1-year Stage III data processing ( 9000 files) for the West Gulf River Forecast Center takes about 3 days of computation time instead of months of manual work. To illustrate the radar precipitation database and its visualization capabilities, we present three application examples: (1) GIS-based data visualization and integration, and ArcIMS-based web visualization and publication system, (2) a spatial–temporal analysis of monsoon rainfall patterns over the Rio Grande River Basin, and (3) the potential of GIS-based radar data for distributed watershed models. We conclude by discussing the potential applications of automated techniques for radar rainfall processing and its integration with GIS-based hydrologic information systems. r 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The extended Kalman filter (EKF) enables to retrieve and track the ABL parameters based on simplified statistics of the ABL dynamics and of the observation noise present in the lidar signal. This adaptive feature permits to analyze atmospheric scenes with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) without the need to resort to long-time averages or range-smoothing techniques, as well as to pave the way for future automated detection solutions.

cac915c7598da4c0caf5b328851488750c52bb7d	review of methods for mapping forest disturbance and degradation from optical earth observation data		This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in remote sensing based monitoring of forest disturbances and forest degradation from optical Earth Observation data. Part one comprises an overview and tabular description of currently available optical remote sensing sensors, which can be used for forest disturbance and degradation mapping. A section is devoted to currently existing mapping approaches, including both operational methods and recent developments. Part two reviews the two main categories of existing mapping approaches: first, classical image-to-image change detection and second, time series analysis. With the launch of the Sentinel-2a satellite and available Landsat imagery, time series analysis has become the most promising but also most demanding category of degradation mapping approaches. Hence, an emphasis is put on methods of time series analysis, among which four different classification methods are distinguished. The methods are explained and their benefits and drawbacks are discussed. A separate chapter presents a number of recent forest degradation mapping studies for two different ecosystems: The first ecosystem comprises the temperate forests with a geographical focus on Europe.	ecosystem;elegant degradation;sensor;table (information);time series	Manuela Hirschmugl;Heinz Gallaun;Matthias Dees;Pawan Datta;Janik Deutscher;Nikos Koutsias;Mathias Schardt	2017	CoRR		geography;soil science;forestry;remote sensing	ML	78.60137820280958	-59.44744667956395	179845

The intrusions display an internal zoning due to the variation in composition and/or grain size. In general, the zone presents a scarce vegetation cover that reaches a minimum during summertime. For this study we used a set of winter and summer images of the TM system of Landsat5 that were used to digital classification. Considering the existence of geological cartography of the area, we used supervised classification by different methods like minimum distance and maximum likelihood. They were also considered empiric techniques of classification as scattergram or equal density analysis. We obtained satisfactory results in the differentiation between the metasedimentary sequence and siliceous rocks and in internal zoning of plutons. The geological mapping offers a support to land ordering. For these reason, the speed and efficiency in the application of these techniques to satellite images offer important economic and scientific advantages.	cartography;machine learning;supervised learning	T.

adc483d900fdb7982dd9f402e96b2fabfeaf99ba	detecting rice blast disease using model inverted biochemical variables from close-range reflectance imagery of fresh leaves		Rice blast is one of the most devastating crop diseases around the world. Although previous remote sensing studies have examined the spectral variation at leaf and canopy levels in response to disease severity levels, the nonimaging nature of their data makes it difficult to examine the spectral variation related to the disease within a leaf. This study proposes to monitor the spatial and temporal pattern of rice leaf blast on individual leaves with close-range imaging spectroscopy data. Hyperspectral images were acquired from diseased leaves at different infection stages. The image data were converted to reflectance cubes and then processed with a model inversion algorithm PROCWT to retrieve leaf biochemical variables. The biochemical maps were examined to investigate the within-leaf spatial variation and leaf-level temporal variation. Preliminary results demonstrated that the PROCWT algorithm could perform on reflectance image cubes. The retrieved chlorophyll maps exhibited a decline with infection stage and significant within-leaf spatial patterns in response to the disease.	algorithm;map;motorola canopy;olap cube;range imaging;sensor	Long Tian;Zefu Wan;Dong Li;Jiale Jiang;Xia Yao;Qiang Cao;Yongchao Tian;Yan Zhu;Weixing Cao;Tao Cheng	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8519229	canopy;computer vision;artificial intelligence;reflectivity;spatial ecology;spatial variability;hyperspectral imaging;imaging spectroscopy;computer science	Vision	82.01019160840063	-58.32694023187783	180111

This letter gives a solution to the two factors by multilevel reconstruction of SAR targets using attributed scattering centers (ASCs). The ASCs of original SAR images are extracted to reconstruct the target’s image, which not only reduces the noise and background clutters but also keeps the electromagnetic characteristics of the target. Template database are reconstructed at multilevels to simulate various extents of ASC absence in the extended operation conditions. Therefore, the quality of SAR images as well as the completeness of the template database is augmented. Features are extracted from the augmented SAR images, and the classifier is trained by the augmented database for target recognition. Experimental results on the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition data set demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.	aperture (software);automatic target recognition;simulation;stationary process;synthetic data;ti advanced scientific computer	Baiyuan Ding;GongJian Wen;Xiaohong Huang;CongHui Ma;Xiaoliang Yang	2017	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2017.2692386	iterative reconstruction;computer vision;synthetic aperture radar;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;image segmentation;scattering;inverse synthetic aperture radar;physics;remote sensing	Vision	74.07754094058292	-64.99409658986775	180132

Either of them require registered stereo pair as input. In order to register each point precisely, this paper proposes a corresponding image object constrained registration method based on object oriented image segmentation. Compared with current methods, the proposed method provides one geometric image transform (GIT) function for each pair of building roof because one GIT could fit well for just one roof. Object oriented segmentation not only helps us set the effective area for each GIT, but also provide us enough feature points from the boundary of a segmented building points to fit the coefficients of its GIT. The result by applying the proposed method on IKONOS stereo pair demonstrates the feasibility of generating building DSM with acceptable accuracy.

3aa4a82189373cbb4dbd03c485d7cb629cf0126a	time series analysis of l-band sar for agricultural landcover classification		In this paper, an agricultural land cover classification algorithm is presented that uses L-band SAR observations over time to create a crop/non-crop classification. A statistical measurement known as the coefficient of variation (CV) is introduced, which as a measurement of change is able to differentiate between changing agricultural fields and relatively static non-crop areas. Images from the airborne AgriSAR 2006 campaign in northern Germany and from the ALOS PALSAR satellite over Minnesota, USA are used to demonstrate the algorithm. The small region covered by the AgriSAR campaign is used to highlight the differences in behavior of L- and C-band, and in this case the better results of L-band data when using the CV algorithm. Results in both regions show promise for future use of the CV algorithm.	airborne ranger;algorithm;coefficient;l band;pixel;refinement (computing);time series	Tracy Whelen;Paul Siqueira	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128211	time series;remote sensing;optical imaging;computer vision;synthetic aperture radar;computer science;artificial intelligence;agriculture;statistical classification;agricultural land;l band	Embedded	80.42720285636763	-58.667919592717766	180390

It is very important for wetlands protection and re-construction to measure water level changes and consequently water-storage capacity changes in wetlands. Using VV polarization C-band and HH polarization L-band SAR data, combined with synchronous field measurement and investigation, this paper analyzes the difference of backscattering and interferometic coherence characteristics of different types of wetlands. After evaluating factors that influence interferometric coherence, the framework, for measuring water level changes using InSAR phase information, is presented in this paper. With obtained SAR data, this paper studies the InSAR-derived water level changes in Yellow-River Delta wetlands. The results show that the InSAR technology has a great potential in mapping water level changes in coastal wetlands, and InSAR-derived water level changes can supply unprecedented spatial details.	cache coherence;decorrelation;l band;motorola canopy;polarization (waves);sampling (signal processing);verification and validation	Chou Xie;Yun Shao;Zi Wan	2010	2010 18th International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567564	geomorphology;geography;hydrology;remote sensing	HPC	82.09186203164572	-60.68196841829526	180398
eec1fab4e113c60f0a3f153e61ee5a313cd9db3b	a data-driven approach to quality assessment for hyperspectral systems	landoberflache;quality assessment;optik kalibrierung und validierung;imaging spectroscopy;airborne remote sensing;hyperspectral	The increasing use of products based on airborne hyperspectral data for decision-making calls for a thorough quality assessment. Due to the complexity of the corresponding processing chain, as well as the variety of physical processes involved, such a task is usually only performed in specific cases and on specific parts of the processing chain. In particular, the quality assessment of data-products is still an open issue. A generic quality assessment method – based on an cross-comparison of errors – is proposed in this paper. Airborne hyperspectral – also called imaging spectroscopy – data is commonly acquired by means of whiskor push-broom sensors, and requires several strips – or flight-lines – to cover the full area of interest. A comparison of the discrepancies between overlapping parts of these flight-lines is used to retrieve an assessment of the measurement reproducibility. This mapping can be performed on preprocessed data which avoids the need to separately investigate all input parameters and their associated models, hence bypassing the ‘curse of dimensionality’. The first step involves retrieving the pairs of pixels corresponding to the same areas imaged from overlapping flight-lines. Even when an ortho-rectification of the data has been carried out, various phenomena, such as errors in the underlying digital elevation model, lead to flight-line mis-registrations. For heterogeneous land-covers, a pixel to pixel registration step has therefore to be performed in order to allow a cross-comparison of pixels: a suitable methodology is proposed along with its validation. The second step corresponds to the relative errors analysis itself. A set of quantitative quality indicators – corresponding to different types of land-products – is presented. These methods are illustrated with an example along with a discussion. This approach can be used on any reasonably well contrasted scene to retrieve a quality assessment for any raster product independently of its data type as well as for the reflectance data itself. & 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Full-waveform topographic LiDAR data consist of a succession of cross-section profiles of landscapes and each waveform can be decomposed into a sum of echoes. The echo number reveals critical information in classifying land cover types. Most land covers contain one echo, whereas topographic LiDAR data in trees and roof edges contained multi-echo waveform features. To identify land-cover types, waveform-based classifier was integrated single-echo and multi-echo classifiers for point cloud classification. The experimental area was the Namasha district of Southern Taiwan, and the land-cover objects were categorized as roads, trees (canopy), grass (grass and crop), bare (bare ground), and buildings (buildings and roof edges). Waveform features were analyzed with respect to the singleand multi-echo laser-path samples, and the critical waveform features were selected according to the Bhattacharyya distance. Next, waveform-based classifiers were performed using support vector machine (SVM) with the local, spatial features of waveform topographic LiDAR information, and optical image information. Results showed that by using fused waveform and optical information, the waveform-based classifiers achieved the highest overall accuracy in identifying land-cover point clouds among the models, especially when compared to an echo-based classifier. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This allows, for the first time, the acquisition of spaceborne polarimetric synthetic aperture radar interferometry (Pol-InSAR) data without the disturbing effect of temporal decorrelation. This paper aims to assess the potential of such data for forest applications. For this, single- and dual-pol data acquired over a boreal, a temperate, and a tropical site were investigated to characterize X-band penetration and polarization diversity of the interferometric coherence measurements. Pol-InSAR forest height inversion schemes have been proposed and implemented for the singleand dual-pol cases and cross validated against LIDAR reference measurements for all sites. The single-pol inversion relies on an external ground digital terrain model (DTM) and performed well for all sites with correlation coefficients r2 between 0.80 and 0.98. The dual-pol inversion does not require an external DTM but depends on the visibility of the whole forest layer. Accordingly, its performance varied with forest structure and season: The best performance was achieved for the summer acquisition of the boreal test site (r2 = 0.86) and for the winter acquisition of the temperate test site (r2 = 0.77). For the tropical test site, only a weak correlation (r2 = ~0.50) could be established.	coefficient;decorrelation;digital elevation model;polarimetry;polarization (waves);synthetic data	Florian Kugler;Daniel Schulze;Irena Hajnsek;Hans Pretzsch;Konstantinos P.

Although DEM (Digital Elevation Model) is an important feature for landslide recognition, it's difficult to obtain the high-resolution DEM in study areas in practical application. In order to analyze the impact of DEM resolution on landslide extraction and to determine the resolution to the meet application requirements, we resample the DEM data into five groups on different spatial resolution and then adopt the object-oriented method to extract the landslides information to combine with high-resolution images. The experimental results show that, when the DEM resolution is greater than 30 meters, we can obtain better recognition and classification results for the landslide with area greater than 5000m2. When the resolution is less than 30 meters, it is difficult to distinguish between landslide types, but by adjusting parameter values we can still achieve the detection of landslides. This research has certain guiding significance and reference value for the selection of DEM spatial resolution on the landslides information extraction.	digital elevation model;hazard analysis;image resolution;information extraction;requirement	Qihao Chen;Xiuguo Liu;Chen Liu;Rui Ji	2013	2013 Ninth International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC)	10.1109/ICNC.2013.6818111	computer vision;geography;hydrology;remote sensing	EDA	76.71618954825426	-58.2290131842104	180700

0dced9caca220202fa35f8ebaf780ad7d67644a0	mad: robust image texture analysis for applications in high resolution geomorphometry	geomorphometry;geostatistics;surface texture;image texture;variogram;roughness	The analysis of surface textures plays an important role in the geomorphometric analysis of high-resolution digital terrain models. Surface textures can be analyzed by means of geostatistical variogram-based indices. The use of variogram-based indices is promising because of their ability to consider the multiscale and anisotropic character of morphometric data. However, similar to other variance-type statistics, variogram-based indices are sensitive to the presence of hotspots and non-stationary data. Consequently, we present a multi-scale and directional image texture analysis operator (MAD or Median Absolute Differences) derived from a modification of a variogram estimator. MAD has been specifically developed to improve the robustness of variogram-based surface indices with a special focus on strongly non-stationary and often noisy spatial data representing solid earth surface morphology. Although the operator has been specifically developed for the analysis of high-resolution digital terrain models, it can be applied to the texture analysis of any type of image. Consequently MAD could be of interest in the broader context of remote sensing as well as for all disciplines for which image texture analysis is relevant. The theoretical presentation of the surface texture operator is accompanied by a working software prototype. The software prototype has been implemented in the Python scripting language for use in ArcGIS (ESRI) using its Spatial Analyst functions. The prototype architecture is concise and can be easily coded in different software environments, such as GIS mapping and image analysis software. The software prototype proposed has been developed to facilitate the development of ad hoc surface texture indices capable of adapting to the special needs of the study at hand. The MAD operator represents an improvement over variogram-based surface texture indices, offering a robust description of relevant aspects of surface texture, including surface roughness.	image resolution;image texture;mad	S.

Prior studies have used visible/shortwave infrared imaging spectroscopy to map surface exposures of deposits from satellite and airborne platforms and image cores in the laboratory. Here, we work at an intermediate, outcrop-scale, testing the ability of field-based imaging spectroscopy to identify oil shale strata and characterize the depositional environments that led to enrichment of organic matter in sedimentary rocks within the Green River Formation, Utah, USA. The oil shale layers as well as carbonates, phyllosilicates, gypsum, hydrated silica, and ferric oxides are identified in discrete lithologic units and successfully mapped in the images, showing a transition from siliciclastic to carbonate- and organic-rich rocks consistent with previous stratigraphic studies conducted with geological fieldwork.	airborne ranger;field research;gene ontology term enrichment	Rebecca N.

It has capabilities similar to sensors currently operating on low earth orbiting weather satellites but is intended for deployment in geostationary orbit - where it will complement future infrared sounders and enable all-weather temperature and humidity soundings and rain mapping. The required spatial resolution of 50 km or better dictates an aperture of 4 meters or more at a sounding frequency of 50 GHz, which is difficult to achieve with a real aperture system - this is the reason why it has until now not been possible to put a microwave sounder on a geostationary platform, GeoSTAR is instead based on a synthetic aperture imaging approach. Among the advantages of such a system are that there are no moving parts, and the size of the aperture is easily expandable to meet future needs.

Some of this required information can be obtained through the analysis of remotely sensed data. Image segmentation is often one of the first steps of this analysis. This paper focuses on two particular types of segmentation: region-based and edge-based segmentations. Each approach is affected differently by various factors, and both types of segmentations may be improved by taking advantage of their complementary nature. Included among region-based segmentation approaches are region growing methods, which produce hierarchical segmentations of images from finer to coarser resolution. In this hierarchy, an ideal segmentation (ideal for a given application) does not always correspond to one single iteration, but map correspond to several different iterations. This, among other factors, makes it somewhat difficult to choose a stopping criterion for region growing methods. To find the ideal segmentation, the authors develop a stopping criterion for their Iterative Parallel Region Growing (IPRG) algorithm using additional information from edge features, and the Hausdorff distance metric. They integrate information from regions and edges at the symbol level, taking advantage of the hierarchical structure of the region segmentation results. Also, to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in processing the massive amount of data that will be generated by future Earth remote sensing missions, such as the Earth Observing System (EOS), all the different steps of this algorithm have been implemented on a massively parallel processor. >	image segmentation	Jacqueline Le Moigne;James C.

40ab215a82e7ba742619e75af65b2ea41c021a90	comparison and integration of feature reduction methods for land cover classification with rapideye imagery		Feature reduction (FR) methods can effectively reduce the feature set and improve the accuracy for land cover classification (LCC) using high resolution remote sensing data with high dimensional or strongly correlated feature sets. However, FR methods have rarely been applied for LCC in arid regions with complex geographic environments, especially for the integration of feature selection (FS) and feature extraction (FE) methods. This study investigated the comparison and integration of FR methods for LCC in part of Dunhuang Basin, northwestern China, which is a typical inland arid region and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. Five spectral bands and 9 vegetation indices features that derived from RapidEye satellite imagery were used with support vector machines algorithm. Two wrapper FS methods, based on random forest algorithm (varSelRF and Boruta packages in R software), were used. Three FE methods (principal component analysis, PCA; independent component analysis, ICA; and minimum noise fraction transformation, MNF), were employed to extract a reduced number of reconstructed new features. Integration of varSelRF and PCA methods (varSelRF-PCA) was attempted. All 14 features were relevant, indicated by Boruta method; only 6 features, including the red-edge band selected by the varSelRF module, had higher importance. All the five FR methods could improve classification accuracy, but only varSelRF achieved significant improvement. The varSelRF outperformed the FE methods, followed by MNF, PCA, and ICA. The proposed varSelRF-PCA model significantly improved classification accuracy and outperformed all the FS or FE methods.	arid;algorithm;ecosystem;feature extraction;feature selection;image resolution;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;principal component analysis;random forest;support vector machine	Xianju Li;Weitao Chen;Xinwen Cheng;Yiwei Liao;Gang Chen	2016	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-016-4311-4	data mining	ML	80.52228072941992	-56.943382253485936	181348

No-local nor no-global but a half-connectivity has been used for defining a robust 3D similarity measure. The method presented has been successfully tested in our lab over range data in a wide variety of shapes. Consequently, extended research on 3D objects clustering will be accomplished in the near future.

These are: (1) the increasing presence of the invasive Africanized Honey Bee (AHB); and (2) the spread of pests and diseases within managed European Honey Bee (EHB) populations that cause major loss of colonies (of which Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is the most recent). The primary objective of this research is to improve prediction of the equilibrium range of both the AHB and EHB within the U.S, and to determine the impact of both urbanization and climate change on this equilibrium range.

Closer to the coast however, the quality of these data degrades as a result of the loading of sediments and dissolved matter from terrestrial runoff, the influences of land reflection on atmospheric correction and sea-bottom reflection, which compromise their use in coastal management actions. Recently, the enabling of citizens to provide environmental observations has gained recognition as a way for enhancing the spatio-temporal coverage of satellite observations. In the FP7 funded EU project “Citclops” (Citizens’ observatory for coast and ocean optical monitoring), a smart phone app for the classification of water colour, simplified to 21 hues of the Forel Ule (FU) scale, is developed.#R##N##R##N#In this study we examine two bays in the Ebro Delta (NW Mediterranean) where satellite data, hyperspectral measurements, and observations with the citizen tool for colour comparison were available. FU values and their corresponding novel colorimetric parameter, the hue colour angle, were derived in the bay at 12 stations with the traditional FU scale and one automated in-situ radiometric system at the Alfacs Bay aquaculture site. Both methods complied well during the study course of May–June 2011. These measurements were further compared to data from Full Resolution MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) satellite images. The quality of the retrieved hue angle varies over the image. For high-quality sites, MERIS hue colour angles and FU values gave a good estimate of seasonal algal dynamics in the bays over the year 2011, while ground measurements revealed colour changes over short space- and time frames, which are indicative of the fast dynamics of phytoplankton in the area that could not be fully resolved with MERIS data.#R##N##R##N#The use of FU values and hue colour angle of water will allow a simple integration of data from hyperspectral measurements, MERIS multispectral observations and citizens observations with the (Citclops/EyeOnWater) water colour app. Such observational data can be included to local monitoring efforts, and can also foster an increased interest of the general public to local environmental management and governance issues.	netware	Julia A.

The epicenter has been located at about 130 km east of Sendai City at a depth of about 32 km. A foreshock sequence took place days preceding the mainshock with magnitude 7.3 in March 9. The earthquake has been followed by a devastating tsunami. The location, the geometric parameters, and the focal mechanism are in agreement with the occurrence of the earthquake along the subduction plate boundary. The focal region from seismological analysis indicated that an area of about 500 km × 200 km moved with a maximum displacement of about 24 m near the hypocenter. The Earth Observation Community has made a strong effort to investigate the surface effects by exploiting the satellite data and the geodetic GPS measurements available. The Group on Earth Observation Geohazard Supersites established the Tohoku-Oki Event Supersite. This initiative provided a huge amount of satellite data to the scientific community. The main outcomes concern the measurement of the surface displacement pattern, the detection of surface changes due to damage, and the investigation of coastal changes due to inundation.	displacement mapping;earthquake network;focal (programming language);geodetic datum;global positioning system;open knowledge initiative;photographic plate;stunt island	Salvatore Stramondo	2013	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2013.2240651	geophysics;seismology;geology;tsunami earthquake;tectonics;remote sensing	Robotics	81.47392719976379	-60.957479518874145	181626

This is especially the case for spatiotemporal ST land use/land cover change LUCC research. In addition to greater variety, for example, from sensing platforms, big data offer datasets at higher spatial and temporal resolutions; these new offerings require new methods to optimize data handling and analysis. We propose a LUCC-based geospatial cyberinfrastructure GCI that optimizes big data handling and analysis, in this case with raster data. The GCI provides three levels of optimization. First, we employ spatial optimization with graph-based image segmentation. Second, we propose ST Atom Model to temporally optimize the image segments for LUCC. At last, the first two domain ST optimizations are supported by the computational optimization for big data analysis. The evaluation is conducted using DMTI DMTI Spatial Inc. Satellite StreetView imagery datasets acquired for the Greater Montreal area, Canada in 2006, 2009, and 2012 534 GB, 60 cm spatial resolution, RGB image.

The traditional approach is to verify each satellite individually. It is difficult to directly compare the difference in their accuracy. In order to evaluate geometric accuracy for multiple satellite images based on the same ground control benchmark, a reliable test field in Xianning (China) was utilized for geometric accuracy validation of HRSIs. Our research team has obtained multiple HRSIs in the Xianning test field, such as SPOT-6, Pleaides, ALOS, ZY-3 and TH-1. In addition, ground control points (GCPs) were acquired with GPS by field surveying, which were used to select the significant feature area on the images. We assess the orientation accuracy of the HRSIs with the single image and stereo models. Within this study, the geometrical performance of multiple HRSIs was analyzed in detail, and the results of orientation are shown and discussed. As a result, it is feasible and necessary to establish such a geometric verification field to evaluate the geometric quality of multiple HRSIs.	autostereogram;benchmark (computing);conceptualization (information science);geology;global positioning system;gray platelet syndrome;image resolution;information engineering;key;natural science disciplines;open research;program development;programmer;simulation;verification and validation;verification of theories;verifying specimen;sensor (device)	Xiongwei Zheng;Qi Huang;Jingjing Wang;Taoyang Wang;Guo Yong Zhang	2018		10.3390/s18072121	engineering;computer vision;satellite;electronic engineering;artificial intelligence	HCI	74.71581089139278	-56.760070578844555	181975
9985d5ed7ab228244a369c166292e3a39e83d4ac	classifying wetland vegetation type from modis ndvi time series using fourier analysis		On the basis of multi-temporal MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data, this paper used a kind of supervised classification method to extract wetlands distribution of Sanjiang Plain. The NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) time series data were got from 16-day MODIS data after processing by Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS). The shape of NDVI time series, which is diagnostic for certain vegetation phenology, was our primary classifier. A similarity measure based directly on the components of the Discrete Fourier Transform which introduced by J.P. Evans was used to determine a pixels class membership. Based on the difference between vegetation phenology, seven kinds of vegetation had been classified: swamp, meadow swamp, bottomland, paddy field, dry land, bush and woodland. The spatial distribution of natural wetland (swamp, meadow swamp, open water) and manpower wetland (paddy field) were extracted. Validation shows that total classification accuracy is 79.67%, Kappa coefficient is 0.7525. Results indicated that this Fourier component similarity measure produced an objective, computationally inexpensive and rapid method of wetlands classification.	fourier analysis;time series	Xiaodong Na;Shuying Zang	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23214-5_9	enhanced vegetation index;hydrology;soil science;remote sensing	PL	80.66110367946838	-55.102814277636114	181986

The site has significant topographic relief and high biomass in this temperate coastal rainforest. Our emphasis was on integration and fusion techniques of polarimetric SAR, hyperspectral and LIDAR data for useful forest information extraction. The polarimetric SAR techniques and analysis methods studied in this project drew on the work of other researchers. The Jong-Sen Lee algorithm for polarization compensation for terrain azimuth slope variations was implemented and tested. The Shane Cloude decomposition method, with basic types of scattering analysis for reducing sensitivity to topography effects was examined and applied. In this study, the hyperspectral data was used for providing high spectral resolution information, such as major forest species and land-cover characterization, and the LIDAR data were utilized to generate information related to vertical structure of both the underlying topography and the forest structure. The combination of these data sources and techniques provided an opportunity to examine the potential capabilities of polarimetric SAR and the synergy of the fused data for forest classification.	columbia (supercomputer);google summer of code;information extraction;l band;lee algorithm;polarimetry;polarization (waves);synergy;the forest;topography	David G.

However, little is known concerning the level of rodent hazard, spatial distribution and regularity of outbreak. This paper approached to use high-resolution imagery (TDOM and DEM) provided by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for rodent pests monitoring in desert forest. The distribution of rat-holes was extracted from TDOM images, then rat-hole density were calculated for evaluating the rodent hazard degree in the study area. Lastly, topographic factors of slope gradient, slope aspect, elevation were calculated using DEM. Spatial and statistical analysis methods were used for it. The results demonstrated that Rhombimys opimus mainly distributed in the elevation of 432.5~437.5m, low slope areas of 0~15°, low RDLS of 0~0.25m, and shady slope of fixed and semi-fixed sand with well-growth plants by “island” mousehole groups. This paper validated the availability of UAV technique for dynamic monitoring rodent pests in desert forest, and laid a critical foundation for further study.	aerial photography;gradient descent;image resolution;semiconductor industry;topography;unmanned aerial vehicle	Amin Wen;Jianghua Zheng;Meng Chen;Chen Mu;Ma Tao	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729463	hazard;distribution function;graphical model;remote sensing	Robotics	81.89596936681345	-56.0858037616049	182735

8564774609b0b97e3757422e57ba77fbfa2169bf	landslide identification and monitoring along the jinsha river catchment (wudongde reservoir area), china, using the insar method		Landslide identification and monitoring are two significant research aspects for landslide analysis. In addition, landslide mode deduction is key for the prevention of landslide hazards. Surface deformation results with different scales can serve for different landslide analysis. L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data calculated with Interferometric Point Target Analysis (IPTA) are first employed to detect potential landslides at the catchment-scale Wudongde reservoir area. Twenty-two active landslides are identified and mapped over more than 2500 square kilometers. Then, for one typical landslide, Jinpingzi landslide, its spatiotemporal deformation characteristics are analyzed with the small baseline subsets (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique. High-precision surface deformation results are obtained by comparing with in-situ georobot measurements. The spatial deformation pattern reveals the different stabilities among five different sections of Jinpingzi landslide. InSAR results for Section II of Jinpingzi landslide show that this active landslide is controlled by two boundaries and geological structure, and its different landslide deformation magnitudes at different sections on the surface companying with borehole deformation reveals the pull-type landslide mode. Correlation between time series landslide motion and monthly precipitation, soil moisture inverted from SAR intensity images and water level fluctuations suggests that heavy rainfall is the main trigger factor, and the maximum deformation of the landslide was highly consistent with the peak precipitation with a time lag of about 1 to 2 months, which gives us important guidelines to mitigate and prevent this kind of hazard.	aperture (software);baseline (configuration management);emoticon;experiment;gnss augmentation;l band;line-of-sight (missile);map;natural deduction;synthetic data;time series	Chaoying Zhao;Ya Kang;Qin Zhang;Zhong Lu;Bin Li	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10070993	geology;remote sensing;geomorphology;china;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;landslide;drainage basin	Vision	82.40191130470275	-59.59512050751438	183301
cff32e947269e1d7efa75fc04aa81afd265fc1a3	towards multi-frequency soil moisture retrieval using p- and l-band passive microwave sensing technology		A fundamental limitation of current soil moisture remote sensing technology is that can only provide moisture information on the top 5 cm layer of soil at most, being one-tenth to one-quarter of the wavelength (21 cm at L-band; 1.4 GHz) using the current SMAP and SMOS soil moisture dedicated missions of NASA and ESA. Consequently, we have developed an airborne passive microwave sensing capability at P-band to develop a new state-of-the-art satellite concept that will provide soil moisture data for the top 10 cm layer of soil using radiometer observations at P-band (40 cm; 750 MHz). Not only would P-band provide soil moisture information on a soil layer thickness that more closely relates to that affecting crop and pasture growth, but it is expected to produce greater spatial coverage with improved accuracy to that from L-band. This is because P-band should be less affected by surface roughness conditions and have a reduced attenuation by the overlaying vegetation. This paper describes a series of small airborne field experiments at P-band, and presents some early results of P-band passive microwave observations in comparison with L-band and K-band passive microwave from initial trial flights.	airborne ranger;esa;experiment;l band;microwave;thickness (graph theory)	Nan Ye;Xiaoling Wu;Jeffrey P.

The proposed least average residual algorithm (LARA) performs a constrained search for matching ice floes by determining an appropriate search space for each floe to be tracked. LARA takes a stepwise approach with suitable decision rules at various stages. It takes into account various distinguishing characteristics such as: i) the geometry of the ice field; ii) size of an ice floe; and iii) geometry of the floe.

We extend the work done in multiresolution analysis using Wavelets for astronomical 2D images to 3D spectroscopic cubes, combining the results with the Dendrograms approach to offer a hierarchical representation of connections between sources at different scale levels. We test our approach in real data from the ALMA observatory, exploring different Wavelet families and assessing the main parameter for source identification (i.e., RMS) at each level. Our approach shows that is feasible to perform multiresolution analysis for the spatial and frequency domains simultaneously rather than analyzing each spectral channel independently.	aaa (video game industry);ada;algorithm;approximation;basal (phylogenetics);bus bunching;coefficient;cubes;dendrogram;discrete wavelet transform;ground truth;haar wavelet;heuristic;multiresolution analysis;olap cube;pattern recognition;standard widget toolkit;synthetic data	Martín Villanueva;Mauricio Araya	2017	CoRR	10.1049/cp.2017.0145	observatory;wavelet;sextant (astronomical);artificial intelligence;cube;continuous wavelet transform;pattern recognition;discrete wavelet transform;multiresolution analysis;computer science;harmonic wavelet transform	SE	69.78910170704147	-61.064946351230034	183420
4e2317e38aa647d789c87e36a056b3e2c65c539f	a new urban index for expressing inner-city patterns based on modis lst and evi regulated dmsp/ols ntl		With the rapid pace of urban expansion, comprehensively understanding urban spatial patterns, built environments, green-spaces distributions, demographic distributions, and economic activities becomes more meaningful. Night Time Lights (NTL) images acquired through the Operational Linescan System of the US Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP/OLS NTL) have long been utilized to monitor urban areas and their expansion characteristics since this system detects variation in NTL emissions. However, the pixel saturation phenomenon leads to a serious limitation in mapping luminance variations in urban zones with nighttime illumination levels that approach or exceed the pixel saturation limits of OLS sensors. Consequently, we propose an NTL-based city index that utilizes the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) images to regulate and compensate for desaturation on NTL images acquired from corresponding urban areas. The regulated results achieve good performance in differentiating central business districts (CBDs), airports, and urban green spaces. Consequently, these derived imageries could effectively convey the structural details of urban cores. In addition, compared with the Vegetation Adjusted NTL Urban Index (VANUI), LST-and-EVI-regulated-NTL-city index (LERNCI) reveals superior capability in delineating the spatial structures of selected metropolis areas across the world, especially in the large cities of developing countries. The currently available results indicate that LERNCI corresponds better to city spatial patterns. Moreover, LERNCI displays a remarkably better “goodness-of-fit” correspondence with both the Version 1 Nighttime Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band Composite (NPP/VIIRS DNB) data and the WorldPop population-density data compared with the VANUI imageries. Thus, LERNCI can act as a helpful indicator for differentiating and classifying regional economic activities, population aggregations, and energy-consumption and city-expansion patterns. LERNCI can also serve as a valuable auxiliary reference for decision-making processes that concern subjects such as urban planning and easing the central functions of metropolis.	centrality;control theory;interference (communication);ntl;ordinary least squares;pixel;sensor;sparse matrix	Yangxiaoyue Liu;Yaping Yang;Wenlong Jing;Ling Yao;Xiafang Yue;Xiaodan Zhao	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9080777	defense meteorological satellite program;geology;vegetation;remote sensing;spatial ecology;visible infrared imaging radiometer suite;spectroradiometer;enhanced vegetation index;population;urban planning	HCI	82.32584215626085	-56.15380447305198	183483

This work used a database of spectra acquired from field campaigns together with wet chemistry estimates of biochemicals including lignin and cellulose, and near infrared spectroscopy estimates of crude protein from coincident field samples. The spectra were grouped in a matrix based on species composition, phenology, greenness and time of acquisition. Absorption features derived from first derivative transforms and continuum removal for known spectral bands showed some predictive potential for crude protein and cellulose. Predictive potential was enhanced if analysis was restricted to green grass-clover pasture samples. The methods require further refinement and testing before they are ported to analysis of airborne and satellite hyperspectral imagery.	airborne ranger;refinement (computing);triune continuum paradigm	Susanne Thulin;Michael J.

The goal of this study is to improve the understanding of the L-band radar backscatter processes over boreal landscapes by comparing ALOS PALSAR high resolution L-band backscatter images with Ku-band backscatter from the SeaWinds QuikSCAT scatterometer and C-, X- and Ka-band brightness temperatures from the Aqua AMSR-E radiometer. The results show that landscape elements driving the L-band backscatter are different from those at higher (Ku-band) frequencies and establishment of an optimal validation strategy for SMAP requires investigation of L-band measurements at spatial scales and temporal fidelity commensurate with landscape freeze/thaw variability.	aqua;image resolution;ka band;ku band;l band;microwave;spatial scale;spatial variability	Andreas Colliander;Kyle McDonald;Reiner Zimmermann;Erika Podest;Ronny Schroeder;John S.

This is linked to SAR system design issues, and, without getting into the technical details deserving by themselves a full paper, we can just mention the swath characteristics of ALOS PALSAR (the Advanced Land Observing Satellite, Phased Array L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), reducing from 70 km for the dual-pol mode to 30 km for the full polarization mode. The reduced coverage in the full polarization mode has a harmful impact on the revisit time, which is always a major drive for the Earth-observing community. The options chosen up to now for dual-pol system designs (or single-polarization on-transmit) rely on a linear polarization on-transmit [either horizontal (H) or vertical (V)], with two orthogonal polarizations on-receive. Souyris and Raney in earlier papers proposed more pertinent alternatives for the selection of the transmit polarization leading to a better characterization of the scattering mechanisms. In this paper, the analysis is pursued in more depth by including the effect of the ionosphere on the wave propagation and extending the applications to polarimetric interferometry SAR (PolInSAR). A compact mode is developed where the transmit polarization is circular, whereas the only constraint on the two receiving polarizations is independence. Indeed, the choice of the polarizations of the two receive channels does not matter, as any polarization on-receive can be synthesized from these two measurements. This is, however, not the case for the unique transmit polarization. At a low frequency, where the ionosphere has a significant effect, the circular transmit polarization is the only sensible option, as it provides an effective constant polarization as seen by the scattering surface. This is an essential condition for a meaningful multitemporal analysis. Both the polarimetric SAR applications and the PolInSAR applications in the context of this compact polarimetry (CP) mode are explored. A pseudocovariance matrix can be reconstructed following Souyris' proposed approach for distributed targets and is shown to be very similar to the full polarimetric (FP) covariance matrix. The reconstruction of the cross-polarized Sigma0 is shown to be reliable and to have very low sensitivity to Faraday rotation. A PolInSAR vegetation height inversion for P-band is presented and applied to the CP data with a level of performance that is similar to the one derived from FP (a 1.2-m root-mean-square height error on the ONERA Airborne radar (RAMSES) data over the Landes Forest). A procedure is developed to correct for the ionospheric effects for the PolInSAR acquisition in the FP or CP mode and is assessed on the data simulated from an airborne acquisition. The results demonstrate that the technique is efficient and robust. The calibration of CP data is identified as an important challenge to be solved, and some clues are provided to address the problem.	airborne ranger;aperture (software);faraday cage;faraday effect;holographic interferometry;l band;linear polarization;onera;phased array;polarimetry;polarization (waves);relevance;robustness (computer science);software propagation;synthetic data;systems design	Pascale Dubois-Fernandez;Jean-Claude Souyris;Sébastien Angélliaume;Franck Garestier	2008	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2008.919143	geodesy;performance;polarization;optics;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	79.1039859086357	-65.84296931513126	184236

Due to the harsh and dangerous conditions of such envir onments, it would be advantageous to deploy a group of autonomous, mobile weathe r sensors, rather than accepting the expense and risk of human presence. For such a s ensor network to be viable, a method of navigating, and thus a method of terrai n assessment, must be developed that is tailored for arctic hazards. An extension to a previous arctic terrain assessment method is presented, which is able to produce den s terrain slope estimates from a single camera. To validate this methodology, a s et of prototype arctic rovers have been designed, constructed, and fielded on a glac ier in Alaska.	autonomous robot;prototype;sensor;terrain rendering	Stephen Williams;Ayanna M.

Whale depredation has resulted in great economic loss for the fishing industry and at the same time raise the chances of serious injury to predators by longline gear. Several reports on the instances of whale predation in the immediate commercial fishing area suggest that whales are attracted to certain vessels. It is postulated that the whales are attracted to certain sounds that are associated with longline fishing activity. Using available hydroacoustic technology, The author would collect and analyze passive acoustic data during instances of killer whale predation on longline gear to determine if there are persistent acoustic phenomena that are present during killer whale depredation. This information would then be used to develop strategies that would prevent whale predation on longline gear.	acoustic cryptanalysis	Alex B. Kulinchenko;Patrick K. Simpson;C.

a9a805879dc2762676f59e5ac057aaa48ee5b432	spectral characterization and smile correction for the imaging spectroscopy mission enmap		The high-resolution imaging spectroscopy remote sensing mission EnMAP (Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program, enmap.org) will cover the spectral range from 420 nm to 2450 nm with a spectral sampling distance varying between 5 nm and 12 nm. A smile effect, which is a spectral shift across the swath, of at most 0.2 pixels is expected. The OHB System AG realizes the satellite with the hyperspectral push-broom imager and the on-board characterization equipment including a doped sphere for spectral calibration. The Earth Observation Center (EOC) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) is responsible for the operational in-flight calibration and realizes the fully-automatic on-ground processors including methods for smile correction. A smile correction taking the spectral calibration into account as well as a simplified atmospheric compensation will be analyzed.	central processing unit;doping (semiconductor);dynamic language runtime;image resolution;image sensor;on-board data handling;pixel;redshift;sampling (signal processing)	Tobias Storch;Hans-Peter Honold;Harald Krawczyk;Richard Wachter;Raquel de los Reyes;Maximilian Langheinrich;Martin Miicke;Sebastian Fischer	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517573	spectroscopy;pixel;remote sensing;computer science;imaging spectroscopy;enmap;hyperspectral imaging	Embedded	81.42391430526136	-63.14540882222022	184665
267a7d25981e7bd183702c62ea6e3133b19bc2f0	scatterer detection in urban environment using persistent scatterer interferometry and sar tomography		In the last decade, Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and SAR tomography (TomoSAR) have been used for reconstructing the elevation profile of a scene, starting from a set of co-registered Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The possible advantage of TomoSAR over classical interferometric methods consists in the potential capability of improving the detection of single scatterers presenting stable proprieties over time (Persistent Scatterers or PS), as well as to enable the detection of multiple scatterers interfering within the same range-azimuth resolution cell. In urban environment, when only single dominant scatterers are present in each range-azimuth resolution cell, both methods can be exploited to estimate the altitude, deformation rate and thermal expansion of a subset of reliable scatterers, which are selected on the basis of different criteria. This paper is focused on a performance analysis of the two class of methods, using the results obtained in urban environment on simulated and real TerraSAR-X data. A concise description of both techniques, along with a discussion on their potential capabilities in selecting the most reliable scatterers, is given.	aperture (software);tomography	Alessandra Budillon;Michele Crosetto;Giampaolo Ferraioli;Angel Caroline Johnsy;Oriol Monserrat;Gilda Schirinzi	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128383	artificial intelligence;remote sensing;computer vision;elevation;computer science;synthetic aperture radar;tomography;interferometry;altitude	Robotics	78.41742904116903	-65.86960656336528	185082

The Delay/Doppler technique aims at reducing the measurement noise and increasing the along-track resolution in comparison with conventional pulse limited altimetry. A new semi-analytical model with five parameters has been recently introduced for this new technology. However, two of these parameters are highly correlated resulting in bad estimation performance when estimating all parameters. This paper proposes a new strategy improving estimation performance for delay/Doppler altimetry. The proposed strategy exploits all the information contained in the delay/Doppler domain. A comparison with other classical algorithms (using the temporal samples only) allows to appreciate the gain in estimation performance obtained when using both temporal and Doppler data.	algorithm;semiconductor industry	Abderrahim Halimi;Corinne Mailhes;Jean-Yves Tourneret;Thomas Moreau;Francois Boy	2014	2014 22nd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		geography;geodesy;telecommunications;remote sensing	EDA	78.35048863576559	-65.80899722294254	185380

The techniques to recover a good image from the contaminated one are called image destriping (for stripes) and image inpainting (for dead pixels). This paper presents a maximum a posteriori (MAP)-based algorithm for both destriping and inpainting problems. The main advantage of this algorithm is that it can constrain the solution space according to a priori knowledge during the destriping and inpainting processes. In the MAP framework, the likelihood probability density function (PDF) is constructed based on a linear image observation model, and a robust Huber-Markov model is used as the prior PDF. The gradient descent optimization method is employed to produce the desired image. The proposed algorithm has been tested using moderate resolution imaging spectrometer images for destriping and China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite and QuickBird images for simulated inpainting. The experiment results and quantitative analyses verify the efficacy of this algorithm.	algorithm;aqua;data striping;defective pixel;experiment;feasible region;gradient descent;hidden markov model;histogram matching;image quality;inpainting;low-pass filter;machine-readable dictionary;markov chain;mathematical optimization;noise reduction;portable document format;stripes	Huanfeng Shen;Liangpei Zhang	2009	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2008.2005780	gradient descent;computer vision;probability density function;far east;image resolution;spectroscopy;image processing;quantitative analysis;noise;digital image processing;chine;earth;markov model;imaging spectrometer;china;physics;pixel;statistics;robustness;remote sensing;inpainting	Vision	68.42912046882185	-64.91628266562448	185496

The Level 1 product is the geolocated and radiometrically calibrated top-of-the-atmosphere solar reflectance. The absolute radiometric uncertainty associated with this product includes contributions from the noise associated with measured detector digital counts and the radiometric calibration bias.

However, the entire process is still not defined in sufficient detail and relatively few automated tools are available. Moreover, the existing tools are primarily designed for generalization of topographic maps and do not address the needs specific to geology. Here we present two case studies describing our approach to the generalization of surficial and bedrock geology maps, respectively. To accomplish the task, we employed the GeoScaler software developed at the Laboratoire de cartographie numerique et de photogrammetrie (LCNP) of the Quebec division of the Geological Survey of Canada (Version 2009). The software is free over the Internet but requires an ArcGIS (ArcInfo) license. Four surficial geology maps at 1:250,000 scale were produced from 14 maps scaled at 1:100,000, while a single compilation of six bedrock maps was generalized from 1:125,000 to 1:500,000 scale. We describe the general considerations required to approach any generalization exercise, applied software, objectives, input data, major generalization steps, and the final results. All generalized maps were favorably evaluated by experts in geological mapping and the surficial maps have been published.		Alex Smirnoff;Gabriel Huot-Vézina;Serge J.

Detailed analysis of images of rail surfaces is used to observe the condition of rails  and, as a precaution, to avoid rail breaks and further damage. Single rails are observed by a color line scan camera at high  resolution of approximately 0.2 millimeters and under special illumination in order to enable 21/2D image analysis. Gabor filter banks are used for 2D texture description and classes are modeled by Gaussian mixtures. A Bayesian  classifier, which also incorporates background knowledge, is used to differentiate between surface texture classes. Classes  which can be related to surface disruptions are derived from the analysis of the anti-correlation properties between two color  channels. Images are illuminated by two light sources mounted at different position and operating at different wavelengths.  Results for data gathered in the Vienna metro system are presented.

To extract damaged areas automatically, it is essential to understand the relationships among the sensor specifications, acquisition conditions, and land cover. Our previous studies developed a method for estimating the phase noise of interferograms using several pairs of TerraSAR-X series (TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X) datasets. Atmospheric disturbance data are also necessary to interpret the interferograms; therefore, the purpose of this study is to estimate the atmospheric effects by focusing on the difference in digital elevation model (DEM) errors between repeat-pass (two interferometric SAR images acquired at different times) and single-pass (two interferometric SAR images acquired simultaneously) interferometry. Single-pass DEM errors are reduced due to the lack of temporal decorrelation and atmospheric disturbances. At a study site in the city of Tsukuba, a quantitative analysis of DEM errors at fixed ground objects shows that the atmospheric effects are estimated to contribute 75% to 80% of the total phase noise in interferograms.	aperture (software);decorrelation;digital elevation model;eighty;epilepsy, temporal lobe;estimated;interferometry;phase noise;physical object;specification;synthetic data	Takashi Nonaka;Tomohito Asaka;Keishi Iwashita	2018		10.3390/s18072336	electronic engineering;geodesy;engineering	Visualization	80.3780364830273	-63.95939427833228	185931

The main idea of the proposed fusion approach is to take full advantage of both data sets in building height retrieval. The proposed approach includes two main stages. First, initial building height estimates are extracted from WorldView-2 stereo images and multitemporal SAR images. These initial results are then combined using a novel object-based fusion approach, in which the heights of points for the same building footprint are retrieved and integrated. Experiments on the Mong Kok area of Hong Kong showed that the proposed approach using both data sets outperforms the use of either stereo images or SAR images alone. According to the results of the proposed approach, the average absolute height retrieval error is 6.53 m, which is much lower than using stereo and SAR images (9.08 and 12.24 m, respectively). The proposed fusion approach is suitable for building height retrieval in urban areas where single satellite data have limitations.	aperture (software);experiment;image resolution;object-based language;synthetic data	Yong Xu;Peifeng Ma;Edward Ng;Hui Lin	2015	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2015.2427738	lidar;computer vision;synthetic aperture radar;geology;optical imaging;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;physics;remote sensing	Vision	76.28226042161455	-59.45543309586796	185994

Such huge datasets must be analyzed by efficient yet accurate algorithms. A supervised automatic classification method (hereafter called """"wavanglet"""") is proposed to identify spectral features and classify images in spectrally homogeneous units. It uses four steps: (1) selection of a library composed of reference spectra; (2) application of a Daubechies wavelet transform to referenced spectra and determination of the wavelet subspace that best separates all referenced spectra; and (3) in this selected subspace, determination of the best threshold on the spectral angle to produce detection masks. This application is focused on the Martian polar regions that present three main types of terrains: H2O ice, CO2 ice, and dust. The wavanglet method is implemented to detect these major compounds on near-infrared hyperspectral images acquired by the OMEGA instrument onboard the Mars Express spacecraft. With an overall accuracy of 89%, wavanglet outperforms two generic methods: band ratio (57% accuracy) and spectral feature fitting (83% accuracy).

Up to now the only remote sensing system capable of providing information on two dimensional sea state on a global and continuous scale and under all weather conditions is the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). In the scope of the project Wave Atlas, ESA provided a two years wave-mode dataset of ERS-2 SAR raw data, mainly collected during 1999 and 2000, which was reprocessed to single-look- complex imagettes at DLR using the BSAR processor. In this study the data were used for a statistical evaluation resulting in global ocean maps of different basic image parameters and oceanic parameters like wind speed, significant wave height, mean period and their respective regional and temporal variability during the seasons of the year using the empirical algorithms CWIND1.0 and CWAVE1.0. Global statistics are given for the time frame of 1998 to 2000 and examples of severe storms are analysed in detail. In future, the reprocessing of wavemode data is planned to be extended to the full lifetime of ERS-1 and ERS-2, which is at least 1991-2006.

This tourist village, lying not far from Punta delle Pietre Nere, the only outcrop of magmatic rock in the Mediterranean basin, sits on a diapir made of Triassic gypsum, mantled by Quaternary sandy deposits. The cutting of the artificial Acquarotta canal in 1930, connecting the nearby Lesina lagoon to the Mediterranean Sea, exposed this grey micro and meso-crystalline gypsum with intercalations of black limestones and marls. This event is a likely cause for the formation of dissolutional conduits and cavities, found in the area, leading to the formation of the sinkholes which have been plaguing the site in the last years [1]. This peculiar geological setting, coupled with its relatively high value as a local touristic resort, led to its selection as a test site for precise InSAR displacement monitoring techniques. The monitoring, started with legacy ERS and ENVISAT sensors, is continuing through analysis of higher-resolution data.	displacement mapping;marina;mesoscopic physics;sensor	Antonella Belmonte;Alberto Refice;Fabio Bovenga;Guido Pasquariello	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325757	geomorphology;geology;time series;irrigation;geotechnical engineering;remote sensing	Arch	81.54890029349603	-58.65986247748193	186246

The methods employed in the study are fully automated, with an accuracy of 0.1–0.2 pixels, however, blunders do occur and this requests a careful blunder detection approach. The investigations include analysis of relative, absolute and band-to-band registration (BBR) accuracy. Regarding relative accuracy, thousands of points are matched between Metop-A, NOAA-17 and NOAA-18 images of the same day. The accuracy is quite high with mean shifts between 0.2 and 0.4 pixels. Systematic stripes have been observed when NOAA-18 images are involved in matching. In spite of many efforts to find the source of this error, no explanation could be found. In addition, large shifts up to 2.9 pixels on some days between September and December 2008 were observed. Regarding absolute accuracy, digitized lakes as reference polygons have been used and a subpixel lake matching method has been applied. The mean shifts generally fulfilled EUMETSAT and GCOS specifications, although some partial results exceed them, especially for Metop-A. Regarding BBR accuracy, six multispectral bands have been compared, also with point matching. The EUMETSAT specification is 0.1 km, however, this specification refers to original images, not orthoimages. OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2015, 7 3294 Taking also into account the matching errors of 0.1 km, the EUMETSAT specifications are in principle fulfilled in all cases except matching of Metop-A and NOAA-17 Band-2 images with Bands 4 and 5. The overall work showed that although, in general, accuracies are high and fulfill specifications, errors exceeding the specifications can occur and vary depending on the satellite used, time and location. Such errors influence subsequent geometric or thematic processing; thus, an automated and permanent quality control of such images should be executed.	behavior-based robotics;general comprehensive operating system;multispectral image;pixel;stripes;switzerland	Sultan Kocaman Aksakal;Christoph Neuhaus;Emmanuel Baltsavias;Konrad Schindler	2015	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs70303293	orthophoto;computer vision;image processing;remote sensing	HCI	76.5697223845259	-56.49540199889694	186772

An algorithm for soybean classification over the Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, was developed as an objective, automated tool. It is based on reflectance from medium spatial resolution images. The classification method was called the RCDA (Reflectance-based Crop Detection Algorithm), which operates through a mathematical combination of multi-temporal optical reflectance data obtained from Landsat-5 TM images. A set of 39 municipalities was analyzed for eight crop years between 1996/1997 and 2009/2010. RCDA estimates were compared to the official estimates of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) for soybean area at a municipal level. Coefficients R 2 were between 0.81 and 0.98, indicating good agreement of the estimates. The RCDA was also compared to a soybean crop map derived from Landsat images for the 2000/2001 crop year, the overall map accuracy was 91.91% and the Kappa Index of Agreement was 0.76. Due to the calculation chain and pre-defined parameters, RCDA is a timesaving procedure and is less subjected to analyst skills for image interpretation. Thus, the RCDA was considered advantageous to provide thematic soybean maps at local and regional scales.

b091012d852545a51ccf8d47f98f486d4c324155	an approach of surface coal fire detection from aster and landsat-8 thermal data: jharia coal field, india	aster;radiant temperature;landsat 8;jharia coal field;coal fire	Radiant temperature images from thermal remote sensing sensors are used to delineate surface coal fires, by deriving a cut-off temperature to separate coal-fire from non-fire pixels. Temperature contrast of coal fire and background elements (rocks and vegetation etc.) controls this cut-off temperature. This contrast varies across the coal field, as it is influenced by variability of associated rock types, proportion of vegetation cover and intensity of coal fires etc. We have delineated coal fires from background, based on separation in data clusters in maximum v/s mean radiant temperature (13th band of ASTER and 10th band of Landsat-8) scatter-plot, derived using randomly distributed homogeneous pixel-blocks (9 × 9 pixels for ASTER and 27 × 27 pixels for Landsat-8), covering the entire coal bearing geological formation. It is seen that, for both the datasets, overall temperature variability of background and fires can be addressed using this regional cut-off. However, the summer time ASTER data could not delineate fire pixels for one specific mine (Bhulanbararee) as opposed to the winter time Landsat-8 data. The contrast of radiant temperature of fire and background terrain elements, specific to this mine, is different from the regional contrast of fire and background, during summer. This is due to the higher solar heating of background rocky outcrops, thus, reducing their temperature contrast with fire. The specific cut-off temperature determined for this mine, to extract this fire, differs from the regional cut-off. This is derived by reducing the pixel-block size of the temperature data. It is seen that, summer-time ASTER image is useful for fire detection but required additional processing to determine a local threshold, along with the regional threshold to capture all the fires. However, the winter Landsat-8 data was better for fire detection with a regional threshold.		Priyom Roy;Arindam Guha;K. Vinod Kumar	2015	Int. J.

The reason why this specific research network has been set up is that the impact of polarimetric methods has not yet attained its expected potential, although this particuliar branch of science is rapidly influencing the scenarios of terrestrial remote sensing, microwave and optical measurements, weather prediction and telecommunications. One main reason for this delayed appreciation is the lack of a fully coherent and structured polarimetric theory. This project will seek to redress this imbalance. Improvements are expected to increase the sophistication of existing remote sensing systems.

This paper describes the extraction of the ionization data of a ground level enhancement (GLE) event from the ionization chamber recordings of three stations, viz.: Godhavn, Cheltenham, and Christchurch. The extracted ionization data was then converted to percentage increase above background cosmic ray levels and compared to existing neutron monitor data. The recordings share common attributes, such as a sharp rise to a peak which tapers off more slowly. This trend, seen in all three data sets, is consistent with the neutron monitor data.	cosmic;gle;height above ground level;relative change and difference;viz: the computer game	V. W. F.

The significant subsidence areas were delineated. Five potential landslide sites near the edge of Heifangtai were identified. In comparison of the surface deformation patterns among five sites, site $A$ had the largest deformation value. The deformation might be accelerated after June of 2017. On 1 October 2017, a landslide event happened at site $A$. Thus, factors closely linked to the event was the magnitude and rate of surface deformation. With the findings coupled with other investigations, one should be able to identify potential landslides using the SBAS-InSAR technique and multi-temporal SAR datasets.	baseline (configuration management);gnss augmentation;synthetic data	Zhu Zeng;Yang Wang;Yan Yan;Ningning Xiao;D C Chen	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8518328	subsidence;remote sensing;loess;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;landslide;synthetic aperture radar;gnss augmentation;computer science	Visualization	82.40221987309894	-59.50783861917202	187579

a2b748d02174fa0dd1072c1c1094e7e314cc6229	an assessment of non-geophysical effects in spaceborne gnss reflectometry data from the uk techdemosat-1 mission		An assessment of non-geophysical effects in spaceborne global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) data from the UK TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) mission is presented. TDS-1 was launched in July 2014 and provides the first new spaceborne GNSS-R data since the pioneering UK-disaster monitoring constellation experiment in 2003. Non-geophysical factors evaluated include ambient L-band noise, instrument operating mode, and platform-related parameters. The findings are particularly relevant to users of uncalibrated GNSS-R signals for the retrieval of geophysical properties of the Earth surface. Substantial attitude adjustments of the TDS-1 platform are occasionally found to occur that introduce large uncertainties in parts of the TDS-1 GNSS-R dataset, particularly for specular points located outside the main beam of the nadir antenna where even small attitude errors can lead to large inaccuracies in the geophysical inversion. Out of eclipse however, attitude adjustments typically remain smaller than 1.5°, with larger deviations of up to 10° affecting less than 5% of the overall sun-lit data. Global maps of L1 ambient noise are presented for both automatic and programmed gain modes of the receiver, revealing persistent L-band noise hotspots along the Equator that can reach up to 2.5 dB, most likely associated with surface reflection of signals from other GNSS transmitters and constellations. Sporadic high-power noise events observed in certain regions point to sources of human origin. Relevant conclusions of this study are that platform attitude knowledge is essential and that radiometric calibration of GNSS-R signals should be used whenever possible. Care should be taken when considering using noise measurements over the equatorial oceans for calibration purposes, as ambient noise and correlated noise in delay–Doppler maps both show more variation than might be expected over these regions.	antenna device component;calibration;eclipse;gnss reflectometry;heisenbug;l band;large;map;noise-induced hearing loss;satellite navigation;transmitter	Giuseppe Foti;Christine Gommenginger;Martin Unwin;Philip Jales;Jason Tye;Josep Rosell&#x00F3;	2017	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing	10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2674305	remote sensing;ambient noise level;satellite system;air navigation;geophysics;satellite;geodesy;nadir;mathematics;gnss reflectometry;radiometric calibration;gnss applications	Vision	81.18015261621372	-65.76676055641812	187793

The UAS photogrammetry was employed to acquire a multitemporal set of high-precision digital terrain models (DTMs) and orthoimages, thereby enabling the reconstruction of variations in riverbed and quantitative analysis of volumetric changes. A hexacopter UAS platform was used for the repeated acquisition of data for the photogrammetric analysis of a stretch of mid-mountain streams with elevated fluvial dynamics. Photogrammetric reconstruction enabled the development of accurate DTMs and orthoimages with spatial resolutions of  2 cm per pixel. These were identified and used to quantitatively assess the segments of channels with active lateral erosion. The UAS-derived data facilitated an analysis of the shifts of stream banks and the calculation of the areal extent of changes and volumetric extent of bank erosion. Comparison of UAS-derived point clouds with aerial LiDAR scanning data demonstrated the high spatial accuracy and precision of the UAS data. The accuracy and high operability of the imaging provide spatial data of a new qualitative level and the potential for the detailed analysis of experimental areas where spatial information is of limited availability.	photogrammetry;unmanned aerial vehicle	Jakub Mirijovský;Jakub Langhammer	2015	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs70708586	computer vision;hydrology;bank erosion;remote sensing	Mobile	81.59049411394454	-57.73080147333963	188036

It is motivated by the fact that variational techniques, such as those employed for computing the optical flow, are successfully applied to many computer vision applications but fail in this particular applicative context, mainly because optical flow techniques are adapted to rigid objects on visible data. The objective of this work is not to propose a full operational process for CMW estimation, but rather to improve optical flow techniques by applying constraints adapted to the specificity of meteorological infrared imagery.	motion estimation	Dominique Béréziat;Jean-Paul Berroir	2000	Environmental Modelling and Software	10.1016/S1364-8152(00)00046-3	computer vision;infrared;computer science;motion estimation;optical flow;optics;remote sensing	Robotics	71.50649647897849	-58.8034083130412	188124

In particular, TanDEM-X provides backscatter, interferometric coherence and digital surface model from phase (DSM) at high spatial resolution (4 m), whose spatial statistics can in principle hold information on forest structure. This information, in turn, could lay the ground to distinguish between naturally occurring forest heterogeneity (e.g. due to the presence of emergent species) and forest disturbance, such as forest degradation (e.g. removal of vegetation) and forest regeneration. The present work investigates by experimental analysis how statistical measures of the spatial random fields (SRF) provided by TanDEM-X InSAR data can be mapped onto properties of the forest spatial structure. The analysis is focused on a case study in the Republic of Congo.	digital elevation model;elegant degradation;emergence;molecular orbital;spatial analysis;the forest	Elsa Carla De Grandi;Edward T. A.

High resolution panchromatic and multispectral images acquired by different satellites were used in this study. These images, acquired also in stereoscopic configuration, were digitally processed and visually interpreted. Geophysical data were collected in some areas of interest using different surveying methodologies (electric, radar). Besides the important scientific implications, the integration of remote sensing and geophysics in archaeology provided a useful tool for the optimization of landscape and cultural heritage management. All data collected were integrated in a Geographic Information System (GIS) to produce comprehensive maps of the site depicting archaeological and environmental features.	image resolution	Giovanni Leucci;Sergio Negri;Evaristo Ricchetti	2002		10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1026423	multispectral image;computer vision;geology;geographic information system;physics;remote sensing	Vision	78.67818693535035	-61.169884102956445	188299

Endmembers are defined as the purest points of the image and lie on the boundary of the data cloud. The image is modeled by a graph and in order to reduce the effects of noise and artifacts existent in the image, the superpixel representation is used instead of pixel representation. Superpixels are the image segments with locally contiguous pixels. The nodes of the graph are the mean spectra of the superpixels and some similarity between each pair of the nodes defines their connectivity to each other. Since the endmembers are the extreme points of the data cloud, we use graph theoretic quantities to discriminate them from the central points in the data cloud. For the validation of the introduced method, we apply this approach to some real hyperspectral images and present the results of applying the method to one image.	graph theory;nonlinear system;pixel;sensor;tag cloud	Neda Rohani;Mario Parente;Arun M.

The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on a Swiss-roll dataset that is restricted to a simplex, and on the spectral unmixing of hyperspectral imagery.	algorithm;barycentric subdivision;maximal set;nonlinear dimensionality reduction	Rob Heylen;Paul Scheunders	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2010.5653675	mathematical optimization;topology;image processing;computer science;hyperspectral imaging;mathematics;geometry;barycentric coordinate system	Robotics	69.51910237390344	-64.46502907901018	188404

It is shown that polarimetric data can be speckle reduced if and only if all the elements of the Mueller matrix are filtered, which is equivalent to filtering the scattering vector covariance matrix. Assuming that speckle is multiplicative and stationary, the algorithms proposed by S.L.Lee et al. (1991) and S.Goze et al. (1993) are extended to filter the covariance matrix of reciprocal and nonreciprocal targets on one-look and multilook images. The problem of estimation of the first- and second-order statistics of the four-channel speckle vector is discussed, and a solution is proposed for one-look and multilook images. >	polarimetry	Ridha Touzi;Armand Lopes	1994	IEEE Trans.

e4dc0f67556e2e962c9890722f7dd7d9e6bb5a7a	three-dimensional reconstruction of building roofs from airborne lidar data based on a layer connection and smoothness strategy	airborne lidar;smoothness strategy;three dimensional 3 d reconstruction;building roof;layer connection points	A new approach for three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of building roofs from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data is proposed, and it includes four steps. Building roof points are first extracted from LiDAR data by using the reversed iterative mathematic morphological (RIMM) algorithm and the density-based method. The corresponding relations between points and rooftop patches are then established through a smoothness strategy involving “seed point selection, patch growth, and patch smoothing.” Layer-connection points are then generated to represent a layer in the horizontal direction and to connect different layers in the vertical direction. Finally, by connecting neighboring layer-connection points, building models are constructed with the second level of detailed data. The key contributions of this approach are the use of layer-connection points and the smoothness strategy for building model reconstruction. Experimental results are analyzed from several aspects, namely, the correctness and completeness, deviation analysis of the reconstructed building roofs, and the influence of elevation to 3-D roof reconstruction. In the two experimental regions used in this paper, the completeness and correctness of the reconstructed rooftop patches were about 90% and 95%, respectively. For the deviation accuracy, the average deviation distance and standard deviation in the best case were 0.05 m and 0.18 m, respectively; and those in the worst case were 0.12 m and 0.25 m. The experimental results demonstrated promising correctness, completeness, and deviation accuracy with satisfactory 3-D building roof models.	airborne ranger;algorithm;best, worst and average case;correctness (computer science);experiment;interference (communication);iterative method;norm (social);point cloud;smoothing;terrestrial television;unofficial patch	Yongjun Wang;Hao Xu;Liang Cheng;Manchun Li;Yajun Wang;Nan Xia;Yanming Chen;Yong Tang	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8050415	geometry;remote sensing	Vision	74.83537044577083	-57.583849666496015	188547

Obvious hot-spots are detected, but also smaller, yet still detrimental RFI, spreading out over for example the ocean, is detected.

A survey done in early March, 2001 sampled many different ice conditions, including heavily ridged coastal ice, large rough floes, rafted nilas, and brash ice near the ice edge. Near the north coast of PEI in 2001, there were large quantities of thick ice due to ridging of grey-white or thin first-year ice. However, high SAR backscatter was associated with floes that had a rough surface on scales of a few meters or less.	antivirus software;gulf of execution	Ingrid K. Peterson;Simon J. Prinsenberg;J.

The core of the proposed technique is represented by the extended minimum cost flow (EMCF) PhU algorithm. Our method is based on a joint analysis of the spatial and temporal relationships among a set of properly selected multitemporal differential interferograms. More specifically, the key idea is to split the complex MCF network problem into that of simpler sub-networks. Accordingly, we start by identifying and solving a primary network that involves a proper selection of coherent pixels of the computed interferograms, representing the backbone structure of the overall network. Subsequently, this result is applied for constraining the solution of the sub-networks connected to the primary one, involving the entire set of analyzed pixels. This task is achieved by solving a constrained optimization problem based on the computation of a Constrained Delaunay Triangulation in the Azimuth/Range domain. The experimental results, achieved by applying the proposed approach to a dataset consisting of European Remote Sensing (ERS) SAR data acquired, from June 1992 to August 2007 over the Napoli (Italy) bay area, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PhU approach..	algorithm;aperture (software);coherence (physics);computation;constrained delaunay triangulation;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);differential cryptanalysis;instantaneous phase;internet backbone;mathematical optimization;meta content framework;minimum-cost flow problem;optimization problem;pixel;time series	Antonio Pepe;Manuela Bonano;Yao Yang;Michele Manunta;Riccardo Lanari	2011	2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049315	computer vision;synthetic aperture radar;interferometry;space time;time series;constrained delaunay triangulation;azimuth;optics;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	77.9763701128411	-64.60184304401204	189066
a37fa847a870f41f8ee1dbcf82cf675d2cae4465	mapping coral reef resilience indicators using field and remotely sensed data	spatial prediction;resilience;fiji;coral reefs;random forest;mapping;universal kriging	In the face of increasing climate-related impacts on coral reefs, the integration of ecosystem resilience into marine conservation planning has become a priority. One strategy, including resilient areas in marine protected area (MPA) networks, relies on information on the spatial distribution of resilience. We assess the ability to model and map six indicators of coral reef resilience—stress-tolerant coral taxa, coral generic diversity, fish herbivore biomass, fish herbivore functional group richness, density of juvenile corals and the cover of live coral and crustose coralline algae. We use high spatial resolution satellite data to derive environmental predictors and use these in random forest models, with field observations, to predict resilience indicator values at unsampled locations. Predictions are compared with those obtained from universal kriging and from a baseline model. Prediction errors are estimated using cross-validation, and the ability to map each resilience indicator is quantified as the percentage reduction in prediction error compared to the baseline model. Results are most promising (percentage reduction = 18.3%) for mapping the cover of live coral and crustose coralline algae and least promising (percentage reduction = 0%) for coral diversity. Our study has demonstrated one approach to map indicators of coral reef resilience. In the context of MPA network planning, the potential to consider reef resilience in addition to habitat and feature representation in decision-support software now exists, allowing planners OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2013, 5 1312 to integrate aspects of reef resilience in MPA network development.	baseline (configuration management);cross-validation (statistics);ecosystem;habitat;host protected area;kriging;random forest	Anders Knudby;Stacy D.

The occurrence of mountain hazards in this area is a matter of serious concern. Thus, it is of great importance to perform hazard assessments in a more accurate and real-time way. Based on temporal and spatial sensor data, this study tries to use data-driven algorithms to predict landslide susceptibility. Ten landslide instability factors were prepared, including elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, plan curvature, vegetation index, built-up index, stream power, lithology, precipitation intensity, and cumulative precipitation index. Four machine learning algorithms, namely decision tree (DT), support vector machines (SVM), Back Propagation neural network (BPNN), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) are implemented, and their final prediction accuracies are compared. The experimental results showed that the prediction accuracies of BPNN, SVM, DT, and LSTM in the test areas are 62.0%, 72.9%, 60.4%, and 81.2%, respectively. LSTM outperformed the other three models due to its capability to learn time series with long temporal dependencies. It indicates that the dynamic change course of geological and geographic parameters is an important indicator in reflecting landslide susceptibility.

The DBM is an Object-Oriented data structure, in which each building is considered as a building object, i.e., an entity of the building class. The attributes of each building include roof types, polygons of the roof surfaces, height, parameters describing the roof surfaces, and the LiDAR point array within the roof surfaces. Each polygon represents a roof surface of building. This type of data structure is flexible for adding other building attributes in future, such as texture information and wall information. Using image knowledge extracted, we developed a new method of interpolating LiDAR raw data into grid digital surface model (DSM) with considering the steep discontinuities of buildings. In this interpolation method, the LiDAR data points, which are located in the polygon of roof surfaces, first are determined, and then interpolation via planar equation is employed for grid DSM generation. The basic steps of our research are: (1) edge detection by digital image processing algorithms; (2) complete extraction of the building roof edges by digital image processing and human– computer interactive operation; (3) establishment of DBM; (4) generation of DTM by removing surface objects. Finally, we implement the above functions by MS VC++ programming. The outcome of urban 3D DSM, DTM and DBM is exported into urban database for urban 3D GIS. r 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents the preliminary results of the Terrain-Roughness Experiment (T-REX), which was carried out in Agramunt, Spain, during the fall of 2004. Four identical sets, each of them having four plots with different plough but the same soil type, were measured. Two profiles per soil plough were acquired, one parallel and the other perpendicular to the antenna frame. Since the purpose of T-REX 2004 was to analyze the impact of surface roughness on the received signal, the soil was not irrigated. Results show that the soil emissivity increases as the soil roughness increases. The horizontal polarization seems to be more sensitive to roughness than the vertical polarization for fields with a tillage direction perpendicular to the antenna reference frame.

This phenomenon is accounted for by splitting the analysis into two steps. In the first step, we estimate the interferometric phases from the data, whereas in the second step, we use these phases to retrieve the physical parameters of interest, such as line-of-sight (LOS) displacement and residual topography. In both steps, we make the hypothesis that target statistics are at least approximately known. This approach is suited both to derive the performances of InSAR with different decorrelation models and for providing an actual estimate of LOS motion and topography. Results achieved from Monte Carlo simulations and a set of repeated pass ENVISAT images are shown.	decorrelation;displacement mapping;line-of-sight (missile);monte carlo method;performance;simulation;synthetic data;topography	Andrea Monti Guarnieri;Stefano Tebaldini	2008	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2008.2001756	stochastic process;geodesy;mathematics;optics;statistics;remote sensing;monte carlo method	Vision	74.92838501706204	-65.90707948791112	189452
e5fe0e8bf71702d1b3088f9b1defd512aaf6901e	sea-ice wintertime lead frequencies and regional characteristics in the arctic, 2003-2015	sea ice;leads;remote sensing;modis	The presence of sea-ice leads represents a key feature of the Arctic sea ice cover. Leads promote the flux of sensible and latent heat from the ocean to the cold winter atmosphere and are thereby crucial for air-sea-ice-ocean interactions. We here apply a binary segmentation procedure to identify leads from MODIS thermal infrared imagery on a daily time scale. The method separates identified leads into two uncertainty categories, with the high uncertainty being attributed to artifacts that arise from warm signatures of unrecognized clouds. Based on the obtained lead detections, we compute quasi-daily pan-Arctic lead maps for the months of January to April, 2003–2015. Our results highlight the marginal ice zone in the Fram Strait and Barents Sea as the primary region for lead activity. The spatial distribution of the average pan-Arctic lead frequencies reveals, moreover, distinct patterns of predominant fracture zones in the Beaufort Sea and along the shelf-breaks, mainly in the Siberian sector of the Arctic Ocean as well as the well-known polynya and fast-ice locations. Additionally, a substantial inter-annual variability of lead occurrences in the Arctic is indicated.	antivirus software;archive;artifact (software development);beaufort cipher;cloud computing;data assimilation;dead sea scrolls;ferroelectric ram;interaction;map;marginal model;meteorological reanalysis;microsoft outlook for mac;microwave;recurrence relation;research data archiving;sensor;spatial variability;whole earth 'lectronic link	Sascha Willmes;Günther Heinemann	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8010004	meteorology;lead;oceanography;climatology;sea ice;physics;remote sensing	Robotics	82.55150825063654	-57.6358462400237	189459

A brief summary of the MLA instrument is given, followed by the instrument measurement model and calibration formulas. The prelaunch tests used to determine the values of various calibration coefficients are described. The boresight alignment parameters were verified and recalibrated by special tests, with the MESSENGER spacecraft en route to Mercury. The MLA instrument model and the calibration methods were largely derived from airborne and spaceborne lidar for Earth science observation at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and will benefit future space lidar developments for Earth and space science.	airborne ranger;coefficient;mercury	Xiaoli Sun;Gregory A.

To evaluate the performance of the integrated method, the extracted linear features were vectorized and overlapped with the original image in the geographic information system to investigate the localization accuracy of the extracted features, which were rarely seen before. The results indicated that the MSR method provided an enhanced image with improved color contrast and brightness, which resulted in a better quality of the extracted linear features. Finally, we compared the performance of two methods of linear feature extraction, the Canny edge detector and the wavelet transform modulus maxima edge detector. It is shown that the Canny edge detector is superior to the WTMM edge detector in terms of visualization quality and localization accuracy.	canny edge detector;edge detection;feature extraction;geographic information system;maxima;modulus of continuity;multiscale modeling;nonlinear system;wavelet transform	Chih-Chung Kao;Liang-Hwei Lee;Chih-Chiang Tai;Yung-Chung Wei	2007	Third International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing (IIH-MSP 2007)	10.1109/IIH-MSP.2007.399	wind wave;computer vision;edge detection;soliton;image gradient;feature extraction;internal wave;computer science;geographic information system;canny edge detector;wavelet transform	Robotics	76.21480817319824	-62.388250316850474	189815

The diseases and epidemic situations erupted recently have a robust relationship with the worsening of environment conditions. Vector-borne diseases are plaguing much of the world, though some remarkable achievements have been gained in the battle against vector-borne diseases. The threats to the public health from vector-borne diseases are at least as important now as at any time in history, especially in developing countries. Most of the vector-borne diseases are associated with specific environmental factors. Control of vector-borne diseases requires the knowledge of the ecology of habitats and breeding sites of vectors, and understanding the life cycles of vectors and pathogens. The past few years have seen a rapid development in spatial information technologies represented by 3S (GIS, RS, GPS), which are suitable for identifying and monitoring environmental targets associated with vector-borne diseases. Combined with other mathematical analysis toolboxes, spatial information technologies provide a new powerful solution to analyzing and predicting the spatial-temporal patterns of vector- borne diseases, which will be helpful for risk assessment and disease prevention. This article gives a general review of the major environmental factors, including climate factor, land use/land cover, hydrologic factor and terrain factor, and analyses briefly the mechanism of each factor acting on vector-borne diseases, then summarizes the major achievements of related work on identifying and monitoring the environmental factors with remote sensing and geographic information system.	cooperative breeding;ecology;geographic information system;global positioning system;habitat;risk assessment;threat (computer)	Wenhua Zeng;Xia Cui;Xiangnan Liu;Haishan Cui;Ping Wang	2006	2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/IGARSS.2006.372	biological life cycle;developing country;vector;spatial analysis;geographic information system;remote sensing	Mobile	82.84873634326591	-55.02793215524329	190089

This accurate knowledge needs frequent updates. This paper presents a methodology for the fully automatic production of land cover maps at country scale using high resolution optical image time series which is based on supervised classification and uses existing databases as reference data for training and validation. The originality of the approach resides in the use of all available image data, a simple pre-processing step leading to a homogeneous set of acquisition dates over the whole area and the use of a supervised classifier which is robust to errors in the reference data. The produced maps have a kappa coefficient of 0.86 with 17 land cover classes. The processing is efficient, allowing a fast delivery of the maps after the acquisition of the image data, does not need expensive field surveys for model calibration and validation, nor human operators for decision making, and uses open and freely available imagery. The land cover maps are provided with a confidence map which gives information at the pixel level about the expected quality of the result.	database;image resolution;machine learning;map;matthews correlation coefficient;pixel;preprocessor;supervised learning;time series	Jordi Inglada;Arthur Vincent;Marcela Arias;Benjamin Tardy;David Morin;Isabel Rodes	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9010095	random forest;machine learning;data mining;remote sensing	ML	79.6679753216104	-56.45036132242566	190262

An experiment with a fully polarimetric radar in an anechoic chamber has been carried out using different frequency bands and baselines. The processed results show the ability of this technique to detect buried plastic mines and to measure their depth. This technique enables the detection of plastic mines even if their backscatter response is much lower than that of the surface clutter.	backscatter (email);baseline (configuration management);clutter;embedded system;frequency band;polarimetry;radar;rejection sampling	Lluís Sagués;Juan M.

c961f641eb1946f268b39d4ba8359ed1e5c39a8a	quantification of anthropogenic and natural changes in oil sands mining infrastructure land based on rapideye and spot5	mining land;change detection;regrowth;extraction of land changes;land disturbance;reclamation	Natural resources development, spanning exploration, production and transportation activities, alters local land surface at various spatial scales. Quantification of these anthropogenic changes, both permanent and reversible, is needed for compliance assessment and for development of effective sustainable management strategies. Multi-spectral high resolution imagery data from SPOT5 and RapidEye were used for extraction and quantification of the anthropogenic and natural changes for a case study of Alberta bitumen (oil sands) mining located in the Western Boreal Plains near Fort McMurray, Canada. Two test sites representative of the major Alberta bitumen production extraction processes, open pit and in situ extraction, were selected. A hybrid change detection approach, combining pixeland object-based target detection and extraction, is proposed based on Change Vector Analysis (CVA). The extraction results indicate that the changed infrastructure landscapes of these two sites have different footprints linked with their differing oil sands production processes. Pixeland object-based accuracy assessments have been applied for validation of the change detection results. For manmade disturbances, except for those fine linear features such as the seismic lines, accuracies of about 80% have been achieved at the pixel level while, at the object level, these rise to 90–95%. Since many disturbance features are transient, a new landscape index, entitled the Re-growth Index, has been formulated at single object level specifically to monitor restoration of these features to their natural state. It is found that the temporal behaviour of the Re-growth Index in an individual patch varies depending on the type of natural land cover. In addition, the Re-growth Index is also useful for assessing the detectability of disturbed sites.	change vector;circuit restoration;file spanning;image resolution;object-based language;pixel;spatial scale	Bert Guindon;Nicholas Lantz;Todd Shipman;Dennis Chao;Don Raymond	2014	Int.

The results obtained depend on the techniques used to identify the point of the specular delay in the waveform, and to perform the different delay corrections to derive the geometric delay. Also, the geometric model assumed for the scenario determines the accuracy of the altimeter range. This work presents the results of two ESA-sponsored airborne experiments using conventional GNSS-R showing subdecimeter altimetric precision with the Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 C/A code only. The Relative Mean Dynamic Topography (RMDT) obtained in both experiments is compared with results derived from traditional radar altimetry provided by Jason 2. The Root Mean Square (RMS) of the RMDT difference between both measurement systems is 48 cm for the first flight, and 198 cm for the second flight. Additionally, results from the second flight experiment show the capability of the proposed technique to retrieve sea slope measurements by superposing the ground track with EM96 geoid undulations.	airborne ranger;esa;experiment;geometric modeling;global positioning system;jason;satellite navigation;system of measurement;topography;undulation of the geoid;waveform	Hugo Carreno-Luengo;Hyuk Park;Adriano Camps;Fran Fabra;Antonio Rius	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352034	meteorology;global positioning system;geodesy;geology;spaceflight;altimeter;accuracy and precision;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	80.46686767451708	-64.96827328812972	190512

In this framework, the application of pixel based classifications of middle resolution images is well assessed while the usefulness of segmentation processes and object classification is still improving. In this paper, a method based on tree-structured Markov random field (TS-MRF) is applied to Landsat TM images in order to assess the capability of the TS-MRF segmentation algorithm for discriminating forest-non forest covers in a test area located in the Eastern Italian Alps of Trentino. In particular, the regions of interest are selected from the image using a two step process based on a segmentation algorithm and an analysis process. The segmentation is achieved applying a MRF a-prior model, which takes into account the spatial dependencies in the image, and the TS-MRF optimisation algorithm which segments recursively the image in smaller regions using a binary tree structure. The analysis process links to each object identified by the segmentation a set of features related to the geometry (like shape, smoothness, etc.), to the spectral signature and to the neighbour regions (contextual features). These features were used in this study for classifying each object as forest or non-forest thought a simple supervised classification algorithm based on a thresholds built on the feature values obtained from a set of training objects. This method already allowed the detection of the forest area within the study area with an accuracy of 90%, while better performances could be achieved using more sophisticated classification algorithm, like Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine.	algorithm;binary tree;image analysis;machine learning;markov chain;markov random field;mathematical optimization;neural networks;performance;pixel;recursion;region of interest;supervised learning;support vector machine;the forest;tree structure	Giovanni Cuozzo;Ciro D'Elia;Virginia Puzzolo	2004	IGARSS 2004. 2004 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1369759	land-use planning;support vector machine;computer vision;contextual image classification;spatial dependence;binary tree;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;segmentation-based object categorization;pattern recognition;image segmentation;tree structure;markov process;tree;scale-space segmentation;artificial neural network;region of interest	Vision	73.17914379008982	-60.23520724990592	190690

Our starting point is to demonstrate that the scale mixture of Gaussian (SMoG) distribution model is suitable for modeling PolSAR data. We show that the distribution of the sample covariance matrix for the SMoG model is given as a generalization of the Wishart distribution and present this expression in integral form. We then derive the closed-form solution for one particular SMoG distribution, which is known as the multivariate K-distribution. Based on this new distribution for the sample covariance matrix, termed as the K -Wishart distribution, we propose a Bayesian classification scheme, which can be used in both supervised and unsupervised modes. To demonstrate the effect of including non-Gaussianity, we present a detailed comparison with the standard Wishart classifier using airborne EMISAR data.	airborne ranger;bayesian network;comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;k-distribution;polarimetry;statistical classification;synthetic data	Anthony Paul Doulgeris;Stian Normann Anfinsen;Torbjørn Eltoft	2008	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2008.923025	statistical classification;estimation of covariance matrices;covariance matrix;agriculture;probability density function;synthetic aperture radar;polarimetry;shape;covariance;mathematics;wishart distribution;scattering;statistics;remote sensing	ML	72.14632899900008	-62.99582411644214	190974

T-LiDAR is used for the recording of the 3D surface of this particular case and provides high resolution 3D digital models. GPR data processing is performed through the novel software tool “toGPRi”, developed by the authors, which allows the creation of a 3D model of the sub-surface and the subsequent XY images or time-slices at different depths. All these products are georeferenced, in such a way that the GPR orthoimages can be combined with the orthoimages from the T-LiDAR for a complete interpretation of the site. In this way, the GPR technique allows for the detection of the structures of the barracks that are buried, and their distribution is completed with the structure measured by the T-LiDAR on the surface. In addition, the detection of buried elements made possible the identification and labelling of the structures of the surface and their uses. These structures are additionally inspected with infrared thermography (IRT) to determine their conservation condition and distinguish between original and subsequent constructions.	2.5d;3d computer graphics;3d reconstruction;classical xy model;data infrastructure;database;digital elevation model;documentation;geomatics;google earth;image resolution;item response theory;kriging;multi-source;postgis;programming tool;quantum well infrared photodetector;radar;raster graphics;sqlite;spatialite;system of measurement;terrestrial television;transport layer security	Iván Puente;Mercedes Solla;Susana Lagüela-Lopez;Javier Sanjurjo-Pinto	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10030379		Graphics	78.83964664811226	-60.79068131630504	191000
a2ef70fabb1d06c4d6ca83bdd690f983b953eea0	remote sensing image data and automated analysis to describe marine bird distributions and abundances	offshore wind farms;aerial survey;environmental impact assessment;marine birds;remote sensing;object based image analysis	Abstract Advances in image data capture with airborne digital cameras and in object-based image analysis (OBIA) have provided a basis for new arenas of applied remote sensing, one of which is the direct counting and mapping of animal individuals. The derived data represents significant inputs to population size estimation and study of animal–habitat interactions. One growing application is bird distributions and abundances in relation to EIAs for marine installations such as offshore wind farms and sea crossing transportation infrastructure. The ornithological surveys in relation to the EIA process concerning the Burbo Bank Extension and Walney Extension offshore wind farms that are being undertaken jointly by Aarhus University and BLOM-UK are an example of the former, with monthly surveys of two offshore areas (total area ca. 670 km 2 ) in the Irish Sea. Image coverage comprises acquisition of 4 cm and 3 cm image data. Object based image analysis methods are used to localise marine birds. This paper describes the data processing and analysis procedures used. It presents examples of representations in these image data of five bird species. Examples of non-bird ‘background’ image patterns that can impact the bird localisation possibilities are presented along with developed countering-strategies.

0bbc955703983c98bb69f4dd8d4546bbc341c0ac	status of the modis spatial and spectral characterization and performance after recent srca operational changes		There are two nearly identical MODIS instruments currently operating on-board the NASA EOS Terra and Aqua spacecraft. Each MODIS is equipped with several on-board calibrators (OBCs) including a Spectro-Radiometric Calibration Assembly (SRCA). The SRCA is a multi-configuration calibrator that aids in determining the performance parameters of MODIS detectors on-orbit. Depending on its configuration, scheduled operations of the SRCA provide measurements to assess the on-orbit radiometric, spatial, and spectral performance. The SRCA was designed to utilize various combinations of three 10 Watt lamps and one 1 Watt lamp and included a spare of each type. On-orbit lamp degradation and failures reduced the available number of 10 Watt lamps from four to two for each mission by 2006. Over the past year, each instrument experienced an issue on-orbit. The nadir door of Terra MODIS closed as the instrument was autonomously commanded into safe-mode after a spacecraft commanding issue. The instrument and spacecraft operations were successfully recovered shortly after the event. For Aqua, a failure occurred for one of the two remaining 10 Watt lamps. We investigate each issue as it relates to the SRCA’s operation and its ability to properly characterize MODIS detector performance. For Terra MODIS, we present changes in MODIS spectral and spatial performance due to changes in the instrument environment. In the case of Aqua MODIS, losing a lamp reduces the output potential of the SRCA. We present the results from this impact and the adjustments made to calibration activities to maximize the effectiveness of the remaining lamps.		Daniel O. Link;Zhipeng Wang;Kevin A.

We used an array of oyster farming frames, composed of two vertical poles and one horizontal pole for each frame, as permanent scatterers. In this paper, we investigate the backscattering characteristics of the structure using AIRSAR data and results of experiment in laboratory. AIRSAR polarimetric images show L-band HH- and VV-polarization produce strong returns from the target structures. Classification of L-band polarimetric AIRSAR data confirms the double-bounce scatter is dominant scattering mechanism. Odd-number scatter is, however, not negligible. The ratio of single-bounce to double-bounce scattering depends of the relative radar look direction to the target array and sea surface conditions. Laboratory experiments were carried out using Ku-band according to the target scale. The results of the experiments can be summarized as: i) the structures produce a mixed signal of double-bounce and odd-bounce scatter; ii) the backscattering from horizontal pole is very sensitive to radar look direction; iii) the signals from vertical poles are stronger than that from horizontal pole. From the results, it is concluded that water level change can be most effectively estimated when vertical poles in the water are observed by L-band HH- or VV-polarization	experiment;ku band;l band;microsoft band;mixed-signal integrated circuit;polarimetry;polarization (waves);radar;star height;verification and validation	Joong-Sun Won;Seung-Kuk Lee;Sang-Wan Kim;Sang-Hoon Hong;Kyoung-Ok Kim	2004	IGARSS 2004. 2004 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1369905	synthetic aperture radar;index term;water level;geodesy;geology;optics;radar imaging;backscatter;physics;remote sensing;tide	Robotics	81.4300577814713	-65.19584354811191	191963

780daf5d8ec313ce6b36e4f9d107ec3d35a2d693	global flood mapping services from jpss		In this presentation, we present details on the use of data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor on the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) to create flood products that are used by decisionmakers in response to flooding events worldwide. In the United States, floods cause more loss of life and property than any type of severe weather events. Billions of dollars are lost annually with hundreds of people losing their lives. The areal extent of flood waters are often difficult to define due to these floods occurring in remote areas and the difficulty in getting timely information in the middle of a crisis. Satellite imagery has proven to be an effect supplement to in-situ methods of defining flood extent. The VIIRS instrument has special advantages in flood detection. VIIRS has a 3000 km swath width and a 375 m spatial resolution. Its polar orbit allows for multiple passes over high latitudes. The recent launch of the JPSS-1 spacecraft to join the Suomi NPP spacecraft provides even more frequent passes. The success of the VIIRS Flood Product has led the way to the development of a flood product from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) from the GOES-16 satellite. A blended JPSS and GOES flood product takes advantage of the high temporal resolution of the GOES satellites and the high spatial resolution of the JPSS satellites.	application binary interface;great molasses flood	Bill Sjoberg;Sanmei Li;Donglian Sun	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517357	severe weather;remote sensing;polar orbit;satellite imagery;computer science;flood myth;weather forecasting;temporal resolution;satellite;visible infrared imaging radiometer suite	Visualization	82.4268598362282	-58.03370771678122	192142

Dual-wavelength LiDAR data were acquired from two airborne LiDAR systems that emitted pulses of light in near-infrared (NIR) and middle-infrared (MIR) lasers. The major features of the LiDAR data, such as surface height, echo width, and dual-wavelength amplitude, were used to represent the characteristics of land cover. Based on the major features of land cover, a support vector machine was used to classify six types of suburban land cover: road and gravel, bare soil, low vegetation, high vegetation, roofs, and water bodies. Results show that using dual-wavelength LiDAR-derived information (e.g., amplitudes at NIR and MIR wavelengths) could compensate for the limitations of using single-wavelength LiDAR information (i.e., poor discrimination of low vegetation) when classifying land cover.	airborne ranger;feature selection;logical volume management;support vector machine;waveform	Cheng-Kai Wang;Yi-Hsing Tseng;Hone-Jay Chu	2014	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs6010700	meteorology;lidar;hydrology;physics;remote sensing	ML	79.68694711113483	-58.63897530545024	192331

One of the most complicated and least defined steps in this procedure is polygon generalization. Here we outline and compare two different approaches to a particular generalization problem, combining four large-scale maps of unconsolidated material from the Chibougamau region, Québec, Canada into a single map for the entire area. First we provide a working multi-step recipe for the ArcGIS software and then show how this procedure can be automated and outperformed through using the cellular automata (CA) model previously proposed for treating satellite images. We finally chose the CA as the preferred method as its results better meet the requirements imposed on the final product. Along the way, we also demonstrate a few ways to control the final level of generalization and show how large maps can be processed on ordinary computer equipment.

The bispectral composite threshold (BCT) technique uses only the 11- and 3.9- channels, and composite imagery generated from these channels, in a four-step cloud detection procedure to produce a binary cloud mask at single-pixel resolution. An innovative aspect of this algorithm is the use of 20-day composites of the 11- and the 11-3.9- channel difference imagery to represent spatially and temporally varying clear-sky thresholds for the bispectral cloud tests. The BCT cloud detection technique has been validated against a ldquotruthrdquo data set generated by the manual determination of the sky conditions from available satellite imagery for four seasons during 2003-2004. The day-and-night algorithm has been shown to determine the correct sky conditions 87.6% of the time (on average) over the eastern two-thirds of the U.S. and surroundings oceans. The incorrectly determined conditions arose from missing clouds 8.9% of the time or from overdetermining clouds 3.5% of the time. Nearly 82% of the misses came in the presence of low clouds. Only small variations in algorithm performance occurred between day-night, land-ocean, and between seasons. The algorithm performed best in the warmer seasons (90.9% correct during the summer versus 81.8% correct in the winter season) and during the day, when the solar illumination provides enhanced surface atmospheric cloud contrast in the infrared channels, and least well during the winter season. The algorithm was found to slightly underdetermine clouds at night and during times of low sun angle and tends to be cloud conservative during the day, particularly in the summertime.	algorithm;image sensor;pixel;trapezoidal rule	Gary Jedlovec;Stephanie L.

With high spatial resolution and novelty in band design, the recently launched Sentinel-2A satellite provides a new opportunity for moderate spatial resolution burned area mapping. This study examines the performance of the Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) bands and derived spectral indices to differentiate between unburned and burned areas. For this purpose, five pairs of pre-fire and post-fire top of atmosphere (TOA reflectance) and atmospherically corrected (surface reflectance) images were studied. The pixel values of locations that were unburned in the first image and burned in the second image, as well as the values of locations that were unburned in both images which served as a control, were compared and the discrimination of individual bands and spectral indices were evaluated using parametric (transformed divergence) and non-parametric (decision tree) approaches. Based on the results, the most suitable MSI bands to detect burned areas are the 20 m near-infrared, short wave infrared and red-edge bands, while the performance of the spectral indices varied with location. The atmospheric correction only significantly influenced the separability of the visible wavelength bands. The results provide insights that are useful for developing Sentinel-2 burned area mapping algorithms.	algorithm;decision tree;lattice model (finance);linear separability;pixel;sensor;stellar classification;time of arrival	Haiyan Huang;David P.

00d387c1787ad21e16c421d91ad0e7622ccd6497	extraction of sample plot parameters from 3d point cloud reconstruction based on combined rtk and ccd continuous photography		Enriching forest resource inventory is important to ensure the sustainable management of forest ecosystems. Obtaining forest inventory data from the field has always been difficult, laborious, time consuming, and expensive. Advances in integrating photogrammetry and computer vision have helped researchers develop some numeric algorithms and methods that can turn 2D (images) into 3D (point clouds) and are highly applicable to forestry. This paper aimed to develop a new, highly accurate methodology that extracts sample plot parameters based on continuous terrestrial photogrammetry. For this purpose, we designed and implemented a terrestrial observation instrument combining real-time kinematic (RTK) and charge-coupled device (CCD) continuous photography. Then, according to the set observation plan, three independent experimental plots were continuously photographed and the 3D point cloud of the plot was generated. From this 3D point cloud, the tree position coordinates, tree DBHs, tree heights, and other plot characteristics of the forest were extracted. The plot characteristics obtained from the 3D point cloud were compared with the measurement data obtained from the field to check the accuracy of our methodology. We obtained the position coordinates of the trees with the positioning accuracy (RMSE) of 0.162 m to 0.201 m. The relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of the trunk diameter measurements was 3.07% to 4.51%, which met the accuracy requirements of traditional forestry surveys. The hypsometrical measurements were due to the occlusion of the forest canopy and the estimated rRMSE was 11.26% to 11.91%, which is still good reference data. Furthermore, these image-based point cloud data also have portable observation instruments, low data collection costs, high field measurement efficiency, automatic data processing, and they can directly extract tree geographic location information, which may be interesting and important for certain applications such as the protection of registered famous trees. For forest inventory, continuous terrestrial photogrammetry with its unique advantages is a solution that deserves future attention in the field of tree detection and ecological construction.	algorithm;charge-coupled device;computer vision;ecosystem;geographic coordinate system;mean squared error;motorola canopy;photogrammetry;point cloud;real time kinematic;real-time clock;requirement;terrestrial television;the forest	Jincheng Liu;Zhongke Feng;Liyan Yang;Abdul Mannan;Tauheed Ullah Khan;Ziyu Zhao;Zhuxin Cheng	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10081299	geology;point cloud;remote sensing;computer vision;artificial intelligence;photography	Visualization	76.80035838356184	-55.63791819579499	193621
9791e9c49b0a3f8b018e3815ce48af974135a689	hyperspectral imaging and spectral classification for pigment identification and mapping in paintings by el greco and his workshop		The identification of painting materials is of essential importance for artistic and scientific analysis of objects of artistic and historic value. In this paper we report a new method and technology comprising a) hyperspectral imaging, b) development of spectral libraries corresponding to target materials and c) proper classification strategies with (a) and (b) as inputs. Our findings advocate that the method improves radically the diagnostic potential of visible-near infrared imaging spectroscopy. A system’s approach is implemented by combining a novel hyperspectral camera integrating an innovative electro-optic tunable filter solution with spectral analysis and classification algorithms. A series of pigment material replicas was developed using original methods covering almost the entire palette of Renaissance painters. Hyperspectral acquisition of the constructed pigment panels provided millions of spectra, which were used for both training and validation of a series of spectral classification algorithms, namely: Maximum Likelihood (ML), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Normalized Euclidean Distance (NEUC), Spectral Information Divergence (SID), Spectral Correlation Mapper (SCM) and Spectral Gradient Mapper (SGM). It was found that the best performing algorithm in identifying and differentiating pigments with similar hue but different chemical composition was the ML algorithm. This algorithm displayed accuracies within the range 80.3%–99.7% in identifying and mapping materials used by El Greco and his workshop. The high accuracy achieved in identifying pigments strongly suggest that the new method and technology has great potential for the scientific analysis of artwork and for assisting conservation and authentication tasks.	algorithm;authentication;emoticon;euclidean distance;gradient;image sensor;library (computing);modality (human–computer interaction);olap cube;palette (computing);pigment;pixel;renaissance;second generation multiplex;spectral efficiency;spectral method;stellar classification;test set	Costas Balas;George Epitropou;Athanasios Tsapras;Nicos Hadjinicolaou	2017	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-017-5564-2	computer vision;stellar classification;artificial intelligence;computer science;maximum likelihood;imaging spectroscopy;spectral line;pattern recognition;hue;statistical classification;pigment;hyperspectral imaging	ML	73.59056669756846	-58.7517101163821	193860

In spite of the increasing utilization of this technology in several applications, its accuracy potential has not been fully explored. Most of current LiDAR calibration techniques are based on empirical and proprietary procedures that demand the system’s raw measurements, which may not be always available to the end-user. As a result, we can still observe systematic discrepancies between conjugate surface elements in overlapping LiDAR strips. In this paper, two alternative calibration procedures that overcome the existing limitations are introduced. The first procedure, denoted as ―Simplified method‖, makes use of the LiDAR point cloud from parallel LiDAR strips acquired by a steady platform (e.g., fixed wing aircraft) over an area with moderately varying elevation. The second procedure, denoted as ―Quasi-rigorous method‖, can deal with non-parallel strips, but requires time-tagged LiDAR point cloud and navigation data (trajectory position only) acquired by a steady platform. With the widespread adoption of LAS format and easy access to trajectory information, this data requirement is not a problem. The proposed methods can be applied in any type of terrain coverage without the need for control surfaces and are relatively easy to implement. Therefore, they can be used in every flight mission if needed. Besides, the proposed procedures require minimal interaction from the user, which can be completely eliminated after minor extension of the suggested procedure.	accessibility;audio control surface;point cloud;strips;topography	Ayman F.

88c1d571d9c17a141cadc8be27854177e18ad676	geometric multi-wavelet total variation for sar image time series analysis		A time series issued from modern synthetic aperture radar satellite imaging sensors is a huge dataset composed by many hundreds of million pixels when observing large-scale earth structures such as big forests or glaciers. A concise monitoring of these large scale structures for anomaly spotting thus requires loading and analyzing huge spatio/polarimetric multi-temporal image series. The contributions of the present paper for the sake of parsimonious analysis of such huge datasets are associated with a framework having two main processing stages. The first stage is the derivation of an index called geometric multi-wavelet total variation for fast and robust anomaly spotting. This index is useful for identifying significant abnormal patterns appearing as geo-spatial non-stationarities in multi-wavelet total variation map. The second stage consists in the proposal of a concise asymmetric multi-date change information matrix on regions associated with significant multi-wavelet total variations. This stage is necessary for a fine characterization of change impacts on existing geo-spatial structures. Experimental tests based on Sentinel-1 data show relevant results on a wide Amazonian forest surrounding the Franco-Brazilian Oyapock Bridge.	anomaly detection;occam's razor;pixel;polarimetry;sensor;synthetic intelligence;time series;verification and validation;wavelet	Abdourrahmane M.

The atmosphere affects differently sensor bands depending on the waveband, thus affecting the indices obtained from top of the atmosphere reflectances. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the atmospheric effects on the NDVI and SAVI using the 6S model adapted for atmospheric correction of images of eight bits digital numbers. Images from the TM and ETM+ sensors of the same area were corrected for the atmosphere and the vegetation indices were compared with those from noncorrected images. For these images the results show that the vegetation indices at the top of the atmosphere were lower than those from the surface. This underestimation of the vegetation indices due to the atmosphere is attributed to a higher absorption of radiation in the near infrared than in the red spectral region. This is exceptionally pronounced on tropical atmospheres where absorption by water vapor tends to be higher than in mid-latitudes. It is concluded that atmospheric correction is necessary when calculating vegetation indices over tropical regions and the adapted 6S model is suitable for this task.	frequency band;sensor	Mauro Antonio Homem Antunes;José Marinaldo Gleriani;Paula Debiasi	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352099	meteorology;enhanced vegetation index;atmospheric model;atmospheric sciences;normalized difference vegetation index;water vapor;reflectivity;physics;tropics;satellite;vegetation;remote sensing	Robotics	82.72349262156564	-61.44819439045686	194277

A small, area scanning multispectral imager was constructed and tested on a Small Unmanned Aerial System (SUAS). Computer vision registration, stereo camera calibration, and geolocation from autopilot telemetry were utilized to design a dismount detection platform. The test expedient prototype was 2kg and exhibited skin detection performance similar to a larger line scan hyperspectral imager (HSI). Outdoor tests with a line scan HSI and the prototype resulted in an average 5.112% difference in Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under Curve (AUC). This research indicated that SUAS-based Spectral Imagers are capable tools in dismount detection protocols.

The dusts were originated from the Lake Eyre Basin and elevated and swept across the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, and Queensland by gusty winds. Ground air quality observation indicated that the dust particle density was 70 times higher than the normal when the dusts struck Sydney. The authors have researched MODIS satellite optical imagery in order to monitor this severe dust storm, and have extracted the information from the satellite images through computing the brightness temperature difference of two thermal infrared channels of MODIS imagery. This method is effective in separating dust and clouds. The mass of the dust plume, therefore, has been estimated using a retrieval model. However, the result of the mass is believed to be under-estimated because the extent of dusts was too great to be covered by a single MODIS image.	plume (fluid dynamics);the australian	Xiaojing Li;Linlin Ge;Yusen Dong;Hsing-chung Chang	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5649212	meteorology;sea surface temperature;air quality index;atmospheric sciences;brightness temperature;storm;physics;satellite;remote sensing;wind	Vision	81.86871665044035	-60.97898695646663	194442

It has been found that TanDEM-X mission is capable of tracking the crop height, and the accuracy of the height estimation depends on the crop morphology, which causes a diversity between canopy top and acquisition phase center. In this work, in addition to interferometry with single polarized channels, polarimetric-interferometric acquisitions have been employed to figure out phase center diversity. The analysis showed that there is a diversity between height estimations from HH and VV polarized interferometric channels, which can reach to 10 cm in the reproductive stages of the crops.	galaxy morphological classification;motorola canopy;polarimetry;verification and validation	Esra Erten;Cristian Rossi;Onur Yuzugullu	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326421	meteorology;estimation;agriculture;synthetic aperture radar;coherence;morphology;hydrology;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Embedded	81.42106762840628	-61.61041938412402	194583

There is much interest, however, in employing smaller lidar systems that require less power to enable sensing from small unmanned aerial vehicles or satellites. Technological advances in the performance of small microlasers and photodetector sensitivity have recently enabled the development of experimental airborne lidar systems with low signal-to-noise ratios (LSNRs). Recent government and academic prototypes have indicated that LSNR airborne lidars could significantly increase the fidelity of terrain reconstruction over what is possible with existing conventional lidars. Thus, there is a need to build up a modeling capability for such systems in order to aid in future system and mission design. A numerical sensor simulator has been developed to model the expected returns from LSNR microlaser altimeter systems and predict their performance. Both optical and signal processing system components are considered, along with other factors, including atmospheric effects and surface conditions. Topographic (solid Earth) and bathymetric (littoral zone) measurement scenarios are considered. The analysis of topographic simulation data focuses on the effect of solar noise on SNR and elevation accuracy while bathymetric performance is evaluated with regard to water depth and scan angle for different water clarities. The mission conditions chiefly responsible for limiting the performance of LSNR lidar are discussed in detail, along with suggestions for further algorithm development and system performance evaluation.	aerial photography;airborne ranger;algorithm;bathymetry;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;topography;unmanned aerial vehicle	Tristan Cossio;K.

d7d573b1d557e99178479869940a00a895c3d93c	assessment of the contribution of beidou geo, igso, and meo satellites to ppp in asia–pacific region	bds;integer ambiguity resolution;eprints newcastle university;open access;convergence time;precise point positioning;dr jing guo;multi gnss	In contrast to the US Global Positioning System (GPS), the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) and the European Galileo, the developing Chinese BeiDou satellite navigation system (BDS) consists of not only Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), but also Geostationary Orbit (GEO) as well as Inclined Geosynchronous Orbit (IGSO) satellites. In this study, the Precise Point Positioning (PPP) and PPP with Integer Ambiguity Resolution (IAR) are obtained. The contributions of these three different types of BDS satellites to PPP in Asia-Pacific region are assessed using data from selected 20 sites over more than four weeks. By using various PPP cases with different satellite combinations, in general, the largest contribution of BDS IGSO among the three kinds of BDS satellites to the reduction of convergence time and the improvement of positioning accuracy, particularly in the east direction, is identified. These PPP cases include static BDS only solutions and static/kinematic ambiguity-float and -fixed PPP with the combination of GPS and BDS. The statistical results demonstrate that the inclusion of BDS GEO and MEO satellites can improve the observation condition and result in better PPP performance as well. When combined with GPS, the contribution of BDS to the reduction of convergence time is, however, not as significant as that of GLONASS. As far as the positioning accuracy is concerned, GLONASS improves the accuracy in vertical component more than BDS does, whereas similar improvement in horizontal component can be achieved by inclusion of BDS IGSO and MEO as GLONASS.	bds c;bds-i antiviral protein, anemonia sulcata;beidou navigation satellite system;cdisc basic data structure dataset;convergence (action);diamond-blackfan anemia 1;glonass;galileo (measurement);galileo (satellite navigation);geo (microformat);geosynchronous orbit;geosynchronous satellite;global positioning system;greater than;largest;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;obstruction;ocular orbit;orbit downloader;performance;precise point positioning;refinement (computing);robertson–seymour theorem;satellite viruses;satellite navigation;software release life cycle;solutions;germanium dioxide;sensor (device)	Qile Zhao;Chen Wang;Jing Guo;Xianglin Liu	2015		10.3390/s151229780	precise point positioning;physics;remote sensing	OS	80.17342780894033	-65.39477554860758	194915

Recently, owing to the popularity of sensors and processors, image-based flow velocity measurement methods have become an important research direction. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is a key example. However, due to the uncertainty of the features, PIV sometimes provides very inaccurate results and always requires customized setups. In this research, we take advantage of the human perception system, that is, the strong abilities related to feature identification and tracking, in order to estimate the surface flow velocity of a river. We developed a method called crowd-based velocimetry (CBV) to incorporate the human perception capacity in the estimation of the flow velocity. CBV includes three main steps: (1) video processing, (2) crowd processing, and (3) statistical processing. We validated CBV by measuring a fast, steady, and uniform river surface flow in an artificial canal. The results show that compared to radar measurements from the center of the flow, CBV measured the surface flow velocity with a deviation ranging between +12.1% and +17.3% from the radar measurement, while PIV resulted in a −1.7% to −24.3% deviation. With rapidly improving mobile devices, CBV allows enormous numbers of people to engage in flow measurement, making CBV more reliable, more efficient, and more economical.

This letter proposes a methodology to take advantage of the revisit time and high resolution in the wind fields retrieved from Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT)-A and ASCAT-B measurements to assess complexity in their short-term evolution and in their instantaneous spatial pattern. The achievement of this information is fundamental for a complete characterization of wind complexity in a region, being also fundamental to determine the influence of geographical elements in local wind patterns. Results show that the proposed approach is able to provide additional and novel information regarding other wind complexity characterizations based on the steadiness, vorticity, or relative wind speed variability.	computation;heart rate variability;real life;spatial variability;spatiotemporal pattern	A.

The radar data have been acquired with the airborne SnowSAR sensor over three test sites in the Austrian Alps during the AlpSAR campaign in winter 2012/13. An example for inversion of backscatter images in terms of snow water equivalent (SWE) is presented. The backscatter signatures of three test sites in different elevation zones show significant differences in terms of mean values and temporal trends during the winter season. These variations can be attributed to snow structure and to properties of the medium below the snow pack.	airborne ranger;alpine;antivirus software;snow	Helmut Rott;Thomas Nagler;Elisabeth Ripper;Karl Voglmeier;Rainer Prinz;Reinhard Fromm;Alex Coccia;Adriano Meta;Daniela Di Leo;Dirk Schuettemeyer	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946957	meteorology;atmospheric sciences;remote sensing	Networks	82.78301769317174	-60.9869739051986	195888

The strengths of SVM are exploited to provide a fast and accurate calculated representation of high-dimensional data sets that may consist of multiple distributions. Once this representation is computed, the number of distributions can be determined without prior knowledge. For each distribution, an optimal transform can be determined that preserves informational content while reducing the data dimensionality and, hence, the computational cost. Finally, endmember extraction for the whole data set is accomplished. Results indicate that this SVM-based endmember extraction algorithm has the capability of semiautonomously determining endmembers from multiple clusters with computational speed and accuracy while maintaining a robust tolerance to noise.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;support vector machine	Anthony M.

Although LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is an effective tool to estimate forest parameters, when acquired from single view point it is not able to represent accurately the entire scene. To solve this problem, in this paper we present a method that integrates the terrestrial and airborne LiDAR data. The proposed method first performs an automatic co-registration of the data sources based on the spatial pattern of the structure of the stand plot. Second, it integrates the LiDAR point clouds to accurately represent the structure of the crown. The resulting fused LiDAR point cloud can be used for an accurate estimation of the crown parameters, thus making it possible a more comprehensive representation of the 3D structure of the forest stand. Experimental results carried out in a oakland savanna in Fresno (California) confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.	airborne ranger;crown group;point cloud;spatiotemporal pattern;terrestrial television;the forest	Claudia Paris;David Kelbe;Jan van Aardt;Lorenzo Bruzzone	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325694	meteorology;lidar;estimation;shape;computer science;data integration;image segmentation;transport layer security;vegetation;remote sensing	Robotics	79.47252779516474	-59.4430704206201	196215

The main aim of this work is to present a new lightweight video monitoring system (COSMOS) that has been developed to target several key characteristics including portability, low-cost, robustness and easy installation. These characteristics were accomplished through the use of standard IP surveillance cameras and in-house developed software to correct the relative large distortion induced by the use of cameras with non-metric lens. This monitoring system has already been successfully tested in several coastal and estuarine sites with different objectives, illustrating its versatility and wide range of applicability. Research efforts are being made so that these systems can provide reliable real-time beach state indicators turning them into a key element in what concerns coastal hazard warning systems. & 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

6b0b9c10e72104ebb829bf3ce9f0df86a1d34ef7	a controlled experiment on oil release beneath thin sea ice and its electromagnetic detection		This paper presents a multidisciplinary research on the thermodynamic and geophysical effects of crude oil released underneath thin sea ice, and further evaluates the ability of a combined frequency- and time-domain approach toward its detection. To this end, a controlled oil release experiment in an artificially grown sea ice mesocosm was performed during the winter of 2017 at the Sea-Ice Research Environmental Facility located at the University of Manitoba. Ice cores extracted during the evolution of the sea ice prior and post oil injection allowed the investigation of the profile’s properties and the oil distribution. Furthermore, chemical composition and microstructure analysis were performed via a gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and X-ray, respectively. The time-series radar signature of the profile was measured utilizing ground penetration radar at 500 MHz and a C-band scatterometer. For this experiment, it was shown that the retrieval of the oil presence underneath the young sea ice layer was feasible, provided that the measured data were utilized simultaneously in a unified cost function.	aerial photography;algorithm;experiment;kriging;loss function;radar;reflection (computer graphics);signal reflection;time series;x-ray (amazon kindle)	Nariman Firoozy;Thomas D.

Due to the non-uniformity  of the noise in the image as well as their relatively low spatial resolution, automatic analysis on SST images usually gives  poor results. This paper presents a new framework to smooth and enhance the information contained in the images. The gray  levels in the image are filtered using a mesh smoothing technique called SOWA while a new technique for resolution enhancement,  named grid smoothing, is introduced and applied to the SST images. Both techniques (SOWA and grid smoothing) represent an  image using an oriented graph. In this framework, a quadratic criterion is defined according to the gray levels (SOWA) and  the spatial coordinates of each pixel (grid smoothing) and minimised using non-linear programming. The two-steps enhancement  method is tested on real SST images originated from Meteosat first generation satellite.    	mathematical optimization;smoothing	Guillaume Noel;Karim Djouani;Yskandar Hamam	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-17691-3_21	computer vision;sea surface temperature;image resolution;geodesy;nonlinear programming	Vision	74.64329841092889	-62.79003657013548	197164

Integrated within an automated mass processing system for Landsat data, the input to our registration system consists of scenes that have been geometrically and radiometrically corrected, as well as preprocessed for detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Such preprocessed scenes are then georegistered relative to a database of Landsat chips. This paper describes the entire registration process, including the use of landmark chips, feature extraction performed by an overcomplete wavelet representation, and feature matching using statistically robust techniques. Knowing the approximate longitudes and latitudes or the UTM coordinates of the four corners of each incoming scene, a subset of the chips that represent landmarks included in the scene are selected to perform the registration. For each of these selected landmark chips, a corresponding window is extracted from the incoming scene, and each chip-window pair is registered using a robust wavelet feature-matching methodology. Based on the transformations from the chip-window pairs, a global transformation is then computed for the entire scene using a variant of a robust least median of squares estimator. Empirical results of this registration process, which provided subpixel accuracy for several multitemporal scenes from different study areas, are presented and discussed.	approximation algorithm;feature extraction;geographic coordinate system;operational system;pixel;prototype;wavelet	Nathan S.

6a5eabe17d47aa0d1cae02b5a4257ac4ed9e1e9c	lidar validation of a video-derived beachface topography on a tidal flat		Increasingly used shore-based video stations enable a high spatiotemporal frequency analysis of shoreline migration. Shoreline detection techniques combined with hydrodynamic conditions enable the creation of digital elevation models (DEMs). However, shoreline elevations are often estimated based on nearshore process empirical equations leading to uncertainties in video-based topography. To achieve high DEM correspondence between both techniques, we assessed video-derived DEMs against LiDAR surveys during low energy conditions. A newly installed video system on a tidal flat in the St. Lawrence Estuary, Atlantic Canada, served as a test case. Shorelines were automatically detected from time-averaged (TIMEX) images using color ratios in low energy conditions synchronously with mobile terrestrial LiDAR during two different surveys. Hydrodynamic (waves and tides) data were recorded in-situ, and established two different cases of water elevation models as a basis for shoreline elevations. DEMs were created and tested against LiDAR. Statistical analysis of shoreline elevations and migrations were made, and morphological variability was assessed between both surveys. Results indicate that the best shoreline elevation model includes both the significant wave height and the mean water level. Low energy conditions and in-situ hydrodynamic measurements made it possible to produce video-derived DEMs virtually as accurate as a LiDAR product, and therefore make an effective tool for coastal managers.	topography	David Didier;Pascal Bernatchez;Emmanuel Augereau;Charles Caulet;Dany Dumont;Eliott Bismuth;Louis Cormier;France Floc'h;Christophe Delacourt	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9080826	remote sensing;geology;elevation;frequency analysis;significant wave height;estuary;shore;water level;lidar;digital elevation model	HCI	82.39960664279538	-60.817588902918274	197877

Results show a significant increase in shrub dominated cover and a loss of lichen dominated zones. Number and area of ponds have also diminished over time. Moreover, according to the change detection analysis, all major vegetation classes had the largest shift in favour of the shrub class. Thus, the final change map illustrates the general shrubification ongoing in the region and pinpoints permafrost degradation zones as principal areas affected by the expansion of shrubs.	aerial photography;elegant degradation;image processing;image resolution	Laurence Provencher-Nolet;Monique Bernier;Esther Lévesque	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6947534	soil science;remote sensing	Embedded	82.13364510643818	-56.5390552272853	198115

(vine plot extraction and caracterisation from very high spatial resolution remote-sensing data.		This work aims to meet the vineyard managers’ needs for information, using very high spatial resolution aerial images. Three methods have been developed and compared for vine plot detection. They are based on oriented and periodical texture recognition using either a cooccurrence analysis (Haralick’s contrast index) or a frequency analysis (Fourier transform and Gabor’s filters). The Fourier transform calculation on a sliding window provides the best results with plot segmentation in polygons as well as a precise estimation of row orientation and interrow distance. These characteristics enable the extraction and detailed study of each vine row, designed to: 1) improve definition of plots contours, 2) detect missing vine plants and 3) characterize inter-rows. Most of the users’ needs have been met during this PhD study thanks to the implementation of a semi-automatic tool for vine plot detection, segmentation and characterization.

The purpose of the study is verifying that a method using a three-dimensional histogram has a higher accuracy for forest fire detection than a previous method using thresholds and verifying forest fire detection for an independent area. In our method, we used the forest fire information that we stored to train a three-dimensional histogram in far east Russia from 1996 to 2000. Our method showed better accuracy than the previous one in a different area from the training area. At non-fire points (e.g. high-brightness clouds) the previous method failed sometimes, but our method judged correctly. For this reason, our method can detect forest fire with better accuracy than the previous one and may be applied to other geographical areas.

However, this promising approach has seldom been reported applied in an oasis of the northwest arid regions of China. This paper presents an analysis of component decomposition based on Radarsat-2 images. The main purpose of the analysis is to provide a preliminary recognition of the scattering mechanisms. The results of the analysis show that the scattering mechanisms in the vegetated oasis are very complex, which implies that scattering mechanisms must be decomposed before SM inversion in a vegetated surface. The analysis provide basis for the SM inversion under vegetation in an oasis of arid regions.	aperture (software);polarimetry;synthetic data	Chunfeng Ma;Xin Li;Irena Hajnsek;Haijing Wang	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730373	entropy;synthetic aperture radar;water content;hydrology;soil science;scattering;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	78.00769694645744	-60.347644661236735	199326

Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have well known limitations in dense forest, and have to be combined with for instance laser based SLAM algorithms to provide satisfying accuracy. Such algorithms typically require accurate detection of trees, and estimation of tree center locations in laser data. Both these operations depend on accurate estimations of tree trunk diameter. Diameter estimations are important also for several other forestry automation and remote sensing applications. This paper evaluates several existing algorithms for diameter estimation using 2D laser scanner data. Enhanced algorithms, compensating for beam width and using multiple scans, were also developed and evaluated. The best existing algorithms overestimated tree trunk diameter by ca. 40%. Our enhanced algorithms, compensating for laser beam width, reduced this error to less than 12%.	algorithm;circa;cluster analysis;curve fitting;map;satellite navigation;simultaneous localization and mapping;triple des;viewing angle	Ola Ringdahl;Peter Hohnloser;Thomas Hellström;Johan Holmgren;Ola Lindroos	2013	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs5104839	computer vision;simulation;information and computer science;remote sensing	Robotics	75.8754433599719	-52.395919521305146	199433

However, the identification of small vessels is still challenging especially when the sea conditions are rough. In this work, a new detector is proposed based on dual-polarized incoherent SAR images. Small ships have a stronger cross polarization accompanied by a higher cross-over co-polarization ratio compared to sea. This is the rational at the base of the detector. The new detector is tested with dual-polarization HH/HV PINGPONG Cosmo-SkyMed images acquired over the North Sea. The test area is near Rotterdam where a large number of ships are expected.	anomaly detection;aperture (software);cosmo solvation model;cosmo-rs;polarization (waves);sensor;synthetic data	Armando Marino;Pasquale Iervolino	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127853	computer vision;remote sensing;artificial intelligence;sea ice;computer science;synthetic aperture radar;detector;clutter;polarization (waves);scattering	Embedded	78.76618857179508	-62.67442760381168	199474

As 2D automatic change detection from satellite images is a very challenging task, 3D information, derived e.g. from Digital Surface Models (DSMs) can provide valuable additional information to detect and analyze such changes. In the first step of the proposed approach, a radiometric co-registration workflow is proposed by automatically selecting pseudoinvariant feature (PIF) pixels using DSMs and multispectral satellite images. Then, an improved Dempster-Shafer (DS) fusion model is proposed for building change detection. In this fusion model, five indicators are adopted to classify five kinds of land cover change/non-change situations. The proposed method is applied to industrial areas using IKONOS stereo imagery of two dates. The evaluation result shows the improvement in true-detection-rate compared to the previous approach.	multispectral image;path integral formulation;pixel	Jiaojiao Tian;Peter Reinartz	2014	17th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)		computer vision;geography;cartography;remote sensing	Robotics	76.32935745497208	-59.003792447956656	199783
c0bbc8736d2ad80c969749586b10d4c03d1346e8	realistic forest stand reconstruction from terrestrial lidar for radiative transfer modelling		Forest biophysical variables derived from remote sensing observations are vital for climate research. The combination of structurally and radiometrically accurate 3D “virtual” forests with radiative transfer (RT) models creates a powerful tool to facilitate the calibration and validation of remote sensing data and derived biophysical products by helping us understand the assumptions made in data processing algorithms. We present a workflow that uses highly detailed 3D terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data to generate virtual forests for RT model simulations. Our approach to forest stand reconstruction from a co-registered point cloud is unique as it models each tree individually. Our approach follows three steps: (1) tree segmentation; (2) tree structure modelling and (3) leaf addition. To demonstrate this approach, we present the measurement and construction of a one hectare model of the deciduous forest in Wytham Woods (Oxford, UK). The model contains 559 individual trees. We matched the TLS data with traditional census data to determine the species of each individual tree and allocate species-specific radiometric properties. Our modelling framework is generic, highly transferable and adjustable to data collected with other TLS instruments and different ecosystems. The Wytham Woods virtual forest is made publicly available through an online repository.	3d scanner;algorithm;bitbucket;don woods (programmer);ecosystem;experiment;field research;open-source software;point cloud;random forest;simulation;terrestrial television;the forest;trait (computer programming);tree structure	Kim Calders;Niall Origo;Andrew Burt;Mathias Disney;Joanne M.

f41af47931474f502bd4d785dfb5a67c5db1c5d3	diagnosing tropical cyclone rapid intensification using kernel methods and reanalysis datasets		Tropical cyclone rapid intensification (RI) continues to be a problem that eludes operational forecasters. Recent work in this area has revealed the value of applying machine learning techniques to classifying storms as RI or non-RI at 24-hours lead time. However, that work showed that differing reanalysis datasets represented the storms in unique ways, offering different discrimination capability and unique predictor sets that are important for RI. The scope of this research is to identify factors important for RI that are consistent among three reanalysis datasets, as these are likely the fields that will provide the greatest discrimination capability. An S-mode rotated principal component analysis was used to formulate unique patterns within RI and non-RI storms, and the resulting RPC scores were used to train a support vector machine classification algorithm that yielded binary RI occurrence output. Base-state meteorological variables (geopotential height, temperature, u and v wind components, vertical velocity, and relative humidity) at single horizontal levels were tested individually as predictors for the SVM. Base-state fields that were consistently good at discriminating RI events from non-RI events among all three reanalysis datasets were deemed most useful for RI classification and will be considered for future forecast applications.	cyclone;kernel method;meteorological reanalysis	Andrew Mercer;Alexandria Grimes	2015		10.1016/j.procs.2015.09.179	data mining	ML	80.87119743595109	-55.51945183664974	199934
