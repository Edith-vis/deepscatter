Image gains depend on the viewing geometry, which is unlike the flat Earth case, which often is assumed to apply in an orbital geometry. Image signal-to-noise ratio is dependent on footprint velocity, but the mean clutter-to-noise ratio for distributed scatterers is dependent on spacecraft velocity. When imagery of a distributed scene observed by an orbital SAR is to be calibrated by comparison to the impulse response of a reference point scatterer, for example, the velocity ratio enters the expression for peak power, but does not enter when an integral is used over the impulse response. The author also looks at the processing gain resulting from overlapping image pixels in azimuth through sampling of the pulse repetition frequency. >	molecular orbital	R. Keith Raney	1991	IEEE Trans.

The nonlinear iterative algorithm is based on the Hasselmann's forward spectral transform extended to include the range bunching effect. An analytic expression for the wave spectral increment is derived based on the exact gradient of the quasilinear ocean-to-SAR transform. Enhanced wave spectra have been obtained using first-guess wave spectra either from the numerical wave model WINCH operated by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute or synthesized from nondirectional wave data and meteorological conditions. The inverted spectra are compared to in situ directional wave data. It is concluded that the wave imagery from ERS-1 appears to be of excellent quality, and as soon as the backscatter modulation transfer functions are properly understood, satellite SAR data will be an important tool for enhancing and extending conventional wave measurements and results from numerical wave models. >	synthetic data	Geir Engen;Harald Johnsen;Harald E.

7fbdf00d2d830466b4aa18182c2b63a4af184e29	a generalized chirp-scaling algorithm for geosynchronous orbit sar staring observations	improved chirp scaling algorithm;fifth order slant range mode;staring observation;geosynchronous sar	"""Geosynchronous Orbit Synthetic Aperture Radar (GEO SAR) has recently received increasing attention due to its ability of performing staring observations of ground targets. However, GEO SAR staring observation has an ultra-long integration time that conventional frequency domain algorithms cannot handle because of the inaccurately assumed slant range model and existing azimuth aliasing. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an improved chirp-scaling algorithm that uses a fifth-order slant range model where considering the impact of the """"stop and go"""" assumption to overcome the inaccuracy of the conventional slant model and a two-step processing method to remove azimuth aliasing. Furthermore, the expression of two-dimensional spectrum is deduced based on a series of reversion methods, leading to an improved chirp-scaling algorithm including a high-order-phase coupling function compensation, range and azimuth compression. The important innovations of this algorithm are implementation of a fifth-order order slant range model and removal of azimuth aliasing for GEO SAR staring observations. A simulation of an L-band GEO SAR with 1800 s integration time is used to demonstrate the validity and accuracy of this algorithm."""	algorithm;aliasing;amniotic bands;aperture (software);assumed;chirp;compression;geosynchronous orbit;image scaling;l band;nr1i2 wt allele;reversion (software development);simulation;test scaling	Caipin Li;Mingyi He	2017		10.3390/s17051058	computer vision;optics;remote sensing	AI	76.06646683999504	-67.25534105521166	93236

Analytical and numerical techniques are used for the development of forward scattering models which are then exploited in construction of matched filters for ultra-wideband synthetic aperture radars operating over a wide rang of incidence angles. Special scattering models for different wall types including cinder block and reinforced concrete walls are presented using efficient numerical and approximate analytical techniques. These allow for construction of SAR images as well as development of a refocusing algorithm. An experimental ultra-wideband radar is set up in the laboratory environment for the evaluation of the models presented. Also, a radar measurement configuration is proposed that allows for elimination of direct reflection from the walls.	approximation algorithm;cinder;image formation;incidence matrix;matched filter;numerical analysis;radar;synthetic data;ultra-wideband	Mojtaba Dehmollaian;Kamal Sarabandi	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518826	computer science;matched filter	Robotics	79.36723692276074	-68.1478440337286	93371
9e77725adffd8b64ea6edee02d931609ed6e7948	bistatic isar imaging with a v-fm waveform based on a dual-channel-coupled 2d-cs algorithm	v style modulation (v-fm) waveforms;bistatic inverse synthetic aperture radar (bi-isar);two-dimension compressed sensing (2d-cs)	Due to the sparsity of the space distribution of point scatterers and radar echo data, the theory of Compressed Sensing (CS) has been successfully applied in Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging, which can recover an unknown sparse signal from a limited number of measurements by solving a sparsity-constrained optimization problem. In this paper, since the V style modulation(V-FM) signal can mitigate the ambiguity apparent in range and velocity, the dual-channel, two-dimension, compressed-sensing (2D-CS) algorithm is proposed for Bistatic ISAR (Bi-ISAR) imaging, which directly deals with the 2D signal model for image reconstruction based on solving a nonconvex optimization problem. The coupled 2D super-resolution model of the target's echoes is firstly established; then, the 2D-SL0 algorithm is applied in each channel with different dictionaries, and the final image is obtained by synthesizing the two channels. Experiments are used to test the robustness of the Bi-ISAR imaging framework with the two-dimensional CS method. The results show that the framework is capable accurately reconstructing the Bi-ISAR image within the conditions of low SNR and low measured data.	algorithm;aperture (software);compressed sensing;conceptualization (information science);constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);data curation;dictionaries as topic;dictionary;digital curation;dual;fm broadcasting;image processing;iterative reconstruction;laser therapy, low-level;mathematical optimization;multi-channel memory architecture;natural science disciplines;optimization problem;signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix;super-resolution imaging;velocity (software development);waveform	Jiyuan Chen;Xiaoyi Pan;Letao Xu;Wei Wang	2018		10.3390/s18093082	engineering;inverse synthetic aperture radar;bistatic radar;electronic engineering;waveform;communication channel	ML	72.51692830323675	-68.92461021491958	94092

In the context of maritime surveillance mission, the Doppler analysis, which is usually performed via FFT-based methods, enables to form a profile view of the ship. We propose to form the ISAR image while antenna is scanning via high resolution spectral estimation methods. The goal of using superresolution algorithms instead of Fourier methods is to improve resolution and to remove sidelobe, especially in our context where the rotation of the antenna implies a shorter dimension of the processed signals. We present in this article results of the application of such methods on both synthetic and real data. Next, this paper considers the possibility to track the scattering centers of the ISAR image along the different antenna scans. This technique will allow a better estimation of discriminating parameters in an additional classification step. We propose to use particle filter methods to perform tracking because they are more adapted to the context than Kalman filtering which imposes a linear state-space modelling and a necessarily white Gaussian noise. Preliminary results of these methods will be presented in this paper.	airborne ranger;algorithm;fast fourier transform;image resolution;kalman filter;particle filter;spectral density estimation;spectral method;state space;super-resolution imaging;synthetic data	Nicolas Bon;Nicolas Khenchaf;René Garello	2004	IGARSS 2004. 2004 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1368707	kalman filter;computer vision;inverse synthetic aperture radar;statistics;remote sensing	Vision	74.60146474597586	-66.99266318606702	94358

The conventional aperture synthesis technique can no more be applied to such cases because the radar image of a pipe does not constitute a hyperbola as is the case for linear scanning radars. We have developed a special purpose signal processing algorithm with the aid of the discrete model fitting method, which can be used for any pattern of scanning. The details of the algorithm are presented together with the results of numerical simulations and test site experiments.

With the global optimizing algorithm of Differential Evolution (DE), low-frequency receiver function waveforms can primarily constrain large-scale velocity structures, while high-frequency receiver function waveforms show the advantages in recovering small-scale velocity structures. Based on the synthetic tests with multi-frequency receiver function waveforms, the proposed approach can constrain both longand short-wavelength characteristics of the crustal velocity structures simultaneously. Inversions with real data are also conducted for the seismic stations of KMNB in southeast China and HYB in Indian continent, where crustal structures have been well studied by former researchers. Comparisons of inverted velocity models from previous and our studies suggest good consistency, but better waveform fitness with fewer model parameters are achieved by our proposed approach. Comprehensive tests with synthetic and real data suggest that the proposed inversion approach with multi-frequency receiver function is effective and robust in inverting the crustal velocity structures.	algorithm;differential evolution;inversion (discrete mathematics);nonlinear system;synthetic intelligence;velocity (software development);waveform	Xuelei Li;Zhiwei Li;Tianyao Hao;Sheng Wang;Jian Xing	2017	Computers & Geosciences	10.1016/j.cageo.2017.02.009	inversion;geophysics;seismology;geodesy;geology;receiver function	ML	76.96019487416316	-68.58452279082616	95158

This blind zone arises from the clutter cancellation by space-time adaptive processing (STAP) to separate moving target returns from the general clutter background. Low-Doppler targets can easily be masked by such a blind zone, leading to sequences of missed detections that strongly deteriorate the performance of a standard tracking filter. This work investigates the Doppler blind zone in the case of bistatic transmitter and receiver configurations and its impact on the tracking of ground targets. The knowledge on the Doppler blind zone is incorporated into a Bayesian unscented Kalman filter multiple hypothesis tracker (UKF-MHT) tracking filter that is also capable of using road-map information. Based on different simulation scenarios, it is demonstrated that in contrast to a monostatic configuration with sideways-looking radar, the blind zone width determined by the minimum detectable velocity is not constant in general. The obtained track results reveal the benefit of exploiting this additional knowledge, especially in combination complementary with road-map information if available.	airborne ranger;clutter;kalman filter;mhtml;moving target indication;radar;scott continuity;sensor;simulation;space-time adaptive processing;transmitter;velocity (software development)	Michael Mertens;Wolfgang Koch;Thia Kirubarajan	2014	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2013.120718	stationary target indication;early-warning radar;man-portable radar;computer vision;continuous-wave radar;electronic engineering;radar tracker;radar engineering details;radar lock-on;doppler effect;moving target indication;space-time adaptive processing;fire-control radar;passive radar;radar horizon;bistatic radar;low probability of intercept radar;envelope;pulse-doppler radar;clutter;3d radar;radar imaging;physics;radar;remote sensing	Robotics	75.81079066994754	-66.21805690119068	95383

There have been many attempts to overcome this limitation by modifications to the barrier top edge. These generally take the form of an absorbent top or the introduction of additional diffracting edges. However, relatively minor variations in geometry have sometimes been found to result in drastic changes to barrier performance. In this paper the Boundary Element Method is employed to calculate the sound field in the vicinity of complex barrier tops and sound field visualization techniques are used with these data to investigate how the sound field varies with frequency and dimensional changes. It is shown that for some top edge configurations local resonance effects have a significant effect on the attenuation afforded by the barrier.	boundary element method;noise generator;resonance	David Joseph Oldham;Christopher A.

In this work, we reveal the existence of statistically complementary information inherent in the backscattered data and propose reconstruction algorithms that exploit this information for achieving a bias-free reduction of image variance in RM DT images. Such a reduction of image variance can potentially enhance the detectability of subtle image features when the signal-to-noise ratio of the measured scattered data is low in RM DT. The proposed reconstruction algorithms are mathematically identical, but they propagate noise and numerical errors differently. We investigate theoretically, and validate numerically, the noise properties of images reconstructed using one of the reconstruction algorithms for several different multifrequency sources and uncorrelated data noise.

In order to get the most optimized balance between computation and effect of noise reduction, a new noise reduction idea - second-time or multiple combined noise reduction is proposed. The algorithm can comprehend the merits of several noise reduction methods. It can preserve edge information well and decrease phase noise dramatically at the cost of adding a little computation. Based on computer simulation, certain terrain is set and the effect of noise reduction of new method is verified. The variance of before and after combined noise reduction is given out. The effect of three-time or more combined noise reduction is not obvious because noise has been reduced by second-time noise reduction.

Measuring the speed of sea surface currents generally employs a radar system using Doppler effect. However, there is a problem that it is unable to measure the current in a wide area because the system is costly to introduce that it is difficult to install two or more systems. Thus, this study extracts characteristic spots from each of the frames of dynamic images of the sea surface shot using a common digital video camera, and calculates movement of the characteristic spots between the frames by means of image correlation. Using the positional information from the video camera, this study also converts the movement on the image into actual speed, and shows it together with the direction of movement. By doing so, we perform research and development of a system capable of grasping the speed and direction of the surface currents of the coastal ocean.	digital video;doppler effect;fast fourier transform;pixel;radar;undulation of the geoid;velocity (software development)	Yuki Fukushima;Etsuji Kitagawa;Hirokazu Muraki;Takehiro Kashiyama;Shigenori Tanaka	2012	The 6th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems, and The 13th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligence Systems	10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2012.6505307	geodesy	Robotics	80.191927844873	-66.57347553090045	103761

The wide azimuthal aperture is divided into overlapped subapertures, and the 2-D scattering centers are extracted in each subaperture. These local scattering centers are rotated and mapped into the ground plane in the target coordinate system, where they are associated according to their location and amplitude consistency. Three-dimensional position of the scatterer is then estimated from the location variation of the 2-D points at different azimuths. The theoretical performance of the position estimator is analyzed, which reveals how the scatterers' azimuthal directivity and persistency affect the precision of the position estimates. The reconstructed model consisted of scattering centers described by their 3-D positions and scattering coefficient profiles at the specific depression angle. Examples using both point scatterers and computer-aided design models not only verify the validity of the methodology but also manifest the applicability of the reconstructed model in scattering analysis, data regeneration, and elevation extrapolation.	3d computer graphics;coefficient;computer-aided design;extrapolation;spike directivity;synthetic data	Jianxiong Zhou;Zhiguang Shi;Qiang Fu	2015	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2014.2346509	continuous-wave radar;radar engineering details;synthetic aperture radar;geodesy;angular aperture;bistatic radar;pulse-doppler radar;optics;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar;remote sensing	Vision	79.0291965633009	-66.67618214618622	104645

For each pixel of the interferometric phase, a 3-D data array is established, and shrinkage is applied after HOSVD. A Wiener filter is used to improve the denoising performance in the end.

Falconer developed two extensions to Kell's MBET: one that is applicable to near-zone data and one that is valid in both the near- and far-zone regions. This paper encompassed collecting and analyzing both monostatic and bistatic radar cross-section data for perfect electrically conducting objects. Specifically, the authors analyzed the effects of varying the transmission frequency, scattering object complexity, and receiver bistatic angle. Objects ranged in geometric complexity from simple canonical objects to multifaceted shapes that produce multiple reflections. Empirical data collected in the far zone were compared with the analytical predictions produced by a commercially available method-of-moment (MoM) code. The code was run at X-band through K-band frequencies for a comparison with the measured data. The empirical bistatic data were then compared with the estimate produced by the MBET to ascertain the region in which the MBET approximation is applicable. Finally, the MoM code was used to produce near-field scattering predictions to facilitate the evaluation of Falconer's near-field MBET. It is shown that the complexity of the scatterer restricts the region of validity for the MBET, where shadowing and multipath interactions prevail. The disparity between the MBET accuracies for the different test objects used clearly illustrates this point.	approximation;binocular disparity;cross-sectional data;interaction;kell factor;ku band;mechatronics;multipath propagation;reflection (computer graphics);turing completeness	Christopher J.

a0bf528ccf979b033e0b23d351c44c0dceb9d2de	an attenuation adapted pulse compression technique to enhance the bandwidth and the resolution using ultrafast ultrasound imaging		Recent studies suggest that Resolution Enhancement Compression (REC) can provide significant improvements in terms of imaging quality over Classical Pulsed (CP) ultrasonic imaging techniques, by employing frequency and amplitude modulated transmitted signals. However the performance of coded excitations methods degrades drastically deeper into the tissue where the attenuation effects become more significant. In this work, a technique that allows overcoming the effects of attenuation on REC imaging is proposed (REC-Opt). It consists in compensating the attenuation effects at each depth in reception. Combined with coherent plane wave compounding (CPWC), REC-Opt was compared to the performance of conventional REC (without attenuation compensation) and CP. With experimental data at 3.25 cm depth in a phantom with an attenuation coefficient slope of 0.5 dB/MHz/cm and using an 8.5 MHz probe, REC-Opt enhanced the bandwidth by 40.6% compared to CP, against an enhancement of only 6% between REC and CP using the same excitation signal designed to provide a 42% increase in bandwidth. The bandwidth enhancements translated into axial resolution improvements of 30% and 3% for REC-Opt vs. CP and REC vs. CP, respectively. This study suggests that REC-Opt is an efficient method to overcome attenuation effects in soft tissues, knowing their attenuation coefficient.	bandwidth (signal processing);coefficient;coherence (physics);medical ultrasound;modulation;phantom reference;pulse compression	Yanis Mehdi Benane;Denis Bujoreanu;Roberto J.

As the laser beams increase, there are limited locations for installing detection channels to obtain measurements, and the soft X-ray spectrum can be difficult to recover. In this paper, a novel recovery method of soft X-ray spectrum unfolding based on compressive sensing is proposed, in which (1) the spectrum recovery is formulated as a problem of accurate signal recovery from very few measurements (i.e., compressive sensing), and (2) the proper basis atoms are selected adaptively over a Legendre orthogonal basis dictionary with a large size and Lasso regression in the sense of ℓ1 norm, which enables the spectrum to be accurately recovered with little measured data from the limited detection channels. Finally, the presented approach is validated with experimental data. The results show that it can still achieve comparable accuracy from only 8 spectrometer detection channels as it has previously done from 14 detection channels. This means that the presented approach is capable of recovering spectrum from the data of limited detection channels, and it can be used to save more space for other detectors.

However, the mismatch among channels will degrade the performance of DBF. In this letter, two novel methods are proposed to estimate channel errors for multichannel SAR systems in azimuth. The first method is based on the fact that the space spanned by the signal eigenvectors is equal to that spanned by the practical steering vectors. In the second method, the channel errors are directly estimated by the antenna patterns without matrix decomposition and inversion processing. Both the theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of these two methods.	aperture (software);beamforming;experiment;image resolution;synthetic data	Taoli Yang;Zhenfang Li;Yanyang Liu;Zheng Bao	2013	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2012.2212873	synthetic aperture radar;doppler effect;telecommunications;antenna;azimuth;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	76.01664355461912	-66.86738098251419	108065

6a42bddb72e12730a3a717f2b7924ba09edf7152	all-in-focus sweep imaging based on wigner distribution function		To extend the depth of field, the all-in-focus image can be achieved via the computational imaging method by designing the data acquisition process under the condition of maintaining the signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, the data acquisition of all-in-focus sweep imaging is described by the Wigner distribution function (WDF); then, the WDF-based all-in-focus imaging model and the computational imaging method are established. In the all-in-focus imaging model, the WDF-based light propagation model is utilized to describe the imaging process. As a consequence, the point spread function (PSF) of the imaging system is derived via the WDF-based light propagation model. By analyzing the PSF of the imaging model, the approximate 3-D spatial invariance of the PSF is achieved, and the all-in-focus sweep data can be expressed as a convolution of the all-in-focus image and the PSF. As a result, the all-in-focus image can be reconstructed by utilizing the deconvolution in the computational imaging. In the simulated experiments, the computational imaging results in different object planes are analyzed based on the structural similarity index to verify the all-in-focus sweep imaging method. In the real data experiments, the resolution targets placed in two different depths can be imaged with extended depth of field via the all-in-focus imaging method proposed in this paper.	approximation algorithm;cns disorder;computation;convolution;data acquisition;deconvolution;experiment;focus stacking;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;structural similarity;wigner distribution function;wigner quasiprobability distribution	Chang Liu;Shan Gao;Xing Zhao;Jun Qiu	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2878056	aperture;computer vision;point spread function;deconvolution;depth of field;computer science;distributed computing;wigner distribution function;computational photography;data acquisition;convolution;artificial intelligence	Vision	72.86458548762842	-68.64612031539967	108647

In our system design, SAR raw data are focused optically by phase correction in the two-dimensional frequency domain. The computations of SAR image formation are performed by spatial light modulators and lenses. With the propagation of the laser beam, the imaging results can be captured by the charge-coupled device. The phase error can be estimated from the imaging results, and adaptive phase error compensation is implemented in the optronic processing. Phase error compensation makes the optronic processing robust and flexible; it can be used for both the initial system calibration and the focus quality improvement. Finally, the experimental setup is demonstrated. The entropies of the images with and without phase error compensation are analyzed, which validates its performance on improving the focus quality.

The algorithm performs the range cell migration correction for non-chirped raw data without interpolation by using a novel frequency scaling operation. The azimuth processing is based on a spectral analysis approach which is made highly accurate by azimuth scaling. In almost all processing stages, a subaperture approach is introduced for efficient azimuth processing. In this paper, the complete derivation of the algorithm is presented. A very useful formulation for non-chirped SAR signals in the range Doppler domain is also proposed where the residual video phase is expressed by a chirp convolution. The algorithm performance is shown by several simulations. A spotlight image, which has been extracted from stripmap raw data of the experimental SAR system of DLR, shows the validity of the frequency scaling algorithm.	algorithm;dbpedia;frequency scaling;image scaling	Josef Mittermayer;Alberto Moreira;Otmar Loffeld	1999	IEEE Trans.

The unique characteristic of this algorithm is that the subapertures are formed by multiplying the received signal with a set of overlapped complex conjugated reference signals where the chirp rate varies in the azimuth direction. This is done to solve the range focus problem that arises after the azimuth input signal undergoes the range walk removal procedure. As the HSS algorithm only involves short fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) and avoids interpolation, it is computationally efficient and allows for small data buffers and facilitates hardware real-time implementation. The distinct feature of this algorithm is its simplicity of implementation, which is vital in real time processing and motion compensation when the squint angle may be changing continuously.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;chirp;fast fourier transform;high-speed serial interface;interpolation;motion compensation;real-time clock;real-time computing;synthetic data	Tat Soon Yeo;Ngee Leng Tan;Cheng Bo Zhang;Yihui Lu	2001	IEEE Trans.

First and higher order derivatives analysis of absorbance and reflectance spectral data is commonly used techniques in differentiating the spectral mixing. But high sensitivity of derivative to the noise in data is a major problem in the robust estimation of derivative of spectral data. An algorithm of robust estimation of first and second order derivative spectra from evenly spaced noisy normal spectral data is proposed. The algorithm is formalized in the framework of an inverse problem, where based on the fundamental theorem of calculus a matrix equation is formed using a Volterra type integral equation of first kind. A regularization technique, where the balancing principle is used in selecting a posteriori optimal regularization parameter is designed to solve the inverse problem for robust estimation of first order derivative spectra. The higher order derivative spectra are obtained while using the algorithm in sequel. The algorithm is tested successfully with synthetically generated spectral data contaminated with additive white Gaussian noise, and also with real absorbance and reflectance spectral data for fresh and sea water respectively. Robust and efficient algorithm of computing first and second orders derivative spectra is designed.The algorithm is based on the premise of inverse problem where a robust solution is achieved via regularization.It couples discrepancy and balancing principles to determine regularization parameter and implement stopping rule respectively.Numerical experiments on noisy data suggest superiority of the method over finite difference and Fourier transform based techniques.The proposed method is applied on absorbance and reflectance spectral data for fresh and sea water.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;experiment;finite difference;numerical analysis;synthetic data;utility functions on indivisible goods	Indrajit G.

A critical issue with waveform inversion is the a priori unknown source signal. Indeed, the estimation of the source pulse is notoriously difficult but essential for the effective application of this method. Here, we explore the viability and robustness of a recently proposed deconvolution-based procedure to estimate the source pulse during waveform inversion of crosshole georadar data, where changes in wavelet shape with location as a result of varying near-field conditions and differences in antenna coupling may be significant. Specifically, we examine whether a single, average estimated source current function can adequately represent the pulses radiated at all transmitter locations during a crosshole georadar survey, or whether a separate source wavelet estimation should be performed for each transmitter gather. Tests with synthetic and field data indicate that remarkably good tomographic reconstructions can be obtained using a single estimated source pulse when moderate to strong variability exists in the true source signal with antenna location. Only in the case of very strong variability in the true source pulse are tomographic reconstructions clearly improved by estimating a different source wavelet for each transmitter location.	acoustic cryptanalysis;deconvolution;heart rate variability;relevance;spatial variability;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;tomographic reconstruction;transmitter;waveform;wavelet	Florian A.

Finally, the use of look-up tables helps in further reducing the processing costs. The technique proposed conjugates excellent performance and low complexity, as demonstrated on both simulated and real-world SAR images and on a dedicated SAR despeckling benchmark.	aharonov–bohm effect;algorithm;benchmark (computing);computer performance;fast fourier transform;lookup table;noise reduction;nonlocal lagrangian;simulation;window of opportunity	Davide Cozzolino;Sara Parrilli;Giuseppe Scarpa;Giovanni Poggi;Luisa Verdoliva	2014	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2013.2271650	speckle pattern;speckle noise;computer vision;synthetic aperture radar;geology;physics;remote sensing	Vision	74.62530039067086	-67.16317274922764	114796

Here, we focus on the diffuse polarisation process occuring at dielectric surfaces due to subsurface scattering and transmission from the object surface into the air. The diffuse polarisation of the reflection process is modelled by the Fresnel transmission theory. We present a method for estimating the azimuth angle of surface normals from the spectral variation of the phase of polarisation. Moreover, we estimate the zenith angle of surface normals and index of refraction simultaneously in a well-posed optimisation framework. We achieve well-posedness by introducing two additional constraints to the problem, including the surface integrability and the material dispersion equation. This yields an iterative solution which is computationally efficient due to the use of closed-form solutions for both the zenith angle and the refractive index in each iteration. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show results of shape recovery and surface rendering for both real-world and synthetic imagery.	algorithmic efficiency;diffuse reflection;iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;maximal set;multispectral image;normal (geometry);polarimetry;polarizer;subsurface scattering;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;viewing cone;well-posed problem	Cong Phuoc Huynh;Antonio Robles-Kelly;Edwin R.

124db146d4bf80f1b1963307d4e949588c25019c	automatic hyperspectral image restoration using sparse and low-rank modeling		Hyperspectral restoration is a preprocessing step for hyperspectral imagery. In this letter, we propose a parameter-free method for the restoration of hyperspectral images (HSIs) called HyRes. The restoration method is based on a sparse low-rank model that uses the  $\ell _{1}$  penalized least squares for estimating the unknown signal. The Stein’s unbiased risk estimator is exploited to select all the parameters of the model yielding a fully automatic (parameter free) technique. Experimental results confirm that HyRes outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, and spectral angle distance for a simulated data set and in terms of noise-level estimation for the real data sets used in this letter. In the experiments, it was noted that HyRes is computationally less expensive compared with competitive techniques.

cca9768baa6a04453054765f55e406b23fad3fcf	a robust change-point detection method by eliminating sparse noises from time series		Singular Spectrum Transform (SST) is a fundamental subspace analysis technique which has been widely adopted for solving change-point detection (CPD) problems in information security applications. However, the performance of a SST based CPD algorithm is limited to the lack of robustness to corrupted observations with large noises in practice. Based on the observation that large noises in practical time series are generally sparse, in this paper, we study a combination of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and SST to obtain a robust CPD algorithm dealing with sparse large noises. The sparse large noises are to be eliminated from observation trajectory matrices by performing a low-rank matrix recovery procedure of RPCA. The noise-eliminated matrices are then used to extract SST subspaces for CPD. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments based on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the competing state-of-the-arts in terms of detection accuracy for time series with sparse large noises.	algorithm;collaborative product development;experiment;ibm notes;information security;recovery procedure;robust principal component analysis;sparse matrix;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;time series	Kun Qin;Lei Sun;Bo Liu;Yuan Fan;Kar-Ann Toh	2018	2018 IEEE Third International Conference on Data Science in Cyberspace (DSC)	10.1109/DSC.2018.00029	linear subspace;time series;robustness (computer science);sparse matrix;change detection;mathematics;robust principal component analysis;principal component analysis;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;matrix (mathematics)	DB	68.93584211811284	-67.43848756339217	118943
5bebc78a83b5c8ad01b76e582d7b2dc0289143ea	multi-target track before detect with labeled random finite set and adaptive correlation filtering		In Track-Before-Detect (TBD), the aim is to jointly estimate the number of tracks and their states from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) images. This is a challenging problem due to the unknown and time varying number of targets as well as the nonlinearity and size of the image data. A good balance between tractability and fidelity is important in the design of the measurement model for such trackers. In this paper, we transform the raw images into predetection images via adaptive correlation filtering, then apply an efficient labeled random finite set tracking filter for image data. Moreover, instead of using a particle implementation, we use an unscented transformation implementation which is computationally efficient and does not suffer from particle depletion. Numerical studies using realistic radar-based TBD scenarios are presented to verify the efficiency of the proposed solution.	algorithmic efficiency;depletion region;euro-vo;nonlinear system;numerical method;overlap–add method;radar;signal-to-noise ratio;track-before-detect;venue (sound system)	Du Yong Kim	2017	2017 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)	10.1109/ICCAIS.2017.8217591	filter (signal processing);control theory;algorithm;engineering;radio frequency;radar;nonlinear system;signal processing;radar tracker;track-before-detect;finite set	Robotics	73.4152956556113	-68.42094012956433	119074
19fedb1130ace3287d06027c8f19c2eb16bb1d8a	microwave imaging of non-rigid moving target using 2d sparse mimo array		A microwave/mmw imaging method for moving objects of non-rigid body using 2D sparse MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) array is proposed in this paper. To achieve high-resolution 3D image, two orthogonal linear arrays are introduced to form a 2D sparse MIMO array and wide-band signals are transmitted in this method. Subsequently, a space-time trajectory model is introduced to describe the motion of the non-rigid body target. The joint use of segmental and joint-estimation leads to the effective movement compensation of each component. Finally, all the images of components are merged into an image of the whole target and the 3D high-resolution image of the target is reconstructed.	3d computer graphics;image resolution;mimo;microwave;sparse matrix	Z.

dc634741b7272055a2976e1368a4d7d621e8c63d	two-dimensional deformation measurement based on multiple aperture interferometry in gb-sar		Ground-based synthetic aperture radar (GB-SAR) technique has been widely applied for the deformation monitoring and measurement of the natural and engineered slopes. To extend the 2-D deformation measurement from the conventional 1-D measurement along the radar-target line of sight (LOS), multiple aperture interferometry (MAI) techniques based on phase differences between interferograms of the forward-looking and backward-looking subapertures are tackled in this letter. The optimal subaperture selection is analyzed considering the typical signal-to-noise ratios and correlations in GB-SAR applications. Simulations prove that the coherent integration (CIM) can be utilized to improve the measurement accuracy of the MAI method. Besides, GB-SAR experiments are carried out to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the 2-D deformation measurement method based on MAI. Accuracy comparison of deformation measurement with the MAI and cross correlation methods is also taken. Experimental results show that the accuracy of deformation measurement along the perpendicular direction to LOS based on MAI and CIM can reach millimeter level for displaceable corner reflector.	coherence (physics);computer simulation;computer-integrated manufacturing;cross-correlation;experiment;intelligence amplification;signal-to-noise ratio;synthetic data	Cheng Hu;Yunkai Deng;Rui Wang;Weiming Tian;Tao Zeng	2017	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2016.2635103	electronic speckle pattern interferometry	Embedded	77.3828654199147	-66.54740424270594	121001

Moreover, images of ACT with different maximum phase errors are simulated.

However, very fine spatial resolution radars represent widespread systems that provides data for which this hypothesis could be no longer valid. This problem is often called in the literature extended target tracking. In this paper we propose to use the well-established random matrix theory to deal with this issue. A suitable measurement model to address the radar's measurement noise and its conversion into Cartesian coordinates is proposed. The benefits of the proposed converted measurements - extended target tracking with regard to the problem of the targets' size estimation are demonstrated by using both simulated and real data acquired by an X-band marine radar. Average gains of 75% in the estimation of the targets' cross-range size and 31% for the along-range size are observed by comparing the proposed approach with the one that neglects the sensor's noises.	algorithm;image resolution;radar;whole earth 'lectronic link	Gemine Vivone;Paolo Braca;Karl Granström;Antonio Natale;Jocelyn Chanussot	2015	2015 18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)		stationary target indication;track-before-detect;computer vision;continuous-wave radar;electronic engineering;radar tracker;radar engineering details;radar lock-on;geography;space-time adaptive processing;bistatic radar;low probability of intercept radar;pulse-doppler radar;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;remote sensing	Robotics	74.90047852149793	-66.29429131003555	122457

Long burst trains with zeroes inserted into the interburst intervals can be processed coherently. This kind of processing preserves the phase information of the data-an important aspect for ScanSAR interferometry. Due to the interference of the burst images the impulse response shows a periodic modulation that can be eliminated by a subsequent low-pass filtering of the detected image. This strategy allows an easy and safe adaptation of existing SAR processors to ScanSAR data if throughput is not an issue. The images are automatically consistent with regular SAR mode images both with respect to geometry and radiometry. The amount and diversity of the software for a multimode SAR processor are reduced. The impulse response and transfer functions of a burst-mode end-to-end system are derived. Special attention is drawn to the achievable image quality, the radiometric accuracy, and the effective number of looks. The scalloping effect known from burst-mode systems can be controlled by the spectral weighting of the processor transfer function. It is shown that the fact that the burst cycle period is in general not an integer multiple of the sampling grid distance does not complicate the algorithm. An image example using X-SAR data for simulation of a burst system is presented.	algorithm	Richard Bamler;Michael Eineder	1996	IEEE Trans.

This parametric point-process model describes a 1-D surface in terms of the mean and variance of the interscatterer distances. Variations of these parameters can describe scatterer distributions ranging from totally random to nearly periodic. Under certain conditions, a closed-form approximation to the mean power spectrum of finite-length data intervals exists. The estimation of model parameters from measured spectra can then be cast as an optimization problem in which the total squared error between the approximation and the simple periodogram is minimized. We examine the general performance limitations of such an optimization procedure, determining how approximation error, signal-to-noise ratio, and frequency-sampling rate affect the feasibility and accuracy of parameter estimation. We determine under what conditions the approximation may be used. We find that parameter estimation is feasible at a frequency-sampling rate that is well below that suggested by the power spectral density (PSD). This suggests that it is possible to obtain parameter estimates by comparing sparse narrow-band frequency measurements to the PSD of the point-process and thereby obtain information about the surface on subresolution scales.	approximation error;estimation theory;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;point process;process modeling;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix;spectral density estimation	Robert M.

1493ecb6afba1e765b489d0c138a0bfa9b266a0a	psf field learning based on optimal transport distances		Abstract. Context: in astronomy, observing large fractions of the sky within a reasonable amount of time implies using large field-of-view (fov) optical instruments that typically have a spatially varying Point Spread Function (PSF). Depending on the scientific goals, galaxies images need to be corrected for the PSF whereas no direct measurement of the PSF is available. Aims: given a set of PSFs observed at random locations, we want to estimate the PSFs at galaxies locations for shapes measurements correction. Contributions: we propose an interpolation framework based on Sliced Optimal Transport. A non-linear dimension reduction is first performed based on local pairwise approximated Wasserstein distances. A low dimensional representation of the unknown PSFs is then estimated, which in turn is used to derive representations of those PSFs in the Wasserstein metric. Finally, the interpolated PSFs are calculated as approximated Wasserstein barycenters. Results: the proposed method was tested on simulated monochromatic PSFs of the Euclid space mission telescope (to be launched in 2020). It achieves a remarkable accuracy in terms of pixels values and shape compared to standard methods such as Inverse Distance Weighting or Radial Basis Function based interpolation methods.	approximation algorithm;dimensionality reduction;euclid;galaxy;interpolation;monochrome;nonlinear system;pixel;radial (radio);radial basis function;transportation theory (mathematics)	Fred Maurice Ngolè Mboula;Jean-Luc Starck	2017	CoRR		interpolation;artificial intelligence;mathematical optimization;pixel;inverse distance weighting;pattern recognition;point spread function;computer science;dimensionality reduction;pairwise comparison;wasserstein metric;radial basis function	ML	70.70015314573689	-69.22224512330972	123380

Regarding the multi-receiver SAS imaging processing, conventional CS algorithm might cause serious defocusing of targets in the edge of the swath due to the relatively large approximate error in the phase of an echo signal. A two-dimensional spectral expression of multi-receiver SAS echoes was studied. From the perspective of phase compensation, the multi-receiver synthetic aperture processing was divided into multi-receiver sonar phase compensation and single receiver sonar phase compensation based on a CS algorithm. Then a high-order Taylor expansion of echo phase was obtained and a three-order or above phase compensating factor for phase compensation was adopted to improve compensation accuracy. The simulation results showed that the algorithm presented in this paper has higher azimuth resolution than the traditional algorithm, and both the center point targets and the edge point targets in the swath have better focus, which can meet the requirements of multi-receiver SAS imaging.	approximation algorithm;chirp;image processing;image scaling;requirement;sas;sonar (symantec);simulation;synthetic data	Naiqiang Fan;Yingmin Wang;Yarong lv	2016		10.1145/3028842.3028862	computer vision;synthetic aperture sonar;electronic engineering;engineering;optics	Robotics	75.99216791719049	-67.40412770985635	123441

This task is solved here by using an inverse SAR (ISAR) technique. The ISAR technique performs an autofocus procedure by implementing exhaustive search algorithms, which are improved by classical convex optimization, of functions based on image contrast or entropy. In this paper, we discuss the possibility to perform an autofocus ISAR technique by exploiting the estimation of the target Doppler parameters, namely the Doppler centroid and the Doppler rate, which are related to the target motion parameters. The present algorithm is based on the reuse of efficient autofocus approaches that are classically used in direct SAR imaging. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on COSMO-SkyMed Spotlight SAR data of maritime targets. Furthermore, the proposed Doppler parameter estimation algorithm is compared with a well-known ISAR technique, namely the image-contrast-based technique.	aperture (software);brute-force search;cosmo-rs;convex optimization;dbpedia;doppler effect;estimation theory;genetic algorithm;image formation;mathematical optimization;search algorithm;synthetic data	Carlo Noviello;Gianfranco Fornaro;Marco Martorella	2015	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2014.2377293	computer vision;estimation;continuous-wave radar;synthetic aperture radar;doppler effect;sensor;mathematics;optics;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;motion compensation;side looking airborne radar;physics;statistics;remote sensing	EDA	75.42621410910823	-67.42062664375074	124553

The endmember identifiability of the proposed two algorithms is theoretically proved under the pure pixel assumption. Both algorithms never require any initializations and hence they are repeatable.

Notable engineering features of the instrument, demonstrated in this paper, include Galactic-noise limited active antennas and direct sampling digitization of the entire tuning range. This paper also summarizes the LWA science goals, specifications, and analysis leading to top-level design decisions.	active galactic nucleus;frequency band;image resolution;level design;phased array;polarization (waves);sampling (signal processing)	Steven W.

In particular, central wavelength of the spectral response varies along the spatial dimension of the array, thus giving rise to artifacts in the data. An accurate knowledge of the point spread function (PSF) of each individual detector of the matrix is fundamental to correct for these effects. In this work, CRISM images from the poles of Mars are noticed to suffer from wavelength shifts that do not agree with pre-launch calibration data. The source of this instrumental anomaly is identified as a faulty flat fielding in the CRISM data pipeline and a method that is based on synthetic spectra is introduced for wavelength calibration. In the experiments, a polar CRISM image is calibrated by estimating its apparent wavelengths. Results are finally compared with the same test image after undergoing a prototype calibration that does not present the wavelength anomaly.	anomaly detection;distortion;experiment;image sensor;pretail;prototype;standard test image;synthetic data;the matrix	Xavier Ceamanos;Sylvain Douté	2010	2010 2nd Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing	10.1109/WHISPERS.2010.5594925	astrobiology;geography;optics;remote sensing	ML	79.77232712546287	-66.57040537223355	127967

The mitigation of mispointing uncertainties related to thermal distortions and vibrations of the antenna structure, and/or attitude determination errors represents one of the several challenges to overcome for the reaching of high-quality Doppler velocity products. In addition to the possibility of adopting mispointing correction techniques based on the surface Doppler velocity in clear sky regions, we propose to use the presence of abundant natural targets (ice clouds) with climatologically very well characterized Doppler velocities as calibration points. This is demonstrated by showing that the ice clouds present on average in each EC orbit (emulated with CloudSat data) can be used to accurately retrieve the effect of an orbital harmonic, which represents the most relevant component in the modeling of the antenna mispointing error expected for the EC satellite. The residual errors associated to the orbital harmonic mispointing are negligible (<; 0.03 m/s) compared with the other errors typically involved in Doppler velocities observed from fast-moving platforms. On the other hand, high-frequency components of the torque spectrum cannot be mitigated and, according to the current thermal and mechanical models for the EC antenna, are estimated to contribute to an RMS error of 0.2 (0.3) m/s in the nominal (worst case) scenario.	best, worst and average case;distortion;doppler effect;emulator;molecular orbital;radar;velocity (software development)	Alessandro Battaglia;Pavlos Kollias	2015	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2014.2353219	meteorology;early-warning radar;continuous-wave radar;space-based radar;radar engineering details;synthetic aperture radar;radar lock-on;atmospheric sciences;radar configurations and types;radar horizon;weather radar;bistatic radar;pulse-doppler radar;3d radar;radar imaging;radar astronomy;side looking airborne radar;radar;remote sensing;low-frequency radar	Visualization	81.23848882520207	-66.64110660231093	128740

To extract clean change features from heavily corrupted spectral change vectors (SCV) of multitemporal HSI, this paper proposes a novel spectrally-spatially regularized low-rank and sparse decomposition model (LRSDSS). It exploits the underlying data structure of SCV by decomposing SCV into three components: spatially smoothed low-rank data, sparse outliers and Gaussian noise. The first component maintains clean change features. The second and the third are corruptions to be removed. The experimental results can validate the effectiveness and the efficiency of LRSD_SS.	data structure;feature extraction;horizontal situation indicator;single customer view;smoothing;sparse matrix	Zhao Chen;Bin Yang;Bin Wang;Guohua Liu;Wei Xia	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8126918	computer vision;artificial intelligence;outlier;feature extraction;gaussian noise;low-rank approximation;change detection;sparse approximation;computer science;hyperspectral imaging;data structure	Embedded	69.24072605691185	-66.62515754342743	129161

62d861dfafe7edf772b1a176e269c718d295d267	the detection of fluctuating targets in case of range migration		Combined with the wide bandwidth, the long coherent processing interval, and the high radial velocity between the target and the radar, this combination of factors causes significant linear range migration which makes detection of weak targets difficult. Keystone transform is one of the methods to remove range migration of fast targets. Since target fluctuation becomes uncorrelated during long observation time, coherent integration becomes inefficient. Hybrid integration combining coherent and noncoherent integration can provide more efficient integration. Higher detection probability can be obtained by using diversity gain provided by frequency hopping. Together with hybrid integration, frequency is hopped in the intervals where fluctuation cannot be assumed uncorrelated after Keystone transform is applied in case of range migration.	coherence (physics);frequency-hopping spread spectrum;keystone effect;quantum fluctuation;radial (radio);universal conductance fluctuations;velocity (software development)	Onur Culha;Yalçin Tanik	2017	2017 25th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2017.7960706	computer science;computer vision;artificial intelligence;coherent processing interval;object detection;doppler effect;radar;electronic engineering;linear range;doppler radar;telecommunications;radial velocity;bandwidth (signal processing)	Robotics	77.3195455294678	-67.95020420044573	129358

There have been physical and empirical studies for modeling the ionosphere. International Reference Ionosphere extended to Plasmasphere (IRI-Plas) is the most recent model developed for this purpose. However, IRI-Plas presents a model about the ionosphere and its compliance with the instantaneous state of the ionosphere does not provide the accuracy needed for engineering purposes. One of the important information sources about the instantaneous state of the ionosphere is GPS signals. In this study, constructing the ionosphere which is compatible with both the instantaneous ionosphere measurements and the physical structure of the ionosphere is presented as an optimization problem, and solved by using the particle swarm optimization technique. The ionosphere over Turkey is investigated by using the proposed optimization method and the importance of the instantaneous ionosphere measurements obtained from GPS signals is demonstrated.	electron;gps signals;global positioning system;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;programmable logic array	Hakan Tuna;Orhan Arikan;Feza Arikan	2014	2014 22nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2014.6830282	estimation;global positioning system;computer science;electrical engineering;signal processing;ionosphere;particle swarm optimization;statistics	EDA	81.60795023794621	-68.35240094541903	129569
fc250e307619cd4fc45f87c4f4dc1fb824e52a85	parallel gpgpu stereo matching with an energy-efficient cost function based on normalized cross correlation	speckle;distortion;remote sensing;algorithms;computer vision technology;radar	Stereo matching is a heavily investigated topic in computer vision because of its wide range of applicability and its high computational complexity. In this paper we explore an energy-efficient technique that is suitable for parallel (GPGPU) stereo matching of remotely-sensed radar images. A major issue with images captured by remote sensing, e.g., by airborne radars, is that they are likely to have speckle noise, which is undesired information that contaminates and distorts the image. Although there are filters that alleviate the effects of speckle noise, they introduce a certain amount of image distortion. It has been demonstrated that cost functions based on Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) can be used for accurate stereo matching in the presence of speckle noise, thus, we explored such a function for passive stereo matching. Accordingly, this paper presents a new NCC-based cost function that minimizes the number of floating-point operations utilized for stereo matching and compares its performance to that of the original NCC cost function. This evaluation is achieved via experiments in which these cost functions are employed by GPGPU stereo matching codes that use the simulated annealing algorithm. Performance comparison is conducted in terms of power and energy consumption and execution time. The dataset consisted of image pairs with two sizes. The smaller images were approximately one megapixel each and the larger image pair was over 42 megapixels each. For the smaller image pairs there was a negligible difference between the floating-point and the integer versions of the code in terms of both the execution time and power consumption. However, for the larger image pair with over 42 megapixels, there was a substantial (nearly 70%) improvement in terms of execution time and energy consumption. In addition, we also investigated the influence of the compute capability of the GPGPU on the results above. Two NVIDIA GPGPUs: a Fermi-based GPGPU with compute capability 2.0 and a more power efficient Kepler-based GPGPU, with compute capability 3.0, were used for this purpose. For the approximately one-megapixel image pairs, the Fermi-based Tesla C2075, had a larger execution time (20%), power consumption (22%), and energy consumption (40%) compared to the newer Kepler-based, GeForce GTX 670.	airborne ranger;algorithm;cuda;code;computational complexity theory;computer stereo vision;computer vision;cross-correlation;distortion;experiment;geforce 600 series;geforce 700 series;general-purpose computing on graphics processing units;kepler;loss function;neural correlates of consciousness;pixel;radar;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulated annealing	Sarala Arunagiri;Jaime Jaloma	2013		10.1117/12.2008565	speckle pattern;computer vision;simulation;distortion;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;optics;physics;radar;computer graphics (images)	Vision	71.22755663089892	-66.71803248452751	130086

However, it suffers from random noise when the number of patterns is less. In this paper, we propose a hybrid pattern coding scheme which embeds Gray coding patterns into high-frequency PMP patterns through amplitude modulation. From captured modulated images, wrapped phase and fringe orders can be simultaneously obtained, and then absolute phase will be computed from the wrapped phase with the fringe orders. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that, compared with standard 3-step PMP, the presented strategy can achieve higher accuracy.	instantaneous phase;modulation;nat port mapping protocol;noise (electronics);signal-to-noise ratio	Yunfei Long;Shuaijun Wang;Wei Wu;Xiaomin Yang;Gwanggil Jeon;Kai Liu	2015	2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)	10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230453	computer vision;electronic engineering;geography;optics	Robotics	73.63717589923408	-69.70467542276424	131349

Due to the specific observation geometry, low values of mispointing angle have been found to significantly affect altimeter impulse response (IR). This involves a nonconventional formulation of the system response which is the main goal of this paper. An analytical model of the average return power waveform, valid for near-nadir altimetry measurements, has been developed in order to cope with the particular operating conditions of Cassini mission. The model used to approximate the altimeter waveform is based on the same general assumptions of the classical Brown's model (1977) but exploits a flat surface response approximation by Prony's methods. Both theoretical considerations and simulated data have been taken into account to support the accuracy of the proposed model. To infer the main geophysical parameters describing surface topography from altimetry data, a parametric estimation procedure has been used. The maximum likelihood estimator procedure has been chosen since, in principle, it can assure optimal performance as a consequence of the analytical model we used to describe the system IR. Performances of the implemented method have been numerically evaluated through simulation of data received by CASSINI in high-resolution altimeter mode.	approximation algorithm;image resolution;numerical analysis;performance;prony's method;response surface methodology;simulation;titan;topography;waveform	Giovanni Alberti;Luca Festa;Claudio Papa;Guido Vingione	2009	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2009.2012718	meteorology;data processing;geodesy;topography;mathematics;maximum likelihood;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Robotics	82.76533158391418	-67.0555304443346	131611
ab6241c77ca899175c27485f50405db64587e97b	visualization of the intensity field of a focused ultrasound source in situ		In an increasing number of applications of focused ultrasound (FUS) therapy, such as opening of the blood–brain barrier or collapsing microbubbles in a tumor, elevation of tissue temperature is not involved. In these cases, real-time visualization of the field distribution of the FUS source would allow localization of the FUS beam within the targeted tissue and allow repositioning of the FUS beam during tissue motion. In this paper, in order to visualize the FUS beam in situ, a 6-MHz single-element transducer ( $f$ /2) was used as the FUS source and aligned perpendicular to a linear array which passively received scattered ultrasound from the sample. An image of the reconstructed intensity field pattern of the FUS source using bistatic beamforming was then superimposed on a registered B-mode image of the sample acquired using the same linear array. The superimposed image is used to provide anatomical context of the FUS beam in the sample being treated. The intensity field pattern reconstructed from a homogeneous scattering phantom was compared with the field characteristics of the FUS source characterized by the wire technique. The beamwidth estimates at the FUS focus using the in situ reconstruction technique and the wire technique were 1.5 and 1.2 mm, respectively. The depth-of-field estimates for the in situ reconstruction technique and the wire technique were 11.8 and 16.8 mm, respectively. The FUS beams were also visualized in a two-layer phantom and a chicken breast. The novel reconstruction technique was able to accurately visualize the field of an FUS source in the context of the interrogated medium.		Trong Nghia Nguyen;Minh N. Do;Michael L.

In this work, the problem of retrieving radar reflectivity of layover areas is addressed. It is formulated as the problem of estimating a multicomponent sinusoidal signal corrupted by multiplicative complex correlated noise and additive white Gaussian noise. Application of nonparametric [e.g., Capon, amplitude and phase estimation filter (APES)], parametric [least squares, modern parametric RELAXation spectral estimator (RELAX)], and hybrid spectral estimators for amplitude estimation is investigated for a multilook scenario. In particular, the multilook extensions of RELAX and APES are applied to the interferometric problem. Performance analysis is investigated through a Cramer-Rao lower bound calculation and Monte Carlo simulation. The method of least squares, coupled with Capon's approach to spatial frequency estimation, multilook APES, and multilook RELAX turn out to provide accurate reflectivity estimates for undistorted multibaseline image formation of layover areas.

The fuzzy logic approach uses the idea to convert the calibration error in a so called linguistic variable defined as the impact of it on the parameter estimation. After an inference step, we obtain a quality matrix that represents the quality index of calibration on the observed variables in different part of the system (transmitting and receiving). This information can be extremely important for the remote monitoring and the realtime diagnosis of the radar system state. The output of the procedure is a diagnostic quality index, useful to establish where and when a technical intervention on the radar system is necessary. Results, using copolar and differential reflectivity, are shown for a C-band weather radar operating in Italy.	deferred procedure call;estimation theory;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;observable;polarimetry;radar;real-time clock;transmitter	Marta Tecla Falconi;Gianfranco Vulpiani;Mario Montopoli;Frank S.

However, when the platform velocity deviates from the theoretical speed, the azimuth signal will be periodic non-uniformly sampled which will produce ambiguities in azimuth direction; therefore the non-uniformly sampled signal must be reconstructed. In this article the non-uniformly sampled signal of DPC-MAB FMCW SAR is presented, and the non-uniformly sampled signal reconstruction algorithm based on Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) is introduced to reconstruct the non-uniformly sampled signal.	algorithm;deferred procedure call;fractional fourier transform;image resolution;modulation;sampling (signal processing);signal reconstruction;velocity (software development)	Qiao Zou;Qin Xin;Pu Cheng	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326847	iterative reconstruction;multidimensional signal processing;signal reconstruction;fourier transform;synthetic aperture radar;mathematical model;pulse-doppler radar;azimuth;optics;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	75.94074495801289	-67.01633551762812	137019

First, a complex image is generated by applying a traditional imaging method to raw echoes. Then, the basis pursuit (BP) method is applied to a CS framework to obtain the scattering coefficients of target points from the complex image. Since CS is applied jointly in range and azimuth, this algorithm utilizes the sparsity of the target scene fully.

Ho4gkiss and D.S. Hansen Marine Physical Laboratory Scripps Institution of Oceanography San Diego, CA 92152 Doppler sonars use the perceived shift in carrier frequency between the outgoing pulse and the returning echo to make an estimate of scatterer radial velocity at several ranges of interest. Scatterers suspended neutrally buoyant in the water column are used as tracers for the remote sensing of water mass motion. Inherently, the problem is one of high resolution (distinguishing small differences in velocity) spectral estimation across segments (range bins) which are too short to provide the desired resolution via conventional methods (FFT) of spectral analysis. In this paper, the application of pth-order autoregressive time series analysis models to the estimation of the time-evolving Doppler sonar reverberation power spectrum is reported. First, with the aid of a reverberation model, it is shown that the spatial transfer function characteristics of a transducer have a significant influence on the time-evolving shape of the reverberation power spectrum. Thus, it is suggested that the use of first-order models for the purpose of Doppler shift estimation simply is inadequate. Then, the results of an exploratory analysis of pings from a 67 kllz Doppler sonar are presented which appears to confirm this caution.	acoustic cryptanalysis;autoregressive model;carrier frequency;doppler effect;fast fourier transform;first-order predicate;image resolution;radial (radio);sonar (symantec);spectral density estimation;spectrum analyzer;time series;transducer;transfer function;velocity (software development)	William S.

But the results of test in the field is beyond theoretical estimations due to sudden changes of the atmospheric conditions which becomes worse under low altitude and long distance between targets. So in this paper, we show distortions of target signatures by atmosphere turbulence using images from the field test for target detection, and also shows linear relations between the target detection rates and its theoretical expectations.	distortion;performance;turbulence;type signature	Jieun Kim;Yeon Soo Kim;Yukyung Yang	2016	2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763405	simulation;geography;optics;remote sensing	Robotics	81.34136979344186	-67.0601262367918	137545

In this paper, we present a novel optimization method of nonlinear unmixing based on a generalized bilinear model (GBM), which considers the second-order scattering of photons in a spectral mixture model. Semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (semi-NMF) is used for the optimization to process a whole image in matrix form. When endmember spectra are given, the optimization of abundance and interaction abundance fractions converge to a local optimum by alternating update rules with simple implementation. The proposed method is evaluated using synthetic datasets considering its robustness for the accuracy of endmember extraction and spectral complexity, and shows smaller errors in abundance fractions rather than conventional methods. GBM-based unmixing using semi-NMF is applied to the analysis of an airborne hyperspectral image taken over an agricultural field with many endmembers, and it visualizes the impact of a nonlinear interaction on abundance maps at reasonable computational cost.	airborne ranger;algorithmic efficiency;bilinear filtering;computation;converge;dhrystone;image processing;local optimum;map;mathematical optimization;mesa;mixture model;non-negative matrix factorization;nonlinear system;semiconductor industry;synthetic intelligence	Naoto Yokoya;Jocelyn Chanussot;Akira Iwasaki	2014	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2013.2251349	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics;statistics	Vision	69.11869147341456	-66.64320784969827	138125

In this paper, we address suppression of front wall clutter prior to image reconstruction for a stepped-frequency radar imaging system, when different sets of few frequency observations are available at different antennas in physical or synthetic aperture arrays. We use a dictionary based on discrete prolate spheroidal sequences to represent the wall return and employ a block sparse model to capture and subsequently remove the wall clutter at each available antenna. The proposed scheme enables sparsity-based image reconstruction techniques to effectively detect and localize behind-the-wall targets from reduced data measurements.	clutter;dictionary;experiment;iterative reconstruction;rejection sampling;sparse matrix;stationary process;synthetic intelligence;zero suppression	Fauzia Ahmad;Jiang Qian;Moeness G.

However, in real-world situations, nonrigid-bodies such as the fast-rotating blades, propellers or turbofans are often present in aircraft. The ISAR image of the main body will be shadowed by the micro-Doppler (m-D) induced by the rotating parts of the target, whereas the m-D parameter estimation of the rotating parts also becomes more difficult because of the interference from the main body returns. To solve this problem, the Doppler frequency difference between the main body and the rotating parts of the aircraft is analyzed and the complex local mean decomposition (CLMD) is applied to separate the m-D signature in the ISAR imaging. The CLMD method can separate the oscillation mode embedded in signals accurately and decompose the complex modulation nonstationary signals adaptively into some stable monocomponents. After the separation, better geometrical features of the main body and better m-D features of the rotating parts can be obtained by processing each independently. The results from the simulated and measured data are given to verify the validity of the algorithm proposed in this paper.	algorithm;aperture (software);computable function;embedded system;emoticon;estimation theory;fm broadcasting;goto;imaginary time;interference (communication);iteration;life model decoy;mean squared error;modulation;motion compensation;normal mode;rotating calipers;simulation;smoothing;synthetic intelligence	Bin Yuan;Zengping Chen;Shiyou Xu	2014	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2013.2249588	computer vision;continuous-wave radar;astronomy;pulse-doppler radar;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar;physics;remote sensing	Vision	74.89725146278336	-67.72517152917052	138705

The effects of multipath signals, separated transmit and receive antennas, and direct antenna coupling are used to explain this anomalous frequency. These effects are mathematically simulated, and the results compare favorably with the test data.	radar	David L. McClanahan;Joseph C. Zuercher;Devendra Misra	1998	IEEE Trans.

One bit coding amounts to retaining only the information about the sign of the signals (signum coding or SC). Theory shows that the image obtained is proportional to that obtained by conventionally quantized data. Possible discrepancies depends on the frequency overlapping among the higher order harmonics generated by the SC operation. To improve the image quality, a sampling rate increase with respect to one consistent with the original signal bandwidth has to be used. Some image quality parameters are also evaluated on actual SAR images.	image quality;oversampling;synthetic data	Vito Pascazio;Gilda Schirinzi	1997		10.1109/ICIP.1997.648099	computer vision;computer science;signal processing;harmonic analysis;mathematics;bandwidth	Vision	73.53329376294661	-69.71665061509293	139941

Whereas, full imaging the continuous reflectivity profile along the elevation dimension is a typical framework to deal with the non-coherent volumetric scatterers in the forested area. Layover usually arises in volumetric scenario and leads to discontinuity in the reconstructed vertical reflectivity image. This paper aims to investigate the possibility of addressing layover issue in forested area by exploiting the unified non-local (NL) filtering of multi-baseline (MB) covariance matrix. To this aim, the performance of non-parametric Capon spectral estimation technique has been analyzed using the NL filtered MB covariance matrix and efficient vertical reflectivity profile reconstruction is demonstrated, which almost addressed the layover issues.	baseline (configuration management);coherence (physics);interference (communication);nl (complexity);pixel;quantum nonlocality;reflections of signals on conducting lines;spectral density estimation;tomography	Hossein Aghababaee;Alessandra Budillon;Giampaolo Ferraioli;Vito Pascazio;Gilda Schirinzi	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128385	computer vision;filter (signal processing);artificial intelligence;iterative reconstruction;elevation;covariance matrix;computer science;synthetic aperture radar;layover;spectral density estimation;image resolution	Vision	73.95410400840031	-66.16258624891006	140523
f62a8a30543912920eab18df33bf2923bd6884e4	gaussian markov random field priors in ionospheric 3-d multi-instrument tomography		In ionospheric tomography, the atmospheric electron density is reconstructed from different electron density related measurements, most often from ground-based measurements of satellite signals. Typically, ionospheric tomography suffers from two major complications. First, the information provided by measurements is insufficient and additional information is required to obtain a unique solution. Second, with necessary spatial and temporal resolutions, the problem becomes very high dimensional, and hence, computationally infeasible. With Bayesian framework, the required additional information can be given with prior probability distributions. The approach then provides physically quantifiable probabilistic interpretation for all model variables. Here, Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) are used for constructing the prior electron density distribution. The use of GMRF introduces sparsity to the linear system, making the problem computationally feasible. The method is demonstrated over Fennoscandia with measurements from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite receiver networks, GNSS occultation receivers, LEO satellite Langmuir probes, and ionosonde and incoherent scatter radar measurements.	3d reconstruction;approximation algorithm;assumed;bayesian network;ct scan;computation;computational complexity theory;electron tomography;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;information systems research;linear system;markov chain;markov random field;mental suffering;normal statistical distribution;numerical analysis;numerous;population parameter;radar;sample variance;satellite dish;satellite navigation;scanning electron microscopy;singular value decomposition;sparse matrix;time complexity;well-posed problem;electron density;exponential	Johannes Norberg;Juha P.

Target's backscattering coefficient is variable at the condition of wide bandwidth and large aspect angle. Considering targets' space-variant and time-variant backscattering, electromagnetic scattering at arbitrary aspect angle and frequency point is calculated accurately by Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD). However, FDTD is a time-domain method causing large computation load, thus a parallel processing scheme is designed to reduce simulation time. It was observed that proposed approach provided higher image quality compared to classical method, and parallel scheme was also verified effective in the experiment.	aperture (software);computation;finite difference;finite-difference time-domain method;image quality;matthews correlation coefficient;parallel computing;simulation	Kai Wang;Jie Chen;Wei Yang;Jian Zhou	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946508	continuous-wave radar;synthetic aperture radar;optics;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar;remote sensing	HPC	76.96828172669889	-67.6920134707047	141160

fee08d7fe6621f8ae332a8c260df541f0f3ccf5d	multi-channel deconvolution for forward-looking phase array radar imaging		Abstract: The cross-range resolution of forward-looking phase array radar (PAR) is limited by the effective antenna beamwidth since the azimuth echo is the convolution of antenna pattern and targets’ backscattering coefficients. Therefore, deconvolution algorithms are proposed to improve the imaging resolution under the limited antenna beamwidth. However, as a typical inverse problem, deconvolution is essentially a highly ill-posed problem which is sensitive to noise and cannot ensure a reliable and robust estimation. In this paper, multi-channel deconvolution is proposed for improving the performance of deconvolution, which intends to considerably alleviate the ill-posed problem of single-channel deconvolution. To depict the performance improvement obtained by multi-channel more effectively, evaluation parameters are generalized to characterize the angular spectrum of antenna pattern or singular value distribution of observation matrix, which are conducted to compare different deconvolution systems. Here we present two multi-channel deconvolution algorithms which improve upon the traditional deconvolution algorithms via combining with multi-channel technique. Extensive simulations and experimental results based on real data are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed imaging methods.	algorithm;angularjs;beamforming;coefficient;convolution;deconvolution;lazy evaluation;radar;radiation pattern;simulation;singular value decomposition;software portability;super-resolution imaging;velocity (software development);well-posed problem	Jie Xia;Xinfei Lu;Weidong Chen	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9070703	wiener deconvolution;computer vision;radar imaging;artificial intelligence;deconvolution;richardson–lucy deconvolution;radiation pattern;blind deconvolution;beamwidth;mathematical optimization;mathematics;phased array	EDA	74.83150012539387	-68.80075554479171	143730

However, it is potentially useful to perform imaging using micro-Doppler signals because they contain information on the geometrical structure of the rotating part. Inspired by the inverse Radon transform, well-known in the image processing community, this paper creates a data-recording model for two-dimensional (2D) ISAR imaging of rotating parts. Based on this model, the real-valued inverse Radon transform is applied to image formation in the range-slow time domain. Then we put forward a complex-valued inverse Radon transform for imaging of rotating parts, which utilizes both the sinusoidal modulus and the phase of the radar echoes. Additionally, we analyze possible problems when applying these algorithms in real world situations and provide corresponding solutions. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithms is demonstrated using simulated and measured data.	algorithm;angularjs;image formation;image processing;interference (communication);modulus robot;radar;simulation	Xueru Bai;Feng Zhou;Meng-dao Xing;Zheng Bao	2011	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2011.6034649	computer vision;image resolution;computer science;signal processing;optics;inverse synthetic aperture radar;remote sensing	Vision	74.62166693695994	-67.76881273909686	145189

The proposed algorithm is optimized for real-time implementation in field-programmable gate arrays. To achieve a very high accuracy, the FMCW radar uses an additional phase evaluation. Therefore, a phase calculation based on the CZT algorithm is derived and compared with a correlation based algorithm. For a better classification of the algorithm, the respective Cramér-Rao bounds are calculated. The performance of the algorithm is shown by the evaluation of different radar measurements with a K-band radar. In the measurements, an accuracy of 5 μm with a mean standard deviation of 774 nm is achieved, which nearly matches the theoretically predicted mean standard deviation of 160 nm.	benchmark (computing);chirp z-transform;community z tools;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;modulation;quantum phase estimation algorithm;radar;real-time clock;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral density estimation;white noise	Steffen Scherr;Serdal Ayhan;Benjamin Fischbach;Akanksha Bhutani;Mario Pauli;Thomas Zwick	2015	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2014.2381354	continuous-wave radar;electronic engineering;radar engineering details;speech recognition;telecommunications;space-time adaptive processing;engineering;passive radar;pulse repetition frequency;pulse-doppler radar	Visualization	76.98264559232412	-67.49295124228759	145467
e53ee3aee8bd9381339b5aeb9c136d611405ae38	statistical properties of marine surface slopes using glitter patterns: the 2-d case		A glitter pattern is a set of bright spots. To have a bright spot on the water, the slope of a point on the sea surface must provide a specular reflection direction of the sunlight to the detector where the image will be created. This interaction is visible for all of us on a clear day with appropriate wind velocities on the sea surface. In this paper, a mathematical methodology was deduced, which is suggested to apply in real images of the sea. First, the suitable 2-D geometry of the reflection situation was determined. Then, the range of the slopes that satisfies the specular reflection condition for each direction was obtained; in addition, the 2-D statistical relationships between the glitter patterns of the sea surface and the sea surface slopes for different wind velocities on the sea surface were deduced using a 2-D Rect and a Gaussian glitter function, considering Gaussian and non-Gaussian probability density functions. Finally, doing parallel computing, the results consistent with the extension of the 1-D case were obtained. This method could be applied on real images, instead of using pressure sensors and others expensive electronic dispositives to model ocean behavior and other various oceanographic studies.	design of experiments;emoticon;incidence matrix;parallel computing;portable document format;sensor	Claudia Andrea Vidales-Basurto;Josu&#x00E9; &#x00C1;lvarez-Borrego	2018	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2018.2833840		Vision	82.66309364429051	-67.49585249551825	146245

SISAL is a linear hyperspectral unmixing method of the minimum volume class. This method solve a non-convex problem by a sequence of augmented Lagrangian optimizations, where the positivity constraints, forcing the spectral vectors to belong to the convex hull of the endmember signatures, are replaced by soft constraints. With respect to SISAL, we introduce a dimensionality estimation method based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated with simulated and real data.	algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;convex hull;convex optimization;minimum description length;sisal;type signature	José M.

In this case the impulse response of each scattering center is represented by a time-delayed Dirac pulse. Some of most popular superresolution imagery techniques, such as MUSIC or ESPRIT, are well-matched to this model. Under this hypothesis, they outperform Fourier-based techniques in terms of both spatial and dynamic resolutions. However, the behavior of real-world targets is often very different from that of the SCM. Indeed, their reflectivity function is not confined just to several perfectly localized scattering centers, but it can be rather approximated by a set of scattering regions having different spatial extent. SCM becomes then inappropriate and the superresolution methods may provide unexpected results. Furthermore, the amplitude information is difficult to interpret in this case. In this paper we propose an extension of two superresolution methods, MUSIC and ESPRIT, to cope with extended scattering centers (ESC). According to this model, the impulse response of an ESC is not a Dirac pulse, but a window of finite support. Besides the position, the size (spatial extent) of this window is also recovered. This additional information about the target structure can be used for increasing ATR (automatic target recognition) accuracy and robustness.	algorithm;apache axis;image resolution;numerical analysis;performance;rp (complexity);radar;super-resolution imaging;window function	Felix Totir;Emanuel Radoi	2009	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2009.04.002	computer vision;impulse response;computer science;music;mathematics;automatic target recognition	Graphics	76.32261208849187	-68.30803604887258	146397

GCF has been used as a weighting factor applied to the conventional image (b-mode), and SLSC has been used as a new standalone image. In this study, a new approach for comparison of both techniques is proposed by using GCF and SLSC as weighting factors and standalone images.

The particular filter employed can remove noise and disturbance while retaining the basic geometry shape of pressure sample signal. This feature allows the filter facilitating signal small and slow change detection. The effect of the structuring element length selection is also analyzed on simulated data to acquire empirical rules for practical applications. An experiment is studied to validate the performance of the employed morphological filter.	closing (morphology);mathematical morphology;pipeline (computing);sensor;signal edge;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral leakage;structuring element;visual inspection	Han Li;De-Yun Xiao;Xiang Zhao	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346676	mathematical morphology;shape;time domain;computer science;noise;pipeline transport;change detection;statistics	Robotics	69.81387560953195	-71.816317764558	149894

Instead of using a probabilistic model, a spatial temporal dynamical model is employed to model the sea scatter phenomenon. Our approach is empirical in the sense that a model is constructed based on experimental data. We extend the approach of using a temporal predictor for temporal dynamical system reconstruction to a spatial temporal predictor for reconstructing a spatial temporal one. The basic spatial temporal dynamical model used in this study is a couple map lattice (CML) rather than the conventional partial differential equation. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network is in- corporated into the CML to enhance the function approximation ability, and the autocorrelation function is used to determine the spatial effect across individual channel. An array antenna was used to collect real spatial temporal sea scattered data for this study. Preliminary results shows that the new model provides an accurate description of the sea scattered signals, and has the potential for signal processing applications.	multipath propagation;subsurface scattering	Henry Leung;Titus K.

eec7bb7abf03ac3c65849e2c270e0901e387b9df	wind direction inversion from narrow-beam hf radar backscatter signals in low and high wind conditions at different radar frequencies		Land-based, high-frequency (HF) surface wave radar has the unique capability of monitoring coastal surface parameters, such as current, waves, and wind, up to 200 km off the coast. The Doppler spectrum of the backscattered radar signal is characterized by two strong peaks that are caused by the Bragg-resonant scattering from the ocean surface. The wavelength of Bragg resonant waves is exactly half the radio wavelength (grazing incidence), and these waves are located at the higher frequency part of the wave spectral distribution. When HF radar operates at higher frequencies, the resonant waves are relatively shorter waves, which are more sensitive to a change in wind direction, and they rapidly respond to local wind excitation and a change in wind direction. When the radar operates at lower frequencies, the corresponding resonant waves are relatively longer and take longer time to respond to a change in wind direction due to the progress of wave growth from short waves to long waves. For the wind inversion from HF radar backscatter signals, the accuracy of wind measurement is also relevant to radar frequency. In this paper, a pattern-fitting method for extracting wind direction by estimating the wave spreading parameter is presented, and a comparison of the pattern-fitting method and a conventional method is given as well, which concludes that the pattern-fitting method presents better results than the conventional method. In order to analyze the wind direction inversion from radar backscatter signals under different wind conditions and at different radar frequencies, two radar experiments accomplished in Norway and Italy are introduced, and the results of wind direction inversion are presented. In the two experiments, the radar worked at 27.68 MHz and 12 MHz, respectively, and the wind conditions at the sea surface were quite different. In the experiment in Norway, 67.4% of the wind records were higher than 5 m/s, while, in the experiment in Italy, only 18.9% of the wind records were higher than 5 m/s.

The spatial and temporal records were transformed to the wavenumber-frequency domain, resulting in a three-dimensional (3-D) image power spectrum. In the spectrum, the signal energy of the waves is localized on a shell defined by the dispersion relation of surface waves. The sum of the sensor's velocity and the near-surface current profile deforms the dispersion shell due to the Doppler-frequency shift. An iterative least-squares fitting technique and an error-estimation model was implemented. To improve the method's accuracy, spectral wave energy found in higher harmonics of the dispersion shell and aliasing effects are taken into account. The most important nonlinear mechanism leading to higher harmonics is explained as resulting from wave shadowing due to the low grazing angles typical for ground- or ship-based radars. The improved method is examined analytically and is tested with Monte Carlo simulations. The variation of the shape of the measured or simulated 3-D image spectra, especially the peak wavenumber, the directional spread, and the main travel direction, controls the behavior and accuracy of the technique. A comparison of velocities acquired by nautical radar and independent Doppler log current measurements is presented. The technique's accuracy, its limits, and its adaptability are discussed.

If not properly handled, ghosts can adversely affect the image interpretation. This paper proposes efficient ghost suppression method which exploits aspect dependence feature of the ghost under CS framework while takes advantage of single-view bistatic radar configuration. The efficacy of the proposed method was scrutinized based on the generalized signal model which mimics the real TWRI scenario that accommodates almost all possible scatterers. Duo sensing matrices are developed such that the ghost's aspect dependence on the resulting images is noticeable.

To deal with these issues, first, a slant range expression is derived based on a geometry model using a circular arc to approximate the curved trajectory in this paper, which is composed of a hyperbolic term, a cubic term, and a quartic term. Then, the imaging flow based on the slant range model is proposed: a cubic filtering in range is employed to normalize the range-variant secondary range compression; the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) is used to correct the additional range displacement introduced by the cubic filtering and the nonlinear range cell migration (RCM) caused by the range dependence of the velocity; necessary modifications are made on the matched filter for azimuth compression to accommodate the cubic filtering in range and to deal with the high-order terms of the slant range model. The simulation results show that the proposed slant range model has a relatively high accuracy; the range processing procedure that involves an NUFFT following a cubic filtering can apply to the case where the nonlinear chirp scaling algorithm is adopted, and it has the advantage of being capable of dealing with the nonlinear RCM; the azimuth processing procedure can provide satisfactory focusing qualities over a rather large azimuth extent.	approximation algorithm;chirp;cubic function;displacement mapping;doppler effect;fast fourier transform;first-order predicate;image resolution;image scaling;matched filter;monomial;motion compensation;network computing system;nonlinear system;normalization (image processing);quartic function;regular expression;reliability-centered maintenance;simulation;synthetic data;velocity (software development);whole earth 'lectronic link	Shuo Zhao;Yunkai Deng;Robert Wang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2016.2615000	computer vision;synthetic aperture radar;trajectory;earth;azimuth;optics;physics;satellite;remote sensing	Robotics	76.12343125665762	-67.66038299198298	152933

169e76c7e6645d72c5acefce6576c1408113777b	knowledge-based generalized side-lobe canceller for ionospheric clutter suppression in hfswr		High frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) has been successfully developed for early warning and remote sensing. However, the ionospheric clutter is a difficult challenge that can make HFSWR system inefficient. The Generalized Side-lobe Canceller (GSC) has been proved to be an effective algorithm for clutter suppression in theory, but it suffers from the performance degradation for some non-ideal conditions in practice. The most intolerable shortcoming is the signal to noise ratio (SNR) loss caused by the residual signal in the secondary data. In this paper, a knowledge-based GSC (KB-GSC) method has been proposed via an adaptive single notch filter design to reject the residual signal for reducing the SNR loss. The feasibility and availability has been demonstrated by measured data.	acoustic lobing;algorithm;clutter;elegant degradation;filter design;gsc bus;signal-to-noise ratio;surface wave;zero suppression	Xin Zhang;Di Yao;Qiang Yang;Yingning Dong;Weibo Deng	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10010104	artificial intelligence;geology;residual;computer vision;band-stop filter;radar;clutter;side lobe;surface wave;signal-to-noise ratio;warning system;electronic engineering	Mobile	76.84875991776278	-67.35695357653297	154540

To reduce the atmosphere effect, large telescopes are provided with adaptive optics (AO) systems, which adapt their shape to the current atmospheric turbulence. As shown in recent works [6],[5], the AO systems performance can be significatively improved by taking advantage of the knowledge of the current turbulence characteristics. In this paper we formalize the problem of estimating such turbulence dynamic characteristics by using the measurements provided by a multi-conjugated adaptive optics (MCAO) system. From a temporal dynamics point of view, the turbulence here is represented as the superposition of a finite set of layers, which are characterized by their velocities, energies and altitudes. Taking advantage of a spatial innovation representation of the turbulence, we provide conditions on the identifiability of such parameters and bounds on the estimation errors. Finally, we propose a procedure for the estimation of the turbulence structure (number of layers, their velocities, energies and altitudes) and we test its performances in simulations.	ambient occlusion;performance;simulation;turbulence	Alessandro Beghi;Angelo Cenedese;Andrea Masiero	2010	49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2010.5717146	aperture;atmospheric model;k-epsilon turbulence model;sensor;computer performance;adaptive optics;atmospheric optics;correlation	Visualization	81.0480677894326	-68.5098833824014	155483

Nevertheless, operating near and below the threshold SNR value might be necessary for many remote sensing applications due to power-related constraints. These constraints may include a limit on the maximum power of a single source pulse or a limit on the total power used by multiple signals transmitted during a single measurement. For narrow-band signals, the threshold effect emerges mostly due to outliers induced by local maxima of the autocorrelation function of a source signal. Following the previously explored path of biosonar-inspired echo processing, this paper introduces a new method for ToF estimation in the presence of outliers. The proposed method employs a bank of phase-shifted unmatched filters for generating multiple biased but only partially correlated estimators (multiple experts). Using machine learning techniques, the information from the multiple experts is combined together for improving the near-the-threshold ToF estimation from a single echo.	autocorrelation;machine learning;maxima and minima;maximum power transfer theorem;signal-to-noise ratio;whole earth 'lectronic link	Alexander Apartsin;Leon N.

This new model not only generalizes the commonly used linear mixing model but also allows for possible nonlinear effects to be handled, relying on mild assumptions regarding these nonlinearities. Based on this model, a nonlinear unmixing procedure is proposed. The standard nonnegativity and sum-to-one constraints inherent to spectral unmixing are coupled with a group-sparse constraint imposed on the nonlinearity component. The resulting objective function is minimized using a multiplicative algorithm. Simulation results obtained on synthetic and real data show that the proposed strategy competes with state-of-the-art linear and nonlinear unmixing methods.	algorithm;linear model;loss function;non-negative matrix factorization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;simulation;sparse matrix;synthetic intelligence;type signature	Nicolas Dobigeon;Cédric Févotte	2013	2013 5th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)	10.1109/WHISPERS.2013.8080681	computer vision;artificial intelligence;mathematics;cartography	ML	68.65108662794468	-66.80205406398633	156509

When combined with the recently developed beam multiplexing (BMX) technique, these radars can obtain very rapid update scans that are useful in monitoring severe weather. A consequence is that the small number of contiguous samples of the time series obtained can be a challenge for temporal/spectral filters used for clutter mitigation. As a result, the accurate extraction of weather signals can become the limiting performance barrier for PARs that employ BMX in clutter-dominated scattering fields. By exploiting the spatial correlation of the auxiliary channel signals, the effect of clutter contamination can be reduced in these conditions. In this paper, three spatial filtering techniques that used low-gain auxiliary receive channels are presented. The effect of clutter mitigation was studied using numerical simulations of a tornadic environment for changes in signal-to-noise ratio, clutter-to-signal ratio, number of time series samples, varying clutter spectral widths, and maximum weight constraints. Since such data are not currently available from a horizontally pointed phased array weather radar, experimental validation was applied to an existing data set from the turbulent eddy profiler, which is a vertically pointed PAR. Although preliminary, the results show promise for clutter mitigation with extremely short nonuniform sampling.	clutter;nonuniform sampling;numerical analysis;phased array;radar;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spin contamination;time series;turbulence;wavelength-division multiplexing	Khoi D.

In this letter, we investigate the important problem of identifying the hyperspectral signal subspace by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the true signal and an estimate of the signal. Since it is dependent on the true signal, the MSE is uncomputable in practice, and so we propose a method based on Stein's unbiased risk estimator that provides an unbiased estimate of the MSE. The resulting method is simple and fully automatic, and we evaluate it using both simulated and real hyperspectral data sets. Experimental results show that our proposed method compares well to recent state-of-the-art subspace identification methods.	algorithm;experiment;horizontal situation indicator;mean squared error;noise power;performance;signal subspace;sparse matrix	Behnood Rasti;Magnus Orn Ulfarsson;Johannes R.

It achieves a free switch in the spotlight, stripmap, scanSAR, wave, global observation and other imaging modes. In order to further utilize GF-3 SAR images, an automatic and fast image registration procedure needs to be done. In this paper, we propose a novel image registration technique for GF-3 images of different imaging modes. The proposed algorithm consists of two stages: coarse registration and fine registration. In the first stage, we combine an adaptive sampling method with the SAR-SIFT algorithm to efficiently eliminate obvious translation, rotation and scale differences between the reference and sensed images. In the second stage, uniformly-distributed control points are extracted, then the fast normalized cross-correlation of an improved phase congruency model is utilized as a new similarity metric to match the reference image and the coarse-registered image in a local search region. Moreover, a selection strategy is used to remove outliers. Experimental results on several GF-3 SAR images of different imaging modes show that the proposed algorithm gives a robust, efficient and precise registration performance, compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms for SAR image registration.	adaptive sampling;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;align (company);aperture (software);c++;computation;control point (mathematics);cross-correlation;dbpedia;distortion;distributed control system;existential quantification;experiment;extraction;frontotemporal dementia, chromosome 3-linked;gram-force;grammatical framework;image registration;largest;local search (optimization);nr1i2 wt allele;neural correlates of consciousness;numerous;phase congruency;piecewise linear continuation;projections and predictions;real-time clock;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;satellite viruses;scale-invariant feature transform;similarity measure;stage level 1;stage level 2;water resources;registration - actclass	Yuming Xiang;Feng Wang;Hongjian You	2018		10.3390/s18020672	phase congruency;engineering;normalization (statistics);synthetic aperture radar;local search (optimization);satellite;image registration;adaptive sampling;algorithm	Vision	75.29335900216402	-69.05709034036632	160840

One of them is phase diversity, for which the joint least-square approach introduced by Gonsalves et al. is a reference method to estimate phase coefficients from the recorded images. In this paper, we rely on the asymptotic theory of Toeplitz matrices to show that Gonsalves' technique provides a consistent phase estimator as the size of the images grows. No comparable result is yielded by the classical joint maximum likelihood interpretation (e.g., as found in the work by Paxman et al.). Finally, our theoretical analysis is illustrated through simulated problems.	coefficient;karp's 21 np-complete problems;pupil;telescopes;toeplitz hash algorithm;word lists by frequency	Jérôme Idier;Laurent M.

NUFFT contributes to SAR imaging and Near-Space SAR also becomes popular recently years. It is difficult to get accurate SAR image in Near-Space because of the obvious motion error and Wide-Swath when the vehicle is slow, so we propose an approach which uses twice NUFFT in ω - k algorithm to solve the problem in this paper. The first NUFFT can solve non-uniform sampling along the track, the second NUFFT can replace the Stolt interpolation and the final range inverse FFT in ω - k algorithm to increase the computational efficiency without reducing the accuracy of the SAR image. The new method is especially suited for Near-Space SAR imaging when the speed of the vehicle is slow.	algorithm;fast fourier transform;interpolation;medical imaging;motion compensation;nonuniform sampling;sampling (signal processing)	Haiguang Yang;Ye Yuan;Junjie Wu;Yulin Huang;Jianyu Yang	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350564	computer vision;fast fourier transform;synthetic aperture radar;geology;computer science;radar imaging;motion compensation;remote sensing	Robotics	75.27654687168713	-67.02303293878636	162476

We have already proposed a high-speed 3-D imaging algorithm, SEABED, which is based on a reversible transform, which is the boundary scattering transform, between the received signals and the target shape. However, the estimated image with SEABED is unstable with random noise because it utilizes a derivative of the received data. In this paper, we propose a robust 3-D imaging algorithm with an envelope of spheres that completely resolves the instability due to derivative operations. Moreover, to enhance the resolution of estimated images, this method is combined with a direct waveform compensation method that does not sacrifice high-speed calculation. Numerical simulations and an experiment confirm that the proposed method can realize fast, robust, and high-resolution 3-D imaging for arbitrary targets.	algorithm;computational fluid dynamics;control theory;download;image resolution;instability;near field communication;noise (electronics);numerical linear algebra;radar;real-time clock;reflector (antenna);simulation;ultra-wideband;waveform	Shouhei Kidera;Takuya Sakamoto;Toru Sato	2008	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2008.922319	computer simulation;medical imaging;image resolution;accuracy and precision;optics;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Visualization	75.5813242873094	-67.44337243054888	162554

One drawback is the appearance of artifacts due to scatterer interactions within the target. This paper defines a modified bicoherence, based on a specific target scattering model, to distinguish target scattering centers from target interactions and develop target-specific features for identification. Third-order statistics such as the bicoherence measure the asymmetric properties of distributions and are therefore zero for Gaussian processes such as additive white Gaussian noise. In addition to scatterer range, the model-based bicoherence described in this paper can also estimate the scatterer separation distance. This target information can be used for defining a feature set for target identification that is independent of target aspect angle, assuming the target is modeled as a collection of point scatterers. This information can also be used to determine subspace separation in eigenspace techniques such as the MUSIC algorithm, thereby increasing ISAR image accuracy.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;feature extraction;gaussian process;interaction;radar;utility functions on indivisible goods	Jon Mitchell;Saibun Tjuatja	2013	2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS	10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723711	computer vision;synthetic aperture radar;feature extraction;music;fourier analysis;optics;radar imaging;bicoherence;remote sensing	Robotics	73.76313912280403	-67.89730787975856	163305

A persistent question in the development and use of such tools is that of appropriate level of fidelity. In this paper we look at one problem area encountered in the simulation of panchromatic and other broadband imaging systems, that of accounting for spectrally varying resolution over the band. An established method for treating this variation is that of the polychromatic optical transfer function (OTF), but this technique imposes a measure of complexity on the simulation tool software architecture, as well as on users who must subsequently interact with it. We present a methodology for assessing the required level of fidelity for this problem and show that under some conditions it appears possible to forgo the polychromatic OTF formalism, or else to treat it with less than full rigor, with minimal loss in accuracy. © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

We discuss two imaging scenarios — radar and Fourier optics — where convolution with a random pulse allows us to seemingly super-resolve fine-scale features, allowing us to recover high-resolution signals from low-resolution measurements.	chroma subsampling;compressed sensing;convolution;data acquisition;image resolution;radar;sparse matrix;waveform	Justin K.

This situation is about to change as many navies are experimenting with reduced manning concepts. As a result, tomorrow's sensor operator is likely to monitor and control all available sensors on his own. In this situation operator overload is expected, especially due to less educated and less experienced personnel and the introduction of new and more complex sensor systems. A possible solution is a high level of automation in sensor management and the integration of tactical decision aids. To further assist the human operator, this work aims to unify sensor performance modeling for the complete sensor suite. The radar and sonar equations are compared and combined with a propagation model for complex environments. The analysis of a real-world scenario with both radar and sonar is shown to result in a unified visualization of predicted sensor coverage.	experiment;fits;han unification;high-level programming language;performance prediction;radar;sonar (symantec);sensor;software propagation;unification (computer science)	Vincent van Leijen;Wilbert van Norden;Fok Bolderheij	2009	2009 12th International Conference on Information Fusion		computer vision;electronic engineering;engineering;remote sensing	Robotics	81.01499250328625	-70.1122978169542	166148

We first show the equivalence between the fully constrained least-squares problem and the convex set projection problem. Next, an alternating projections algorithm is designed that can be used for this projection operation. A validation phase is built in the algorithm, so that the iteration can be terminated early when the projection has been found. The resulting algorithm yields abundance maps that are similar to those obtained with state-of-the-art methods, with runtimes that are competitive compared to several other techniques. Furthermore, the simple nature of the algorithm allows for efficient implementations on specialized hardware.	algorithm;convex set;iteration;least squares;map;turing completeness	Rob Heylen;Muhammad Awais Akhter;Paul Scheunders	2013	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2013.2261276	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;dykstra's projection algorithm;mathematics	ML	69.46627054640439	-67.13903148023391	166645

97c94c25b3ae6a13152bb6bd09f88aebb688d09f	on the formalization of cardinal points of optical systems		Optical systems are widely used in safety critical applications such as aerospace, telecommunication and biomedical systems. The verification of such systems is usually performed by informal techniques (e.g., numerical simulation and paper-and-pencil based proofs) which may result in erroneous designs. Interactive theorem proving has the potential to verify complex optical designs with better accuracy and soundness. However, existing formalizations of optics theories do not provide the facility to analyze optical imaging properties which are used to characterize the behavior of objects under observation (e.g., cancer cells, human eye or commercial camera lenses). In this paper, we present the formalization of cardinal points which are the most fundamental requirement to model imaging properties. We also present the formal verification of the cardinal points for an arbitrary optical system consisting of any number of optical components. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of our formalization, we present the formal analysis of an optical instrument used to compensate the ametropia of an eye.	algorithm;automated theorem proving;computer simulation;correctness (computer science);formal methods;formal verification;linear algebra;numerical analysis;proof assistant;ray tracing (graphics)	Umair Siddique;Sofiène Tahar	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-16577-6_4	theoretical computer science;computer science;automated theorem proving;mathematical proof;formal verification;computer simulation;optical instrument;soundness;proof assistant;lens (optics)	EDA	78.93596297213018	-71.77051475232402	168443

In this paper, a new method for mitigating the range-dependence of the clutter spectrum based on the geometry-aided subspace projection is proposed. In the proposed method, the clutter covariance matrix of the range under test is firstly constructed based on the prior knowledge of antenna array configuration, and then the clutter subspace projection matrix is obtained by decomposing the corresponding covariance matrix. In the following, the mitigation of the range-dependence is accomplished by applying this clutter subspace projection matrix to transform the secondary range samples to obtain an approximate clutter subspace with the range under test. The simulation results show that the proposed method can mitigate the range-dependence significantly.	airborne ranger;approximation algorithm;clutter;radar;simulation;space-time adaptive processing;zero suppression	Xiaopeng Yang;Yongxu Liu;Teng Long	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352205	computer vision;continuous-wave radar;radar engineering details;radar lock-on;radar horizon;envelope;constant false alarm rate;clutter;radar imaging;side looking airborne radar;remote sensing	Robotics	75.73440066641068	-67.00526280278665	168852

In particular, we demonstrate that for a typical UXO target set, when data in the range 30 Hz to 24 kHz are extended downward toward 1-Hz discrimination performance improves by a factor of 1.5. Measurements and numerical simulations show that very low frequency magnetic fields penetrate deep into the target, enabling one to discriminate between thick- and thin-walled ferrous cylinders that are otherwise visually identical. Data acquisition at extremely low frequencies is a time-consuming process especially if data averaging is required to achieve acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, in practice, discrimination improvement using ELF is probably best carried out using a """"cued"""" approach. In a """"cued"""" approach, target locations would be marked using another detection technique (e.g., a simple total-field magnetometer), and the low-frequency CW EMI system would be deployed to these known target locations for classification."""	data acquisition;emi;ibm naval ordnance research calculator;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;system of measurement	Sailaja V.

Calibrating along multiple directions in the sky and removing the bright foreground signal is a crucial step in many science cases in radio interferometry. The residual data contain weak signals of huge scientific interest and of particular concern is the effect of incomplete sky models used in calibration on the residual. In order to study this, we consider the mapping between the input uncalibrated data and the output residual data. We derive an analytical relationship between the input and output probability density functions which can be used to study the performance of calibration.	algorithmic efficiency;input/output;mathematical optimization;profiling (computer programming)	Sarod Yatawatta	2018	2018 IEEE 10th Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop (SAM)	10.1109/SAM.2018.8448481	mathematical optimization;physics;calibration;residual;astronomical interferometer;probability density function;computer vision;input/output;artificial intelligence;lofar;data modeling;interferometry	Visualization	73.11030053288896	-68.21131085514502	169660
57b5848dbca8cfb92dfc404876de546ebd13ef64	multiobjective genetic optimization of terrain-independent rfms for vhsr satellite images		Rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) biases and over-fitting phenomenon are two major issues in terrain-independent rational function models. These problems degrade the accuracy of extracted spatial information from very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite images. This study particularly focused on overcoming the over-fitting problem through an optimal term selection approach. To this end, multiobjective genetic algorithm was used in order to optimize three effective objective functions: the RMSE of ground control points (GCPs), the number, and the distribution of both RPCs and GCPs. Finally, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution, as an efficient multicriteria decision-making method, was applied to select the best solution, i.e., the optimum terms of RPCs, through the ranking of solutions in the optimum set. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by using three VHSR images acquired by GeoEye-1, Worldview-3, and Pleiades satellite sensors. Experimental results show that subpixel accuracy can be nearly achieved in all data sets, when over-fitting problem is addressed. The optimal selected terms leaded to a significant improvement compared to the original RPCs. Indeed, our method, which is independent of GCPs distribution, not only requires a small number of GCPs, but also leads to a 30% to 75% improvement when compared to the original RPCs. This improvement in VHSR images, usually makes no more need to remove the RPCs biases.	coefficient;genetic algorithm;overfitting;pixel;pleiades (supercomputer);polynomial;sensor	Amin Alizadeh Naeini;Sayyed Hamed Alizadeh Moghaddam;Sayyed Mohammad Javad Mirzadeh;Saeid Homayouni;Sayyed Bagher Fatemi	2017	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2017.2712810	mathematics;genetic algorithm;spatial analysis;mathematical optimization;image resolution;rational function;data set;small number;ranking;phenomenon	AI	69.56023583882899	-67.05415520194515	170942

This paper focuses on a new implementation of the first stage, i.e., the range resampling, using the chirp z-transform (CZT). The presented algorithm requires no interpolation. It works for the SAR system directly digitizing the echo signal, as well as that employing the dechirp-on-receive approach. The parameters of the CZT, including the frequency spacing and the start frequency, are derived to accommodate the PFA in both cases. Related filtering and compensation procedures are developed for the chirp z-transformed range signal with and without dechirp, respectively, in order to achieve a signal format entirely suitable for the azimuth resampling. Furthermore, incorporating the new algorithm with the existing CZT-based azimuth resampling and focusing algorithm, we can achieve a PFA totally free of interpolation. The presented approach has been validated by point target simulation, and the test is carried out with a very critical relative bandwidth of 30%	aperture (software);bandwidth (signal processing);chirp z-transform;circuit complexity;community z tools;dbpedia;image formation;image scaling;interpolation;keystone effect;linear phase;matched filter;modulation;phase-locked loop;predictive failure analysis;prime-factor fft algorithm;resampling (statistics);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;synthetic data;whole earth 'lectronic link	Daiyin Zhu;Zhaoda Zhu	2007	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2006.887144	medical imaging;fourier transform;computer vision;mathematics	Visualization	76.20984618814042	-67.8621110689969	171345

In the measurements of such fast phenomena, the thermal noise by the camera to record the interferogram results in a significant error and the signal becomes weak owing to the short exposure time of the camera. When the noise level is high, a process to denoise wrapped phase should be added before phase unwrapping in order to obtain an optical distance distribution. The thermal noise has a uniform spatial distribution; however, the signal depends on a profile of the incident wave to the interferometer. This means that the signal to noise ratio has a spatial distribution. This paper proposes the denoising method that can take account of the weight of the data that depends on the signal intensity distribution. In order to determine the denoised phase, two cost functions are examined. One is a complex-valued cost function that can ensure convergence of iterative method to obtain the stationary point; however, it is not proved that both the real part and the imaginary part are minimized at the stationary point. The other is a real-valued cost function that cannot ensure the convergence but it minimizes the cost function at the stationary point. The numerical simulation demonstrates the validity of the weighted denoising and the applicability of the cost functions.	algebraic equation;algorithm;computer simulation;imaginary time;instantaneous phase;iterative method;johnson–nyquist noise;linear equation;loss function;noise (electronics);noise reduction;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;pixel;signal-to-noise ratio;stationary process;stationary state;time complexity	Satoshi Tomioka;Shusuke Nishiyama	2014		10.1117/12.2039390	astronomical interferometer;mathematical optimization;noise reduction;iterative method;optics;signal-to-noise ratio;physics	Robotics	72.40896675406614	-68.32972251067547	171545

With the launch of the European satellite ENVISAT, SAR look cross spectra (SLCS) have become available on an operational basis. Activities therefore exist at different European weather centres to use the data for assimilation into numerical wave models. Furthermore there is scientific interest in SLCS, e.g., concerning the estimation of the phase speed of ocean waves. For the estimation of ocean wave parameters, it is important to have information about the accuracy of SLCS. In this paper, errors of estimated SLCS due to SAR image speckle, spectral estimation errors, and image pattern decorrelation associated with ocean wave motion are analyzed. A probability model is proposed for the estimated SLCS based on the respective cross-spectrum coherence. The model is used to calculate signal-to-noise ratios and confidence limits for the SLCS phase and magnitude, as well as the real and imaginary part. The coherence is factored into a component describing look decorrelation due to SAR image speckle and a second factor describing the effect of sea surface motion. It is shown that the ocean-wave-dependent decorrelation can be simulated using existing nonlinear integral transforms for the look variance spectrum and the SLCS. The decorrelation effect associated with speckle noise is related to SAR system parameters, e.g., the spatial SAR resolution. The probability model is used to investigate the optimal choice of look processing parameters like the look separation time. A statistical analysis based on a global dataset of a reprocessed dataset of European Remote Sensing 2 satellite SLCS is presented confirming the applicability of the probability model. The implications of the results for the retrieval of two-dimensional wave spectra from SLCS are summarized. Possible future applications of the model like, for example, the investigation of the turbulent air flow over waves, are discussed.	a new kind of science;aperture (software);approximation;bessel filter;coupling (computer programming);data assimilation;decorrelation;expectation value (quantum mechanics);hp 48 series;image formation;image noise;imaginary time;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;portable document format;signal-to-noise ratio;smoothing;spectral density estimation;statistical model;synthetic data;turbulence	Johannes Schulz-Stellenfleth;Susanne Lehner	2005	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2005.846871	meteorology;wind wave;mathematics;accuracy and precision;optics;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Vision	80.12199497170134	-67.43245967627605	171611

The algorithms investigated here, Beamformer, Capon and MUSIC, have a relatively low numerical complexity and varying levels of resolution. A novel approach is developed to estimate 3-D full rank polarimetric covariance matrices with HR spatial properties.	algorithm;beamforming;image resolution;numerical analysis;polarimetry;polarization (waves);spectral density estimation;tomography	Laurent Ferro-Famil;Yue Huang;Stefano Tebaldini	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730487	computer vision;estimation;linear programming;multiple signal classification;reflectivity;tomography;optics;scattering;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Robotics	73.85742409713671	-66.39513045694494	172060

This can cause an effect known as azimuth scalloping, a wavelike modulation of the image intensity in near-azimuth direction. In theory, azimuth scalloping can be straightened out by using appropriate beam pattern corrections and multilooking techniques in the SAR processor. This works well over land, but lower signal-to-noise ratios and less accurate Doppler centroid estimates over water cause significant residual scalloping in many ScanSAR images of ocean scenes. The scalloping patterns hamper a correct interpretation of signatures of wind streaks, waves, and other phenomena. To overcome this problem once and for all, we have developed an algorithm that can eliminate scalloping patterns from existing ScanSAR images by postprocessing. Our algorithm detects the dominant scalloping pattern in an image automatically and eliminates most of it with very small side effects. We treat the scalloping pattern as a multiplicative effect, i.e., the amplitude spectrum of an affected image is assumed to be the convolution of the amplitude spectra of the unscalloped image and of the scalloping pattern. The proposed descalloping technique works partly in the spatial and partly in the spectral domain to approximate an exact deconvolution. We give a detailed technical description, show example results, and perform a quality analysis. We demonstrate the positive effects of the proposed descalloping treatment with a wind field retrieval example.	antivirus software;approximation algorithm;cosmo-rs;convolution;deconvolution;doppler effect;iteration;modulation;radiation pattern;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial variability;spectral density;synthetic data;typhoon	Roland Romeiser;Jochen Horstmann;Michael J.

0fb62a677a9f77a48e85662102d5e3105c2a5c4c	an endmember initialization scheme for nonnegative matrix factorization and its application in hyperspectral unmixing		Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a blind source separation (BSS) method often used in hyperspectral unmixing. However, it tends to converge to a local optimum. To overcome this limitation, we present a simple, but effective endmember initialization scheme for NMF, which is realized by improving initial values through the application of the automatic target generation process (ATGP) algorithm. The initial spectra and abundances of target endmembers are first obtained using the ATGP algorithm and nonnegative least squares (NNLS) method, respectively. The preliminary results are then optimized through iterative application of NMF. To validate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method, we analyzed the improvement of NMF by the ATGP algorithm, using the synthetic hyperspectral data and real hyperspectral images. The results from the proposed method are compared with those of the vertex component analysis (VCA)-NMF algorithm, which uses the VCA algorithm to perform initialization for NMF, the minimum volume constrained NMF (MVC-NMF) algorithm, the traditional two-step VCA-fully-constrained least squares (FCLS) algorithm, which uses the VCA to extract the endmember matrix, and the FCLS algorithm to estimate the abundance matrix. The comparison results prove that proper endmember initialization can help the NMF algorithm yield better estimation results. Through the optimization of target endmembers’ initial values, the proposed ATGP-NMF algorithm can consistently produce good results at a lower computational cost, especially in the case of a real hyperspectral image for which pure pixels do not exist and there is little prior knowledge. With its high applicability and effectiveness, the ATGP-NMF algorithm has a great potential to solve hyperspectral unmixing problems.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;blind signal separation;computation;converge;experiment;iterative method;linear least squares (mathematics);local optimum;mathematical optimization;model–view–controller;non-negative least squares;non-negative matrix factorization;performance;pixel;rca spectra 70;source separation;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;time complexity;video content analysis	Jingjing Cao;Li Zhuo;Haiyan Tao	2018	ISPRS Int.

Here, the impact of the EarthCARE cloud profiling radar (CPR) receiver saturation on the quality of the surface Doppler velocity measurements is discussed. The CPR linear receiver is expected to saturate always from surface echoes. Our results based on an I/Q simulation framework show that for the EarthCARE radar configuration: 1) biases introduced by saturation will be negligible; 2) the standard deviation of the velocity estimates will increase by 30-50% when moving from unsaturated to completely saturated surface return for a corresponding pulse repetition frequency in the range between 6.1 and 7.5 kHz. As a consequence longer integration times will be necessary to achieve the same accuracy in presence of complete saturation.	radar;simulation;surround sound;velocity (software development)	Alessandro Battaglia;Pavlos Kollias	2015	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2014.2335896	meteorology;early-warning radar;continuous-wave radar;space-based radar;radar engineering details;radar lock-on;atmospheric sciences;radar configurations and types;passive radar;radar horizon;bistatic radar;pulse repetition frequency;pulse-doppler radar;3d radar;radar imaging;radar display;wave radar;radar;remote sensing;low-frequency radar	Embedded	81.40711031398968	-66.64648410804259	174059

However, this assumption does not hold for the medium-Earth-orbit (MEO) SAR systems due to the significantly longer azimuth integration time and complex imaging geometries. As a result, the MEO SAR data cannot be processed accurately and efficiently using the existing algorithms. To solve this problem, this letter proposes a two-step azimuth perturbation (AP) method that uses the first-step AP to remove the bulk azimuth variance at the range processing stage and the second-step AP to remove the residual variance at the azimuth processing stage. As an example, an improved range Doppler algorithm with the integrated two-step AP is discussed in this letter. Simulations of an L-band MEO SAR with 5-m resolution at 10 000-km orbit height are used to demonstrate the validity and accuracy of this algorithm.	algorithm;aperture (software);computer simulation;geosynchronous orbit;human height;l band;perturbation theory;synthetic intelligence	Lijia Huang;Xiaolan Qiu;Donghui Hu;Bing Han;Chibiao Ding	2015	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2014.2353674	geophysics;early-warning radar;continuous-wave radar;space-based radar;synthetic aperture radar;geodesy;pulse-doppler radar;3d radar;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar;remote sensing	Robotics	76.09744071936964	-66.96123475266845	174245

By exploiting the vertically stratified nature of ocean currents, we show how classical multi-robot tasks (spreading out and aggregation) can be accomplished by the multi-drifter system. Tests with a realistic simulation based on an ocean model suggest that a practical implementation of active drifters which aggregate and disperse in the coastal ocean could be realized through our control method with relatively inexpensive components. Specifically, we are able to show that over a 90 day deployment a significant fraction of drifters can be made to aggregate in few clusters suitable for recovery.	aggregate data;robot;simulation;software deployment	Artem Molchanov;Andreas Breitenmoser;Gaurav S.

To acquire Doppler frequency shift, FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) method is conducted. It is used for the transformation of time domain signal to frequency domain data. A time and radial velocity resolution can be determined by sampling frequency and number of FFT which is used for acquiring velocity data. A number of FFT can be constrained by acceleration and sample frequency is constrained by maximum target velocity. So in this paper, not only the sample frequency effect on time and radial velocity resolution, but also effect on the SNR(Signal to Noise Ratio) to increase measurement accuracy and range performance is described.	diversification (finance);fast fourier transform;radar;radial (radio);sampling (signal processing);velocity (software development)	Yong-Sik Jang;Chung-Ho Ryu;Ik-Hwan Choi;Seung-Oh Yoo	2013	2013 International Conference on ICT Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2013.6675543	continuous-wave radar;electronic engineering;geography;analytical chemistry;monopulse radar;pulse repetition frequency;pulse-doppler radar;nuclear magnetic resonance;frequency domain;acoustic doppler velocimetry	Robotics	76.95098915662606	-67.31811236233465	174562

It is notably difficult to access the interior regions in which planetary formation and dynamics take place. This paper presents the possibility that radar measurements could contribute to the understanding of interior structure, particularly that of Enceladus, the small but notably dynamic icy moon of Saturn. The application of such radar may lead to discoveries concerning formation mechanisms and surface processes. Additionally, radar sounding will contribute measurements that aid in diagnosing the dynamics system at work in the subsurface - perhaps most notably, the source reservoir and/or dynamics of the observed water plume at the moon's south pole, in addition the moon's role as a whole in the Saturnian system.	automatic sounding;icy;planetary scanner;plume (fluid dynamics);radar	Catherine C.

In order to decrease the influence of variable motion information, a kind of MOCO approach called azimuth-subaperture processing is widely used, which causes the azimuth-signal aliasing in squint SAR mode. Usually, this aliasing can be ignored, since its effect on final results is not worth mentioning. However, when the squint angle grows, it becomes serious and drops the quality of final images severely. To address this problem, an improved MOCO approach is proposed in this paper.

The shadow ghost moves as the human target does, which makes causal change detection (CD) invalid to separate them. To mitigate the shadow ghost, we analyze its differences from the moving human target. Based on the difference that the illumination is only blocked in partial channels of the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) array while target echoes exist in most channels and the fact that shadow ghosts overlap more between successive indication results than the imaged targets as a result of their larger size, we proposed a mitigation method including a coherence factor and noncausal CD processing. Through-wall experiments via a MIMO through-wall imaging radar validate the proposed method.	blocking (computing);causal filter;experiment;ghost in the shell;illumination (image);mimo;shadow copy	Jun Hu;Yongping Song;Tian Jin;Biying Lu;Guofu Zhu;Zhimin Zhou	2015	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2014.2345777	continuous-wave radar;radar engineering details;radar lock-on;moving target indication;space-time adaptive processing;fire-control radar;bistatic radar;low probability of intercept radar;envelope;pulse-doppler radar;optics;radar imaging;remote sensing	Mobile	73.99007462252155	-67.92680925788497	175835

df9190ceb43b2ecf4cd532aad7eb3ea28789c344	scalable algorithm for polarization constrained sparse interferometric stokes imaging		Polarized emissions from various astrophysical sources provide an additional means to infer the properties of the source. This information can be extracted by imaging the Stokes parameters characterizing these emissions, from the incomplete Fourier sampling measurements provided by the radio interferometer. To solve the corresponding ill-posed inverse problem, we recently proposed the Polarized SARA method which exploits the polarization constraint along with imposing an average sparsity prior for each of the Stokes parameters, encompassed in a reweighting approach. Motivated by the large amounts of data produced by the next-generation radio interferometers, in the current work, we propose a scalable version of this method, combined with an accelerating strategy. We showcase the performance of this improved method on a real dataset acquired by the Very Large Array (VLA).	algorithm;clean;distributed computing;navier–stokes equations;parallel computing;polarization (waves);preconditioner;sampling (signal processing);scalability;sparse matrix;stokes parameters;variable-length array;well-posed problem	Jasleen Birdi;Audrey Repetti;Yves Wiaux	2018	2018 IEEE 10th Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop (SAM)	10.1109/SAM.2018.8448968	astronomical interferometer;iterative reconstruction;fourier transform;stokes parameters;mathematical optimization;computer science;sampling (statistics);inverse problem;interferometry;polarization (waves)	Vision	72.0297547056568	-67.99777553111441	177398

Except for conventional side-looking mode, 3D-SAR with LAA can be operated in downward-looking mode which can avoid shadowing effects. The relation between the LAA elements spacing and the elevation angular ambiguity is derived, and the maximal distance between individual antenna elements allowed to avoid elevation angular ambiguity is deduced in this paper. The demonstration of the feasibility of the 3D-SAR with LAA and the relation between elements spacing and elevation angular ambiguity are analyzed by simulation in the last part of this paper.

8d6bd3da0698272bf56ba4a48f501b6bfeb32f84	millimeter-wave imaging of surface-breaking cracks in steel with severe surface corrosion		Robust detection of surface-breaking (fatigue) cracks in metals with severe surface corrosion (rust) and pitting is of great practical interest. Detection of surface-breaking cracks in the millimeter-wave frequency range (30–300 GHz) has received considerable attention in the past two decades. At these frequencies, corrosion byproducts (rust) are in the family of dielectric materials allowing millimeter-wave signals to penetrate through and interact with a visually masked crack. When using open-ended rectangular waveguides, no contact is required, and the crack signal characteristics are significantly different than those from corrosion and pitting, which renders a crack detectable even in the presence of severe corrosion. Moreover, synthetic aperture radar images of cracks masked by corrosion can be rapidly generated providing additional geometrical information. This paper presents the results of uniquely combining these two methods for detecting cracks in severely corroded steel plates and for other similar applications where a crack is visually masked by a dielectric layer.	frequency band;nonlinear gameplay;numerical analysis;rendering (computer graphics);rust;sensor;synthetic data	John R.

The logging response of the layered media to the LFMCWs under the noise environment has been numerically modeled using numerical mode matching (NMM) and inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). Based on the frequency spectrum of LFM signals, the NMM method is used first to calculate both the amplitude and the phase of the signals in receiving coils for every frequency point, and then, IFFT is applied to convert them to the logging response in the time domain. After that, the matched filter method has been imposed to realize pulse compression of the received signals and to improve the peak SNR (PSNR) significantly. As the logging responses of the EM propagation logging tool, the amplitude ratio and the phase difference between the compressed signals from the two separated coils at the peak point are obtained, respectively. Then, the apparent conductivity based on the amplitude ratio and the phase difference is obtained to have the logging curves. It has been shown from the simulation results that using LFMCWs as wideband logging signals can improve the SNR and the logging resolution remarkably, particularly under the condition with correlated noise that restrained the SNR and logging resolution strongly in traditional logging with a single-frequency continuous wave.	data logger;fast fourier transform;matched filter;modulation;numerical analysis;peak signal-to-noise ratio;pulse compression;simulation;single-frequency network;software propagation;spectral density;unit propagation	Kebin Zhu;Zaiping Nie;Xiangyang Sun	2014	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2013.2278571	well logging;fast fourier transform;acoustics;telecommunications;geology;noise;physics;remote sensing	EDA	78.05837648730339	-67.86149890374219	178988

The FRFT with an appropriate order is operated on the signals in the cross-interference interval. Such order is obtained via the calculation of the frequency-modulation slope of transmitted signals. The cross-channel interference is changed into sinc functions that are detected by a designed threshold and filtered out in the FRFT domain to suppress the cross-channel interference. The simulations show that the proposed method can obviously reduce the peak sidelobe levels and the integrated sidelobe levels of targets in range profiles compared with the traditional method, which is benefit to improve the detection and measurement performances of weak polarimetric scattering components. The proposed method is suitable for stable or slow-moving targets.	fractional fourier transform;interference (communication);modulation;performance;polarimetry;simulation;zero suppression	Mi He;Yongjian Nian;Yongzhen Li;Shunping Xiao;Zhihui Liu	2013	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2013.2260525	frequency modulation;fourier transform;continuous-wave radar;radar engineering details;space-time adaptive processing;computer science;pulse repetition frequency;pulse-doppler radar;mathematics;optics;remote sensing	Mobile	77.98147328681704	-67.59666114649261	179644

RFI is always additive to a brightness observation, and so the presence of RFI can bias geophysical parameter retrieval. As microwave radiometers typically have the most sensitive receivers operating in their band, low-level RFI is both significant and difficult to identify. The kurtosis statistic can be a powerful means of identifying some types of low-level RFI, as thermal noise has a distinct kurtosis value of three, whereas thermal noise contaminated even with low-level nonthermal RFI often has other values of kurtosis. This paper derives some benign distortions of the kurtosis statistic due to digitization effects and demonstrates these effects with a laboratory experiment in which a known amount of low-level RFI is injected into a digital microwave radiometer.	distortion;high- and low-level;interference (communication);johnson–nyquist noise;microwave;radio frequency;sensor;utility functions on indivisible goods	Roger D.

This is very relevant for surface-consistent deconvolution where current processing standards focus on the removal of the source and receiver effects under the minimum phase assumption. The proposed method, which is an extension of the Euclid deconvolution method, employs an iterative algorithm that simultaneously estimates the source and receiver wavelets that are consistent with the data. Unlike most deconvolution methods, the algorithm requires no prior phase assumptions. Another important feature of the algorithm is that we questioned the Gaussian density assumption of the reflectivity series and instead implemented a sparse regularizer to constrain the solution space of our desired reflectivity series. In other words, we assume that the reflectivity series can be cast as a sparse vector with few nonzero coefficients.	algorithm;blind deconvolution;coefficient;euclid;feasible region;iterative method;minimum phase;sparse matrix;wavelet	Nasser Kazemi;Emmanuel Bongajum;Mauricio D.

However, changes in solar activity can be a major source of error in interpreting the results of solar calibration for lower frequency bands. The cross-correlation of horizontal and vertical polarization signals, which is zero for perfectly unpolarized electromagnetic radiation, could give non-zero estimates if a quiet sun is not observed by the radar. In this paper, solar scan measurements are made at X-band to detect the effect of solar activity on this cross-correlation coefficient. To facilitate mitigation of instrument-wide errors, we employ multiple XPOL radars to simultaneously observe the sun. Though our experiments during a limited period show that the cross-channel correlation estimates obtained by X-band weather radars remain relatively unaffected by the variations in solar flux, the paper makes suggestions on improving the results.	coefficient;cross-correlation;experiment;fast flux;frequency band;polarimetry;polarization (waves);radar	Kumar Vijay Mishra;Anton Kruger;Witold F.

An antenna array with a large aperture must be used, in order to achieve the desired resolution. At the same time, the number of array elements is limited to only a few, which leads to ambiguities due to spatial undersampling. The ambiguities can be resolved by application of compressed sensing (CS) techniques, as this paper will demonstrate. A model of this particular problem is developed, such that CS algorithms can be applied. Statistical analyses demonstrate the robustness of the method. Finally, measurements of a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) system are presented, with an array size of down to 4 elements.	algorithm;coherence (physics);compressed sensing;discretization;emergence;high dynamic range;image resolution;iterative reconstruction;linear equation;microwave;modulation;monte carlo method;radar;refinement (computing);reflection coefficient;simulation;sparse matrix;undersampling	Stephan Kolb;Reinhard Stolle	2014	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2013.120440	phased array;continuous-wave radar;electronic engineering;radar engineering details;optics;radar imaging;remote sensing	Visualization	75.76085146033188	-67.08939561183773	180787

In particular, the case of small perfect electric conducting spheres is of concern, with the scattered field data collected under multistatic/multifrequency/single-view or multistatic/single-frequency/multiview far zone configurations. The multiple scattering between the spheres is neglected, and their locations are represented as the supports of the Dirac delta functions. This allows one to cast the problem as the inversion of a linear integral operator, with the delta functions being the unknowns of the problem. The inversion of this linear integral operator is achieved by means of the truncated singular value decomposition. The performance of the linear inversion algorithm against the model error (i.e., for situations where the multiple scattering is not negligible) is investigated by numerical simulations. Furthermore, the effect of noise is also analyzed by corrupting the data by an uncorrelated additive white Gaussian process.	algorithm;approximation;dirac delta function;gaussian process;high-level programming language;incidence matrix;internationalization and localization;numerical analysis;performance;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;single-frequency network;singular value decomposition;utility functions on indivisible goods	Raffaele Solimene;Aniello Buonanno;Rocco Pierri	2008	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2008.919273	mathematical optimization;performance;calculus;harmonic analysis;mathematics;optics;physics;quantum mechanics	Visualization	77.2992670728122	-69.10442586340841	181450

It is assumed that the geostationary Earth orbit satellite is equipped with the radar reflector antenna, which provides high accuracy and a high ground resolution of the specified Earth area. Essential properties of Earth monitoring through a radar phase-shift-keyed signal are studied. For a multibeam radar, the algorithm for switching the partial directional tracks is proposed, providing the uniform exposure of the area of interest with the highest possible density of the probing beams for the minimal time under conditions of uniform satellite rotation about the centroidal axis and the constant probing frequency. The numerical example is presented, showing the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;apache axis;carrier frequency;circuit complexity;communications satellite;diagram;geosynchronous satellite;numerical analysis;radar;reflector (antenna);synthetic data	Sergey N.

However, the dynamic nature of typical flows of supersonic combustors, gas turbine engines and augmenters can also lead to inhomogenities that cannot be captured by a single line-of-sight TDLAS measurement. Instead, multiple measurements varied over several spatial locations need to be made. In the current study, shock train structure in the isolator section of the Research Cell 18 supersonic combustion facility at Wright-Patterson AFB is measured. Although only two view angles are available for measurement, multiple absorption features along with a priori computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations enable estimates of two dimensional flow features to be formed. Vector quantization/kmeans data clustering is used to identify key flow features from the temporal history of the raw sinograms. Through the use of multiple absorption features that are measured nearly simultaneously, an approximate two-dimensional image can be formed. This image can be further refined through the use of an optimal set of basis functions that can be derived from a set of CFD simulations that describes the flow shapes.	a-train;approximation algorithm;basis function;cluster analysis;computational fluid dynamics;data compression;diode;k-means clustering;line-of-sight (missile);opto-isolator;simulation;tomography;vector quantization	Chad Lindstrom;Chung-Jen Tam;Ryan Givens;Doug Davis;Skip Williams	2008		10.1117/12.766323	absorption;data compression;vision;internationalization and localization;tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy;quantization;computational fluid dynamics;tomography;optics;cluster analysis;tunable laser;physics;semiconductor laser theory;shock wave;diode;combustion	Visualization	75.8133593529145	-70.69602243052702	182705

This paper aims to obtain well focused images using sliding spotlight mode with the Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR sensor. We proposed an integrated imaging scheme with sliding spotlight echoes. In the imaging scheme, the two-step approach is applied to the spaceborne sliding spotlight SAR imaging algorithm, followed by the Doppler parameter estimation algorithm. The azimuth spectral folding phenomenon is overcome by the two-step approach. The results demonstrate a high Doppler parameter estimation accuracy.

dcb03f7f33146f68537389867131dbd67131d896	ship detection in dual-channel ati-sar based on the notch filter		Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in along-track interferometry (ATI) mode has been extensively applied in velocity measurements of ocean currents and ship detection. A notch filter was recently proposed and was demonstrated to be a promising tool for ship detection exploiting quad- or dual-polarization SAR information. In this paper, the investigation of the notch filter is extended to the dual-channel ATI-SAR mechanism for ship detection on the ocean surface. First, a theoretical proof that the interferometric magnitude performs better in ship detection than single-channel amplitude/intensity is given based on the signal-clutter-ratio improvement, which validates the advantages of interferometric SAR against conventional single-channel SAR for the purpose of ship observations on the ocean surface. Second, based on the proof, the version of the notch filter that is suitable for the ATI-SAR, that is, the interferometric notch filter (INF), is proposed. We then analyze the statistical models of the INF distance, which can facilitate the adaptive realization of INF for ship detection in ATI-SAR. Finally, the experimental results for dual-channel ATI-SAR data measured by NASA/JPL L-band AIRSAR verify the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and effectiveness of the INF.	aperture (software);clutter;informatics;kalman filter;l band;multi-channel memory architecture;statistical model;synthetic data;velocity (software development)	Gui Gao;Gongtao Shi	2017	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2017.2701810	artificial intelligence;computer vision;remote sensing;synthetic aperture radar;clutter;amplitude;mathematics;magnitude (mathematics);band-stop filter;interferometry;communication channel	Vision	76.87693733631528	-66.39438297298163	185113

STAP supports joint space-time processing for detecting moving targets in ground clutter. Large, random arrays are undersampled arrays that support improved angle-Doppler resolution and lower minimum detectable velocity (MDV), at the cost of higher sidelobes. MIMO provides further improvements in angular resolution and MDV. Compressive sensing algorithms are designed to cope with ambiguities introduced by undersampling.

For the coherent radar systems, GMT imaging necessitates the compensation of the additional azimuth modulation without a priori knowledge of the GMT's motion parameters. That is to say, it is necessary to estimate the Doppler parameters of the GMT before the azimuth compression processing. For conventional estimation methods, such as the map drift (MD) method and the phase gradient auto-focus (PGA) method, a searching procedure is necessary and leads to an expensive computational cost. In this paper, a Doppler parameter estimation method based on mismatched compression is proposed. One advantage of this method is that it doesn't need the searching procedure. In addition, another advantage of this method is that both the Doppler centroid and the Doppler frequency rate of the GMT can be simultaneously estimated according to the relationships among the Doppler parameters, the positional offset and the boarding width of the mismatched imaging result. The theoretical analysis and numerical simulations validate that the proposed method works well with different signal to noise ratio.	algorithmic efficiency;aperture (software);coherence (physics);computer simulation;doppler echocardiography;doppler effect;estimation theory;gradient;modulation;newton's method;numerical analysis;radar;sar (unix);signal-to-noise ratio;synthetic data	Zhongyu Li;Junjie Wu;Yulin Huang;Zhichao Sun;Jianyu Yang;Xiaobo Yang	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326819	medical imaging;continuous-wave radar;radar engineering details;synthetic aperture radar;doppler effect;passive radar;bistatic radar;low probability of intercept radar;monopulse radar;pulse repetition frequency;pulse-doppler radar;azimuth;optics;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar;physics;remote sensing	Robotics	75.73264826952722	-67.37484673674464	185730

However, efficient moving-target imaging is a key challenge for current CS methods, since the redundant basis brings heavy computation load. In this letter, by exploiting the geometry information of the defocused results, we present an efficient fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) to estimate the Doppler rate and image the moving targets by only two times FRFT rather than time-consuming searching operation. Then, the concept is extended into an efficient CS (ECS) imaging method by two bases consisting of two discrete FRFT matrices rather than the redundant basis. Simulations and real-data process are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ECS method. The proposed ECS method can achieve accurate parameter estimation and imaging performance with low computational complexity.	cs games;compressed sensing;computation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;estimation theory;fractional fourier transform;moving target indication;precondition;real-time clock;signal processing;sparse matrix;synthetic intelligence	Xuepan Zhang;Guisheng Liao;Shengqi Zhu;Dong Yang;Wentao Du	2015	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2014.2349035	computer vision;optics;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar;remote sensing	Robotics	75.25742882222447	-67.23286923334896	186933

For example, to achieve acceptable differential reflectivity bias (i.e., less than 0.1 dB) using simultaneous transmission and reception of horizontally and vertically polarized waves, the isolation between coaxial cross-polar and copolar beams needs to be in excess of 50 dB. This presents a formidable challenge, because sufficient isolation cannot be achieved at an affordable price by the antenna hardware alone. Hence, additional approaches are required to reduce the differential reflectivity bias due to cross-polar fields. One proposed technique is a 180° pulse-to-pulse phase change of signals injected in either the horizontal or vertical ports of the transmission elements. This approach mitigates the differential reflectivity bias but may increase the bias of the copolar correlation coefficient estimates and, in some cases, the bias of the differential phase estimates. Herein, a modified phase code is proposed, which maintains the differential reflectivity bias suppression but reduces the copolar correlation coefficient and differential phase bias with respect to the originally proposed phase code.	coefficient;differential phase;offset binary;phased array;zero suppression	Igor R.

e6070a91cc4b06382a7747fa5d9909de0a332afc	an automatic algorithm to retrieve wave height from x-band marine radar image sequence		A new method is proposed to retrieve wave height from an X-band marine radar image sequence, without external measurements for reference. The X-band marine radar image sequence is first decomposed by empirical orthogonal function (EOF), and then the sea surface height profile is reconstructed and scaled from the first EOF mode. The radial profiles that are close to the peak wave direction are used to extract the zero-crossing wave periods and relative wave heights. The spectral width parameter is deduced from the histogram of a dimensionless wave period. Based on a joint probability distribution function (pdf) of a dimensionless wave period and wave height, the theoretical pdf of the wave height is derived. A shape parameter is defined for the theoretical pdf and the histogram of the relative wave heights, and then the calibration coefficient is estimated. The method is validated by comparing the significant wave heights retrieved from two different X-band marine radar systems with those measured by buoy; the correlation coefficient, the root-mean-square error, and the bias between them are 0.78, 0.51 m, and −0.19 m for HH polarization, while they are 0.77, 0.51 m, and 0.19 m for VV polarization, respectively. The sources of error of the method are discussed.	algorithm;coefficient;empirical orthogonal functions;end-of-file;multimodal interaction;portable document format;radar;radial (radio);star height;verification and validation;zero crossing	Zhongbiao Chen;Yijun He;Biao Zhang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2017.2702192	computer vision;continuous-wave radar;geodesy;radar imaging;remote sensing	Vision	81.0259075189982	-66.46240561872666	190062

Generally speaking, the slipstream which is an important part of shock reflection structures has a significant effect on the flow property. On the one hand, better understanding of the slipstream is beneficial to flow control which aims to reduce the stagnation pressure loss. On the other hand, it also provides a reasonable way in mixing enhancement. In view of these structures, the schlieren method and the shadow method are widely applied for flow visualization so far. However, the photographs which are obtained by the above methods merely reflect the flow field that is through temporal and spatial integration, rather than high-spatiotemporal resolution images. Also, the evolution of the slipstream cannot be fully investigated by means of the traditional methods of flow visualization. Garrison and Settles (1992) trace the evolution of the slipstream which emanates from the triple point of the k-shock system using the Planar Laser Scattering (PIS) technique. Afterwards, to describe the steady Mach reflection configuration approximately, Azevedo and Liu (1993) and Li and Ben-Dor (1997) investigate shape of the slipstream ignoring the viscous effect respectively. Then, Rikanati et al. (2006) indicate that the slipstream thickening of the pseudo-steady Mach reflection is caused by small-scale growth of the Kelvin–Helmholtz shear flow instability using the interferometry technique. Afterwards, Rubidge et al. (2013a, b; Rubidge and Skews 2014) point out that Kelvin–Helmholtz instability do form on the pseudo-steady Mach reflection slipstream, and describe the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability evolution using the schlieren images. However, little work has been conducted on the development of the slipstream in steady shock reflection. Hence, a series of experiments are performed to observe the fine structures of the steady shock reflection and investigate the evolution of the slipstream in this paper, using Nano-tracer Planar Laser Scattering (NPLS) technique.

Modern SARs are equipped with active phased array antennas and multiple channels. In order to keep costs low, TerraSAR-X uses the redundant receiver unit for the second channel such that fore and aft channel signals are combined by a hybrid coupler to form sum and difference channel data. The dual receive antenna (DRA) mode can either be used to acquire along-track interferometric data or to acquire signals with different polarizations at the same time (Quad-Pol). Fore and aft channel reconstruction is necessary if ground moving target indication (GMTI) algorithms such as the displaced phase center antenna technique or along-track interferometry shall be applied, and in order to separate the horizontally and vertically polarized received signal components. The proposed approach uses internal calibration pulses from different calibration beams in order to estimate and compensate the hardware impact. The theoretical framework together with the results from the experimental data evaluation for the fore and aft channel reconstruction of the TerraSAR-X DRA mode are presented. The impact of the receive hardware transformation matrix estimation accuracy on errors in the reconstructed fore and aft channel image data is studied, and first examples on the GMTI capability of the TerraSAR-X DRA mode are given.	acoustic coupler;algorithm;aperture (software);baseline (configuration management);coherence (physics);dynamic resolution adaptation;image resolution;moving target indication;phased array;radar;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;synthetic data;transformation matrix	Martina Gabele;Benjamin Bräutigam;Daniel Schulze;Ulrich Steinbrecher;Nuria Tous-Ramon;Marwan Younis	2010	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2009.2032920	astronomy;telecommunications;physics;satellite;remote sensing	Mobile	77.56583161279354	-66.77853193796064	193330

When GPR scans a ground surface, an antenna of GPR should be put on a ground as an ideal condition. The farther an antenna is put away from a ground, the shallower the sensing depth becomes, because a ground surface reflects most of the electromagnetic wave radiated by the antenna. Practically an antenna should be manipulated, keeping a small distance from a ground in order to avoid a collision with a ground. Besides, the distance should be controlled so as to observe the ground reflection at a constant position in B-scan image, which is eliminated by a simple algorithm. There are many sensors to measure a ground configuration, but we propose an adaptive sensing which does not require any additional sensors such as laser range finder. In addition, the ground reflection in B-scan image is precisely eliminated by manipulating the sensor head according to GPR sensor information. We show some experimental results to confirm its effectiveness and its performance.	algorithm;ct scan;computer performance;dummy variable (statistics);experiment;kriging;sensor	Yasuhisa Hasegawa;Kazunori Yokoe;Yasuhiro Kawai;Toshio Fukuda	2004	2004 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) (IEEE Cat.

We find that, in additional to highly localized Bragg peaks, there exists broad diffuse scattering patterns consisting of distinguishable geometries. Besides these two distinctive features, we also identify a third distinguishable feature submerged in the low signal-to-noise region in the reciprocal space, whose origin remains an open question.	algorithm;cluster analysis;dbscan;scattering theory;signal-to-noise ratio	Yawei Hui;Yaohua Liu;Byung-Hoon Park	2018	CoRR			Vision	71.07023173089149	-73.35789254272122	194408

The TerraSAR-X satellite is a high resolution SAR system launched in June 2007. Its active phased array X-band antenna hosts 384 transmit/receive modules (TRMs) for controlling the electronic beam steering in azimuth and elevation direction. The precise modeling of the antenna performance is only possible if the actual characteristics of each individual TRM are monitored. TerraSAR-X has been equipped with an innovative characterization mode based on a coding technique, which is the so-called pseudonoise gating method. The individual and simultaneous characterization of all TRMs is realized under most realistic conditions with power supply loads like in nominal radar operation. For the first time, this novel technique has been applied on a spaceborne SAR system.	authorization;dynamic programming;elegant degradation;federal enterprise architecture;ieee xplore;image resolution;mathematical optimization;phased array;power supply;pseudorandom noise;quantum phase estimation algorithm;radar;sensor;synthetic intelligence	Benjamin Bräutigam;Marco Schwerdt;Markus Bachmann	2009	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2008.2008719	phased array;astronomy;phased-array optics;active electronically scanned array;performance;telecommunications;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	77.93161830144592	-66.7857753338427	196454

To that end, first, translational motion is modeled as a polynomial signal, and inspired by the fact that all the scatterers in the moving target experience the same translational range history, the phase difference operation and keystone transform (KT) are utilized to transform the energy of all the scatterers into one range cell. Second, by the virtue of the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), the energy of all the scatterers is coherently accumulated into a peak point, and from which the polynomial coefficients can be obtained accurately. With the estimated polynomial coefficients, the dechirp operation and KT are applied jointly to compensate range misalignment and phase error. The analysis of the proposed method shows that it is of low computational complexity due to avoiding multidimensional search and improves the output SNR providing satisfactory low SNR performance. The experimental results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.	algorithm;coefficient;coherence (physics);computational complexity theory;exptime;experiment;fractional fourier transform;keystone effect;kosterlitz–thouless transition;motion compensation;polynomial;radar;signal-to-noise ratio;tree accumulation	Dong Li;Muyang Zhan;Hongqing Liu;Yong Liao;Guisheng Liao	2017	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2017.2683599	computer vision;short-time fourier transform;mathematics;nuclear magnetic resonance;inverse synthetic aperture radar;remote sensing	Vision	75.8039419420517	-67.59419897540695	197239

The phase-encoding method is used to monitor and characterize individual transmit/receive modules of the active phased-array antenna, which has been demonstrated to be an effective method by TerraSAR-X in a spaceborne environment. The error source due to finite phase-encoding setting accuracy is modeled and analyzed, based on which a modification of the phase-encoding matrix is done to improve the measurement accuracy. Furthermore, simulation confirms a significant improvement in the measurement accuracy with the modification, showing an agreement with the model-based theoretical analysis.	coefficient;effective method;federal enterprise architecture;image processing;molecular orbital;phased array;simulation;synthetic data	Yinghui Gong;Robert Wang;Pei Wang	2016	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2016.2542104	normal distribution;phased array;continuous-wave radar;radar engineering details;calibration;synthetic aperture radar;optics;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar;physics;encoding;remote sensing	Vision	77.54921702910521	-66.62041458591062	198300

This letter presents a complete procedure for the automatic estimation of maritime target motion parameters by evaluating the generated Kelvin waves detected in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The algorithm consists in evaluating a dual-stage low-rank plus sparse decomposition (LRSD) assisted by Radon transform (RT) for clutter reduction, sparse object detection, precise wake inclination estimation, and Kelvin wave spectral analysis. The algorithm is based on the robust principal component analysis (RPCA) implemented by convex programming. The LRSD algorithm permits the extrapolation of sparse objects of interest consisting of the maritime targets and the Kelvin pattern from the unchanging low-rank background. This dual-stage RPCA and RT applied to SAR surveillance permits fast detection and enhanced motion parameter estimation of maritime targets.	algorithm;aperture (software);clutter;convex optimization;estimation theory;extrapolation;motion estimation;object detection;robust principal component analysis;sparse matrix;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;velocity (software development)	Filippo Biondi	2018	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2017.2777264	mathematics;radon transform;computer vision;artificial intelligence;sparse matrix;object detection;clutter;sparse approximation;motion estimation;robust principal component analysis;synthetic aperture radar	Vision	74.78567096502958	-67.18966297851536	199972
