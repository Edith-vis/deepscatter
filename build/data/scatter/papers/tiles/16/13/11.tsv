This paper presents a complete set of self-consistent equations including self and coupling terms for resistance, capacitance and inductance of various TSV structures. Further, a reduced-order electrical circuit model is proposed for isolated TSVs as well as bundled structures for delay and SI analysis, and extracted TSV parasitics are employed in Spectre simulations for performance evaluations. Critical issues in the performance modeling for design space exploration of 3-D ICs such as cross-talk induced switching pattern dependent delay variation and cross-talk on noise are discussed. The error in these metrics when using the proposed models as compared to a field solver is contained to a few percentage points.	computer simulation;crosstalk;design space exploration;electrical connection;electromagnetic field solver;equivalent circuit;integrated circuit;performance prediction;signal integrity;through-silicon via	Roshan Weerasekera;Matt Grange;Dinesh Pamunuwa;Hannu Tenhunen;Lirong Zheng	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on 3D System Integration	10.1109/3DIC.2009.5306541	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	70.92660338004443	46.749945058687175	77745
04f297777cce5111ab320134596401ee0b700008	detection of the chirp signal features caused by doppler phenomenon in the presence of destructive agents based on cyclostationary and hough transform methods		This study deals with investigating the chirp signal detection obtained from the moving target in the presence of the destructive factor (leakage) and Gaussian noise using the generalised almost-cyclostationary (GACS) and Hough transform (HT) signal processing altogether (i.e. GACS–HT) approaches. To do so, a receiver was designed hierarchically using the above approach in this study. In this receiver, the detection and extraction of linear frequency modulation takes place in the subspace of the cyclostationary and Hough which have unique characteristics. In order to detect the target, the relative velocity was analysed in the cyclostationary subspace while the relative acceleration was analysed in the Hough space. Due to using the simulation, the behaviour of this receiver was measured by different subspaces for different parameters in the presence of noise and destructive factor. Ultimately, the efficiency of the presented approach was analysed and compared with other approaches. The results indicated that the GACS–HT approach is more efficient than the energy detector approach and in terms of complexity it is almost as complex as the LV transform approach.	chirp;cyclostationary process;hough transform	Kazem Heydari;Paeiz Azmi;Gere Ortiz Soria;Akbar Heydari	2018	IET Signal Processing	10.1049/iet-spr.2017.0092	control theory;cyclostationary process;mathematics;gaussian noise;signal processing;chirp;frequency modulation;detector;speech recognition;hough transform;pattern recognition;phenomenon;artificial intelligence	ECom	77.09980545268385	48.50021625334279	79139

A novel optoelectronic technique for the generation and the detection of ultrashort voltage pulses, which serve as calibration signals for the oscilloscope, is introduced. The uncertainty of the oscilloscope's time-domain response is derived from a Monte Carlo analysis. Aside from a more complete characterization, our enhanced technique considerably reduces the uncertainty of rise-time measurements.	monte carlo method;rise time;sampling (signal processing);step response	Mark Bieler;Meinhard Spitzer;Klaus Pierz;Uwe Siegner	2009	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2008.2009916	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method	Visualization	69.07539970455466	51.755971323071286	80028

It is recommended to be utilized in the calibration of the reference measuring system composed of impulse resistor divider and digital recorder in IEC 61083. The impulse voltage calibrator is made up of resistors and capacitors of given values. The parameters of its output waveform, Up, T1, and T2, can be calculated based on the parameters of the circuit elements and circuit principle of the calibrator. The uncertainties of the waveform parameters are always evaluated by Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) in previous publications. However, GUM exhibits some limitations when it is applied. In this paper, a 1-kV low-impedance impulse voltage calibrator (1.56 μs/60 μs) is developed. The values and uncertainties of Up, T1, and T2 are evaluated with another two new approaches, Monte Carlo method and random fuzzy variable (RFV). Particularly, the combination of several RFVs with both random and nonrandom effects is also discussed when RFV method is applied. The detailed process of each approach is presented and the results are compared.	characteristic impedance;monte carlo method;multi-chip module;nominal impedance;primary source;simulation;voltage divider;waveform	Xiang Ren;Weidong Ding;Zhaozhi Long;Wenting Li;Feng Li;Guan-Jun Zhang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2016.2540999	resistor;control engineering;electronic engineering;capacitor;uncertainty;engineering;electrical engineering;voltage divider;mathematics;rlc circuit;statistics;measurement uncertainty	Visualization	69.89045597357497	51.351561766646725	85965

The power supply for the HV section of the measurement system, together with the required galvanic isolation, is obtained by means of an innovative energy transfer technique from the low-voltage to the HV section. The energy transfer apparatus is based on conversion of the optical power generated by a laser source into the electrical power needed to supply the measurement circuit. The structure of the insulated transducer is based on a capacitive divider and two electrically isolated signal conditioning sections. The proposed solution allowed for designing and developing a novel and high-performance HV transducer for in-field applications. A prototype version of the transducer was constructed following these new design criteria, and the experimental results confirmed a measurement bandwidth as wide as 5 kHz within a 0.5 accuracy class.	transducer	Cesare Svelto;Roberto Ottoboni;Alessandro Ferrero	2000	IEEE Trans.

The proposed method solves the difficulties arising from quantization, and nonlinearity. The method estimates the noise distribution function by fine adjustment of the input signal offset. The contribution of jitter-induced voltage noise is separated from additive noise in two different ways. Finally, the aperture uncertainty, assumed independent of the frequency, is estimated by varying the signal frequency.

The paper consists of two parts. Part I presents a detailed mathematical model of the FA synthesizer, capturing the relationships between the properties of the FA's output and internal signals and the FA's parameters. The counting of the rising edges in the FA's multiplexer's output establishes a discrete-time index that is used to analytically derive the fundamental discrete-time periods of all the FA's signals. The continuous-time intervals between the rising edges are calculated and used to derive the fundamental continuous-time periods of the signals from the corresponding discrete-time ones. It is shown that the FA behaves differently within different ranges of the frequency word, and the practically useful range is identified. The FA's output average frequency, along with its maximum and minimum values, is analytically derived by calculating the number of cycles in the output signal within a fundamental continuous-time period of it. The relationship between the average and the fundamental output frequencies is also established, indicating the potential frequencies and density of output spurious frequency components. Part II of the paper characterizes the timing structure of the output signal, providing analytical expressions of the pulses' locations, analytical strict bounds of the timing irregularities, and exact analytical expressions of several standard jitter metrics. Spectral properties of the output waveform are presented, including the dominance of the frequency component at the average frequency, and analytical expressions of the dc value and average power of the output signal are derived. The FA has been implemented in a Xilinx Spartan-3E field-programmable gate array, and spectral measurements are presented, confirming the theoretical results. Extensive MATLAB simulation has also been used to generate numerous examples, illustrating the developed theory.	adder (electronics);field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;frequency synthesizer;matlab;mathematical model;maxima and minima;multiplexer;simulation;waveform	Paul-Peter Sotiriadis	2010	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2009.2039835	multiplexer;electronic circuit;discrete time and continuous time;electronic engineering;jitter;direct digital synthesizer;frequency synthesizer;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;development theory;signal processing;mathematical model;truncation;frequency domain;adder;field-programmable gate array	ML	69.036784050755	48.20578663810212	100887

These capacitances can be realized with a relative uncertainty of better than 1/spl times/10/sup -4/ and repeated selection of a given capacitance can be achieved with a relative uncertainty of the order of 1/spl times/10/sup -6/. To minimize temperature dependence of the capacitances, special ceramic capacitors with temperature coefficients of the order of 1/spl times/10/sup -6/ K and low loss factor are used. The effect of switching impedances is minimized by a four terminal-pair definition of capacitors and quasicoaxial connection.

The proposed method takes advantage of the auxiliary sinusoidal signals generated by addition and subtraction operations of the demodulated signals of the resolver's outputs. A pseudolinear signal is obtained through appropriate mathematical manipulation between the auxiliary sinusoidal signals and the demodulated ones. A calibration strategy is then provided to achieve the highest possible precision. It is shown that the error between the calibrated angular and the true angular position is less than 0.00235° over 0° ~ 360°. The proposed method enables the determination of the angular position without utilizing a lookup table or additional reference signals. Furthermore, the presented strategy is implemented using a field-programmable gate array. Finally, our method is tested on a tracking radar antenna servo system where resolvers are installed on it. Several experiments under different conditions are performed to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.	analog-to-digital converter;angularjs;experiment;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;lookup table;pseudoconvex function;servo	Yijing Wang;Zhiqi Zhu;Zhiqiang Zuo	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2014.2375254	electronic engineering;calibration;logic gate;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;demodulation	Robotics	68.444434334492	49.09068399106118	104016

The electronic system is based on an emitter node and on the two receiver nodes. The three nodes, together with the four rails to be analyzed, constitute the electrical circuits, whose currents are measured in both the emission and reception nodes. These nodes can communicate through a data network between them, as well as with a remote center that controls and synchronizes the electronic systems along the railway line. The electronic subsystem associated with the emitter node transmits an encoded signal to the rails, modulated by an 800-Hz carrier. A set of eight currents are measured, one per rail at each end of the section defined between the emitter and the receiver, with a maximum length of 7 km. The evaluation of electrical discontinuities in each section is carried out by means of the relative imbalances that can appear between the eight measured currents, according to possible breakages. The method of measurement is characterized by a high immunity to noise. The results presented here are based on a railway line prototype, which implements the electrical propagation models and coupling between the four rails in the double track. This model allows the proposed electronic system and measurement methodology to be successfully verified.	algorithm;broken sword 5:;high- and low-level;image noise;lambert's cosine law;modulation;prototype;reflections of signals on conducting lines;sensor;simulation;software propagation;train simulator	Felipe Espinosa;&#x00C1;lvaro Hern&#x00E1;ndez;Manuel Mazo;Jes&#x00FA;s Ure&#x00F1;a;Mar&#x00ED;a Camila Rubio P&#x00E9;rez;Jos&#x00E9; A.

Nanoelectronic discrete devices, such as resonant tunneling diodes and transistors, singleelectron transistors, bistable quantum-cells, quantum interference devices, etc. have been proposed and built. Technology and physics of the devices are reasonably well understood, but there exists a gap between device physics and nanoelectronic systems integration. In this paper i t wiIl be shown that in case of local quantum coherence, i.e. if coherence is restricted to the internal dynamics of Coulombcoupled devices, system dynamics can be described by a set of coupled ordinary nonlinear differential equations. In this case virtual charges, voltages and currents, obeying Kirchoffs equations, can be assigned to the dynamic variables of the state equations, thus circuit models can be introduced. We also show that edge-driven arrays performing ground state computing are locally passive systems if the Coulomb-coupled devices are excited by the input signals only. In order to perform signal processing or computing, external energy should be pumped into the array, and the pumped array should be locally active. Adiabatic pumping is one way of injecting energy to the signal path.	coherence (physics);diode;ground state;interference (communication);nonlinear system;obedience (human behavior);one-electron universe;pumping (computer systems);signal processing;system dynamics;system integration;transistor;tunneling protocol	Árpád Csurgay;Wolfgang Porod	2000		10.1109/ISCAS.2000.857010	electronic engineering;electrical engineering;signal processing;coulomb blockade;quantum mechanics	Arch	69.13893426620294	46.43582027683303	108270

Bulk material applications have also increased. For accurate dielectric measurements, each measurement band and material geometry requires specific fixtures. Engineers and researchers must carefully match their material system and uncertainty requirements to the best available measurement system. Broadband measurements require transmission-line methods, and accurate measurements on low-loss materials are performed in resonators.

bc9ff0830ee06628d77d9fc5c0326c27a9e2c219	dynamic model of soft ferrites for avionic applications		A simplified dynamic model to represent the behaviour of soft ferrites at higher frequency is necessary in many applications including avionics. We have tried to address this issue by using a circuital model. The model represents frequency dependence of hysteresis in ferrite material using the parallel combination of static hysteresis model and passive electrical elements. The static hysteresis model such as preisach model represents the magnetic core behaviour, whereas the passive electrical elements represent the broadening of hysteresis loops with the increase in frequency. The parameters of the model are identified using pattern search algorithm, and the model is tested for the frequency upto one Megahertz. Comparison between the results obtained from simulation and measurements for N30 Manganese Zinc ferrite using sinusoidal excitation are presented in the paper. The model is applicable to predict the performance of ferrite core inductors that are used to mitigate the lightning indirect effects in avionic equipments.

In this paper, a current sensor based on proper measurements of the magnetic field produced by the primary current is proposed. Its main feature is the capability, owing to its particular geometry, of neglecting the effect of external fields without using traditional coil structure. An experimental analysis of its performance in both time and frequency domains is presented and discussed.	ibm power systems;profiling (computer programming);smart meter;transformers	Maria Gabriella Masi;Lorenzo Peretto;Roberto Tinarelli	2012	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2012.2205513	current sensor;current transformer;fiber optic current sensor;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;constant current;nuclear magnetic resonance	Visualization	69.68099067120583	49.84615231934067	111280
1c1a1b57c087db7e6eba117ad4afcd0e23ced3ff	a modularized noise analysis method with its application in readout circuit design		A readout integrated circuit (ROIC) is a crucial part that determines the quality of imaging. In order to analyze the noise of a ROIC with distinct illustration of each noise source transferring, a modularized noise analysis method is proposed whose application is applied for a ROIC cell, where all the MOSFETs are optimized in subthreshold region, leading to the power dissipation 2.8 µW. The modularized noise analysis begins with the noise model built using transfer functions and afterwards presents the transfer process of noise in the form of matrix, through which we can describe the contribution of each noise source to the whole output noise clearly, besides optimizing the values of key components. The optimal noise performance is obtained under the limitation of layout area less than 30 µm × 30 µm, resulting in that the integration capacitor should be selected as 0.74 pF to achieve an optimal noise performance, the whole output noise reaching the minimum value at 74.1 µV.

7a6f06c43fc87be605b2a84f9db94501f6b12adb	studies of third-order nonlinearities in materials and devices for ultrafast lasers	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	Recent developments in telecommunications, frequency metrology, and medical imaging have motivated research in ultrafast optics. Demand exists for broadband components and sources as well as highly nonlinear fibers and materials. For this thesis, several different devices have been developed for such applications. Broadband saturable absorbers based on III/V and Si materials systems were developed for femtosecond lasers and have high reflectivity over 200 to 300 nm bandwidths. These absorbers were designed for modulation depths ranging from 0.3% to 18%. Self-starting modelocked operation with the absorbers was achieved in a variety of lasers including Ti:Sapphire, Cr:Forsterite, Er:glass, Cr4+:YAG and erbium-doped bismuth-oxide fiber. In tapered microstructure fiber, highly nondegenerate four-wave mixing was achieved, with a frequency shift of 6000 cm-1 in an interaction length of only 1.4 cm. Amplification in erbium-doped bismuth-oxide fiber was demonstrated, with gains of 12 dB achieved between 1520 1600 nm in a 22.7-cm length. With a 55.6 cm length of bismuthoxide erbium-doped fiber, an L-band modelocked laser was constructed, tunable between 1570 1600 nm. It produced 288-fs pulses at 1600 nm. Undoped highly nonlinear bismuthoxide fiber was used to generate smooth, controlled supercontinuum between 1200 to 1800 nm. Pulse compression of 150-fs pulses to 25 fs was also demonstrated. Finally, the nonlinear refractive index coefficient and two-photon absorption coefficient of Ge-As-Se glasses were measured. Ge35As15Se50 is found to have a nonlinearity 900 times that of silica.

Due to lack of an effective method for automatically distinguishing the state transition, phase analysis is extensively used. However, it needs ocular estimation to identify phase pattern corresponding to transition of Duffing oscillator. Hence it is not fit for communication signal demodulation. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a method, called circular zone partition (CZP), for partitioning trajectory on the phase plane of Duffing oscillator. First, a computing model for Duffing oscillator is described. Then, the fundamental principle and algorithm for the CZP method are discussed. Meanwhile the equation of a circular zone divider and its realization are presented. Thus, by way of the divider, the two-dimensional phase trajectory pattern of Duffing oscillator driven by an external signal can be transformed into the one-dimensional time signal, whose envelop after being filtered is able to indicate the state transition, i.e. the presence or the absence of external signal. Finally, to verify the effect of the CZP method on binary phase shifted keying (BPSK) signal demodulation, two examples are presented and simulation results show that this CZP method is accurate and valid for BPSK signal demodulation.	algorithm;computer engineering;crystal oscillator;detection theory;effective method;electronic oscillator;key (cryptography);milstein method;quantum harmonic oscillator;simulation;state transition table	Yongqing Fu;Dongmei Wu;Lin Zhang;Xingyuan Li	2011	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-011-4199-6	computer simulation;control theory;mathematics;oscillation;quantum mechanics;detection theory	EDA	77.01250923112296	48.50838849258676	117230

2efe11de79fc393be6911188cdbe792a6148d24f	semiconductor-based all-optical switching for optical time-division multiplexed networks	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	All-optical switching will likely be required for future optical networks operating at data rates which exceed electronic processing speeds. Switches utilizing nonlinearities in semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA) are particularly attractive due to their compact size, low required switching energies, and high potential for integration. In this dissertation we investigate the practical application of such semiconductor-based all-optical switches in next-generation optical networks. We present both theoretical and experimental studies of SOA-based interferometric switches. A detailed numerical model for the dynamic response of an SOA to an intensity-modulated optical signal is described. The model is validated using novel pump-probe techniques to measure the time-domain response of an SOA subject to various levels of saturation. The model is then used to evaluate the performance of three common SOA-based interferometric all-optical switches. The use of SOAs in optical transmission systems has been limited due to the deleterious effects of pattern-dependent gain saturation. We develop a statistical model to study the system impact of variations of the SOA optical gain in response to a random intensity-modulated optical signal. We propose the use of pulse-position modulation (PPM) as a means for mitigating gain saturation effects in SOA-based optical processors. We present techniques for modulation and detection of optical PPM signals at data rates in excess of 100 Gbit/s. We demonstrate demultiplexing, wavelength conversion, and format conversion of optical PPM signals at data rates as high as 80 Gbit/s. Finally, we report on experimental demonstrations of an optical interface for slotted OTDM networks. We implement head-end and transmitter nodes capable of producing fully loaded optical slots at an aggregate network data rate of 112.5 Gbit/s. We demonstrate a fully functional receiver node which utilizes semiconductor-based all-optical logic for synchronization, address processing, and rate conversion. Thesis Supervisor: Erich P.

Therefore it is important to estimate exact noise coupling in glass interposers. Thus noise coupling modeling for glass interposer is needed. We proposed a TGV-TGV noise coupling model based on equivalent circuit model. Our TGV-TGV noise coupling structure for modeling verification is composed of TGVs and channel lines. So we proposed both TGV and channel line coupling model. In this paper, we verified our model using 3D-EM solver in frequency domain up to 20GHz by comparing the s-parameter. We analyzed noise coupling function with our model. Also, noise coupling reduction methods are proposed and their effects are analyzed on frequency domain and time domain.	equivalent circuit;glass;interposer;noise reduction;scattering parameters;solver;time series	Insu Hwang;Jihye Kim;Youngwoo Kim;Jonghyun Cho;Joungho Kim	2015	2015 International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC)	10.1109/3DIC.2015.7334605	materials science;ceramic materials;electronic engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	71.11072724874683	47.12553301374212	122085

However, in this method, ripples often appear in the frequency characteristics of the measured permittivities owing to the reflections at the fixture ends. Although gating analysis for the time-domain signals have been employed to reduce these ripples, it cannot be applied to conventional T/R methods at microwave frequencies because of the short distance of the time interval between the required signal and unwanted signals to be eliminated in the gating process. To deal with the problem of eliminating the reflection effects at fixture interfaces, we used a long air line as a fixture, and analyzed the measured S-parameters by using the improved gating analysis in the time domain, where unwanted reflection signals in S-parameters in the time domain were eliminated while maintaining the continuity of the waveforms. We demonstrated its efficacy by performing numerical calculations, as well as using actual measurement data for polytetrafluoroethylene obtained with a PC-7 air line with the length of 30 cm. Furthermore, we developed a new algorithm for a rigorous uncertainty analysis of the time-domain analysis of S-parameters that considers the correlations between the measured S-parameters at different frequencies. By applying this algorithm, we evaluated the uncertainty of the proposed method for permittivity measurements.	algorithm;denavit–hartenberg parameters;domain analysis;experiment;hybrid fibre-coaxial;microwave;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;parameter (computer programming);reflection (computer graphics);scattering parameters;scott continuity;test fixture;waveform	Yuto Kato;Masahiro Horibe	2017	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2017.2653598	algorithm design;electronic engineering;uncertainty;engineering;scattering parameters;optics;physics;statistics;permittivity	Visualization	71.37344795795866	47.531153356980255	124268

The received ultrasonic envelope contains an additive noise, which resembles another sine wave whose frequency is very close to that of the envelope. This gives rise to a low-frequency beat in the phase shift between the transmitted and received envelopes. Consequently, the estimated phase shows an equivalent phase jitter. The desired sinusoidal envelope signal cannot easily be separated from the noise signal, even by sharply tuned SDFT filters with phase-locked loops (PLLs). A parameter estimation procedure has been applied to remove these interharmonic signals with the help of comb filters. The PLL was strengthened by a cosine lookup table (LUT). By locating the envelope frequency far away from the interharmonic noise frequency, the convergence time could greatly be reduced. Simulation studies were conducted in the Matlab-Simulink-DSP builder environment, and ideas were implemented in a Cyclone-II field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based range finder fabricated in the laboratory. The test results of the AM ultrasonic range finder are presented to show its performance for static and slowly moving objects.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;bounce address;cyclone;discrete fourier transform;estimation theory;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;lookup table;matlab;modulation;phase-locked loop;simulation;simulink;utility functions on indivisible goods	P.

Its main component is a homemade high-precision 1 : 1 inductive voltage divider used in a autotransformer configuration. For balancing the bridge, adjustable in-phase and quadrature currents can be injected. A detailed uncertainty budget is presented for measuring small capacitance changes. Considering correlations between main terms in the mathematical model, it is shown that it is possible to measure capacitance changes of at most a few 0.1% with a relative standard uncertainty below one part per million, i.e., with an uncertainty relative to the capacitance value of order one part per billion.	approximation error;image resolution;mathematical model;technical standard;voltage divider	Bernd Fellmuth;Harald Bothe;Norbert Haft;Jürgen Melcher	2010	CPEM 2010	10.1109/TIM.2010.2099410	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;parts-per notation;physics;quantum mechanics;statistics	ML	69.6379820920181	51.131785361703756	132273

Results of the relative measurement processes have shown good repeatability. The method for evaluation of reference values was based on similar shunts and suitable assumptions and derived by extrapolation. For the type of resistance elements employed in these shunts, the derivation of the reference is not very accurate and still needs to be improved.	comparator;extrapolation;istituto di scienza e tecnologie dell'informazione;phase detector;prototype;repeatability	Gian Carlo Bosco;Martin Garcocz;Kåre Lind;Umberto Pogliano;Gert Rietveld;Valter Tarasso;Bostjan Voljc;Vera Nováková Zachovalova	2011	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2011.2108553	phase detector;electrical resistance and conductance;electronic engineering;uncertainty;data processing;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;mathematics;extrapolation;measurement;statistics;measurement uncertainty	Visualization	69.54491330483421	51.26973120880564	133782

The BPN filter is designed by specifying a stability margin and then minimizing the area under the amplitude response so as to achieve maximum selectivity for the chosen stability margin. Preliminary results indicate that the use of a BPN filter leads to improved hot-spot prediction compared to results obtained with classical filters investigated earlier by the authors such as inverse-Chebyshev filters. The results also show that the improved technique yields predictions that are consistent with results based on biological methodologies. In addition, the technique reveals certain new 'potential' hot-spot locations which could be investigated further by the biological community.	business process network;chebyshev filter;chebyshev polynomials;computation;digital filter;experiment;filter bank;hot spare;phase margin;selectivity (electronic);undersampling	Parameswaran Ramachandran;Wu-Sheng Lu;Andreas Antoniou	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2008.4542007	computer vision;electronic engineering;digital filter;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;control theory	Embedded	73.67913207763651	50.21847201000378	135869

The proposed system was able to measure the load impedances that were realized with using various terminal resistors and connected at the end of a cable. The experimental results show that the proposed system allows us to know where the connected terminal resistor is on the cable, and how much the impedance of the terminal resistor is. Through real experiments, it is possible for the proposed system to acquire more accurate results in wide range of impedance than conventional commercial time domain reflectometry instrument.

This is based on the properties of traveling waves instigated on high-voltage transmission lines as a result of a fault, switching operation, or a lightning strike. The method is unique in that superimposed voltage transients can be deduced without employing measurements taken from voltage transducers. It is demonstrated that full advantage can be made of the broad bandwidth of the current transducers to improve fault location and enable high-speed traveling wave protection to be applied on power systems.	transmission line	David W.

1d884ef60b4d061319e434468f30ab7feb7c605a	few-cycle and cavity-enhanced optical parametric amplification	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	Optical parametric amplifiers have emerged as important optical sources by extending the properties of few-cycle laser sources, which exist only in materials with sufficiently large gain bandwidths, to wide array of spectral ranges. The work reported in this thesis relates to two areas for the continued development of optical parametric amplification based sources. First, we present a white light seeded, carrier-envelope stable, degenerately pumped OPA producing near tranform-limited sub 7 fs , 3 pIJ pulses at the driver wavelength from a long pulse, non-CEP stable Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier. Problems to the spectral phase jump at the driver wavelength, 800 nn, were avoided by using a near infrared OPA to produce white light continuum down to 800 nm where the spectral phase is smooth. Secondly, enhancement cavities are used in conjunction with parametric amplifiers resulting in a new technique entitled, cavity-enhanced optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification (C-OPCPA). C-OPCPA increases the capabilities of nonlinear crystals and can allow continued scaling of parametric amplifier systems to high repetition rate. This work contains the first theoretical and experimental investigation of C-OPCPA. Numerically, passive pump pulse shaping of the intracavity pump power is shown to enable octave spanning gain. Experimentally, a first proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates a 78 MHz C-OPCPA with more than 50% conversion with under 1 W of incident pump power. A comparison to a single pass system shows improvements in the C-OPCPA of orders of magnitude in conversion efficiency and 3 fold increase in phase matching bandwidth in 10 and 20 mm periodically poled lithium niobate phase matched for parametric amplification with 1030 nm pump wavelength and a 1550 nm signal wavelength. A Yb-fiber laser based CPA system producing up to 5 W of 500 fs pulses comprises the pump source, and a Er-fiber laser the signal. Thesis Supervisor: Franz X.

Over the years, “cut-and-try” procedures have been adopted by electronic designers to make circuits comply with these regulations, mainly due to the lack of reliable theoretical models of radiated noise and clear design rules. To gain new insight into this field, a novel approach is presented in this paper based on a well-known technique in the field of antenna design, i.e., the source reconstruction method (SRM). Its application allows a set of equivalent currents to be obtained that behave exactly like the circuit under consideration with regard to radiated noise. From these currents, magnetic and electric radiated fields can be obtained at any point in space, even at 3 or 10 m away from the circuit where the regulations must be met. Moreover, the equivalent currents accurately represent noise sources in the circuit, thus permitting the elements responsible for generating radiated noise to be located. The aforementioned method would enable designers to reduce the use of anechoic-chamber facilities when testing their designs, thereby leaving the chamber only for final certification purposes.	emi;electronic circuit;interference (communication)	Yuri Alvarez Lopez;Miguel Rodriguez;Fernando Las-Heras Andrés;Marta M.

Substation impulsive noise might interfere with classic wireless communications and none of the existing models can reliably represent this noise in wide band. Previous studies have shown that impulsive noise is characterized by series of damped oscillations with the amplitude, the duration and the occurrence times of the impulses that are random. All these characteristics make this noise time-correlated and the partitioned Markov chain remains an efficient model that can ensure the correlation between the samples. In this study, we propose to design a partitioned Markov chain to generate an impulsive noise that is similar to the noise measured in existing substations, in time and frequency domains. We configure our Markov chain to produce the impulses with the damped oscillation effect, then, we determine the probability transition matrix and the distribution of each state of the Markov chain. Finally, we generate noise samples and we study the distribution of the impulsive noise characteristics. Our Markov chain model can replicate the correlation between the measured noise samples; also the distributions of the noise characteristics are similar in the simulations and the measurements.	algorithm;carrier frequency;cluster analysis;fall time;markov chain;neural oscillation;noise shaping;performance;self-replicating machine;simulation;spectral density;stochastic matrix;time series;traction substation	Fabien Sacuto;Fabrice Labeau;Basile L.

In the SPICE-compatible model, a new C-L-R series path in the parallel branch is introduced to describe the electromagnetic coupling for CPWs with large lower ground or shield, while other kinds of high frequency effects including substrate loss, and skin effect are considered to explain the frequency-dependent per-unit-length Lx, Cx, Rx, and Gx parameters. The direct extraction procedure are established which can ensure both accuracy and simplicity compared with other reported methods. The model is verified by IBM 90nm CMOS processes with SLOT de-embedding techniques. Excellent agreement between the model and the measured data for different CPWs is achieved up to 67GHz. The direct extraction methodologies ensure the feasibility and availability of scalable modeling of CPWs for circuit designer.	cmos;coplanar waveguide;frequency band;information science;maximal set;on-premises wiring;spice;scalability;substrate (electronics);unified model	Jun Luo;Lei Zhang;Yan Wang	2012	Proceedings of the IEEE 2012 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference	10.1109/CICC.2012.6330676	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;cmos	EDA	70.84272933406208	47.1384447717437	138556

Inductance measurements of the CCC overlapping tube at 300 and 77 K, as well as the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) noise spectra of the complete CCC setup at 4 K, confirm the effectiveness of the damping of the CCC self-resonance with respect to other designs. At 4 K, the CCC is remarkably stable in measurements with external feedback mode; even mains-operated current sources can be used without unlocking the SQUID null detector of the measurement bridge. First measurements of currents in the range of 100-300 pA using this CCC are performed, resulting in deviations from the expected value in the range of about 20-50 muA/A.	4k resolution;bridge circuit;comparator;current source;interference (communication);null (sql);resonance	Gert Rietveld;Pieter de la Court;Helko E. van den Brom	2009	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2008.2009919	damping;electronic engineering;current;resonance;noise measurement;electrical engineering;software testing;squid;nuclear magnetic resonance;cryogenics;physics;expected value;quantum mechanics	Embedded	69.41721907428881	51.270420100685136	142367

Variants of the scheme apply to three impedances commonly used to calibrate vector reflectometers and vector network analyzers. The scheme permits impedance standards to be characterized in the intermediate frequency (IF) range (where, broadly speaking, IF refers to the frequency range 10 kHz to 100 MHz) in terms of their VRC values and associated measurement uncertainties. The scheme allows the use of commercially available devices (rather than specially constructed calculable devices) as impedance standards with VRC values traceable to national measurement standards. Measurement results are presented which illustrate the capabilities of the scheme.	characteristic impedance;computability;frequency band;intermediate frequency;interpolation;radio frequency;reflection coefficient;traceability;transverse redundancy check	Maurice G.

9bc044ee8223aa35bdf74b79425b80b655d48b41	the influence of microwave pulse width on the thermal burnout effect of an lna constructed by a gaas phemt		Abstract In this paper, the influence of microwave pulse width on the thermal burnout effect of a low noise amplifier (LNA) constructed by a GaAs pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor (PHEMT) is theoretically analyzed and further verified with simulation and experimental results. By analyzing the electrical procedure and the thermal procedure, a theoretical model of the thermal burnout effect of the studied LNA is established according to the properties of microwave pulses and the structure of the LNA and GaAs PHEMT. Based on the theoretical model, the analytical relationship between the microwave pulse width and the thermal burnout power threshold is further obtained. According to the limitations caused by the approximations in the process of modeling, the available microwave pulse width range for the proposed analytical relationship is more than a nanosecond level and less than a microsecond level. The coefficients of the proposed analytical relationship can be determined by fitting at least two sets of simulation or experimental results, which can greatly reduce the simulation or experimental costs. Finally, the analytical relationship is verified by simulation and experimental results. The results show that the proposed analytical relationship is suitable to estimate the thermal burnout power threshold for a given microwave pulse width within the limit of microwave pulse width range.	launch numerical aperture;microwave;pulse-width modulation	Shipeng Yi;Zhengwei Du	2018	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2018.04.016	engineering;electronic engineering;burnout;nanosecond;microsecond;low-noise amplifier;thermal;microwave;high-electron-mobility transistor;pulse-width modulation	HCI	70.90082086867608	47.692973567711434	144786

The model has been developed by applying Gauss's law in the cylindrical channel depletion region for undoped or lightly doped silicon SRG MOSFET working in the subthreshold regime. In order to validate the model, the modelled expressions are compared with the simulated characteristics obtained from the numerical device simulator. A systematic investigation of analogue performance figures of merit are reported for different dimensions of SRG MOSFET. The obtained gm/Id model has been implemented in modelling the 1/f low-frequency noise (LFN). The variation of 1/f LFN is obtained and investigated for different device parameters.	pink noise	Angsuman Sarkar;Swapnadip De;Anup Dey;Chandan Kumar Sarkar	2012	IET Circuits, Devices & Systems	10.1049/iet-cds.2011.0093	gauss's law;electronic engineering;subthreshold slope;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;physics;quantum mechanics	EDA	68.71944527661628	47.161981279938	144955

A practical circuit utilizes one operational amplifier to obtain -(X+Y)/2 and a second such unit to measure the summing point current. Addition of four auxiliary diodes reduces circuit interactions and makes less stringent requirements on the diodes. A simple operational adjustment procedure is described. Also, a simple means for obtaining the precise resistance balance is outlined. Calibration does not depend upon triangular wave frequency or symmetry. The amplifiers are not required to handle the triangular wave frequencies.	diode;operational amplifier	Paul E. Pfeiffer	1959	IRE Trans.

Grei The optimum shape design of Y-noise barriers is carried out using single and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and the Boundary Element Method (BEM). Reduction of noise impact efficiency (using the insertion loss-IL-magnitude) and cost of the barrier (using its total length magnitude) are considered. A two-dimensional problem of sound propagation in the frequency domain is handled, defined by a fixed position emitting source, which pulses in a frequency range, and receptor. A noise barrier (limiting its maximum effective height) is situated between both. Its shape is modified to minimize the receptor measured sound level, which is calculated using BEM. Results of an inverse problem using the IL barrier curve as reference are successfully performed to validate the methodology. The proposed methodology is then used to obtain Y-barriers with 15% and 30% improved IL spectrum. Finally, six non-dominated solutions of the multi-objective optimum design problem are presented in detail. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To reflect the future revision of IEC 61000-4 series, uncertainty in the calibration factors was investigated to improve calibration quality and determine the factors affecting calibration. We found that fluctuation in the power transmitted from a high power amplifier and the imperfection of the anechoic chamber were the most important factors affecting uncertainty.	align (company);audio power amplifier;institute of electronics, information and communication engineers;quantum fluctuation;uncertainty principle;universal conductance fluctuations	Ifong Wu;Shinobu Ishigami;Kaoru Gotoh;Yasushi Matsumoto	2009	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.6.1032	electronic engineering;uncertainty;engineering;electrical engineering;electric field;physics;quantum mechanics;statistics	HCI	69.97339198347282	52.171738550101	157506

The model was firstly discovered from magnetic domain wall (DW) in ferromagnetic strips. We analyze the principle of the proposed underdamped pinning SR (UPSR) system, the detailed numerical simulation and system performance. We also propose the strategy of selecting the proper damping factor and other system parameters to match a weak signal, input noise and to generate the highest output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Finally, we have verified its effectiveness with both simulated and experimental input signals. Results indicate that the UPSR performs better in weak signal detection than the conventional SR (CSR) with merits of higher output SNR, better anti-noise and frequency response capability. Besides, the system can be designed accurately and efficiently owing to the sensibility of parameters and potential diversity. The features also weaken the limitation of small parameters on SR system.	computer simulation;damping factor;detection theory;dreamwidth;fault detection and isolation;frequency response;http public key pinning;l (complexity);performance;strips;signal detection (psychology);signal-to-noise ratio;stochastic resonance	Haibin Zhang;Qingbo He;Fanrang Kong	2015		10.3390/s150921169	nonlinear filter;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory	EDA	73.06291748239708	49.00929074242557	159960

Several experimental results are described and the analysis of several characteristics using an equivalent circuit of the transformer is shown. The following two characteristics are investigated. They are the ratio of a differential mode output voltage to a common mode input voltage, and a common mode voltage transfer ratio. In an electrostatic shielded transformer, when a common mode current flows in the shielding plate from a primary coil, it induces a differential mode voltage in the secondary coil. We want to know the mechanism of this phenomenon in detail. Thus, we have measured how the common mode signal changes according to the number of grounding points to chassis from the electrostatic shielding plate, and the ground line impedance, etc.	transformer	M.

b9f66f6e73d07e413dbfd04bde55617abbed928b	model in frequency-domain identification of a fast steering mirror system based on levenberg-marquardt algorithm		A method for frequency-domain identification of a fast steering mirror system is provided. The method firstly uses swept sine as dynamic excitation signal to obtain the frequency characteristics of controlled object and frequency response data by dynamic signal analyzer Agilent 35670A. Then the paper uses data pre-processed to analyze magnitude-phase characteristics based on FFT (Fast Fourier Fransform). The error of FFT calculation is relative major. To obtain the frequency characteristics approaching to real system, windowing and Sample Hold is introduced to modify magnitude-phase characteristics. For non-parametric frequency characteristics curve of the system, in combination of Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least squares curve fitting and transfer function model based on dynamic mechanism modelling, this paper implements curve fitting for low frequency band with frequency characteristics. With this method, the frequency characteristics of complex system can be converted to accurate transfer function. Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm providing the theoretical support for parameterizing BODE diagram is an optimization strategy. The optimization strategy improves the matching degree between actual system and model system in process of modeling and it is provided for the compensation of the influence which is from the temperature shift and measurement error of components. The paper provides a theoretical foundation for building a more complex electro-optical tracking system.	levenberg–marquardt algorithm	Peng Chen;Yanbing Liang	2017		10.1109/CRC.2017.10	complex system;frequency domain;transfer function;fast fourier transform;bode plot;curve fitting;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;control theory;computer science;frequency response	NLP	72.29808359216842	46.68709826684571	163718

Such frequency locking is necessary to ensure maximum constructive interference inside the cavity. This is achieved by altering the resonant frequency of the optical cavity to match the frequency of the input laser. The optical cavity is characterized as a negative imaginary system in the desired frequency range and a strict negative imaginary IRC is designed for locking such a cavity. We show in simulation that the internal stability of the positive feedback interconnection of the plant and the IRC is guaranteed as long as a certain DC gain condition is satisfied, as mentioned in previous theoretical results. Experimental frequency response data for the plant, comprising of a three-mirror ring cavity and a piezoelectric actuator is used. This data is used to obtain a model for the plant using methods of system identification which is then used to design an IRC. A unit step response is obtained to check for the performance of the controller in closed-loop.	frequency band;frequency response;imaginary time;interconnection;interference (communication);internet relay chat;lock (computer science);piezoelectricity;positive feedback;resonance;simulation;step response;system identification	Abhijit G.

Using post-correction methods can improve the performance of the component as well as the overall measurement system. In this paper an ADC is characterised by a Kautz-Volterra (KV) model, which utilises a model-based post-correction of the ADC with general properties and a reasonable number of parameters. It is also shown that the inverse model has the same dynamic properties as the direct KV model. Results that are based on measurements on a high-speed 12-bit ADC show good results for a third-order model.	analog-to-digital converter	Niclas Björsell;Magnus Isaksson;Peter Händel;Daniel Rönnow	2010	Computer Standards & Interfaces	10.1016/j.csi.2009.11.007	inverse problem;system of measurement	HCI	68.43340522822224	48.135774975758125	164072

The novel interface system is designed to measure small capacitances in a reliable and accurate way even when the sensor capacitors are shunted by parasitic conductances. The problem of shunting conductances is solved by performing a series of eight measurements and using a new auto-calibration technique. Moreover, all multiplicative and additive errors of the interface are also eliminated by using this new auto-calibration technique. In the microcontroller, the final result is calculated based on the new measurement algorithm. A prototype has been built and tested. Experimental results show that the interface is able to measure a capacitance of 0–1.2 pF with a shunting conductance of up to 0.42S, with a resolution and a relative accuracy of 0.03% and 0.15%, respectively. The measurement time is about 400 ms.	algorithm;capacitive sensing;conductance (graph);linear programming relaxation;microcontroller;parasitic element (electrical networks);prototype;relaxation oscillator;sensor;utility functions on indivisible goods	Xiujun Li;Gerard C.

This paper describes methods for analysis of thermal effects at both at the circuit, system and component level. The first part describes how thermal analysis can be combined with advanced RF modeling techniques to predict self-heating and thermal coupling in multi-antenna transmitter systems. Experimental methods are then used to determine thermal coupling effects occurring at chip level.

Specifically, methods are presented that are compatible with the multiresolution time-domain (MRTD) technique using Haar basis functions that allow the modeling of general structures without limiting the cell size to the features of the modeled structure. Existing Haar techniques require that cells be homogenous in regard to PECs and other localized effects (with the exception that permeability and permittivity can vary throughout the cell). The techniques that are presented here allow the modeling of these structures using a subcell technique that permits the modeling of these effects at individual equivalent grid points. This is accomplished by transforming the application of the effects at individual points in the grid into the wavelet domain. There are several other contributions that are provided in this work. First, the MRTD technique is derived for a general wavelet basis using a relatively compact vector notation that both makes the technique easier to understand and allows the differences and similarities between different MRTD schemes more apparent. Second, techniques such as the uniaxial perfectly matched layer (UPML) for arbitrary wavelet resolution and non-uniform gridding are presented for the first time. Using these techniques, any structure that can be simulated in Yee-FDTD can be modeled with Haar-MRTD. For the first time, results for the use of a time-and-space-adaptive grid in an MRTD simulation are presented.	radio frequency	Nathan Bushyager	2004			electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	69.85950869809237	57.60741451829167	168341

A new low-cost method for converting the amplitudes of these sine/cosine transducer signals into a measure of the input angle without using lookup tables is proposed. The new method takes advantage of the components used to operate the resolver, the excitation (carrier) signal in particular. This is a feedforward method based on comparing the amplitudes of the resolver signals to those of the excitation signal together with another shifted by pi/2. A simple method is then used to estimate the shaft angle through this comparison technique. The poor precision of comparison of the signals around their highly nonlinear peak regions is avoided by using a simple technique that relies only on the alternating pseudolinear segments of the signals. This results in a better overall accuracy of the converter. Beside simplicity of implementation, the proposed scheme offers the advantage of robustness to amplitude fluctuation of the transducer excitation signal.	angularjs;feedforward neural network;lookup table;nonlinear system;pseudoconvex function;quantum fluctuation;simulation;transducer	Lazhar Ben-Brahim;Mohieddine Benammar;Mohd A.

The approaches differ in the way they incorporate the quantization of charge into a circuit theory. First, the quantum phenomena important for single-electron tunneling devices are presented. Second, two energy-based theories are discussed, together often called orthodox theory of single electronics. The focus is on the transition from a device description to a circuit theory. In the orthodox theory the quantization of charge leads to the quantization of the continuous spectrum of energy states associated with the capacitance of small metal islands. In the third section, the on direct-tunneling-based impulse circuit model is discussed that translates the quantization of charge into the quantization of current and of time during a tunnel event. The conclusion is that the orthodox theory of single electronics poses severe problems when used as a circuit theory; the impulse circuit model provides a better starting point.	network analysis (electrical circuits);one-electron universe;quantum tunnelling;theory;tunneling protocol	Jaap Hoekstra	2007	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2007.907797	equivalent circuit;electronic engineering;quantum tunnelling;condensed matter physics;coulomb blockade;physics;quantum mechanics	EDA	69.26408869670023	47.16484398164288	170700

Because of their intrinsic nonlinearity, real resistors, inductors, capacitors, and so on show behaviors that are very different from those expected in a sinusoidal environment. Consequently, a problem of reliable assessment of these components in the presence of nonsinusoidal environments arises. This problem is even more critical in applications such as the creation of hybrid filters, control circuits based on patterns of sensing elements, and circuits of digital protection in power systems, where the design and control of electrical and electronic circuits depend on the correct modeling of the R, L, and C components. In previous research works, the authors proposed a suitable measurement method for the estimation of R, L, and C parameters of passive components in nonsinusoidal conditions. This paper deals with the realization of a measurement instrument, based on a Field Gate Programmable Array, that is able to continuously update the estimated values of the considered components. The instrument realization passes through an optimized implementation of the previously proposed measurement method aimed at minimizing the hardware resources and the computational burden and increasing the measurement rate. After a preliminary tuning of the measurement method, carried out in a simulation environment, the hardware and the software architectures of the realized measurement instrument, together with the measurement strategy, are described and experimentally characterized.	condition number;electronic circuit;experiment;field-programmable gate array;ibm power systems;intrinsic dimension;nonlinear system;simulation;software architecture	Luigi Ferrigno;Marco Laracca;Consolatina Liguori;Antonio Pietrosanto	2012	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2011.2176165	equivalent circuit;computer simulation;control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;quantum mechanics;field-programmable gate array;statistics	EDA	68.87902979022083	48.50704343974779	174211

The method is useful in checking system operation under normal measurement configurations and programmed control.

This approach application has proved to be very useful to justify the necessity of looking for an alternative technique. Therefore, the authors proposed the ldquogrey boxrdquo calibration procedure. Considerations about the comparison of the two procedures have been made.	computation;electric power quality;fast fourier transform;field-programmable gate array;fuzzy set;interaction;propagation of uncertainty;software propagation;total harmonic distortion;transducer	Claudio De Capua;Emilia M.

In this paper, a mathematical method for estimating power losses in insulated-gate bipolar transistors and freewheeling diodes occurring under chaotic frequency modulation SPWM (CFM-SPWM) switching is proposed. This method is based on the features of the chaotic mapping and uses semiconductor datasheet information to calculate the power losses in a discrete way. Analytical expressions and approximations for estimating the losses for the cases of SPWM and CFM-SPWM switching, respectively, are presented. This paper includes a quantitative comparison of the losses under the two previously mentioned cases. It is confirmed that CFM-SPWM does not result in higher power losses when it greatly improves electromagnetic compatibility of power converters, and hence, its adoption will not require any modified converter thermal design. Experimental results taken from a single-phase ac–dc converter are presented to prove the validity of the proposed method and associated results.	approximation;datasheet;flyback diode;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;interference (communication);pulse-width modulation;semiconductor;switched-mode power supply	Hong Li;Zhichang Yang;Boyu Wang;Vassilios G.

The transient sensitivity analysis aims to truncate the high dimensional parameter variations space into a reduced subspace. Thereafter, a phase-space pattern matching verification approach is performed on this reduced subspace to estimate the yield rate using new measures called Recurrence Rate and Recurrence Periodicity Entropy. The proposed approach is illustrated on a four stage CMOS Rambus oscillator. The obtained results demonstrate a far faster yield assessment with a superior accuracy compared to Monte Carlo technique.

To this end, an accurate model of the injection probe is combined with typical injection profiles recommended by automotive Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Standards, and with a distributed-parameter representation of the wiring harness. The model also includes possible imbalance affecting the bus terminal sections, whose non-ideal behavior is recognized to be at the basis of bus susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. As a matter of fact, the obtained predictions prove the great sensitivity of the injected current to the degree of imbalance of the terminal sections, and indicate that, in order to derive from the test consistent information to fix possible susceptibility problems, statistical models accounting for the uncertainty associated with the involved circuit components are preferable, unless accurate characterization of the terminal sections were available.	brain–computer interface;can bus;communications protocol;experiment;flexray;frequency band;interference (communication);intermediate frequency;radio frequency;statistical model;substitution method;wiring	Flavia Grassi;Giordano Spadacini;Sergio Amedeo Pignari;C.

b936303cab694e58bfbf5940b640affd8ecbe2e6	shake table testing of a radar-based structural health monitoring method		Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is an active field of research concerned with the development of sensors to measure structural loading and deformation as a result of external loading. This paper details the testing of a new method of SHM, which uses frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar to measure the displacement of a structure. This method avoids the integral drift errors incurred by contemporary accelerometer-based devices. In order to determine a structures interstorey drift ratio (IDR), an FMCW radar device measures the diagonal distance between two opposite corners of two adjacent floors. This distance can then be converted to an IDR using knowledge of the dimensions of the structure. A prototype FMCW radar unit was built to verify that such a method is able to achieve the precision necessary for SHM. The device was tested using a shake table driven with ground motion data taken from the 2011 Christchurch, New Zealand earthquakes. The distance between the radar transceiver and the target reflector was compared to linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) data to determine the error in target tracking. The mean distance error was found to be 0.0308%, which corresponded to a mean IDR error for an arbitrary structure of 0.00107. This value was half the required mean error determined to be suitable for SHM purposes, meaning that the results of this experimentation justify further research into the implementation of this method.	automatic identification and data capture;displacement mapping;independence day: resurgence;mean squared error;modulation;nörlund–rice integral;prototype;radar;requirement;sensor;shake;simulation;super high material cd;transceiver;transformer	Alexander C.

The case of a limited pool of switching frequencies, convenient and adequate for technical purposes, is considered, and a mathematical background for this type of random PWM (RPWM) is provided. It is shown that the limited-pool RPWM gives rise to not only a continuous spectrum, but, also, under certain circumstances, pure power spectral components (harmonics), typical for the deterministic PWM. Criteria for the existence of harmonics are given, and formulae for both the power and the power spectral density are derived and verified experimentally.	clock rate;inverter (logic gate);power inverter;pulse-width modulation;randomized algorithm;spectral density	R.

The transmission-line (TL) models are faithful to the physiology, particularly in terms of cochlear nonlinearity, but are computationally demanding. The pole-zero filter cascade (PZFC) model, however, is much more efficient to implement, but the nonlinearity is included implicitly, using an automatic gain control network. In this study, the connection between the linear responses of these two models is first discussed, followed by a comparison of their nonlinear responses in terms of self-suppression and two-tone suppression on the level of the basilar membrane. Both models are capable of simulating dynamic range compression as measured on the cochlear partition, but the TL model is more reasonable in representing two-tone suppression, with the PZFC having lower suppression thresholds and over-predicting the suppression due to high-side suppressors. Further tuning of its parameters and structure, especially the automatic gain control (AGC) network may be possible to make it more compatible with these experimental observations. After adapting the PZFC model to have a more realistic nonlinear behavior, its use for investigating auditory signal processing such as masking effects, and hence as a front-end processor for acoustic signals can be enhanced, while retaining its computational efficiency.	acoustic cryptanalysis;automatic gain control;cochlear implant;computation;dynamic range;front-end processor;nonlinear system;selective calling;signal processing;simulation;transform, clipping, and lighting;transmission line;zero suppression	Shuokai Pan;Stephen J.

The proposed model is compact but has reasonable accuracy for the dense substrate contacts in large-scale three dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs). We describe the modeling for substrate contacts with the equivalent electrical circuit, discuss the impact of substrate contacts on the electrical parasitic parameters, and clarify the effect of substrate contacts on reducing crosstalk noise and increasing delay. Results of analysis show that if substrate contacts are not considered, crosstalk noise becomes the overestimate of 5 to 700 times and delay becomes the underestimate of 1.4 to 2.4 times.	cmos;crosstalk;equivalent circuit;integrated circuit;silicon on sapphire;through-silicon via	Masayuki Watanabe;Rosely Karel;Nanako Niioka;Tetsuya Kobayashi;Masa-Aki Fukase;Masashi Imai;Atsushi Kurokawa	2014	2014 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems (APCCAS)	10.1109/APCCAS.2014.7032893	embedded system;substrate coupling;electronic engineering;crosstalk;telecommunications;electrical engineering;coupling	EDA	70.82629456671839	47.13773724451244	199749
