A resistive type of SFCL, which provides quick system protection, is modeled. Then, the optimal resistive value of the SFCL connected in series with a transmission line during a short-circuit fault is systematically determined by applying the equal-area criterion based on the power-angle curves. To verify the effectiveness of the optimal value of the proposed SFCL for reducing the value of fault current, several case studies are carried out by both simulation and experimental tests, particularly including the 220-V/300-A-scale laboratory and 13.2-kV/630-A-scale distribution system hardware tests. The results show that the optimal resistive value of the SFCL determined by the proposed method improves effectively the transient stability and damping performances during a fault over the other values determined by an ad hoc approach.	current limiting;hoc (programming language);limiter;optimization problem;performance;series and parallel circuits;simulation;transmission line	Byung Chul Sung;Dong Keun Park;Jung-Wook Park;Tae Kuk Ko	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2018432	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;transmission line;power system simulation;equivalent series resistance;electric power system;electric power transmission;power-system protection;system testing;transmission system	EDA	69.40132417729059	37.31931958723597	76451

Instead of making the reduced models passive for infinite frequencies, which is difficult and inefficient using state-of-the-art optimization based methods for circuits with many terminals and operating in wideband frequency ranges, the new method works on the signal waveform driving reduced models. It slightly shapes the waveforms of the signal such that the resulting signal spectra are band limited to the frequency range in which the reduced system is passive. As a result, the reduced models only need to be band-limited passive (also called conditionally passive), which can be achieved much easier than traditional passivity for a reduced system, especially for ones with many terminals or requiring wide band accuracy (more poles). We propose to use spectrum truncation via FFT/IFFT and low-pass filter based approaches for transient waveform shaping processing. We analyze the delay and distortion effects caused by using low-pass filters and propose methods to mitigate the two effects.

The DTC performance is significantly improved by the use of FPGA, which can execute the DTC algorithm at higher sampling frequency. This leads to the reduction of the torque ripple and improved flux and torque estimations. The main achievements are: 1) calculating a discrete integration operation of stator flux using backward Euler approach; 2) modifying a so called nonrestoring method in calculating the complicated square root operation in stator flux estimator; 3) introducing a new flux sector determination method; 4) increasing the sampling frequency to 200 kHz such that the digital computation will perform similar to that of the analog operation; and 5) using two's complement fixed-point format approach to minimize calculation errors and the hardware resource usage in all operations. The design was achieved in VHDL, based on a Matlab/Simulink simulation model. The Hardware-in-the-Loop method is used to verify the functionality of the FPGA estimator. The simulation results are validated experimentally. Thus, it is demonstrated that FPGA implementation of DTC drives can achieve excellent performance at high sampling frequency.	algorithm;binary file;computation;control flow;double-precision floating-point format;euler;experiment;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;matlab;ripple effect;sampling (signal processing);simulink;two's complement;vhdl	T.

The tool allows for the determination of the resulting whole system temperature and relative humidity distribution. For that, the simplified physical model combines principles of classical thermodynamics and heat transfer, resulting in a system of three-dimensional (3D) differential equations that are discretized in space using a 3D cell-centered finite volume scheme. As an example of a complex and integrated system analysis, 3D simulations are performed in order to determine the temperature and relative humidity distributions inside an all-electric ship for a baseline medium voltage direct current power system architecture, under different operating conditions. A relatively coarse mesh was used (9410 volume elements) to obtain converged results for a large computational domain (185m× 24m× 34m) containing diverse equipment. The largest computational time required for obtaining results was 560 s, that is, less than 10 min. Therefore, after experimental validation for a particular system, it is reasonable to state that the model could be used as an efficient tool for complex and integrated systems thermal design, control and optimization.	baseline (configuration management);computation;computational model;computer cooling;discretization;finite volume method;heat sink;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;noise temperature;numerical analysis;simulation;system analysis;system integration;systems architecture;systems design;thermal management of high-power leds;time complexity;windows steadystate	J.

Total harmonic distortion (THD) is one of the most important indexes to evaluate the harmonic contents of waveforms. The conventional method of line-voltage THD calculation gives approximate answers, because high-order harmonics are ignored. In this paper, an analytical algebraic method based on formulating the line-voltage THD of multilevel inverters with unequal dc sources is presented. This method, which is general and applicable to each number of switching angles, is implemented to a five-level inverter with staircase waveform as a case study. The implementing process of this method can be easily repeated for each number of levels. The accuracy of the proposed method is illustrated in comparison with the approximate method. Some advantages of the extracted formulas of line-voltage THD are simplicity and rapidity in calculations, considering all harmonics and the possibility of finding optimal switching angles analytically. Experimental results are presented to validate the theory.	approximation algorithm;inverter (logic gate);newton's method;power inverter;total harmonic distortion;waveform	Naeem Farokhnia;Hadi Vadizadeh;Seyed Hamid Fathi;Fariba Anvariasl	2011	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2010.2089938	electronic engineering;computer science;electrical engineering;harmonic analysis;control theory;mathematics;total harmonic distortion;statistics	Robotics	68.53866006799251	46.1011735627006	81517

Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to low pass filtering of a reduced-order model produced by these methods without breaking the passivity condition. Therefore, the proposed eigenspace method is not only a reduced-order macromodeling method, but also is embedded in other methods enhancing their performances.	sparse	Yuichi Tanji	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e91-a.9.2419	mathematical optimization;eigendecomposition of a matrix;low-pass filter;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;theoretical computer science;mathematics;quantum mechanics;algebra	EDA	72.17264739939147	44.08207879234197	82021

It is a very difficult problem to be solved, and affects the applications of vortex flowmeter. To solve this key problem, the frequency features of the flow signal and vibration noise are analyzed. A frequency-variance algorithm is proposed to deal with the vortex flow sensor output signal. A variance threshold is set to distinguish the vortex flow signal from the vibration noise interference. A signal processing system based on an ultralow-power microcontroller is developed to implement the algorithm and to extract the flow rate information from the signal containing strong vibration noise. At the same time, this system meets the requirements of low-power and two-wire mode, and can be used in process control. The strong vibration experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of both antistrong vibration algorithm and the system. Only one vortex flow sensor is required in the vortex flowmeter, which avoids the design and installation of the vibration sensor and saves the costs of meter.	algorithm;digital signal processing;experiment;interference (communication);low-power broadcasting;matlab;microcontroller;mixed-signal integrated circuit;quantum fluctuation;requirement;signal processing;ti msp430;taylor–green vortex	Chun-Li Shao;Ke-Jun Xu;Min Fang	2014	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2013.2289579	control engineering;electronic engineering;time–frequency analysis;acoustics;engineering;noise;vibration;interference;correlation;physics;quantum mechanics	Embedded	70.86299163411013	38.017841082636465	82456

This practically renders them useless for large circuits. This paper presents efficient substrate parasitic extraction techniques employing closed-form models derived using a quasi-static approach. We develop an integral equation model based on the Green's theorem utilizing a novel fast-convergent Green's function. In addition, we propose another modeling technique based on point approximation of the elements of the impedance matrix of the system. Although the proposed techniques speed the parasitic extraction process up, we show that it is unnecessary to run a full substrate parasitic extraction among all the devices for a system-on-a-chip. As such, by applying the new modeling technique to a multi-contact substrate structure, we develop a methodology that is a large-scale solution for substrate parasitic extraction in VLSI and mixed-signal circuits. Moreover, we demonstrate that the coupling among the contacts in a large system decreases faster than an exponential function of the distance among them. Using the proposed methodology, we introduce a decomposed two-contact problem set, associated with the original complex problem. Then, the total crosstalk of a device in the original problem is simply computed from the associated decomposed problem set.	crosstalk;system on a chip	Nasser Masoumi;Safieddin Safavi-Naeini;Mohamed I.

Temperature affects reliability, performance and power directly, motivating the need to accurately simulate the thermal profile of a chip. In literature, thermal conductivity is assumed to be a constant in order to obtain a linear system of equations which can be solved efficiently. But thermal conductivity is a nonlinear function of temperature and for silicon it varies by 22% over the range 27.80. C [1]. If the nonlinearity of the thermal conductivity is ignored the thermal profile might be off by 10. C. Thus to get an accurate thermal profile it is important to consider the nonlinear dependence of the thermal conductivity on temperature. In this paper the nonlinear system arising out of considering the nonlinear thermal conductivity is solved efficiently using a variant of Newton-Raphson. In this paper we also study the abstraction levels under which the approximation of a periodic source by a DC source is valid.	approximation;erewhon;linear system;newton's method;nonlinear system;set packing;simulation;system of linear equations;thermal profiling	Anand Ramalingam;David Z.

One of the most popular ones is the complex coefficient filter-based PLL (CCF-PLL), which benefits from a sequence selective filtering ability. This feature enables the CCF-PLL to selectively reject/extract disturbances before the PLL control loop while maintaining an acceptable dynamic behavior. The aim of this letter is presenting a simple yet effective approach to enhance the standard CCF-PLL performance without requiring any additional computational load.	coefficient;control system;microsoft customer care framework;phase-locked loop	Malek Ramezani;Saeed Golestan;Shuhui Li;Josep M.

After discretizing the linear part of the circuit, a system of non-linear algebraic equations is obtained. the final formulation is written entirely in the discrete-time domain, making it unnecessary to repeatedly take direct and inverse DFTs during the solution process. Furthermore, it is shown that the resulting formulation may be viewed as a generalization of the harmonic balance equations. an analytic method for computing the exact partial derivatives of the resulting equations with respect to the samples of the variables, the oscillation period and the circuit element values is described, making the proposed approach efficient for both analysis and optimization. Different globally convergent techniques for solving the non-linear system of equations are described, with emphasis on an algorithm based on fast simulated diffusion. Selected application examples are provided to validate the proposed approach.	autonomous robot;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;steady state	Pere Palà-Schönwälder;Joan M. Miró Sans	1995	I.

The low-frequency characterization of a thermal converter below 10 Hz is of great importance for linking ac-dc transfer standards and low-frequency ac voltage standards based on sampling methods. One feature of our model is the incorporation of the heat capacity for the thermocouple, which has previously been neglected to reproduce an accurate thermal time constant. Our model also includes the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient in the thermocouple in addition to the temperature-dependent material parameters of the heater. To verify the simulation results, the calculated results are compared with the experimental results, which shows that our improved model well reproduces the measured data below 1 Hz. The estimated uncertainty of the simulated ac-dc transfer differences is 49 μV/V at 4 Hz. These results suggest that our model is a useful predictive tool at low frequencies.	computer simulation;matthews correlation coefficient;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;sampling (signal processing);thermal time hypothesis	Yasutaka Amagai;Hiroyuki Fujiki	2014	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2014.2313952	forward converter;electronic engineering;ac/ac converter;electrical engineering	EDA	69.22679188600178	44.37706439134415	87705

Dominant components of spectrum are determined, and the impact of their distribution on the requirements for substrate modeling has been discussed. It has been concluded that resistive substrate approximation introduces large errors for systems with small decoupling capacitances, while it can be satisfactory for systems with large decoupling capacitances.	approximation;approximation error;computer simulation;coupling (computer programming);digital electronics;domain model;electronic circuit;globally asynchronous locally synchronous;ground bounce;matlab;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;rlc circuit;requirement;resonance;spectral density	Milan Babic;Xin Fan;Milos Krstic	2015	2015 25th International Workshop on Power and Timing Modeling, Optimization and Simulation (PATMOS)	10.1109/PATMOS.2015.7347597	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;ground bounce;control theory;frequency domain	EDA	70.38345355939238	45.155062023699536	90036

Unlike the traditional method, the proposed method first transforms the recorded current during the sag event to obtain frequency-time plot (Hilbert spectra) and IMF plot before the location of voltage sag source is determined. Then based on the change in frequency and IMF the relative location of voltage sag source is obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified through simulation on 20 bus system and by comparing with an existing S-Transform based method. The results show that the presented method can determine the location of voltage sag source correctly.	hilbert transform;newton's method;numerical analysis;power iteration;s transform;sensor;signal processing;simulation	Wong Ling Ai;Hussain Shareef;Ahmad Asrul Ibrahim	2012	2012 10th International Power & Energy Conference (IPEC)	10.1109/ASSCC.2012.6523296	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;analytical chemistry;hilbert–huang transform;hilbert spectral analysis	EDA	70.62337264971674	37.48061184798708	90725

This paper investigates the effect of frequency quantization in a first-order loop with a frequency-modulated input signal. Using tools of nonlinear dynamics, we show that, depending on the modulation amplitude, trajectories in the phase space eventually fall into either an invariant region or a trapping region, the boundaries of which give useful bounds on the steady-state phase jitter excursion. We also derive a sufficient condition for the maximum modulation amplitude to prevent loop cycle slipping.

It is based upon the use of complex damped exponential modeling functions. These allow to construct accurate signal models for digitally modulated telecom signals, requiring only few modeling functions. Since these models are valid over a long range of time, they allow for a large timestep, which greatly speeds up time-domain simulation of the telecom frontends. Details of a simulation approach based upon this signal model are discussed.

The proposed method predicts an estimation of the CPS1 value for the future, which could be used in deciding operating strategies to achieve a target CPS1 value. NERC standards on frequency control performance define two indices known as Control Performance Standards 1 and 2 (CPS1 and CPS2). This paper focuses on CPS1, which is used to evaluate control area performance in normal interconnected power system operation. The most straightforward method of estimating CPS1 is to perform a time domain simulation provided that the area load forecast is available. However, if only the probability distribution of load change is available, then a random load curve must be generated to use in time domain simulation. This paper proposes a simple technique to estimate CPS1 directly from the probability distribution of load change without performing a time domain simulation which significantly reduces computing time. Hence predictive evaluation of CPS1 value is a novel concept which could be very useful in practice. A two-area test system is used to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method against the time domain simulation method.	load profile;simulation;turing test	T. Jayasekara;U. D. Annakkage;R.

As a result of this critical evaluation, the general requirements for the simulation program adequate for converter systems studies and design have been formulated. On this basis the algorithm of TCAD — a general-purpose converter system simulation program — has been elaborated. In presentation of the TCAD program three parties have been distinguished: the first one emphasizes the applications of modern simulation methods for converter systems, the second describes briefly the features of the main modules of the TCAD package, and the third presents some simulation examples of practical converter systems. Three simulation examples are presented: two resonant converters and an induction motor drive fed by a full-bridge voltage source PWM inverter at normal and fault operation conditions. A good agreement between simulation and experimental results has proved that this simulation package is a power tool for research, teaching and engineering practice.

First, the characteristic frequencies of gearbox faults in DFIG stator and rotor currents are analyzed. Different time- and frequency-domain features of gearbox faults in DFIG stator and rotor current signals are then defined, and the methods to extract these features are introduced. These features are used as the inputs of multiclass support vector machines with probabilistic outputs for fault mode identification. Different schemes that use a single stator or rotor current signal or both stator and rotor current signals for the feature- or decision-level information fusion are designed.

Our framework can reuse factorized matrices to simulate the large-scale linear PDN system with variable stepsizes. In contrast, current conventional PDN simulation solvers have to use fixed step-size approach in order to reuse factorized matrices generated by the expensive matrix decomposition. Based on the proposed exponential integration framework, we design a PDN solver R-MATEX with the flexible time-stepping capability. The key operation of matrix exponential and vector product is computed by the rational Krylov subspace method. To further improve the runtime, we also propose a distributed computing framework DR-MATEX. DR-MATEX reduces Krylov subspace generations caused by frequent breakpoints from a large number of current sources during simulation. By virtue of the superposition property of linear system and scaling invariance property of Krylov subspace, DR-MATEX can divide the whole simulation task into subtasks based on the alignments of breakpoints among those sources. The subtasks are processed in parallel at different computing nodes without any communication during the computation of transient simulation. The final result is obtained by summing up the partial results among all the computing nodes after they finish the assigned subtasks. Therefore, our computation model belongs to the category known as embarrassingly parallel model. Experimental results show R-MATEX and DR-MATEX can achieve up to around 14.4× and 98.0× runtime speedups over traditional trapezoidal integration-based solver with fixed time-step approach.	algorithm;breakpoint;current source;dr-dos;distributed computing;domain analysis;dynamical system;electronic circuit simulation;embarrassingly parallel;fleet telematics system;iterative method;krylov subspace;linear system;manycore processor;model of computation;multi-core processor;numerical analysis;numerical integration;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;parallel computing;solver;speedup;stepping level;superposition principle;time complexity	Hao Zhuang;Wenjian Yu;Shih-Hung Weng;Ilgweon Kang;Jeng-Hau Lin;Xiang Zhang;Ryan Coutts;Jingwei Lu;Chung-Kuan Cheng	2016	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2016.2523908	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;theoretical computer science;linear circuit;computational model;algorithm	EDA	72.05570822458306	44.495205688848785	95209

The economic impact resulting from a bad PQ would be drastic on all consumers. Computers, uninterruptible and switched power supplies (UPS), and fluorescent lamps/tubes are examples of nonlinear loads that have the consumption of a nonsinusoidal current, which cause disturbances in the power supply system (that may be severe or not). This study discusses residential generic power circuitry analysis and simulation, under nonlinear loads, in connection with undergraduate electrical engineering education. It briefly reviews some of the basic techniques, and presents a software tool that has been found to be very useful in the context. The tool has an easy-to-use, friendly interface, and can be used to teach design techniques or as a laboratory support to study the applicability of known methods to real situations. The students can perform simulations with their own data on Microsoft™ Windows®-based platforms. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In SG systems, voltage, current, frequency and phase measurements can be collected in real-time using phasor measurement units (PMUs). Based on the wavelet analysis of these measurements, the signal features can be extracted by computing the maximum wavelet transform coefficients (WTCs) and further processing them with a new hybrid clustering algorithm. The clustered signal features then form a fault contour map which can be used to locate faults in the SG system accurately. Both long-term and short-term faults of transmission line, transformer, generator, and load, which are major components of SG systems, are simulated in PSCAD and PowerWorld using the IEEE New England 39-bus system to verify the proposed method. The numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method for accurate fault localization in SG systems.	algorithm;cluster analysis;coefficient;contour line;fast fourier transform;numerical analysis;phasor;real-time clock;suicidegirls;transformer;transmission line;unsupervised learning;wavelet transform	Huaiguang Jiang;Jun Jason Zhang;David Wenzhong Gao	2012	2012 Conference Record of the Forty Sixth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (ASILOMAR)	10.1109/ACSSC.2012.6489031	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;engineering	EDA	70.13860607186537	36.48009788883633	98064

They offered a criterion to estimate the feasibility and effect in engineering practice of the compensating method to improve the sensor's dynamic characteristics, and proved that the compensating method has good reliability. Conclusions were drawn clearly: For a first-order system, the compensation effect is conspicuous, which only relates to modeling error but is independent of time constant; for a second-order system, the compensation effect is determined by modeling error and damping ratio. Within a wide range, if the damping ratio is larger, the modeling precision required to obtain the same compensation effect can be lower. Through quantitatively analysis, we found that the modeling precision in dynamic compensation with analogy or digital filter should not be so high as one is taken for granted currently.

Thermal modeling for microchannel cooling is challenging due to its complicated thermal-wake effect, a localized temperature wake phenomenon downstream of a heated source in the flow. This paper presents a fast and accurate thermal-wake aware thermal model for integrated microchannel 3D ICs. Validation results show the proposed thermal model achieves more than 400x speed up and only 2.0% error in comparison with a commercial numerical simulation tool. We also demonstrate the use of the proposed thermal model for thermal optimization during the IC placement stage. We find that due to the thermal-wake effect, tiles are placed in the descending order of power magnitude along the flow direction. We also find that modeling thermal-wakes is critical for generating a thermal-aware placement for integrated microchannel-cooled 3D IC. It could result in up to 25°C peak temperature difference according to our experiments.	computer cooling;downstream (software development);experiment;mathematical optimization;numerical weather prediction;simulation;sorting;speedup;three-dimensional integrated circuit	Hitoshi Mizunuma;Chia-Lin Yang;Yi-Chang Lu	2009	2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design - Digest of Technical Papers	10.1145/1687399.1687447	computer simulation;thermal resistance;electronic engineering;microchannel;simulation;electrical engineering;stress;computer cooling;heat transfer;thermal analysis;integrated circuit design	EDA	73.67033491574894	45.22916970001864	99685

The black-box method is divided into three steps. In the first step, a black-box testing theory model with the rotational speed as the input signal and the noise frequency as the output signal is proposed. The main abnormal noise sources of PMSM for electric vehicles are taken into account in this model, such as harmonic currents, switching frequency of pulsewidth modulation, eccentricity, sliding bearing, and resonance. In the second step, a black-box testing experiment of noise of PMSM is applied under acceleration conditions and the sound quality of PMSM is analyzed with objective acoustic indicators, and psychoacoustic indicators as well. In the third step, abnormal noise sources are identified and diagnosed by means of the black-box testing theory and the black-box testing experiment. Noise contribution to psychoacoustic indicators is further analyzed. The proposed method is independent of detailed internal parameters of PMSM, such as structural parameters and electromagnetic parameters, and observably raises analyzing efficiency.	acoustic cryptanalysis;black box;black-box testing;clock rate;distance (graph theory);psychoacoustics;pulse-width modulation;resonance;sound quality	Conggan Ma;Shuguang Zuo	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2014.2301767	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;vibration;noise;physics	Robotics	69.77240094956693	37.765213434290665	100105

The proposed strategy is based on the decomposition of the stator currents into their instantaneous active and reactive current components. Such components allow the decoupling of the effects produced by rotor asymmetries from those produced by oscillating loads. This allows not only the proper fault detection but also a correct fault diagnosis. Simulation and experimental results, both from laboratory and industrial cases, are presented to validate the proposal.	coupling (computer programming);fault detection and isolation;mathematical induction;neural oscillation;r.o.t.o.r.;simulation	Guillermo R.

7225b2aaaf4de424cd61d325391e5e3e990bec05	torque ripple suppression for open-end multi-phase pmsms operating under open-phase faults		Open-phase faults in multiphase PMSMs could occur either through an electrical failure or by selective isolation of one or a higher number of phase windings. In such cases, postfault currents are injected into the remaining healthy windings to maintain an average torque. However, considerable torque ripple may be present if the post-fault currents are not properly designed. Accordingly, a generic approach is proposed in this paper for designing post-fault currents including nonfundamental harmonics that lead to maximum post-fault average torque with suppressed torque ripple in open-end multiphase PMSMs. The proposed scheme is not restricted by the number of open-phase faults. In the proposed algorithm, the post-fault currents are parameterized, based on which the instantaneous post-fault torque is exhaustively formulated. An optimization algorithm is then used to obtain the optimal parameters of the post-fault currents. Experimental tests on a prototype open-end five-phase PMSM under different fault scenarios are used validate the torque ripple suppression capability of the proposed approach.

The main purpose is to extract the bearing fault signatures in the presence of strong noise and multiple vibration interferences without prior information of the resonance excited by the bearing fault. This new energy operator exploits both the interference handling capability of a differentiation step and the noise suppression nature of the integration process. It also shares the simplicity, computational efficiency, and the ability to reveal signal impulsiveness of the energy operator. All these elements, i.e., differentiation, integration and energy operator, are implemented by a simple formula in a single step. Another advantage of the CEEO method is that, unlike the popular high frequency resonance methods, it does not require a bandpass filtering step and hence eliminates the burden to acquire the resonance information. As such, it is suited to on-line bearing fault detection in a noisy environment with multiple vibration interferences. Our simulation studies have shown that the CEEO method outperforms the conventional energy operator and the enveloping methods in handling both noise and interferences. Its performance has also been examined using our experimental data and the data from the literature.	energy operator;fault detection and isolation	Mike Liang;H. Faghidi	2014	Expert Syst.

Four different types of transient signals are obtained and they are voltage oscillation, current oscillation, voltage pulse and current pulse. The wavelet and the lifting wavelet are respectively used to detect the above four kinds of transient signals. The simulation results show that both the wavelet and the lifting wavelet can accurately detect the singularity of transient signal. However, the reconstruction error of the lifting wavelet is much less than that of the wavelet. The algorithm of the lifting wavelet is more accurate than that of the wavelet. Therefore, the lifting wavelet is more suitable for the accurate and real-time operating requirements in the power system.	simulation	Jian-ping Zhou	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33478-8_64	wavelet;second-generation wavelet transform;control theory;cascade algorithm;mathematics;wavelet packet decomposition;stationary wavelet transform;transient;discrete wavelet transform;lifting scheme;statistics	EDA	69.8675969282908	37.80927111906257	107425

The single-pulse control strategy is widely adopted for high speed SRG which discretizes the generator model into a static optimization problem with excitation angles as the control variables. The conventional procedure of finding the optimal excitation angles is divided into two groups, i.e. purely equation-based approach and purely data-based approach. Excitation control based on polynomial approximation is presented in this paper. A data-driven Finite Element Model (FEM) is studied at the very beginning to account for the un-modeled dynamics of the plant. Then constrains and objectives are approximated by polynomial functions via extensive input-output mapping, which are used to solve a nonlinear programming in a later step. The optimal excitation angle pairs are finally stored in a look-up table. Upon the completion of the nonlinear optimization process. The simulation in Matlab/Simulink demonstrates the control performance for a 45kw, rotor speed 9000 rpm, 6/14 poles switched reluctance generator.	approximation algorithm;control theory;excited state;finite element method;lookup table;matlab;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;polynomial;r.o.t.o.r.;simulation;simulink;strongly regular graph	Yang Yu;Shuai Wang;Rong Su;King-Jet Tseng;V.

The IMF is an electrical furnace in which heat is applied by induction heating of the metal and its operation injects various time-varying harmonic and interharmonic currents to the power system, which should be analyzed in terms of power quality. In this research work, the IMF operation has been represented by a variable series RL circuit to model the fundamental components of electrical quantities, and a shunt-connected current source, to model the generated harmonics and interharmonics over a typical melting cycle. Based on the similarity between the spectrums of speech signals and that of the IMF current, sinusoidal coding method is applied to represent the major harmonics and interharmonics of the supply line currents obtained from field measurements of the IMFs. It has been shown that the sinusoidal coding method can be used to satisfactorily represent the operation of the IMF system as seen from the supply terminals, with a minimum data storage requirement, and can be used to construct efficient IMF databases for power quality studies. The power quality problems of the IMF system, in particular the problematic time-varying interharmonic voltage distortion have been investigated in detail, using the developed model.	computer data storage;current source;database;distortion;electric power quality;mathematical induction;rl (complexity);rl circuit	Ilker Yilmaz;Özgül Salor-Durna;Isik Çadirci;Muammer Ermis	2013	2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2013.6531370	electrical engineering;harmonic analysis;metal	EDA	70.95380008239914	38.198229103866964	108415

Normalization issues are fixed by an appropriate transformation allowing a quickly global minimum search. Finally, the proposed estimation method is tested and validated using simulation data from a 1GHz oscillator circuit in GaAs technology.	algorithm;electronic oscillator;estimation theory;high-level programming language;iterative method;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;nonlinear system;radio frequency;simulation;state space;state-space representation;van der pol oscillator;variable data printing;variable data publishing	Iulia Dumitrescu;Smail Bachir;David Cordeau;Jean-Marie Paillot;Mihai Iordache	2012	Journal of Circuits, Systems, and Computers	10.1142/S0218126612500430	control engineering;electronic engineering;systems modeling;nonlinear system;control theory;mathematics;estimation theory;oscillation;quantum mechanics;statistics	EDA	69.51594519571526	43.968204819662986	110680

The algorithm does not require line parameters to locate the fault, which is an advance over fault locators that do require such information. Line parameters are only approximately constant; they vary with different loading and weather conditions, which affects the accuracy of existing fault location algorithms. Thus, an approach which does not require line parameters would be more robust, accurate, and flexible. Accurately, locating faults on transmission lines is vital for expediting their repair, so the proposed solution could lead to an improvement in the security and quality of the energy supply. Development of the proposed algorithm was facilitated by new smart grid technologies in the field of wide-area monitoring, protection, and control. The proposed algorithm is based on emerging synchronized measurement technology, using synchronized data sampling at both line terminals; however, the “SynchroCheck” procedure is also proposed as a means of accurately locating faults when data sampling synchronization has been lost. This paper presents the algorithm derivation and the results of thorough testing using alternative transients program-electromagnetic transients program (ATP-EMTP) fault simulations.	algorithm;iteration;iterative method;numerical analysis;online locator service;overhead (computing);phasor;robustness (computer science);sampling (signal processing);simulation;transmission line	Vladimir V.

The basis of the proposed method is to determine different frequency bands of the faulty motor current and extract a proper intrinsic mode function (IMF) developed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD). It is analytically proved that two specific IMFs, IMF2 in line-start mode and IMF3 in inverter-fed mode, can be used for precise prediction of the behavior of a faulty induction motor. The precision of the method is shown at different operating points, including different loads, fault, and reference speeds. The results indicate that the motor asymmetry is remarkably reduced at distributed broken bars. In addition, the proposed method is capable of determining the operating point of the faulty motor even at no/light loads. Finally, the Filippetti criterion is used, and a new aspect is analytically developed to justify the variations of IMF3 with speed in an inverter-fed induction motor. The analytical results are verified by experiments.	bar induction;distance (graph theory);distortion;experiment;frequency band;hilbert–huang transform;operating point;power inverter;vertical bar	Jawad Faiz;Vahid Ghorbanian;Bashir Mahdi Ebrahimi	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2013.2289941	control engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;induction motor	Robotics	69.25791952775297	37.55670037451727	111501

3ff030d873ac5caa900508eb29014a8509c7004b	expedited dimension scaling of microwave and antenna structures using inverse surrogates		Re-designing circuits for various sets of performance specifications is an important problem in microwave and antenna engineering. Unfortunately, this is a difficult task that is normally realized as a separate design process, which is often as expensive (in computational terms) as obtaining the original design. In this work, we consider the application of inverse surrogate modeling for fast geometry scaling of microwave and antenna structures. Computational efficiency of the discussed procedure is ensured by representing the structure at the low-fidelity model level. The explicit relation between design specifications (here, operating frequency) of the structure and its geometry dimensions is determined based on a set of predetermined reference designs. Subsequently, the model is corrected to elevate the redesigned geometry to the high-fidelity electromagnetic (EM) model level. Our approach is demonstrated through a compact rat-race coupler and a patch antenna with enhanced bandwidth.	acoustic coupler;clock rate;computation;image scaling;microwave;reference implementation;surrogate model;surrogates	S.

52966eb39a1af14d0b520f0459f2a00a3b2abd13	3d electro-thermal simulations of wide area power devices operating in avalanche condition		In this paper a novel 3D electro-thermal simulator for high power devices operating in avalanche condition will be presented. The proposed solution is based on two coupled systems: a 3D-FEM thermal simulator and a 2D electrical solver. The simulator has been implemented in MATLAB language. It is capable of simulating a large number of macro-cells composing a wide-area power devices operating in avalanche condition. The electrical solver uses a SPICE-like algorithm with a look-up-table description for every cell. The thermal problem is solved by a finite element method (FEM) in an iterative scheme with the electrical simulator. In order to prove the effectiveness of the simulator, we will present electro-thermal simulations in Unclamped Inductive Switching (UIS) conditions for a high power Trench-IGBT. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The main objective was to find the nonlinear current-versus-voltage (I–V) and power-versus-voltage (P–V) characteristics curves for solar PV modules Photonix 150W and Photonix 140W and to compare the results with the manufacturer’s data sheet. The Embedded MATLAB function finds the best output current and power with respect to voltage characteristics curves for various cell temperature and solar irradiation values for the solar PV model, which includes the effect of the series resistance. Thus, the parallel resistance, which is infinite, can be neglected for simplification. The modeling method and the proposed Embedded MATLAB function are helpful for power electronics designers, who need a trouble-free and user-friendly modeling method for the simulation of solar PV systems. The parameters that compose various PV models have been proposed by many authors. By changing the parameter values, the output current and power with respect to voltage characteristics curves are acquired, and simulation results match the manufacturer’s data.	decstation;datasheet;diode;electron;embedded system;ibm power systems;imax;input/output;level of detail;matlab;maximum power transfer theorem;newton;newton's method;nonlinear system;numerical recipes;page view;power electronics;profiling (computer programming);p–n junction;ray (optics);series and parallel circuits;short circuit;simulation;simulink;solar cell;spectral leakage;usability;user-generated content	C.

Fast-switching digital blocks inject noise into common substrate hindering the performance of high precision sensible analog circuitry. Miniaturization effects on IC's complexity, inevitably make the accuracy requirements for substrate coupling simulation increase. However, model extraction and evaluation should not increase, leading to the need for fast and accurate substrate model extraction tools. We propose an extraction methodology based on a 3D finite difference formulation. The resulting 3D mesh is efficiently reduced to a circuit-level contact-based model by means of a fast multilevel algorithm. Extraction results show the proposed method to be very efficient, achieving linear complexity independently of accuracy and discretization and outperforming competing algorithms that show quadratic complexity.	algorithm;analog signal processing;discretization;electronic circuit;finite difference;linear programming;mixed-signal integrated circuit;multigrid method;requirement;simulation;substrate coupling	João M.

Furthermore, this method is validated through two simulations. The first simulation's result showed that this method is as accurate as traditional modal analysis.

Several techniques based on passive and active detection schemes have been proposed previously. Although passive schemes have a large nondetection zone NDZ, concerns have been raised about active methods because of their degrading effect on power quality. Reliably detecting this condition is regarded by many as an ongoing challenge because existing methods are not entirely satisfactory. This article proposes a new integrated histogram analysis method using a neuro-fuzzy approach for islanding detection in grid-connected wind turbines. The main objective of the proposed approach is to reduce the NDZ to as close as possible to zero and to maintain the output power quality unchanged. In addition, this technique can also overcome the problem of setting detection thresholds which is inherent in existing techniques. The method proposed in this study has a small NDZ and is capable of detecting islanding accurately within the minimum standard time. Moreover, for those regions which require better visualization, the proposed approach can serve as an efficient aid for better detecting grid-power disconnection. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

5fa2b844e70692f9dbcc27890574cc03a9d1eca6	dynamic co-simulation methods for combined transmission-distribution system and integration time step impact on convergence		Combined Transmission and Distribution Systems (CoTDS) simulation for power systems requires development of algorithms and software that are numerically stable and at the same time accurately simulate dynamic events that can occur in practical systems. The dynamic behavior of transmission and distribution systems are vastly different, especially with the increased deployment of distribution generation. The time scales of simulation can be orders of magnitude apart making the combined simulation extremely challenging. This has led to increased research in applying co-simulation techniques for integrated simulation of the two systems. In this paper, a rigorous mathematical analysis on convergence of numerical methods in co-simulation is presented. Two methods for cosimulation of CoTDS are proposed using parallel and series computation of the transmission system and distribution systems. Both these co-simulation methods are validated against total system simulation in a single time-domain simulation environment. The series computation co-simulation method is shown to have better numerical stability at larger integration time steps. The series computation co-simulation method is additionally validated against commercial EMTP software and the results show remarkable correspondence.

It has previously been shown that the dc electric current solution on each interconnect segment of a net may be modified to form the analytical solution of the 1-D time-independent heat equation along the entire net. A symbolic solution of the network equations (requiring O(P3) operations, where P is the number of nodes) is first evaluated to solve the electrical problem and then evaluated again to solve the resulting Joule heat problem (each evaluation requiring O(P) operations). The symbolic solution is extended here to couple each interconnect segment to the weighted average temperature of the segments on neighboring nets. The temperature over the entire set of nets may be found by iterating until convergence, which does not require a significant overall increase in operations. The accuracy of the temperature trajectories is principally dependent on the validity of the assumptions that the temperature background seen by each individual interconnect segment is uniform and that vias conduct heat only along their lengths. The estimated temperature of self-heated nets is 110% of the finite-element result for a realistic layout example. The net-based solution is well suited to distributed processing and identifying problematic layout.	central processing unit;code;computational resource;computer-aided design;coupling (computer programming);cray t3d;distributed computing;electromigration;entity;excalibur: morgana's revenge;integrated circuit;iterated function;iteration;iterative method;joule;linked list;network analysis (electrical circuits);network topology;numerical analysis;r language;requirement;schematic;simulation;via (electronics)	Andrew Labun;Karan Jagjitkumar	2008	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2008.2003275	electronic engineering;electrical engineering;finite element method;quantum mechanics	EDA	71.74853250705749	44.14454980255806	121044
77ab90d26f4d9281bb97ccb813b0bf7f1b1df5e7	improving accuracy and speed in real-time simulation of electric circuits	variable sub step;real time;real time simulation;electric circuit;fixed step;electrical circuit	This article proposes a methodology for real-time simulation of electric circuits consisting of linear circuit components combined with nonlinear elements, such as diodes and electronic switches, that exhibit discontinuous behavior. The methodology consists of sub-dividing fixed numerical integration time-steps into sub-steps over which the entire circuit behaves linearly, thus permitting the simulation over each sub-step to be performed using analytic formulas. For non-real-time simulation, this has routinely been accomplished using variable-step numerical integration. In the article, we show how real-time integration can be accomplished using a linear analytic formula over each fixed integration step, where the formula coefficients are stored functions of the sub-step parameters. For example, in a single-phase diode rectifier circuit, each fixed integration step h is divided into two sub-steps, the first of duration hen over which the diode is not conducting and the second of duration h(1 - en) over which the diode is conducting, with a simple formula used to calculate the dimensionless sub-step parameter en. The output current for the n + 1 frame is then calculated with a linear formula requiring four multiplications and four additions. Three of the five coefficients required for this calculation are rather complex functions of the parameter en. However, by restricting en to N + 1 equally spaced values between 0 and 1, the 3(N + 1) possible coefficient values can be pre-computed and stored in memory, which results in a sizeable reduction in execution time for each fixed integration step. The article includes a three-phase diode rectifier example that sub-divides each fixed integration step h into three sub-steps of duration hdn, h(en - dn) and h(1 - en).		Robert M.

To serve the demands of many applications, often a large number of single battery cells are combined into modules or packs of batteries. However, the determination of state of charge and parameters of the single cells is important for the reliable and safe operation of batteries. In the present paper, we investigate the observability and identifiability of cells in battery packs, realized in parallel and serial connections. The analysis is based on linear and nonlinear observability tests exploiting an equivalent circuit model. This leads to conclusive findings concerning the feasibility of estimating the states of single cells from lumped measurements. As shown for cells in parallel connection, one voltage and one current sensor are sufficient to determine state of charge and model parameters of the individual cells. The results are illustrated by simulations.	equivalent circuit;nonlinear system;sensor;series and parallel circuits;simulation;state of charge	Matthias Rausch;Stefan Streif;Christian Pankiewitz;Rolf Findeisen	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2013.6662782	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	70.70729493484163	42.215563228247184	124421

The methods here proposed use parameters of the power system in nominal steady state condition and available measurements at the distribution substation during fault and pre-fault. The tests were performed on the IEEE 34 bus system with different fault resistances and variations of several parameters of the power distribution systems. These methods help improve the continuity index in power distribution systems by determining the distance to the fault. The absolute error has been used to evaluate the efficiency of each method and its subsequent comparison.	approximation error;ieee 1471;oral history metadata synchronizer;qualitative comparative analysis;scott continuity;steady state;traction substation	J.

These predictive filters are optimized for generating current references in active power filters (APFs). The accuracy (phase/amplitude) of the reference current is crucial in current-injection-type systems, because it directly affects the harmonics reduction ability of the APF. Our digital filtering approach has the following advantages: selective bandpass response, efficient attenuation of specific harmonic components, capability to handle typical frequency alteration, small number of multiplications, and structural simplicity. In addition, practically no prior knowledge of the electricity distribution network and its loading characteristics is needed for designing the current reference generator. In an illustrative example, the total harmonic distortion of an artificial current waveform was reduced from 36.7% to less than 3.7% within the line frequency range 49-51 Hz. The proposed scheme is a combination of the hard-computing (HC)-type multiplicative general parameter method and evolutionary programming that, on the other hand, is a constituent of soft computing (SC). Such open-minded fusion thinking is emerging among researchers and engineers, and it can potentially lead to efficient combinations of HC and SC methodologies*both on the algorithm level and on the system level.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;digital filter;evolutionary programming;frequency band;mathematical optimization;particle filter;soft computing;total harmonic distortion;type system;waveform	Seppo J.

This versatile and robust tool is well adapted to the implementation in a DFIG drives CAD environment using iterative optimization procedures. In such an application, it is used to compute the dynamical constraints function during the integrated design process of the whole drive including the generator, the gearbox and the power converters. Results show that it is necessary to take into account the dynamical constraints under fault operation, during the early steps of the system design process. Another application of the tool is also illustrated in the paper: the design of the protection system (i.e. the crowbar resistance) for a given generator, a given gearbox and a given power converter. © 2010 IMACS.

Standard operation of plasma reactors uses an RF power source with constant average power to excite a plasma in the vacuum chamber. Recently, several researchers have shown empirically that operation of plasma reactors with a periodic power input has the promise to increase the flexibility of plasma processing, in the sense that a greater range of operating conditions is achievable. This paper presents a numerical analysis of a global model for an argon plasma with the aim of answering the following questions: First, can a periodic input achieve effective operating conditions that cannot be achieved using steady-state inputs? Second, if the answer to the first question is yes, what is the shape of the periodic input required to achieve a particular operating point? This technique was utilized to give answers to these questions in one particular case. It was shown that periodic operation of an argon plasma can create variations in the ratio of metastable argon density to ionized argon density beyond that achievable using constant power. In addition, strong evidence is given that arbitrarily shaped modulating waveforms have advantages over simple pulse width modulation.	electron;emoticon;excite;floor and ceiling functions;gradient descent;hessian;loss function;noise shaping;numerical analysis;operating point;orthogonal polarization spectral imaging;physical vapor deposition;plasma active;plasma display;power supply;pulse shaping;pulse-width modulation;radio frequency;series expansion;simulation;steady state;time complexity;variational principle;very-large-scale integration	Tyrone L.

Independent of any specific form of observers, the bounds explore the quality of the data collected for estimation and indicate the best achievable accuracy of any (unbiased) estimator under measurement noise. The derivation is performed based on an equivalent circuit model. First, the Cramer-Rao bounds for standalone estimation, where only one state/parameter is estimated, is derived. The discussion is then extended to combined estimation where multiple state/parameters are estimated from the same data set. It is found that for current inputs that satisfy certain patterns, loss of accuracy in combined estimation can be avoided. The derived explicit analytic expressions are easy to use for improving the accuracy of both online and offline state/parameter estimation.	design of experiments;equivalent circuit;estimation theory;experiment;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;online and offline;optimization problem;recursion;state of charge;system on a chip	Xinfan Lin	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7525539	electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics;resistance;statistics	ML	72.33173683992828	41.05712082468482	132591

In the study, after introducing the importance of the power factor, the methods of improving power factor and the topologies used for single-phase ac–dc boost PFC are discussed. Then, single-phase boost type PFC converters are analyzed and simulated via Simplorer 6.0 component-level simulation program.

We present an efficient and elegant method, involving no numerical simulation, for finding parametric sensitivities of oscillator frequencies directly from nonlinear phase domain macromodels. We validate the method, termed FS-PPV, on numerically extracted ring and LC oscillator PPV macromodels, as well as on a purely analytical exact PPV macromodel for idealized ring oscillators. We apply FS-PPV to find statistical distributions of oscillator center frequencies and validate these distributions against Monte-Carlo simulations. FS-PPV achieves speedups of more than 3000times over brute-force Monte-Carlo based parameter variation analysis.	computer simulation;electronic oscillator;heart rate variability;lc circuit;macromodel;monomial;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;object storage;performance;spatial variability;variable rules analysis;x86 memory segmentation	Zhichun Wang;Jaijeet S.

The ability to partition a model increases the potential for physical-domain model reduction, and allows parallel simulation of smaller individual submodels that can reduce computation time. Negligible constraint equation terms are identified and eliminated in a bond graph by converting inactive power bonds to modulated sources. If separate bond graphs result, between which all modulating signals move from a ‘‘driving” subgraph to a ‘‘driven” one, then one-way coupling exists in the model and it can be separated into driving and driven partitions. Information flow between the subgraphs is one-way. In this paper the algorithm is extended to models in which two-way information flow from modulating signals precludes complete partitioning. It is shown for several classes of modulating signals that, under certain conditions the signal is ‘‘weak” and therefore can be eliminated. Removal of weak signals allows partitioning of the longitudinal and pitch dynamics of a medium-duty truck model. The intensity of dynamic coupling and the potential for model reduction are shown to depend on the magnitude of system parameters and the severity of inputs such as road roughness. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The major challenge for wind turbines is the electrical and the mechanical failures which can occur at any time causing prospective breakdowns and damages and therefore it leads to machine downtimes and to energy production loss. To circumvent this problem, several tools and techniques have been developed and used to enhance fault detection and diagnosis to be found in the stator current signature for wind turbines generators. Among these methods, parametric or super-resolution frequency estimation methods, which provides typical spectrum estimation, can be useful for this purpose. Facing on the plurality of these algorithms, a comparative performance analysis is made to evaluate robustness based on different metrics: accuracy, dispersion, computation cost, perturbations and faults severity. Finally, simulation results in MATLAB with most occurring faults indicate that ESPRIT and R-MUSIC algorithms have high capability of correctly identifying the frequencies of fault characteristic components, a performance ranking had been carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the studied methods in faults detecting.

In the model, system initial state before switching is considered and the full response is used to describe the switch-on process. First, the system states before and after switching are discussed, and an approximate method is proposed to calculate the initial value of converter dc-side voltage in switch-on unit. Then, equivalent transient sources and system transfer functions are obtained to establish the switch-on model. So, the switch-on process can be described through full responses of the selected currents under the excitation of equivalent sources. Furthermore, the proposed model is verified by a developed dynamic wireless EV charging prototype. Also, switch-on transient characteristics are investigated through discussions on system parameter and vehicle speed effects. Finally, a simple way to select the suitable switching position is provided based on the analysis of switching position influence, and its effectiveness has been validated by experimental results.	approximation algorithm;extended validation certificate;position-independent code;prototype	Yanjie Guo;Lifang Wang;Qingwei Zhu;Chenglin Liao;Fang Li	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2557302	equivalent circuit;control engineering;electronic engineering;vehicle dynamics;degradation;network switch;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	Robotics	68.47233773379821	41.750988299898324	136985

Based on the analysis of time-frequency features of fault waveform, a recognized method of distribution line fault type was proposed in this paper. Through modeling and theoretical analysis of waveforms of different fault types, characteristic parameters, which could characterize waveforms of different fault types from three aspects, time domain, frequency domain, and electric arc, were put forward. Calculation formula for extracting characteristic parameters according to fault waveform data was proposed, recognition logic was established by taking multi-parameter fusion as a basis, and then,automatic recognition of distribution line fault types caused by different factors was realized through detection and classification of characteristic parameters of input waveform data. Finally, 136 groups of field fault waveform data provided by the Electric Power Research Institute were used to do closed-loop control and verification of the algorithm, and results indicated that recognition success rate reached 90%, which verified the feasibility of using time-frequency characteristics of fault waveform to realize recognition of distribution line fault types.	algorithm;control theory;waveform	Xue Qin;Peng Wang;Yadong Liu;Linhui Guo;Gehao Sheng;Xiuchen Jiang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2728015	fault coverage;frequency domain;computer science;time–frequency analysis;distributed computing;fault indicator;waveform;electric power;electronic engineering;time domain;fault (power engineering)	Robotics	69.02556724759091	36.32087228839194	137761

An initial output waveform is calculated by solving the corresponding differential equations of the circuit only for the conducting transistor. The effect of the short-circuit current is treated as an additional charge that has to be discharged through the conducting transistor thus causing a time-shift of the initial output waveform. The dynamic behavior of the loading transistor is analyzed and the current due to its bulk-to-drain coupling capacitance is taken into account. Also, sub-threshold current is taken into account where significant.	cmos;computational complexity theory;power inverter;propagation delay;short-circuit evaluation;software propagation;transistor;waveform	Orestis Palampougioukis;Spiridon Nikolaidis	2013	2013 IEEE 20th International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS)	10.1109/ICECS.2013.6815335	materials science;control engineering;electronic engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	68.99918169892307	45.21735516226033	140324

In our approach, we first approximate the nonlinear system with a convex combination of parameterized linear models created by linearizing the nonlinear system at points along training trajectories. Each of these linear models is then projected using a moment-matching scheme into a low-order subspace, resulting in a parameterized reduced-order nonlinear system. Several options for selecting the linear models and constructing the projection matrix are presented and analyzed. In addition, we propose a training scheme which automatically selects parameter-space training points by approximating parameter sensitivities. Results and comparisons are presented for three examples which contain distributed strong nonlinearities: a diode transmission line, a microelectromechanical switch, and a pulse-narrowing nonlinear transmission line. In most cases, we are able to accurately capture the parameter dependence over the parameter ranges of plusmn50% from the nominal values and to achieve an average simulation speedup of about 10x.	approximation algorithm;diode;linear model;model order reduction;nonlinear system;simulation;speedup;transmission line	Bradley N.

Usually, during relaxation (the phase of no or low loads) the SoC is determined based on the measurement of the battery's electro-motive force (EMF). To obtain a reliable measurment, it is required that the battery voltage transient is in a well-relaxed state, which is rarely reached in practice (e.g. due to periodic discharge activities). In this paper, a predictive methodology is presented which is able to forecast the EMF and therewith the SoC already during a not well-relaxed state of the voltage transient. A nonlinear relaxation voltage model is reformulated such that the problem can be treated as a linear least squares estimation problem. Based on this estimation, the performance is evaluated with respect to the following aspects: prediction time, current rate influence, SoC influence, cell-to-cell deviation, or rather aging and temperature effects. Experimental results are presented for a fixed-point implementation of the estimation scheme on a CY8CKIT-050 PSOC5 programmable system on chip. For validation, measurements of 2.25Ah Sanyo UR18650A lithium cells have been used. It is shown that the presented approach offers an improved re-initialization methodology for the Coulomb counting method, and that it clearly outperforms the usual EMF-measurement based SoC determination method.	discharger;eclipse modeling framework;estimation theory;fixed-point arithmetic;linear least squares (mathematics);linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;psoc;process corners;prototype;sanyo plv-z4;state of charge;system on a chip	Christoph Unterrieder;Michael Lunglmayr;Stefano Marsili;Mario Huemer	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2014.6865212	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	71.37292825855596	39.623890742072504	144029

This paper is devoted to designing a new time synchronization method for such systems. In the proposed algorithm, a proportional-integral (PI) clock servo is used to achieve the frequency compensation. In order to reduce the growth rate of synchronization error due to the quantization error in timestamping, a Kalman filter is designed based on a state-variable model, which is built for the PI controller-tuned slave clock. In addition, the quantization effect is analyzed and the variance of quantization error is quantitatively estimated for each slave node. Experiments are performed to validate its effectiveness and demonstrate that the peak-to-peak jitter is measured to be only 59.37 ns after four hops, and the growth rate of synchronization error can also be significantly reduced by the presented synchronization method. This indicates that the maximum number of networked nodes can be correspondingly increased.	algorithm;experiment;frequency compensation;kalman filter;platform for internet content selection;precision time protocol;quantization (signal processing);real-time clock;real-time computing;scalability;servo;slave clock;synchronization (computer science);tree accumulation	Xiong Xu;Zhenhua Xiong;Xinjun Sheng;Jianhua Wu;Xiangyang Zhu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2013.2238547	kalman filter;control engineering;clock synchronization;synchronization;real-time computing;jitter;telecommunications;computer science;self-clocking signal;control theory	Embedded	73.66818604722692	36.304529068767195	144365

One method often used to calculate first-order estimates of gate delays is the average capacitor current method. Using this method, the delay is calculated assuming that the capacitor current is constant and equal to the average of the capacitor current values at the limits of the time interval of interest. In this paper, this method is discussed and compared with other methods of delay calculation using integration and curve-fitting techniques familiar to electrical and computer engineering students. Since the computation of the capacitor current is relatively complicated because it requires the calculation of the MOS transistor currents, for propagation delay calculation there is no benefit in calculating the capacitor current twice. A single current calculation, corresponding to the familiar midpoint integration method, is sufficient to get the same or better accuracy as that of the average capacitor current method. The two-point Gauss quadrature formula is shown to provide excellent results with two capacitor current evaluations.	computation;computer engineering;curve fitting;delay calculation;electronic circuit simulation;fall time;first-order predicate;gauss–jacobi quadrature;integrated circuit;midpoint method;newton–cotes formulas;propagation delay;semiconductor;software propagation;switching time;transistor;very-large-scale integration	Ayman I.

With the rapid development of the advanced digital filtering technique (such as ZOOM-FFT) and the rotor slot harmonics (RSH) techniques for slip measurement, it is possible to accurately estimate a motor’s slip rate from the precise measurements of the harmonic components of a rotor and the power supply frequency. This enables us to find the characteristic spectrum of a bar-broken rotor from the stator current spectrum. We proposed an online algorithm to detect the motor broken bar fault by localising and checking the existence of the fault-related characteristic spectrum. The proposed method overcomes the drawback of traditional current spectral analysis approaches. In particular, this paper addresses the problem that the side lobe spectral components are covered by the fundamental frequency and noises.

While the research on the hardware realization of battery equalizers has received significant attention, rigorous analysis of the battery equalization process at the system level remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we study three types of battery equalization system structures: series-based, layer-based, and module-based. Specifically, we derive mathematical models that describe the system-level behavior of the battery equalization processes under these equalization structures. Then, based on the mathematical models, analytical methods are developed to evaluate the performance of the equalization processes. In addition, we carry out statistical analysis to compare the performance of the three equalization structures considered.	mathematical model;performance evaluation;rechargeable battery	Haoqi Chen;Liang Zhang;Yehui Han	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2330692	control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;mathematical model;mathematics;statistics	Visualization	70.62911919171356	42.18896041833918	147755

This physical compact model is based on charge Source 1 1 Drain f 1 Bit line sheet approach which is able to describe the complete electrical behavior of the cell. In this model, we have introduced the dependence of the tunneling capacitance as a function of the voltage across the tunnel oxide and the floating gate depletion effect. This model has been successfully implemented in common circuit simulators and used for the study of the write/erase operations in a memory cell.

a6b4906cef490b714a46cb9807f0996812adaae7	switch short-circuit fault detection algorithm based on drain-to-source voltage monitoring for a fault tolerant dc/dc converter	switch failure diagnosis;fuel cell;fault tolerant converter;interleaved boost converter;short circuit fault	Switch Short-Circuit Fault (SSCF) is one of the most harmful failure mode in a DC-DC Converter. As a consequence, the earliest identification should be ensured in order to avoid the shutdown of the whole system. In this paper, a fast and simple method is introduced for detecting and identifying the faulty leg caused by a SSCF in a six-phase Interleaved Boost Converter (IBC) for Fuel Cell Vehicle application. The proposed detection technique is based on a comparison between the power MOSFET Drain-to-Source Voltage VDS in ON state with an adjustable threshold voltage VDS-ON-TH by using only control pulses and driver information. After the fault detection, and its isolation, remedial actions by control reconfiguration methodology are applied to allow the DC-DC converter to operate in pre-fault conditions. To confirm the effectiveness of the suggested approach, simulation tests are reported using Matlab/Simulink© and ANSYS/Simplorer©. Also, comparative study between the developed voltage-based method and current-based method is provided by numerical simulations. The results obtained by the proposed method indicate that the SSCF can be detected not only in switch ON state but also in OFF state by adding some modifications to the proposed algorithm. In switch OFF state, the results prove similar behavior detection time for both the methods which detects fault occurrence in less than one switching period. By contrast, for the ON state, the proposed method detects the failure for a 100 kHz frequency using the voltage information provided by the driver. The advantage of this method is that the detections are valid in both states (ON and OFF), the suggested algorithm is simple, and easily configurable.	algorithm;boost converter;control reconfiguration;failure cause;fault detection and isolation;fault tolerance;matlab;numerical analysis;power mosfet;sensor;shutdown (computing);simulation;simulink	R.

With the time-frequency localization characteristics embedded in wavelets, the time and frequency information of a waveform can be integrally presented, thereby enhancing the monitoring of voltage flicker-generated signals at different time intervals. The Morlet wavelet has been selected as the basis function for the CWT in the proposed method. The merit of the method lies in that the signal component at any frequency of interest can be more easily monitored than by discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The high frequency required in the voltage flicker study can be also comfortably accomplished. This approach has been applied to investigate various simulated voltage flicker-generated signals, and inspect the data recorded from the actual are furnace operation.

In this study, to reduce the complexity of hardware, the coil voltage signal was not filtered but measured in the form of a duty cycle by the eCAP port of DSP (TMS320F28335). A mathematical model was established to provide the relationship between rotor position, current ripple, and duty cycle. Theoretical analysis of the amplitude-frequency characteristic of the coil current at the switching frequency was presented using Fourier series, Jacobi-Anger identity, and Bessel function. Experimental results showed that the time-varying duty cycle causes infinite side frequencies around the switching frequency. The side frequency interval depends on the varying frequency of the duty cycle. Rotor position can be calculated by measuring the duty cycle and demodulating the coil current ripple. With this self-sensing strategy, the rotor system supported by AMBs can steadily rotate at a speed of 3000 r/min.	audio power amplifier;bessel filter;clock rate;digital signal processor;duty cycle;jacobi method;mathematical model;multistage interconnection networks;pulse-width modulation;quantum noise;r.o.t.o.r.;real-time clock;ripple effect;spectral density;window function	Ming Tang;Chang-sheng Zhu;Jie Yu	2013	Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE C	10.1631/jzus.C1300023	telecommunications;duty cycle	EDA	70.55265845918224	39.45223929367744	153171
043324912362be027d71a4a23446a81a9b69823c	explicit size-reduction-oriented design of a compact microstrip rat-race coupler using surrogate-based optimization methods		In this paper, an explicit size reduction of a compact rat-race coupler implemented in a microstrip technology is considered. The coupler circuit features a simple topology with a densely arranged layout that exploits a combination of highand low-impedance transmission line sections. All relevant dimensions of the structure are simultaneously optimized in order to explicitly reduce the coupler size while maintaining equal power split at the operating frequency of 1 GHz and sufficient bandwidth for return loss and isolation characteristics. Acceptable levels of electrical performance are ensured by using a penalty function approach. Two designs with footprints of 350 mm and 360 mm have been designed and experimentally validated. The latter structure is characterized by 27% bandwidth. For the sake of computational efficiency, surrogate-based optimization principles are utilized. In particular, we employ an iterative construction and re-optimization of the surrogate model involving a suitably corrected low-fidelity representation of the coupler structure. This permits rapid optimization at the cost corresponding to a handful of evaluations of the high-fidelity coupler model.	acoustic coupler;bandwidth (signal processing);benchmark (computing);characteristic impedance;clock rate;computation;experiment;isolation (database systems);iterative method;mathematical optimization;microstrip;penalty method;power dividers and directional couplers;requirement;return loss;simulation;space mapping;surrogate model;transmission line	S.

This paper presents a new approach for the robustness optimization of a MEMS-IC system. The new methodology is exemplified for a MEMS microphone with readout circuit. The design parameters of both the MEMS and the IC part are subject to optimization. Advanced methods for robustness analysis and optimization in consideration of operating and process parameters, developed for ICs, are transferred to MEMS based sensor circuits. The optimization succeeds only when considering both mechanical and electrical parameters. To save CPU time, a reduced-order model is used for the MEMS part. To integrate the generation of the simplified model into the optimization flow, a new simulation-in-a-loop flow based on commercial tools is implemented.	central processing unit;computer-aided design;mathematical optimization;microelectromechanical systems;microphone;simulation;verilog;verilog-a	Florin Burcea;Andreas Herrmann;Aditya Gupta;Helmut E.

Detecting the changes occurring in the frequency spectrum of the EAF voltages fast and accurately has crucial importance to eliminate the undesired effects of harmonics and interharmonics using advanced technology compensation systems such as active power filters, synchronous static compensators, energy storage systems, and etc. The aim of the research work presented here is to reduce the spectral leakage effects experienced by Fourier analysis based methods by estimating the spectral model parameters using nonlinear least squares. The Fourier spectrum of the signal is used as apriori information; however, the proposed model does not suffer from the spectral leakage problems encountered by the Fourier analysis based methods in case of fundamental frequency variation, which frequently occurs in the existence of EAF plants in an electrical system. Moreover, the proposed model permits frequency detection at a much higher resolution than the Fourier analysis based methods. The proposed method has been tested on both synthetic and field data and it has been shown that it is able to detect frequency components and the corresponding amplitudes and phases of harmonics and interharmonics with high accuracy for EAF plants.	apriori algorithm;enterprise architecture framework;fourier analysis;mathematical optimization;non-linear least squares;sensor;spectral density;spectral leakage;synthetic intelligence	Yunus Emre Vatankulu;Zekeriya Senturk;Özgül Salor-Durna	2016	2016 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2016.7731905	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;analytical chemistry	EDA	70.8585457784	37.91543866106823	161902

A new method for model order reduction, which is the combination of classical Miller's theorem and the root localisation (RL) algorithm, is introduced. This method is based on frequency-independent Miller's theorem, RL and signal-path tracing algorithms. The first step of the presented procedure identifies the significant nodes in a circuit, discarding those deemed insignificant. Next, Miller's theorem, RL and a set of predefined simplification rules are applied, creating an order-reduced equivalent circuit. Such an approach maintains the capability of representing both the linear and nonlinear, the static and dynamic behaviours of the original circuit. This method can also be used to identify the topological nodes that have strong nonlinear dynamic behaviours. Finally, the extension of the simplified circuit to represent the nonlinear behaviour of the original circuits is presented.		Yucheng Feng;W.

The detection strategy is based on the estimation of a particular stator current parameter. The considered mechanical faults cause periodic load torque oscillations leading to a sinusoidal phase modulation of the stator current. The modulation index is related to the fault severity and can be used as a fault indicator. First, a simplified stator current model is proposed. The problem is then equivalent to the parameter estimation of a sinusoidal phase mono-component signal. Second, the maximum likelihood estimator is implemented using evolution strategies for optimization. The Cramer-Rao lower bounds are calculated and compared to the estimator performance through simulations.

However, existing coupling schemes can deal with only one finite-element (FE) model connected to the external circuit. A new coupling method in which the generic machine model is established by the multiloop method and the parameters are extracted from FE analysis in real time is proposed in this paper. The introduced method allows one more transient FE model; adding to the arbitrary schematic with robust and reliable simulation results. The comparisons from the simulation results of the proposed method with strong coupling cosimulation and experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the new method. Furthermore, experimental tests of a three-stage generator system are carried out to validate the results from the coupling simulation with the proposed method.	experiment;finite element method;nonlinear system;schematic;simulation	Wenyi Liang;Jianfeng Wang;Tianxiong Lu;Weizhong Fang	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2014.2314053	control engineering;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;circuit extraction	EDA	70.79005719189142	43.262464758091	168351

Conventional condition monitoring techniques, such as vibration, lubrication oil, and generator current signal analysis, require the deployment of a variety of sensors and computationally intensive analysis techniques. This paper describes a WT condition monitoring technique that uses the generator output power and rotational speed to derive a fault detection signal. The detection algorithm uses a continuous-wavelet-transform-based adaptive filter to track the energy in the prescribed time-varying fault-related frequency bands in the power signal. The central frequency of the filter is controlled by the generator speed, and the filter bandwidth is adapted to the speed fluctuation. Using this technique, fault features can be extracted, with low calculation times, from direct- or indirect-drive fixed- or variable-speed WTs. The proposed technique has been validated experimentally on a WT drive train test rig. A synchronous or induction generator was successively installed on the test rig, and both mechanical and electrical fault like perturbations were successfully detected when applied to the test rig.	adaptive filter;algorithm;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;experiment;fault detection and isolation;frequency band;quantum fluctuation;sensor;signal processing;software deployment;wavelet	Wenxian Yang;Peter J.

Several algorithms were recently suggested for macromodeling such types of data to enable unified transient analysis in the presence of external network elements. One of the critical issues involved here is the passivity violations associated with the computed macromodel. To address this issue, a new passivity enforcement algorithm is presented in this paper. The proposed method adopts a global approach for passivity enforcement by ensuring that the passivity correction at a certain region does not introduce new passivity violations at other parts of the frequency spectrum. It also provides an error estimate for the response of the passivity corrected macromodel.	algorithm;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);imaginary time;kernel (linear algebra);macromodel;motion compensation;spectral density;storage violation;transient state	Dharmendra Saraswat;Ramachandra Achar;Michel S.

This paper looks at failure predictions in three-phase line-operated induction machines through spectral analysis or electric and electromagnetic signals. Fault characteristics frequencies generated in the estimated and the measured signal spectrum, as a result of mechanical abnormalities such as broken rotor bars, are analyzed. Spectral analyses of simple stator current, of the current's Park vector modulus, and or total and partial instantaneous electric powers are considered as external diagnosis. Internal methods of diagnosis are usually based on a mathematical model of the motor. This requires knowledge of the motor's electrical parameters, which are affected by a number of physical phenomena such as temperature variations, skin effects, core losses, and saturation. As internal diagnosis, we examine different approaches to the spectral analysis of electromagnetic torque computed by stator and rotor flux estimation. To this end, the open loop method, the Luenberger observer and the Kalman filter are employed. Finally, experimental results enable us to draw up a table of comparison of internal and external methods in the detection of rotor imperfections, using two criteria under different load levels.	kalman filter;mathematical model;modulus robot;phase line (cartography);r.o.t.o.r.;spectral density estimation;spectrum analyzer	Mario Eltabach;Ali Charara;Isamil Zein	2004	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2003.822083	kalman filter;control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;induction motor	Robotics	69.40000977249768	37.538762990741446	174748

Recently, an alternative method based on approximate dynamic programming showed that it is possible to reduce the computational burden enabling sampling times under 25 μs by shortening the MPC horizon to a very small number of stages while improving the overall controller performance. In this paper we implemented this new approach on a small size FPGA and validated it on a variable speed drive system with a three-level voltage source converter. Time measurements showed that only 5:76 μs are required to run our algorithm for horizon N = 1 and 17:27 μs for N = 2 while outperforming state of the art approaches with much longer horizons in terms of currents distortion and switching frequency. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time direct MPC for current control has been implemented on an FPGA solving the integer optimization problem in real-time and achieving comparable performance to formulations with long prediction horizons.	approximation algorithm;clock rate;computation;computational complexity theory;distortion;dynamic programming;field-programmable gate array;hil bus;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;mathematical optimization;optimal control;optimization problem;power electronics;real-time clock;real-time transcription;run time (program lifecycle phase);sampling (signal processing);steady state;total harmonic distortion;usb on-the-go;voltage source	Bartolomeo Stellato;Paul J.

Comparison of the optimum designs with the initial and industrial design reveals that better than the proposed performance can be obtained by a simple optimization method. It is interesting to note that the industrial design satis®es some performance of the cost optimum design, and eciency optimum design, of course with a lower eciency. The most desirable variation of motor performance with line voltage and output power is due to the eciency optimum design. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Fast and accurate estimation of time-varying harmonics is a key to realize many objectives of the smarter and cleaner grid such as harmonic source identification, improved active filter control for mitigation of harmonics, and smart meters for harmonic pollution metering. This paper presents a fast and accurate approach for real-time estimation of moderate time-varying harmonics of voltage/current signals. The proposed method is based on estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT)-assisted adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN). The AWNN provides quick estimates (twice every fundamental cycle with only half-cycle data as input) of the dominant harmonics, whereas the ESPRIT complements it to handle time-varying signals with higher accuracy. The salient features of the proposed method are validated on the simulated and experimental signals of stationary and time-varying nature.	active filter;algorithm;artificial neural network;distortion;image resolution;incomplete nature: how mind emerged from matter;real-time clock;response time (technology);short-time fourier transform;simulation;smart meter;spanning tree;stationary process;transient (computer programming);wavelet	Sachin K.

However, the computed sensitivity qualities are incremental in nature, hence only reflecting the performance changes under small perturbations of circuit parameters. In this paper, we rigorously extend the classical adjoint-sensitivity analysis and provide an efficient formulation for computing time-domain second-order adjoint sensitivities for linear circuits. This new formulation not only computes the exact second-order sensitivities but also has a linear complexity in the number of parameters. Specifically, it only takes P+2 transient runs to compute all O(P 2) first- and second-order performance sensitivities, where P is the number of parameters. Circuit examples are included to demonstrate the proposed formulation under the context of parametric circuit analysis and optimization.	computation;first-order predicate;linear circuit;mathematical optimization;network analysis (electrical circuits);performance;perturbation theory	Xiaoji Ye;Peng Li;F.

The main defect of a conventional maximum power point tracking control algorithm is its misinterpretation of the location of the maximum power point during a sudden change in climatic conditions because of the existence of several local maxima on the power-voltage characteristic curve. This work presents a preliminary study on the modeling, simulation and implementation of a new algorithm for power output maximization of photovoltaic generators under partially shaded conditions using a bond graph approach. The idea is to use a buck-boost converter and to test experimentally the performance of the proposed algorithm on a real photovoltaic panel. We imposed ten patterns of irradiance on the photovoltaic panel, of which more than half were patterns of partial shading. The proposed controller performed excellently under all shading conditions compared with the classical direct duty cycle technique. The control part and the proposed algorithm were implemented on a microcontroller, and the efficiency of the developed algorithm was demonstrated as a function of the real position of the maximum power point through the results of a simulation performed using Symbols SYstem Modeling by BOnd graph Language and Simulation software.

And one of the most important factors that determine the design of traction system is the thermal distribution of IGBT convertors. Thermal simulation of IGBT converter using a two-step methodology (temperature rise and thermal distribution) and its simulation results are presented in this paper [1]. The simulation is based on the combination of an electrical model and a thermal one based on heat accumulation [2] as well as the technique of computer programming [3]. When designers change parameters of these models, the simulating software gets new temperature values and distribution state. So that the simulation can help designers configure the traction system. The modeling results have been checked by operation measured data.	computer programming;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;simulation;traction teampage;tree accumulation	Huaiyu Xu;Jihui Xu;Zhiqiang You;Wenqi Peng;Kunlin Zhang;Jinfeng Xu	2012	JCP	10.4304/jcp.7.4.1034-1040	simulation;computer science;computer programming	EDA	68.75741859972484	42.9004241178376	183072

The intrinsic mode function (IMF) components of the fault generated traveling wave are extracted by empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and the instantaneous frequency changing time of each IMF component is obtained through Hilbert transform. The traveling wave arrival time in global position system (GPS) can thus be detected according to its high frequency sudden change point which is extracted in the instantaneous frequency diagram. The HHT based fault location scheme is comparing with that based on wavelet transform. ATP simulation results show that the HHT method can more effectively extract the characteristics of traveling wave, and the fault location error is not more than plusmn150 m.	automated theorem proving;diagram;global positioning system;hilbert transform;hilbert–huang transform;instantaneous phase;simulation;time of arrival;wavelet transform	Xiao'an Qin;Xiangjun Zeng;Xiaoli Zhang;Zewen Li	2008	2008 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/08IAS.2008.383	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;electrical engineering;mathematics	EDA	70.54583309843476	37.13292051883517	183789
e51ab716897fc68527272a35b96b7e826c88d4dd	structure-preserving-based model-order reduction of parameterized interconnect systems		In recent years, the continued miniaturization of VLSI circuits leads to the need for more efficient simulation of large-scale linear dynamical systems with ever-increasing state-space dimension. The linear dynamical systems in VLSI circuit simulation are RC or RCL models of the VLSI circuit’s interconnected system. Model-order reduction is an important technique to reduce such a high complexity. Along the technology scaling, the indetermination in the manufacturing process causes variations in the critical dimensions and interlevel dielectric thickness of interconnects, which could make the system performance unpredictable and produce a significant parametric yield loss. An efficient exploitation of these design activities results in a parameterized model-order reduction technique able to reduce large systems of equations with respect to all of the variable parameters of the circuit, (i.e., resistance, capacitance, and inductance). For this purpose, we propose a novel parameterized model-order reduction method for interconnect variation systems, which is based on an efficient and reliable combination of invariable structure-preserving model-order reduction (SPMOR) methods and variable parameter retaining schemes. It is referred to as a parameterized interconnect model-order reduction via structure-preserving algorithm. The SPMOR model yields the same form of the original state equation and preserves the passivity of the parameterized RC and RLC networks, like the well-known passive reduced-order interconnect algorithm for nonparameterized RC and RLC networks. The most important benefit it entails is the ability to preserve the probability characteristic of the original interconnect systems. Pertinent numerical examples are proposed to validate the proposed SPMOR approach.	model order reduction	Xinsheng Wang;Mingyan Yu;Chenxu Wang	2018	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-017-0561-2	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;theoretical computer science;mathematics	EDA	74.82520124601906	43.29661676587651	184078

If sufficiently accurate, the estimated parameter values are a powerful tool for improving the performance of a range of power system monitoring, protection, and control applications, including fault location and dynamic thermal line rating. The accuracy of the parameter estimates can be reduced by unknown errors in the synchrophasors that are introduced in the measurement process. In this paper, a method is proposed with the aim of obtaining accurate estimates of potentially variable impedance parameters, in the presence of systematic errors in voltage and current measurements. The method is based on optimization to identify correction constants for the phasors. A case study of a simulated transmission line is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method, which is better in comparison with a previously proposed method. The results, as well as limits, and the potential extensions of the new method are discussed.	characteristic impedance;estimation theory;impedance matching;impedance parameters;mathematical optimization;phasor;real-time transcription;system monitoring;transmission line	Deborah Ritzmann;Paul S.

Nevertheless, the implementation of the wavelet transform (WT), especially on embedded or low-power devices, faces practical problems, such as the election of the mother wavelet, the tuning of its parameters, the coordination between the sampling frequency and the levels of the transform, and the construction of the bank of wavelet filters, with highly different bandwidths that constitute the core of the DWT. In this paper, a diagnostic system using the harmonic WT is proposed, which can alleviate these practical problems because it is built using a single fast Fourier transform of one phase's current. The harmonic wavelet was conceived to perform musical analysis, hence its name, and it has spread into many fields, but, to the best of the authors' knowledge, it has not been applied before to perform fault diagnosis of rotating electrical machines in transient regime using the stator current. The simplicity and performance of the proposed approach are assessed by comparison with other types of WTs, and it has been validated with the experimental diagnosis of a 3.15-MW induction motor with broken bars.	digital signal processor;discrete wavelet transform;embedded system;fast fourier transform;field-programmable gate array;frequency band;kinetic void;low-power broadcasting;maxima and minima;poisson wavelet;power semiconductor device;quantum harmonic oscillator;sampling (signal processing);spectral density;steady state	Angel Sapena-Bano;Manuel Pineda-Sánchez;Ruben Puche-Panadero;Javier Martínez-Román;Dragan Matic	2015	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2015.2444240	control engineering;wavelet;constant q transform;electronic engineering;speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;harmonic wavelet transform;second-generation wavelet transform;continuous wavelet transform;engineering;electrical engineering;fractional fourier transform;discrete fourier transform;harmonic analysis;induction motor;cascade algorithm;mathematics;wavelet packet decomposition;stationary wavelet transform;discrete wavelet transform;fast wavelet transform;lifting scheme;physics;quantum mechanics;wavelet transform	Embedded	70.17309856517734	37.85083512248212	187415

Such circuit models are actually model templates: the specific values of their electrical elements must be derived by the analysis of the specific battery devices to be modeled. This process requires either to measure the battery characteristics or to derive them from the datasheet. In the latter case, however, very often not all information are available and the model fitting becomes then unfeasible.  In this paper we present a methodology for deriving, in a semi-automatic way, circuit equivalent battery models solely from data available in a battery datasheet. In order to account for the different amount of information available, we introduce the concept of """"level"""" of a model, so that models with different accuracy can be derived depending on the available data. The methodology requires only minimal intervention by the designer and it automatically generates MATLAB models once the required data for the corresponding model level are transcribed from the datasheet.  Simulation results show that our methodology allows to accurately reconstruct the information reported in the datasheet as well as to derive missing ones."""	co-simulation;curve fitting;datasheet;digital electronics;electrical element;matlab;semiconductor industry;simulation	Massimo Petricca;Donghwa Shin;Alberto Bocca;Alberto Macii;Enrico Macii;Massimo Poncino	2013	International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED)		equivalent circuit;microbial fuel cell;electronic engineering;simulation;engineering;electrical engineering;efficient energy use;quantum mechanics	EDA	69.28699813294156	43.00091001168931	188292

In this work, we present a scalable power grid reduction method for reducing large-scale flip-chip power grids based on recent spectral graph sparsification techniques. The first step of the proposed approach aggressively reduces the large power grid blocks into much smaller power grid blocks by properly matching the effective resistances of the original power grid networks. Next, an efficient spectral graph sparsification scheme is introduced to dramatically sparsify the relatively dense power grid blocks that are generated during the previous step. In the last, an effective grid compensation scheme is proposed to further improve the model accuracy of the reduced and sparsified power grid. Since reduction of each power grid block can be performed independently, our method can be easily accelerated on parallel computers, and therefore expected to be capable of handling large power grid designs as well as incremental designs. Extensive experimental results show that our method can scale linearly with power grid sizes and efficiently reduce industrial power grids sizes by 20X without loss of much accuracy in both DC and transient analysis.	computational complexity theory;computer;flip chip;parallel computing;scalability;transient state	Xueqian Zhao;Zhuo Feng;Cheng Zhuo	2014	2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)		embedded system;electronic engineering;parallel computing;cyber-attack;computer science;theoretical computer science;accuracy and precision;resistance;computational model	EDA	72.85571485480541	44.138810588281494	192870

This paper describes a methodology to obtain the OLTC vibration characteristics in time-frequency domain. Considering the possible aliasing effect in vibration signal processing, an improved empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is proposed with masking signals of multiple frequencies added, which has obvious superiority in aliasing reduction compared with conventional methods. Then, an effective fault-diagnosis strategy based on energy distributions variations of OLTC vibration signals according to Lorentz information measure is brought up. The calculated results under normal and typical fault conditions of model and real OLTC have shown that the energy spectrums of different conditions vary significantly so that the similarity index can measure the difference degree of energy distribution. Meanwhile, the index of contact looseness is higher than the insulated panel looseness which indicates that the contact looseness fault has greater influence on switch-over process of OLTC.	aliasing;hilbert–huang transform;repeatability;signal processing;simulation;time–frequency analysis;transformer;voltage regulation	Ruochen Duan;Fenghua Wang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2524399	control engineering;database index;electronic engineering;time–frequency analysis;network switch;computer science;engineering;hilbert–huang transform;vibration;control theory;physics;quantum mechanics	HPC	69.4841929329768	37.655050514483996	194517

The paper proposes a synchronizer based on the Least Squares approach: using the sampled grid voltages to fit a straight line corresponding to the grid phase-angle estimation. An extensive set of simulation results, including comparative results with three other methods, covering steady state and transient conditions, is provided and demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed method. Also, a set of experimental results, obtained with a field programmable gate array platform, complements the validation of the synchronizer and its very good performance in all conditions.	algorithm;code;computational resource;field-programmable gate array;low-pass filter;microcontroller;ordinary least squares;phase converter;phase-locked loop;polynomial;power electronics;recursion;settling time;simulation;steady state;synchronizer (algorithm)	Carlos Joao Ramos;António P.

Although many studies exist regarding the optimized models of power electronic drives and digital controllers for real-time simulation, the real-time models of electrical machines are still limited to the lumped parameter electric circuit models. This is mainly due to the complexity of a detailed electrical machine model which makes it computationally expensive. This paper presents the modeling, real-time implementation, finite element analysis, and experimental validation of a nonlinear geometrical permeance network based induction machine model. A nonlinear permeance network model (PNM) is developed for the real-time simulation of a 3-hp squirrel cage induction machine with closed rotor slots. Several studies both under open-loop and closed-loop control conditions are conducted, and the results obtained from the offline and real-time simulations and the experiment are compared with each other to show the effectiveness of the proposed PNM model.	analysis of algorithms;control theory;finite element method;network model;nonlinear system;online and offline;r.o.t.o.r.;real-time clock;real-time transcription;simulation;squirrel	Babak Asghari;Venkata Dinavahi	2012	2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting	10.1109/TIE.2011.2175674	control engineering;electronic engineering;digital control;computer science;engineering;control theory;hardware-in-the-loop simulation	Embedded	70.73457364488925	42.48217804473215	198840

If unaccounted for, it can lead to significant error in the signal integrity analysis of high-speed digital systems. Distributed passive systems are characterized by multiple causality conditions in their time-domain response. The port-to-port delay, which is the time taken by the electrical signal to reach from one port to the other, forms the basis for these causality conditions. This paper describes a technique to extract the port-to-port delay in passive networks directly from their frequency domain parameters. The technique can be applied to either S, Y or Z parameters of passive systems. It can also be extended to multi-port networks. The delay thus determined has been used to enforce causality on the S parameters of a passive system.	causality;digital electronics;elliptic curve cryptography;impedance parameters;mixed-signal integrated circuit;passive optical network;signal integrity;simulation;software propagation;speaker wire;transmission line	Rohan Mandrekar;Madhavan Swaminathan	2005	2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1465946	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;signal processing;control theory;frequency domain	EDA	71.07448230446886	45.57845750215382	199409
