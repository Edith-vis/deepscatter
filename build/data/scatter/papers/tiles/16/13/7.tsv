By introducing a k-difference operator, the nonlinear terms of the system are not required to be globally bounded. The proposed adaptive control scheme is composed of a linear adaptive controller, a neural-network-based nonlinear adaptive controller and a switching mechanism. The linear controller can assure boundedness of the input and output signals, and the neural network nonlinear controller can improve performance of the system. By using the switching scheme between the linear and nonlinear controllers, it is demonstrated that improved performance and stability can be achieved simultaneously. Theory analysis and simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

To study the properties of this approach in comparison with the lifting-based LPTV scaling approach, we consider exploiting the framework of representing the associated robust stability conditions with infinite matrices. Since it serves as a common framework for comparing the two different LPTV scaling approaches, it provides us with new insights into the relationship between the cycling-based and lifting-based scaling approaches. In particular, we derive fundamental results that enable us to reduce the comparison, with respect to conservativeness in robust stability analysis, of the two scaling approaches with restricted and tractable classes of separators to a modified comparison of the associated classes of what we call infinite-dimensional separators arising in the above infinite matrix framework.	cobham's thesis;image scaling;lambda lifting;lifting scheme;linear time-invariant theory;low-power broadcasting;matrix representation;numerical analysis	Mitsuaki Miyamoto;Yohei Hosoe;Tomomichi Hagiwara	2017	Int.

The control scheme is based on the minimization of the 6nite horizon cost with a 6nite terminal weighting matrix. The resulting stabilizing RHC scheme leads to time-varying 6nite terminal weighting matrices even for time-invariant systems, which is more general than in the case of using constant matrices. Based on the proposed scheme, another implementation method is also discussed for easy computation and numerical feasibility consideration of LMI optimization, although the second method does not guarantee the closed-loop stability theoretically. Through a simulation example, the e7ectiveness of the proposed schemes is illustrated. ? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The underdetermined blind sources separation has two steps. In matrix-recovery step, we defined a characteristic of the signals as the durative-sparsity and proposed a novel approach called as a searching-and-averaging-based method in frequency domain. This approach tells us how to search some data points that are very close to the basis lines along the direction of basis vectors a j and how to use them to estimate the mixing matrix. In source-recovery step, we used Bofill and Zibulevsky's shortest-path algorithm. Finally, the separation results were obtained using their short-time Fourier transforms.

Two approaches, norm-bounded and linear fractional transformation (LFT) uncertainty formulations, are considered. By using a new Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional approach, combined with the advanced techniques for achieving delay dependence, improved robust H ∞ state-feedback controller design methods are developed. The existence condition for admissible controllers is formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and the controller design is cast into a convex optimisation problem subject to LMI constraints. If the optimisation problem is solvable, a desired controller can be readily constructed. The result for the norm-bounded uncertainty case improves the existing ones in terms of design conservatism, and that for the LFT uncertainty case represents the first attempt in this direction.

We first consider the delay-free case and obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for consensus. Then, based on the obtained conditions for the delay-free case, we deduce an explicit formula for the delay margin of the consensus for the case with time delay using the relationship between the roots of the characteristic equation and the time delay parameter. In addition, we consider the special case where the second-order model is a double integrator. For this case, simpler consensus conditions under communication delay are provided. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

These conditions can be expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities, and the largest constrictively invariant ellipsoid can be determined by solving an optimization problem with LMI constraints. By viewing the feedback gain as an additional variable, this optimization problem can be readily adapted for the design of feedback gain that results in the largest contractively invariant ellipsoid. Moreover, in the degenerate case where the singular linear system reduces to a regular system, our set invariance conditions reduce to the existing set invariance conditions for normal linear systems.	control theory;linear matrix inequality;linear system;mathematical optimization;optimization problem	Zongli Lin;Liang Lu	2006	2006 Chinese Control Conference	10.1109/TAC.2007.910711	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Robotics	71.23431867321823	-3.2760080037342814	51085

It is assumed that each vehicle can control its position based on the spacing error with respect to the preceding vehicle in the string, as well as on coded information transmitted by the lead vehicle. Using information–theoretic techniques, this paper establishes a lower bound to the integral of the sensitivity function of spacing errors with respect to a stochastic disturbance acting on the lead vehicle. The derived bound depends on the open-loop poles and zeros of the vehicles’ dynamics as well as on the (possibly non-linear) controller used at each vehicle. The lower bound is shown to be tight for a specific class of systems and controllers.	nonlinear system;software propagation;theory	Yingbo Zhao;Paolo Minero;Vijay Gupta	2014	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2013.11.029	control engineering;simulation;information theory;engineering;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	69.61927879551111	-3.9103173604714607	51249

The proposed controller uses only the delayed output measurement to stabilize the closed-loop system and guarantee an adequate level of system performance. By constructing a set of multiple Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals which include triple-integral terms, a new criterion for the existence of dynamic output feedback guaranteed cost controllers is established and expressed in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI). A numerical example is given to illustrate the obtained results.	block cipher mode of operation;linear system	Mai Viet Thuan;Vu Ngoc Phat;Hieu Minh Trinh	2012	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2012.04.039	mathematical optimization;nonlinear control;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov function;control theory;mathematics	ML	68.51903925951825	-0.5083932301274159	51365

Recently it has been suggested that in digital control systems such problems may be overcome by using multirate sampling. In this paper we describe the capabilities of such multirate control schemes with regard to pole and zero assignment. We also point out a limitation of the approach due to degradation in the intersample behavior. In Mita and Chida (1988,  Proc.  27th  Conf. on Dec. and Control,  pp. 1883–1888) it is shown that with a two-delay input control scheme it is possible to assign all the poles and zeros of the closed-loop system using state feedback. In this paper we generalize this result to the case of  N -delay input control using dynamic compensators. In an  N -delay input control scheme the input to the continuous system is changed  N  times more often than the output is sampled. Using such a scheme we show how to design output feedback controllers for SISO systems that ensure arbitrary placement of all the poles and zeros of the closed-loop system. Corresponding results for the MIMO regulator and the SISO servomechanism are given. We also show that a hidden cost associated with the use of  N -delay input control is a degradation in the intersample behavior. We demonstrate this via simulation and present an analysis which explains why this degradation arises.		Kevin L. Moore;S. P.

4b0580f432cbcdbf22d0473b64d72a8e326fee99	hybridization for stability analysis of switched linear systems	switched systems;stability verification;hybridization;hybrid systems	In this paper, we present a hybridization method for stability analysis of switched linear hybrid system (LHS), that constructs a switched system with polyhedral inclusion dynamics (PHS) using a state-space partition that is specific to stability analysis. We use a previous result based on quantitative predicate abstraction to analyse the stability of PHS. We show completeness of the hybridization based verification technique for the class of asymptotically stable linear system and a subclass of switched linear systems whose dynamics are pairwise Lipschitz continuous on the state-space and uniformly converging in time. For this class of systems, we show that by increasing the granularity of the region partition, we eventually reach an abstract switched system with polyhedral inclusion dynamics that is asymptotically stable. On the practical side, we implemented our approach in the tool averist, and experimentally compared our approach with a state-of-the-art tool for stability analysis of hybrid systems based on Lyapunov functions. Our experimental results illustrate that our method is less prone to numerical errors and scales better than the traditional approaches. In addition, our tool returns a counterexample in the event that it fails to prove stability, providing feedback regarding the potential reason for instability. We also examined heuristics for the choice of state-space partition during refinement.	automata theory;experiment;heuristic (computer science);hybrid automaton;hybrid system;instability;linear system;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;personal handy-phone system;polyhedron;predicate abstraction;refinement (computing);star catalogue;state space	Pavithra Prabhakar;Miriam Garcia Soto	2016		10.1145/2883817.2883840	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;control theory;mathematics	Logic	68.6890184404222	1.1475865642532415	51740

These characteristics determine a state space partition into slabs. Sign conditions of quadratic functions and quadratic forms constrained to the slabs are reformulated in terms of cone-constrained linear matrix inequalities. It is shown that these conditions can be solved by defining a suitable copositive programming. Copositivity is then exploited in order to determine a sufficient condition for the existence of a piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function which is used to get an absolute stability result for the Lur'e system. An example with asymmetric sector bounds shows the effectiveness of the the proposed approach.	cone (formal languages);linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;piecewise linear continuation;quadratic function;state space	Raffaele Iervolino;Francesco Vasca	2014	53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2014.7040377	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;control theory;mathematics	Vision	68.54857159018412	-0.07261041895983793	52112

By constructing a filter to estimate the states, the FI problem can be reduced to an entropy optimization problem subjected to the non-Gaussian estimation error systems. The design objective for the FI purpose is that the entropy of the estimation error is maximized in the presence of diagnosed fault and is minimized in the presence of the nuisance faults or noises. It is shown that the error dynamics is represented by a nonlinear non-Gaussian stochastic system, for which new relationships are applied to formulate the probability density functions (PDFs) of the stochastic error in terms of the PDFs of the noises and the faults. The Renyi's entropy has been used to simplify the computations in the filtering for the recursive design algorithms. It is noted that the output can be supposed to be immeasurable (but with known stochastic distributions), which is different from the existing results where the output is always measurable for feedback. Finally, simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven FI filtering algorithms.	algorithm;computation;entropy (information theory);fault detection and isolation;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;portable document format;recursion;simulation;stochastic process	Lei Guo;Liping Yin;Hong Wang;Tianyou Chai	2009	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2008.2009599	entropy;mathematical optimization;nonlinear control;control theory;mathematics;statistics	EDA	73.58955030972673	-4.160492514146382	52462

This extends the prior art of searching for the maximum upper bound of time delay. In order to improve the flexibility in controller design and obtain better performance, a fractional-order PDα controller is proposed. The exactly stable regions of delays are explored for both integral-order and fractional-order controllers. Compared with conditions in most previous works which are deduced by the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and rely on the solution of some linear matrix inequalities, the stability conditions proposed in this paper are established from the frequency domain point of view, and thus, the results are not only sufficient but also necessary. To illustrate accuracy of the conditions, they are simulated on a delayed teleoperation system composed of a pair of robots.	bilateral filter;broadcast delay;channel (communications);linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;point of view (computer hardware company);robot;simulation	Xian Yang;Changchun Hua;Jing Yan;Xin-Ping Guan	2016	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems	10.1109/TSMC.2015.2444415	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	69.82662426095489	-0.07308706150114172	52960

f7d659ab4dfef5fa6cf13324e7a3163fbe5d6f1a	stability of the feedback linearization of bilinear plants with bounded inputs		Many nonlinear plants can be better approximated and controlled using bilinear models instead of linear ones. For many bilinear models, a feedback linearization can be achieved, forcing the plant to behave like a linear system, with all known advantages. In practical applications, however, this means that the dynamic range of the applied control input is enlarged, increasing the danger of running into bounds, due, for example, to power saturation. Running into bounds can cause problems even for linear systems (e.g. instability) but in general, if the open-loop system is stable, not too conservative conditions can be given to insure stability [1]. In bilinear systems the issue is more complex, as the control input and the state are connected multiplicatively. This makes the methods used in the linear case very conservative. However, they suggest a very simple analytical approach, as the saturated bilinear system actually becomes a linear system with different dynamics. These dynamics can be influenced by the choice of the saturation levels. Starting from this key idea, the paper shows that the stability problem is actually a multi-model linear problem, and gives sufficient conditions for the global stability of the closed-loop system. An algorithmic approach is given based on the work presented in [2], and an alternative testing procedure is derived from the approach of [3]. The results are applied to a hydraulic system to show the practical aspects. A discussion of the implications of the results on the control system design closes the paper.	approximation algorithm;bilinear filtering;control system;dynamic range;instability;linear programming;linear system;nonlinear system;systems design	Luigi del Re;Lino Guzzella	1994	Kybernetika		feedback linearization;control theory;mathematical optimization;mathematics;bilinear interpolation;linearization;bounded function;control system	Embedded	68.7370975670548	-5.34746066936726	53344

The optimal control of the flotation circuit at Lake Dufault is found to be a bang-bang control, to contain a singular sub-arc, or to be totally singular depending on the various practical constraints. The influence of the time-delay on the optimal control of the flotation circuit is then investigated. Although the influence of the delay is quite significant, the basic structure of the optimal policy remains roughly the same. Thus it is not unreasonable to ignore the delay, although the optimality suffers from this.	bang file;bang–bang control;optimal control	Heikki N. Koivo;R.

We use differential analysis to formalize this important concept in a nonlinear setting. We show that dominance can be studied through linear dissipation inequalities and an interconnection theory that closely mimics the classical analysis of stability by means of dissipativity theory. In this approach, stability is seen as the particular situation where the dominant behavior is 0-dimensional. The generalization opens novel tractable avenues to study multistability through 1-dominance and limit cycle oscillations through 2-dominance.	cobham's thesis;control theory;emoticon;interconnection;limit cycle;linear matrix inequality;nonlinear system;positive systems;quadratic function;robust control;state space	Fulvio Forni;Rodolphe Sepulchre	2017	CoRR		mathematics;control theory;limit cycle;interconnection;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;multistability;dissipation;oscillation	ML	75.47659677231779	4.036436813360334	53848

The gain parameter of the congestion control model is chosen as the bifurcation parameter. The analysis shows that in the absence of the state feedback controller, the model loses stability via the Hopf bifurcation early, and can maintain a stationary sending rate only in a certain domain of the gain parameter. When applying the state feedback controller to the model, the onset of the undesirable Hopf bifurcation is postponed. Thus, the stability domain is extended, and the model possesses a stable sending rate in a larger parameter range. Furthermore, explicit formulae to determine the properties of the Hopf bifurcation are obtained. Numerical simulations are given to justify the validity of the state feedback controller in bifurcation control.	bifurcation theory;network congestion	Min Xiao;Wei Xing Zheng;Jinde Cao	2013	I. J.

Based on sliding control theory, the proposed autopilot utilizes a fuzzy basis function network to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions of bank-to-.turn missile dynamics, enabling a mixed H2/H∞ controller with weight updating laws to be applied to attenuate the effects of approximation errors and external disturbances. Moreover, the mixed H2/H∞ autopilot design can minimize H2 performance criteria under a desired H∞ disturbance rejection constraint. Unlike general mixed H2/H∞ control problems, the proposed H2/H∞ autopilot with self-tuning fuzzy basis function network can avoid solving coupled Riccati equations by adequately selecting diagonal weighting matrices in the H2 performance criterion and H∞ constraint. Therefore, the proposed H2/H∞ control approach can be implemented efficiently. Computer simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed mixed H2/H∞ autopilot for BTT missiles.	autopilot;basis function	Chuan-Kai Lin	2007	Fuzzy Sets and Systems	10.1016/j.fss.2007.05.009	computer simulation;mathematical optimization;approximation error;information processing;computer science;approximation;riccati equation;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy set;h-infinity methods in control theory;implementation;fuzzy control system	Robotics	72.9801430238211	-4.560409222491404	54502

Abstract An efficient methodology to study conditions for stable in-phase synchronization in networks of periodic identical nonlinear oscillators is proposed. The problem of investigating synchronization properties on periodic trajectories is reduced to an eigenvalue problem by means of the joint application of Master Stability Function and Harmonic Balance techniques. The proposed method permits to exploit the periodicity of trajectories, reducing computational time with respect to traditional time-domain approaches (which were designed to deal with generic attractors) and good accuracy. In addition, such method can easily deal with networks of nonlinear periodic oscillators described by differential-algebraic equations and then both static and dynamic coupling could be studied. I. Introduction The synchronized state in networks of coupled dynamical systems (cells) —namely the phenomenon that occurs when coupled systems adjust their different trajectories to a unison one due to the mutual interactions— is a deeply studied subject [1]–[3]. Beyond rising researchers curiosity per se and the amazing fact that many real world systems exhibit it [1], synchronization is believed to play an important role in information processing in biological neural networks [4], [5], for instance as a way to filter noise [6]. The existence of (locally) stable synchronous states is generally investigated by computing the spectrum of Lyapunov Exponents (LEs) [7] of the whole network. Unfortunately, even when dealing with networks composed of a small number of cells, the size of the problem requires long CPU time and may show numerical instabilities [8]–[10]. In 1998, Pecora and Caroll [11] proposed a technique, subject to some constraints, to simplify this task. The problem of identifying conditions for stable synchronization was split in two parts: one related to network topology and the other requesting the computation of LEs of a system of the same order as a single uncoupled oscillator. This second step involves the evaluation of the so called Master Stability Function (MSF) [11]. Notwithstanding a great simplification, as in this case we have to deal with one nonlinear oscillator at a time, the computational effort remains important: for each value of the MSF, one has to identify an attractor and the algorithm estimating the LEs has to reach convergence. The attractor is …	algebraic equation;algorithm;artificial neural network;central processing unit;computation;dynamical system;harmonic balance;information processing;level of detail;lyapunov fractal;microsoft solutions framework;network topology;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;quasiperiodicity;time complexity;unison;world-system	Marco Righero;Fernando Corinto;Mario Biey	2013	I.

After discussing some existing notions of solution for such systems, we derive Lyapunov-based conditions on the system’s vector fields for asymptotic stability under a specific class of inputs. These conditions are based on the stability margin of the Lebesgue-integrable and the measure-driven components of the system. For more general inputs which do not necessarily lead to asymptotic stability, we then derive conditions such that the maximum norm of the resulting trajectory is bounded by some function of the total variation of the input, which generalizes the notion of integral input-to-state stability in measure-driven systems.	bounded variation;control theory;emoticon;expanded memory;farkas' lemma;linear function;lyapunov fractal;np-completeness;nonlinear system	Aneel Tanwani;Bernard Brogliato;Christophe Prieur	2015	MCSS	10.1007/s00498-015-0140-7	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;control theory;mathematics;stability theory	ML	70.28429014696582	2.363522513108107	55646

Besides the simplicity in their construction, the new solutions can also be easily scheduled online to achieve global result in the presence of input saturation.	display lag;input lag;linear system;lyapunov fractal;semiconductor industry	Bin Zhou;Zongli Lin;Guang-Ren Duan	2009	2009 American Control Conference	10.1109/TAC.2009.2020644	control engineering;mathematical optimization;design methods;control system;control theory;mathematics;linear system	EDA	71.51123692216332	-3.4210316890630468	55854
fc74e93f2a669e048015b4ebc7dfc6bc62b46fb7	optimal control of noninstantaneous impulsive differential equations		Abstract In this paper, we study optimal control problems for a new class of noninstantaneous impulsive differential equations arising from the dynamics of evolution processes in pharmacotherapy. We construct a suitable control function, which allows us to characterize the structure of controllability by using the terminal time subinterval instead of the global time interval. We apply fixed point approach to show the controllability results that are the foundation of optimal control theory. Next, we study existence of optimal control problems for a certain quadratic functional acting as the performance index. In addition, we design ILC updating laws for deterministic impulsive systems to generate a sequence of control functions to approximate the optimal control function. Further, we extend the deterministic results to random case by designing ILC updating laws with randomly varying trial length. Finally, several examples are given to demonstrate the validity of theoretical results and design methods. Here, we remark that ILC updating algorithm is adopted to find a desired optimal control for impulsive systems, which provides another effective way to solve optimization problem via computer techniques.	optimal control	Shengda Liu;JinRong Wang;Yong Zhou	2017	J.

This system generates a chaotic attractor for the range of control parameters studied and we determine the organization of the unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) associated with the chaotic attractor. Surrogate UPOs were found in the four-dimensional phase space and pairs of these orbits were embedded in three-dimensions using Locally Linear Embedding. This is a dimensionality reduction technique recently developed in the machine learning community. Embedding pairs of orbits allows the computation of their linking numbers, a topological invariant. A table of linking numbers was computed for a range of control parameter values which shows that the organization of the UPOs is consistent with that of a Lorenz-type branched manifold with rotation symmetry.	control theory;nonlinear dimensionality reduction	Benjamin Coy	2012	I.

4dd5a8cc82d08ceb4f1e2f22d8f6246b6620e4c1	the global exponential pseudo almost periodic synchronization of quaternion-valued cellular neural networks with time-varying delays		Abstract In this paper, we consider the problem of the pseudo almost periodic synchronization of quaternion-valued cellular neural networks (QVCNNs) with time-varying delays. Firstly, we use the Banach fixed point theorem to obtain the existence of pseudo almost periodic solutions of QVCNNs with time varying delays. Then, by designing a novel and very general nonlinear state-feedback controller, and constructing suitable Lyapunov functions, we obtain that the drive-response structure of QVCNNs with pseudo almost periodic coefficients can realize the global exponential synchronization. Our results are completely new. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the feasibility of our results.	almost periodic function;artificial neural network;time complexity	Yongkun Li;Bing Li;Sisheng Yao;Lianglin Xiong	2018	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2018.04.044	periodic graph (geometry);machine learning;cellular neural network;quaternion;banach fixed-point theorem;synchronization;artificial intelligence;lyapunov function;mathematics;control theory;nonlinear system;exponential function	ML	73.22494323134514	2.3968090408641873	56839

Transfer functions of these systems are rational functions with polynomials of rational powers of the Laplace variable s. Such systems are defined on a Riemann surface because of their multivalued nature. A set of rules for plotting the root loci on the first Riemann sheet is presented. The important features of the classical root-locus method such as asymptotes, roots condition on the real axis, and breakaway points are extended to fractional case. It is also shown that the proposed method can assess the closed-loop stability of fractional-order systems in the presence of a varying gain in the loop. Three illustrative examples are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;apache axis;breakaway games;locus;linear time-invariant theory;polynomial;time complexity;time-invariant system;whole earth 'lectronic link	Farshad Merrikh-Bayat;Mahdi Afshar	2008	J.

For the joint diagonalization we suggest a novel algorithm which finds the correct direction in an deflation based manner, one after another.

Nonlinearity is expressed by low-order polynomials, which are acceptable in many practical applications. A separation block and a linearization block are cascaded. In the separation block, the cross terms are suppressed, and the signal sources are separated in each group, which include its high-order components. The high-order components are further suppressed through the linearization block. A learning algorithm minimizing the mutual information is applied to the separation block. A new learning algorithm is proposed for the linearization block. Simulation results, using 2-channel speech signals, instantaneous mixtures, and 2nd-order post nonlinear functions, show good separation performance.	algorithm;blind signal separation;mutual information;nonlinear system;polynomial;simulation;source separation	Takayuki Nishiwaki;Kenji Nakayama;Akihiro Hirano	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2004.1327174	spline;minimisation;mathematical optimization;speech recognition;computer science;speech;machine learning;signal processing;mathematics;blind signal separation;mutual information;feedback linearization;information system;statistics;polynomial;signal generator	Embedded	80.89833766853046	-9.422842901014734	57287

Namely, the one that ensures attractivity of the manifold whose internal dynamics contains a copy of the desired system behavior. Towards this end we invoke contraction theory principles and propose two alternative procedures to carry out this step: (i) to replace attractivity of the manifold by virtual contraction of the off-the-manifold coordinate and (ii) to ensure the attractivity of the manifold rendering it horizontally contractive. This makes more systematic the design with more explicit degrees of freedom to accomplish the task. Several examples, including the classical case of systems in feedback form, are used to illustrate the proposed design.

The approach is to choose from all available measurements that subset which minimizes a criterion of performance subject to an investment cost constraint on the measurements. The number of possible measurement combinations is assumed to be too large to permit performance evaluation for each such combination. Consequently, the problem is formulated as a nonlinear 0–1 integer programming problem. In order to reduce the computational burden required by the usual quadratic criterion, alternative performance measures are developed which approximate the quadratic criterion, are much simpler to evaluate, and retain certain monotone properties relating to addition of measurements. A new efficient integer programming algorithm is proposed for this problem which takes better advantage of these monotone properties than the Lawler-Bell algorithm which also applies here.	control system;control theory	Dipankar Ghosh;Charles H.

While the generalized Lorenz system unifies the famous Lorenz system and Chen's system [10], the hyperbolic-type generalized Lorenz system is in some way complementary to it. Synchronization of two such systems is made through a scalar coupling signal based on nonlinear observer design using special change of coordinates to the so-called observer canonical form of the hyperbolic-type generalized Lorenz system. The properties of the suggested synchronization that make it attractive for the the secure encrypted communication application are discussed in detail. Theoreti­ cal results are supported by the computer simulations, showing viability of the suggested approach.	chaos theory;computer simulation;encryption;entity–relationship model;lorenz system;neural oscillation;nonlinear system;synchronization of chaos	Sergej Celikovský	2004	Kybernetika		mathematics;scalar (physics);control theory;synchronization of chaos;observer (quantum physics);nonlinear system;canonical form;lorenz system;synchronization;oscillation	Robotics	73.47530115672207	0.4674950125885067	58102

The nonlinearity is assumed to be both sector bounded and slope restricted. Stability of this system is determined using a Lyapunov function with a quadratic term on both the states and the nonlinearity. The main result of this paper is to relax the positivity conditions that have been imposed for such Lyapunov functions. This allows Lyapunov functions to be constructed without a positive definite quadratic matrix and whose scalars of the Lur'e term are not sign-definite. We also show that previous results can be simplified to the case of the quadratic form with Lur'e term. The benefits of considering such a Lyapunov function for stability analysis are shown both for the global case and for the local case.	coefficient;interconnection;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerical method;quadratic function;soft-in soft-out decoder;type system	Giorgio Valmorbida;Ross Drummond;Stephen Duncan	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7524925	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control-lyapunov function;nonlinear system;lyapunov function;trajectory;lyapunov equation;control theory;mathematics;linearity;lyapunov redesign;lyapunov exponent;lyapunov optimization;symmetric matrix	Robotics	69.24522445997394	-1.5595820780142884	58395
d69aaa23cec8709c355417952cf39449de28f95b	a general method to stabilize unstable periodic orbits for switched dynamical systems with a periodically moving threshold		In the previous study, a method to control chaos for switched dynamical systems with constant threshold value has been proposed. In this paper, we extend this method to the systems including a periodically moving threshold. The main control scheme is based on the pole placement, then a small control perturbation added to the moving threshold value can stabilize an unstable periodic orbit embedded within a chaotic attractor. For an arbitrary periodic function of the threshold movement, we mathematically derive the variational equations, the state feedback parameters, and a control gain by composing a suitable Poincare map. As examples, we illustrate control implementations for systems with thresholds whose movement waveforms are sinusoidal and sawtooth-shape, and unstable one and two periodic orbits in each circuit are stabilized in numerical and circuit experiments. In these experiments, we confirm enough convergence of the control input.		Yuu Miino;Daisuke Ito;Hiroyuki Asahara;Takuji Kousaka;Tetsushi Ueta	2018	I. J.

Firstly, some new simple Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals are constructed by uniformly dividing the discrete delay interval into multiple segments, and choosing proper functionals with different weighted matrices corresponding to different segments in the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. Then using these new simple Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, some new delay-dependent stability criteria are derived. These criteria include some existing results as their special cases and are much less conservative than some existing results, which is shown through a numerical example. Secondly, a delay-dependent bounded real lemma (BRL) is established.

The generalized eigendecomposition algorithms consider the estimation of a pair of correlation matrices (a matrix pencil) using observed sensor signals. Each of various algorithms proposed in the literature uses a different approach to form the pencil. This study proposes a linear algebra formulation which exploits the definition of congruent matrix pencils and shows that the solution and its constraints are independent of the way the matrix pencil is computed. Also an iterative eigendecomposition algorithm, that updates separation parameters on a sample-by-sample basis, is developed. It comprises of: (1) performing standard eigendecompositions based on power and deflation techniques; (2) computing a transformation matrix using spectral factorization. Another issue discussed in this work is the influence of the length of the data segment used to estimate the pencil. The algorithm is applied to artificially mixed audio data and it is shown that the separation performance depends on the eigenvalue spread. The latter varies with the number of samples used to estimate the eigenvalues. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Sufficient global dissipativity conditions are derived from the theory of M-matrix analysis, and the globally attractive set as well as the positive invariant set is established. By constructing Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals and using a linear matrix inequality technique, some new sufficient conditions on global dissipativity and global exponential dissipativity of MCVNNs are derived.

It provides comparable performance and is significantly faster than convex optimization techniques used in sparse processing. In this paper we extend SBL to process observations from multiple dictionaries when the sparse solutions have common support across dictionaries. Two solutions are presented, a multiple covariance formulation and a common covariance formulation. As an example, the multi-dictionary approach is used to estimate the direction-of-arrivals in presence of aliasing. Simulations and data from the SwellEx-96 experiment are used to demonstrate qualitatively the advantages of multi-dictionary SBL.	aliasing;computer simulation;convex optimization;dictionary;linear equation;mathematical optimization;sparse matrix	Santosh Nannuru;Kay L.

The sufficient conditions for the stability and stabilizability of these systems are often related to certain growth rate conditions on the functions which define the dynamics of the system. In this paper we analyze three complementary classes of nonlinear time-varying systems according to these growth rates. For each case, we give further results to guarantee uniform global asymptotic stability of the cascade and relate our contributions to input-to-state stability and other growth rate conditions previously reported. The advantage of this type of analysis is that it is often easier to verify such conditions than to find a Lyapunov function with a negative-definite derivative.

This map models the dynamical behavior of the converter when the waveforms of the inductor current can be approximated by straight lines during each switching subinterval. The parameter space is constrained by the interleaving control and the physical restriction on the values of some parameters. The main focus of this paper is on the existence and stability conditions of the rich variety of k-periodic orbits and the different bifurcation patterns that can be exhibited in this system. The analytical results in the form of 1-D and 2-D bifurcation diagrams are compared with numerical simulations obtained from the circuit-based switched model getting a good agreement between the two approaches.	bifurcation theory;dc-to-dc converter;net (polyhedron);switched-mode power supply	Luis Benadero;Vanessa Moreno-Font;Abdelali El Aroudi	2013	I.

940f83c80060d8c7833025e860179405a6d1da20	a pedestrian's introduction to spacetime crystallography	emergent structure;physical properties	Ordinary crystallography deals with regular, discrete, static arrangements in space. Of course, dynamic considerations— and thus the additional dimension of time—must be introduced when one studies the origin of crystals (since they are emergent structures) and their physical properties such as conductivity and compressibility. The space and time of the dynamics in which the crystal is embedded are assumed to be those of ordinary continuous mechanics. In this paper, we take as the starting point a spacetime crystal, that is, the spacetime structure underlying a discrete and regular dynamics. A dynamics of this kind can be viewed as a “crystalline computer.” After considering transformations that leave this structure invariant, we turn to the possible states of this crystal, that is, the discrete spacetime histories that can take place in it and how they transform under different crystal transformations. This introduction to spacetime crystallography provides the rationale for making certain definitions and addressing specific issues; presents the novel features of this approach to crystallography by analogy and by contrast with conventional crystallography; and raises issues that have no counterpart there.	computability;computation;design rationale;discrete mathematics;dynamic programming;embedded system;emergence;emoticon;euclidean distance;floor and ceiling functions;lattice gas automaton;plug-in (computing)	Tommaso Toffoli	2004	IBM Journal of Research and Development	10.1147/rd.481.0013	classical mechanics;spacetime topology;computer science;mathematics;geometry;physical property;physics;quantum mechanics	PL	82.73117920622924	3.4666882375910437	60093

The basis of this work is a geometric approach allowing to partitioning the parameter space in regions with constant number of unstable roots. This methodology defines the hyper-planes separating the aforementioned regions and characterises the way in which the number of unstable roots changes when crossing such a hyper-plane. The main contribution of the paper is that it provides an explicit tool to find P-δ gains ensuring the stability of the closed-loop system. In addition, the proposed methodology allows to design a non-fragile controller with a desired exponential decay rate σ. Several numerical examples illustrate the results and a haptic experimental set-up shows the effectiveness of P-δ controllers.

Switching or discontinuous controllers may offer advantages in this context. In particular, there may not exist a continuous control law which would keep the output identically equal to zero and for which the zero output constrained dynamics are locally stable, whereas a discontinuous controller which achieves this exists. For single-input/single-output input nonaffine nonlinear systems we give sufficient conditions for existence and present a method for the design of discontinuous switching controllers which yield locally stable zero dynamics.	control system;minimum phase;nonlinear system;optimal control	Dragan Nesic;Efstratios Skafidas;Iven M.

The novelty of this approach is that the inherent nonlinearities of the underlying system are incorporated into the design of the control law in a simple and practical manner. An adaptive bilinear PSS is proposed, and a theoretical proof of convergence of the adaptive bilinear control algorithm is given. The significance of the adaptive bilinear PSS lies in that: (i) its nonlinear nature accounts for dynamic changes of the system due to the system’s inherent nonlinearities; and (ii) its adaptive feature accommodates changes in the system parameters and/or configuration. 01997 Elsevier Science Ltd.	algorithm;bilinear filtering;nonlinear system;operating point;optimal control;physical symbol system;simulation;xfig	Fangpo He;M.

After establishing the necessary condition based on stochastic algebraic Riccati equation (SARE) for the existence of the strategy set, it is shown that the same conditions can be written by the linear matrix inequality (LMI). The equivalence between the solvability of the SARE and the feasibility of the LMI is proved for the first time by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. In order to prove the usefulness of the proposed methodology, the extension to the multiparameter singularly perturbed systems (MSPS) is also considered. It is shown that the parameter-independent strategy set can be designed by solving the reduced-order AREs and LMI. Furthermore, as a novel contribution, the degradation of H2 norm for the closed-loop stochastic systems by means of the parameter independent strategy set that is yielded via LMI methods is given. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the useful feature obtained.	algebraic riccati equation;algebraic equation;elegant degradation;feedback;h2 database engine;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;linear matrix inequality;linear time-invariant theory;numerical analysis;social inequality;stochastic process;time complexity;time-invariant system;tucker decomposition;turing completeness	Hiroaki Mukaidani;Hideyuki Tanaka;Toru Yamamoto	2012	2012 American Control Conference (ACC)			Robotics	68.53950971390236	0.17873945871157948	60610

Using these functions, we propose sufficient conditions for the global stability analysis, in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI), only taking the bounded sector condition into account. Unlike frameworks based on the Lur’e-type function, the additional assumptions about the derivative or discrete variation of the nonlinearity are not necessary. Hence, a wider range of cone bounded nonlinearities can be covered. We also show that there is a link between global stability LMI conditions based on this new Lyapunov function and a transfer function of an auxiliary system being strictly positive real. In addition, the novel function is considered in the local stability analysis problem of discrete-time Lur’e systems subject to a saturating feedback. A convex optimization problem based on sufficient LMI conditions is formulated to maximize an estimate of the basin of attraction. Another specificity of this new Lyapunov function is the fact that the estimate is composed of disconnected sets. Numerical examples reveal the effectiveness of this new Lyapunov function in providing a less conservative estimate with respect to the quadratic function.	ambiguous name resolution;cone (formal languages);control system;convex cone;convex optimization;linear matrix inequality;linear system;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;quadratic function;sensitivity and specificity;transfer function;transfer matrix	Carlos A.

In this paper, we present an example of a system with hysteresis that possesses self-excited limit cycles. In particular, we consider an integral-controlled system with backlash (also known as play operator). A Newton-Raphson algorithm is formulated to calculate the limit cycles in the system. We then prove that the amplitude and period of these limit cycles have linear relationships to parameters within the system. These results are then confirmed in simulation, where we demonstrate our ability to predict and modify the properties of the limit cycles.	algorithm;hysteresis;limit cycle;newton's method;petri net;simulation;steady state	Alex Esbrook;Xiaobo Tan;Hassan K.

The nonlinearity may be represented in the form of a differential equation representing process or system dynamics. On the other hand, nonlinear control element characteristics such as hysteresis, saturation, backlash, or nonlinear damping, whose mathematical description is algebraic, may appear. In many instances the mathematical formulation for system description may become so unwieldy that an analytical solution is either impractical or impossible. It is particularly in situations like these that digital simulation has become an invaluable tool.	3d modeling;hysteresis;linear algebra;nonlinear system;simulation;system dynamics	Joseph S.

We consider one of the most simple and innocently looking SD-DDEs x(t) = ±x(t-x(t)). This retarded SD-DDE brings a lot of intricacies. It looks linear but is actually a nonlinear SD-DDE in disguise. It exhibits the phenomenon of bifurcation. Also there is a switch in the stability properties of this system. The type of bifurcation exhibited by the system x(t) = - x(t - x(t)) + μ is transcritical. Furthermore, its Taylor series approximation, based on truncation and partial sums, gives no idea of the response. We show that Taylorization of SD-DDEs, which is ubiquitously used in physics and engineering community, could be misleading. We also perform singular and regular perturbation analyses and derive the solution of the small signal perturbed system in terms of the Lambert-W function. We also demonstrate that the instability of SD-DDE is quite different from that of ODEs. Our simulation results reveal that serious errors may occur when SD-DDEs are approximated either by Taylorization or by constant delay systems.	approximation algorithm;bifurcation theory;dynamic data exchange;instability;nonlinear system;perturbation theory;secure digital;simulation;small-signal model;truncation	Aftab Ahmed;Erik I.

This approach is based on a stochastic sensitivity analysis and uses the construction of confidence tori. A confidence torus as a simple 3D-model of the stochastic cycle adequately describes its main probabilistic features. We suggest an effective algorithm for construction of the confidence tori using a discrete set of confidence ellipses. The ability of these tori to visualize thin effects observed for the period-doubling bifurcations zone in the stochastic Roessler model are shown. For this zone, the geometrical growth of stochastic sensitivity of the forced cycles under transition to chaos is presented. © 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The stability and forward invariance of a set of points around the reference state, named the tracking ellipse, is established by using tools for hybrid dynamical systems. Moreover, prediction of solutions for a finite number of switching events is used to minimize the number of switches.

Partitioning the reconstruction process into two complementary parts provides a natural trade-off between runtime and reconstruction quality. To exploit the advantages of the two-part framework, we propose a Noisy-Sudocodes algorithm that performs two-part reconstruction of sparse signals in the presence of measurement noise. Specifically, we design a fast algorithm for Part 1 of Noisy-Sudocodes that identifies the zero coefficients of the input signal from its noisy measurements. Many existing CS algorithms could be applied to Part 2, and we investigate approximate message passing (AMP) and binary iterative hard thresholding (BIHT). For Noisy-Sudocodes with AMP in Part 2, we provide a theoretical analysis that characterizes the trade-off between runtime and reconstruction quality. In a 1-bit CS setting where a new 1-bit quantizer is constructed for Part 1 and BIHT is applied to Part 2, numerical results show that the Noisy-Sudocodes algorithm improves over BIHT in both runtime and reconstruction quality.	1-bit architecture;approximation algorithm;coefficient;compressed sensing;detection theory;iterative method;message passing;noisy-channel coding theorem;numerical analysis;quantization (signal processing);sparse matrix;thresholding (image processing)	Yanting Ma;Dror Baron;Deanna Needell	2014	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2014.2362892	algorithm design;mathematical optimization;sparse matrix;computer science;noise measurement;noise;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;compressed sensing	Vision	78.04266893223372	-6.116480464487151	61611
9a287824a3922c092b5324afee9a23a5d916e6a0	playing with the regulation zeros in the stabilization of a double inverted pendulum		State-space methods are well adapted for solving stabilization problems. In the linear multivariable case, when the poles are placed, some degrees of freedom are left which can be used to place some zeros in the transfer functions from the perturbations to the outputs, called regulation zeros, to reject some perturbations. It is therefore interesting to use a suitable representation to compute the closed-loop transfer functions from the perturbations to the outputs. The YoulaJabr-Bongiorno parametrization of the controller turns out to be very appropriate for this task. We have applied this method to the stabilization of a double inverted pendulum, fixed on a carriage moving on an horizontal bench. We have obtained a minimal controller which stabilizes the system and rejects asymptotically on the position of the carriage some perturbations, for example: measurements noises on the angle, the slope of the bench. All the results we have obtained on a full-size realization, (which can be seen at the permanent exhibition of the Cite des Sciences et de l'lndustrie de La Villette), show that the behavior of the system closely depends on the choice of the regulation zeros.	inverted pendulum;linear algebra;regulation a;state space	Brigitte d'Andréa-Novel;Laurent Praly	1991	Kybernetika		simulation;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	69.79008255870075	-4.7447235558692675	61705

In particular, the results can be used to show stability under approximated PID, PI and PD control. Experimental step responses are given for two diierent PI controllers. The rst controller guarantees a stable response, based on the work presented. While the second system displays superior performance and seems stable, it does not satisfy the stability criterion of the paper.

Several exponential and uniform stability criteria of this impulsive delayed system are derived, which promotes the study of memristor-based recurrent neural networks.

In this paper, we study the dynamical behavior of a piecewise linear (PWL) spring-mass-damper system for vibration-based energy harvesting applications. First, we present a continuous time single degree of freedom PWL dynamical model of the system. Different configurations of the PWL model and their corresponding state-space regions are derived. Then, from this PWL model, extensive numerical simulations are carried out by computing time-domain waveforms, state-space trajectories and frequency responses under a deterministic harmonic excitation for different sets of system parameter values. Stability analysis is performed using Floquet theory combined with Fillipov method, Poincaré map modeling and finite difference method (FDM). The Floquet multipliers are calculated using these three approaches and a good concordance is obtained among them. The performance of the system in terms of the harvested energy is studied by considering both purely harmonic excitation and a noisy vibrational source. A frequency-domain analysis shows that the harvested energy could be larger at low frequencies as compared to an equivalent linear system, in particular for relatively low excitation intensities. This could be an advantage for potential use of this system in low frequency ambient vibrational-based energy harvesting applications.	bifurcation theory;chaos theory;coexist (image);concordance (publishing);domain analysis;dynamical system;finite difference method;frequency response;lagrange multiplier;linear system;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;piecewise linear continuation;simulation;state space;vibrator (electronic)	Abdelali El Aroudi;H.

A boundary controller based on boundary measurement is designed for exponential stabilization of the PIDE system, and it is implemented by controlling and measuring only one endpoint of the 1-D spatial domain. With the Lyapunov direct method and Wirtinger’s inequality, a sufficient condition for exponential stabilization of the PIDE system with a given decay rate is investigated. Dealing with a special case of PIDE systems, one lemma called Yang inequality is proposed, and a new less conservative sufficient condition is investigated. An example with two cases is given to show the effectiveness and less conservativeness of the proposed methods by using Yang inequality.	communication endpoint;direct method in the calculus of variations;lyapunov fractal;parabolic antenna;semiconductor industry;social inequality;time complexity;yang	Chengdong Yang;Tingwen Huang;Zhenxing Li;Ancai Zhang;Jianlong Qiu;Fuad E.

A crucial step in our proofs is finding an appropriate Lyapunov function for the quantization/time-scheduling protocol which verifies its uniform global exponential stability (UGES). We construct Lyapunov functions for several representative protocols that are commonly found in the literature, as well as some new protocols not considered previously.

We give a state space oriented extension of the Nehari Theorem to a time-varying system-theoretic setting. In that setting the theorem addresses the issue of measuring the distance between a noncausal bounded I/O operator and the family of causal I/O operators in stable linear systems. The analysis is based on the recent time-domain LQ optimization approach to robust control. The discussion includes a geometrical analysis of stable and antistable invariant subspaces, a short study of certain types of co-prime factorizations of I/O operators in time-varying systems, and a parametrization of all suboptimal solutions.	nehari manifold	Gilead Tadmor;Madanpal Verma	1992	MCSS	10.1007/BF02134014	parametrization;mathematical analysis;calculus;control theory;mathematics;factorization;systems theory;algebra	Logic	73.50992422935293	-1.5342866160652275	62597

The two types of complex-valued behaved functions, amplification functions and activation functions, are considered. By using homeomorphism theory and inequality technique, the sufficient conditions for the existence of unique equilibrium point are obtained. Then, by constructing a suitable Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, the global asymptotic stability condition of the proposed neural networks is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. This linear matrix inequality can be efficiently solved via the standard numerical packages. Finally, the numerical examples are given to validate the effectiveness of theoretical results.	activation function;artificial neural network;bidirectional associative memory;content-addressable memory;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;social inequality	K.

We derive a sufficient condition for the local exponential stability of equilibrium points, and give an estimate on the domains of attraction of locally exponentially stable equilibrium points. Our condition and estimate are formulated in terms of the network parameters, the neurons’ activation functions and the associated equilibrium point; hence, they are easily checkable. Another advantage of our results is that they neither depend on monotonicity of the activation functions nor on symmetry of the interconnection matrix. Our work has practical importance in evaluating the performance of the related associative memory. To our knowledge, this is the first time to present an estimate on the domains of attraction of equilibrium points for delayed neural networks.	activation function;content-addressable memory;interconnection;neural networks;time complexity	Xiaofan Yang;Xiaofeng Liao;Yuan Yan Tang;David J.

2ce3d6fb54c99a59de5ff9a41f48296dd159a913	exponential synchronization for complex dynamical networks with sampled-data	journal	This paper is concerned with the problem of exponential synchronization for a kind of complex dynamical networks (CDNs) with time-varying coupling delay and sampled-data. The sampling period considered here is assumed to be time-varying but bounded. A newly exponential synchronization condition is provided by using the Lyapunov method. Based on the condition, a set of sampled-data synchronization controllers is designed in terms of the solution to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that can be solved effectively by using available softwares. The derived results are theoretically and numerically proved to be less conservative than the existing results. Two numerical examples are introduced to show the effectiveness and improvement of the given results. & 2012 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the number of degrees of freedom is limited due to the existence of holes in difference coarrays if subspace-based algorithms such as the spatial smoothing multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm are utilized. To address this issue, techniques such as positive definite Toeplitz completion and array interpolation have been proposed in the literature. Another factor that compromises the accuracy of DOA estimation is the limitation of the number of snapshots. Coarray-based processing is particularly sensitive to the discrepancy between the sample covariance matrix and the ideal covariance matrix due to the finite number of snapshots. In this paper, coarray interpolation based on matrix completion (MC) followed by a denoising operation is proposed to detect more sources with a higher accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is based on the capability of MC to fill in holes in the virtual sensors and that of MC denoising operation to reduce the perturbation in the sample covariance matrix. The results of numerical simulations verify the superiority of the proposed approach.	angularjs;coarray fortran;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;direction of arrival;discrepancy function;doa (eukaryote);estimation theory;fill out form;interpolation imputation technique;music (algorithm);multiple personality disorder;noise reduction;numerical analysis;smoothing (statistical technique);spectrometry, mass, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization;toeplitz hash algorithm;sensor (device)	Muran Guo;Tao Chen;Ben Wang	2017		10.3390/s17051140	mathematical optimization;music;statistics	Robotics	81.5795482571254	-6.523392373338685	63318

A switching law and output feedback controllers are designed such that the corresponding closed-loop systems are with the passivity and disturbance tolerance capacity. The switching law satisfies a maximal dwell time (DT) condition, which avoids too high switching frequency. More importantly, under the switching law, the storage function is allowed to be increased during the DT and then decreased due to the drop of itself at the mixed time/state-dependent switching instants. This releases the performance requirement of existing results where the storage function must be non-increasing all the time. Finally, the existence of the upper bound of DT and output feedback controllers is guaranteed by solving some linear matrix inequalities. Two examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.	block cipher mode of operation	Xiao-Qi Zhao;Jun Fu;Jun Zhao	2017	Int. J.

In particular, we derive a linear-matrix-inequalities based procedure to compute upper bounds of dwell time for uniform global exponential stability in linear hybrid systems, and we apply it to stability verification of an industrial refrigeration process that is regulated by several switched proportional-integral controllers via bumpless transfer.	computation;control system;hybrid system;linear matrix inequality;linear system;lyapunov fractal;matlab;network switch;time complexity	Chaohong Cai;Stevo Mijanovic	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/COASE.2010.5584040	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Embedded	68.59205970335167	0.5515762214241061	63608

Polynomial fuzzy system is a general form of the well-known T-S fuzzy system. The stabilization conditions of polynomial fuzzy system are derived based on the Lyapunov stability theory that are represented in terms of sum-of-squares (SOS) and solved by utilizing the SOSOPT that is a free-third party MATLAB toolbox. A Positivstellensatz relaxation for SOS stabilization conditions of polynomial fuzzy systems is also performed in this paper to get a more relaxed result compared with other existing results.

The individual neural network is subject to parameter uncertainty, stochastic disturbance, and time-varying delay, where the norm-bounded parameter uncertainties exist in both the state and weight matrices, the stochastic disturbance is in the form of a scalar Wiener process, and the time delay enters into the activation function. For the array of coupled neural networks, the constant coupling and delayed coupling are simultaneously considered. We aim to establish easy-to-verify conditions under which the addressed neural networks are synchronized. By using the Kronecker product as an effective tool, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed to derive several sufficient criteria ensuring the coupled delayed neural networks to be globally, robustly, exponentially synchronized in the mean square. The LMI-based conditions obtained are dependent not only on the lower bound but also on the upper bound of the time-varying delay, and can be solved efficiently via the Matlab LMI Toolbox. Two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed synchronization scheme.	activation function;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;broadcast delay;linear matrix inequality;matlab;mean squared error;neural network simulation;numerical analysis;population parameter;social inequality;synchronization (computer science)	Jiuyang Liang;Zidong Wang;Yurong Liu;Xin Liu	2008	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks	10.1109/TNN.2008.2003250	stochastic neural network;synchronization;mathematical optimization;computer science;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;artificial neural network	ML	73.5583909105024	0.767793677328364	64715

This contribution summarizes the state of such models in the simulation of electric circuits; that is, we place known facts and techniques into an overall context. In fact, we mainly discuss the modeling and analysis aspects of several important settings. In the modeling context, we embed the network equations into the context of Maxwellu0027s equations and address the three main types of coupling: modeling with subsystems of the same type, refined models, and multiphysics. In the analysis context, we address the existence of solutions for these complex systems as well as structural properties as the DAE index (after spatial semidiscretization). For the numerical simulations, we give results for the cosimulation technique (also referred to as dynamic iteration), which is a standard method for coupled systems.

The effect of delay parameter on the stability of the system is simulated by a bifurcation diagram, the Lyapunov exponent, and an entropic diagram; in addition, the stability region of the system is given by a 2D parameter bifurcation diagram and a 3D parameter bifurcation diagram. Finally, the method of delayed feedback control is used to control the chaotic system. The research results can provide a guideline for enterprise decision-making.	bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;broadcast delay;chaos theory;computer simulation;feedback;hopf bifurcation;lyapunov fractal	Zhihui Han;Junhai Ma;Fengshan Si;Wenbo Ren	2016	Entropy	10.3390/e18090317	entropy;simulation;period-doubling bifurcation;control theory;mathematics;bifurcation theory;mathematical economics;thermodynamics;physics;quantum mechanics;bifurcation diagram	Robotics	78.26455924485398	4.172872464575969	65783

The parametric uncertainties are assumed to be of a linear fractional form, which includes the norm bounded uncertainty as a special case and can describe a class of rational nonlinearities. A strict linear matrix inequality (LMI) design approach is developed such that, when the LMI is feasible, a desired robust state feedback control law can be constructed, which guarantees that, for all admissible uncertainties, the resulting closed-loop system is not only regular, impulse free and stable, but also meets an     H    ∞    -norm bound constraint on disturbance attenuation. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the application of the proposed method.		Shaosheng Zhou;Wei Xing Zheng	2009	J.

This paper provides a step towards the design of a model-based fuzzy PSS that guarantees not only stability, but also performance specifications of power systems. A new practical and simple design based on static output feedback is proposed. The design guarantees robust pole clustering in an acceptable region in the complex plane for a wide range of operating conditions. A power system design model is approximated by a set of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models to account for non-linearities, uncertainties and large-scale power systems. The proposed PSS design is based on parallel distributed compensation (PDC). Sufficient design conditions are derived as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The design procedure leads to a tractable convex optimisation problem in terms of the stabiliser gain matrix. Simulations results of both single machine and multimachine power systems confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PSS design.	approximation algorithm;block cipher mode of operation;cluster analysis;cobham's thesis;computer simulation;convex optimization;ibm power systems;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;multimachine;peripheral dma controller;physical symbol system;systems design	Mostafa Soliman;Fahmy M.

5d83cd0f52e9a539f1ee02e879c029ee261a3783	sparse bayesian learning approach for outlier-resistant direction-of-arrival estimation		Conventional direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation methods are sensitive to outlier measurements. Therefore, their performance may degrade substantially in the presence of impulsive noise. In this paper, we address the problem of DOA estimation in additive outliers from the perspective of sparse Bayesian learning (SBL). A Bayes-optimal algorithm is devised for robust DOA estimation, which can achieve excellent performance in terms of resolution and accuracy. To reduce the computational complexity of the SBL scheme, a fast alternating algorithm is also developed. New grid-refining procedures are further introduced into these two proposed algorithms to efficiently fix the off-grid gap. As our solutions do not require the prior knowledge of the number of sources and can resolve highly correlated or coherent sources, it is expected that they have higher applicability. Simulation results verify the outlier-robust performance of the SBL approach.	algorithm;coherence (physics);computational complexity theory;direction of arrival;kernel density estimation;simulation;sparse matrix;utility functions on indivisible goods	Jisheng Dai;Hing Cheung So	2018	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2017.2773420	robustness (computer science);variable-order bayesian network;mathematics;gaussian noise;recursive bayesian estimation;outlier;wake-sleep algorithm;sparse approximation;artificial intelligence;bayesian inference;pattern recognition	Vision	78.68953087551783	-7.331267085030192	66489

These can be considered as a subclass of the competitive neural networks introduced by Cohen and Grossberg in 1983. The theorem guarantees that each forward trajectory has finite length and converges toward a single equilibrium point, even for those parameters for which there are infinitely many nonisolated equilibrium points. The convergence result in this correspondence, which is proved by means of a new method based on the Lojasiewicz inequality for gradient systems of analytic functions, is stronger than the previous result established by Cohen and Grossberg via LaSalle's invariance principle, which requires, for convergence, the additional assumption that the equilibrium points be isolated.	convergence (action);dynamical system;gradient;kind of quantity - equilibrium;lotka–volterra equations;nash equilibrium;neural network simulation;neural networks;social inequality;subclass	Mauro Forti	2008	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)	10.1109/TSMCB.2007.907041	equilibrium point;mathematical optimization;convergence;computer science;analytic function;dynamical system;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;invariance principle;artificial neural network;symmetric matrix	ML	74.67283735135094	3.20706431314763	66588

The plant incorporates a distinct infinite-dimensional block that might be a pointwise or distributed time delay. Mathematical models that belong to this class of systems appear in mathematical biology and computational medicine. A discrete time (Poincaré) map is constructed to capture the system dynamics and investigate its periodic solutions. Simulation results indicate that the effects on the system dynamics incurred by distributed delays are quite similar to those previously observed for pointwise delays. Generally, it appears that the complexity of the nonlinear dynamics does not increase with an increasing delay value.	broadcast delay;computer experiment;feedback;hybrid system;mathematical model;nonlinear system;simulation;system dynamics	Alexander N.

To this end, we introduce a class of spatially distributed system models called /nite dimensional, distributed, linear, time-invariant systems. Sensors and actuators are considered to be part of the controller, rather than part of the plant, and thus the controller we wish to design is itself a spatially distributed system. Optimising over placements and shapes of the sensor and actuator spatial distribution functions is an integrated part of the controller design procedure. As an illustrative design example, we present the feedback stabilisation of an electrostatically destabilised, electrically conducting membrane. ? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We first follow the lifting-based treatment for the induced norm from L2 to L∞ of SISO LTI sampled-data systems, but further apply the key idea of fast-lifting, by which the sampling interval [0, h) is divided into M subintervals with an equal width. Such an idea allows us to develop two methods for computing the induced norm with gridding and piecewise constant approximations. These methods leads to approximately equivalent discretization methods of the generalized plant that can be used for readily computing upper and lower bounds of the induced norm together with the derivation of the associated convergence rates. More precisely, it is shown that the approximation error converges to 0 at the rate of 1/√M and 1/M in the gridding and piecewise constant approximation methods, respectively.	approximation error;computation;converge;data system;discretization;lambda lifting;lifting scheme;linear time-invariant theory;rate of convergence;sampling (signal processing);soft-in soft-out decoder;time complexity;time-invariant system	Jung Hoon Kim;Tomomichi Hagiwara	2015	2015 54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2015.7402463	frequency modulation;sampled data systems;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;convergence;control theory;mathematics;linear system;upper and lower bounds	Theory	70.09092591023068	3.7518994616270094	67061

A controller can be synthesized by obtaining a DES controller for an equivalent DES representation (DES plant) of the CSS plant. An important issue concerns the logical invariance (stability) of DES plant transitions to variations in the initial CSS plant state. This paper provides a set of sufficient conditions for the existence of stable transitions in the DES plant. For CSS plants which are affine in their control policies, these conditions form a system of linear inequalities over the space of control vectors used by the CSS plant. Feasible points to this inequality system are inductively determined using a method of centers algorithm known as the ellipsoid method.	algorithm;cascading style sheets;control system;dynamical system;ellipsoid method;hybrid system;inductive reasoning;linear inequality;lyapunov fractal;scott r. lemmon;social inequality;theoretical computer science	Michael D.

Proposed method for tracking of a desired reference trajectory uses a state space model of the multivariable nonlinear/nonstationary system. The method involves three steps. The first step is the design of nominal trajectory using the predictive control technique. The second step is the sequential linearization of the nonlinear system around the fixed operating points, chosen in accordance to the plant dynamics changes. The third step involves the choice of the weighting matrices in the classical LQG controller design for the sequence of linearized models. The feasibility of the proposed method has been demonstrated through its application to the control of aircraft, represented by the six-degree-of-freedom model around the prespecified nominal trajectory.	nonlinear system	Z.

While Gaussian and Bernoulli random measurements perform quite well on the average, structured matrices such as Toeplitz are mostly used in practice due to their simplicity. However, the signal compression performance may not be acceptable. In this paper, we propose to optimize the Toeplitz matrices to improve its compression performance to recover sparse signals. We establish the optimization on minimizing the coherence of the measurement matrix by an intelligent optimization method called Particle Swarm Optimization. Our simulation results show that the optimized Toeplitz matrix outperforms the non-optimized one in reconstructing sparse signals in terms of quality and sampling rate.	bernoulli polynomials;compressed sensing;mathematical optimization;nyquist rate;particle swarm optimization;program optimization;sampling (signal processing);signal compression;simulation;sparse matrix;toeplitz hash algorithm	Masoume Azghani;Ali Aghagolzadeh;Farrokh Marvasti	2013	2013 Iran Workshop on Communication and Information Theory	10.1109/IWCIT.2013.6555756	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;theoretical computer science;mathematics	AI	78.39276533030015	-6.209332466257611	67912

By using a new discrete event-triggering mechanism, an event-based sampled-data three-layer fully connected feedforward neural-network-based controller is constructed. Compared with the conventional periodic sampled-data neural-network-based control in previous works, the main advantage of this paper is that the proposed event-based sampling and transmission scheme not only reduces the updating frequency of the controller, but also guarantees the asymptotical stability of the closed-loop system without dramatically degrading the overall system performance. Based on a discontinuous Lyapunov Krasovskii functional, a convex combination technique and the Wirtinger-based integral inequality, some new criteria are derived to guarantee the asymptotical stability and certain performance of closed-loop system in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Based on the proposed criteria, a co-design method is presented to obtain the triggering parameter and the connection weights of the neural network simultaneously while ensuring a certain system performance. Finally, simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed theoretical results.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;asymptote;control system;feedforward neural network;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;mac os x 10.3 panther;multitier architecture;neural networks;nonlinear system;sampling (signal processing);simulation;social inequality	Songlin Hu;Dong Yue;Xiuxia Yin;Xiangpeng Xie	2016	2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727667	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	71.8364043397667	1.4170434582548148	68303

During implementation of the wave transformation for the sampled-data system, a unit delay arises due to causality of the reflection wave. The property of the wave transformation using delayed reflection, which is different from the standard wave transformation, can be verified with the passivity condition of the scattering matrix. The unit delay on the reflection wave occasionally becomes a positive damping. From the passivity condition of the sampled-data system, the wave impedance can be designed such that the wave transformation using delayed reflection wave provides the effect of positive damping. As an example, the wave transformation using delayed reflection wave makes it possible that the stable haptic interface is achieved on the sampled-data system with appropriate wave impedance. The simulation and the experiment results show that the stable haptic interface can be accomplished by use of the wave transformation using delayed reflection.	bilateral filter;bilateral sound;causality;characteristic impedance;data system;experiment;haptic technology;optimal control;sampling (signal processing);simulation	Jae-Hyeong Lee;Jae-Bok Song;Chang-Soon Hwang;Munsang Kim	2005	2005 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2005.1545457	s-matrix;control engineering;sampled data systems;electronic engineering;stability;engineering;control theory;reflection coefficient;haptic technology;scattering;quantum mechanics	Robotics	75.0565178049214	-8.010387707143003	68308

It is shown that the framework is well connected to the Youla controller parameterization and to fault tolerant/detection schemes. Furthermore, the proposed framework provides a transparent analysis of the interactions between the different design parameters which allows for a clearer design tradeoff between robust stability and robust performance for the saturated and unsaturated closed loops.	adjusted winner procedure;fault tolerance;interaction;robust control	Andrés Marcos;Matthew C.

The linear dynamic model of piezoelectric bonded cantilever beams is obtained using online recursive least square parameter estimation. A digital control system that consists of simulink modelling software and dSPACE 1104 controller board is used for identification and control. The performance of simultaneous controller is evaluated by considering three structure models. These models are obtained by introducing parameter variation in length and mass of a single cantilever beam structure. The effectiveness of the controller is demonstrated experimentally by exciting the structures at resonance.	feedback;sampling (signal processing)	Deenadayalan Ezhilarasi;Mangalanathan Umapathy;Bijnan Bandyopadhyay	2010	IJAAC	10.1504/IJAAC.2010.029838	control engineering;electronic engineering;piezoelectric sensor;engineering;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	72.4330565811381	-8.41668126600285	68382

The control scheme consists of two controllers: a SVM based controller which fulfils the direct inverse model control and a traditional controller which fulfils the close-loop control. And so the scheme can deal with the errors between the process and the SVM based internal model generated by model mismatch and additional disturbance. Simulations are given to illustrate the proposed design procedure and the properties of the SVM based internal model control scheme for unknown nonlinear systems with time delay.	broadcast delay;computer simulation;memory controller;nonlinear system;radial basis function kernel;support vector machine	Weimin Zhong;Daoying Pi;Youxian Sun;Chi Xu;Sizhen Chu	2006		10.1007/11760023_135	kernel;input/output;support vector machine;kernel method;radial basis function;internal model;systems modeling;nonlinear system;computer science;inverse problem;artificial intelligence;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;artificial neural network	Robotics	72.66341950712071	-6.390856066651699	68617

Though formulation of the control design problem in matrix second-order form has many advantages, there is very little literature available on this topic—even for nominal case. In this paper, we design controller gains directly in matrix second-order formulation for robust stability in a specified range of parameter variations. The stabilizing controller gains for entire parameter variations range are obtained from only two given extreme matrices without formulating or checking the stability of other vertex matrices of the family. The design algorithm is computationally efficient and simple.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;control engineering;dynamical system;robotics;robust control	Anjali M. Diwekar;Rama K.

In the previous literature, the major three upper bound norms for the intervalized interconnection matrices have been reported and they have been successfully applied to derive new sufficient conditions for robust stability of delayed neural networks. One of the main contributions of this paper will be the derivation of a new upper bound for the norm of the intervalized interconnection matrices of neural networks. Then, by exploiting this new upper bound norm of interval matrices and using stability theory of Lyapunov functionals and the theory of homomorphic mapping, we will obtain new sufficient conditions for the existence, uniqueness and global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point for the class of neural networks with discrete time delays under parameter uncertainties and with respect to continuous and slope-bounded activation functions. The results obtained in this paper will be shown to be new and they can be considered alternative results to previously published corresponding results. We also give some illustrative and comparative numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed robust stability condition.	artificial neural network;dynamical system;generalization (psychology);interconnection;kind of quantity - equilibrium;lyapunov fractal;neural network simulation;numerical analysis;osi model;population parameter;scientific publication	Ozlem Faydasicok;Sabri Arik	2013	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/j.neunet.2013.03.014	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	ML	73.35496064793648	2.262892600894258	69241

First, we study how to define a Lyapunov function for BNs. A proper form of pseudo-Boolean functions is found, and the concept of (strict-) Lyapunov functions is thus given. It is shown that a pseudo-Boolean function in the proper form can play the role of Lyapunov functions for BNs, based on which several Lyapunov-based stability results are obtained. Second, we study how to construct a Lyapunov function for BNs and propose two methods for this problem: one is a definition-based method, and the other is a structure-based one. Third, the existence of strict-Lyapunov functions is studied, and a converse Lyapunov theorem as well as a necessary and sufficient condition are obtained for the asymptotical stability.

Although various algorithms exist for the underdetermined BSS problem for sparse sources, as well as for the PNL BSS problem with as many mixtures as sources, the nonlinear problem in an underdetermined scenario has not been satisfactorily solved yet. The method proposed in this letter aims at inverting the different nonlinearities, thus reducing the problem to linear underdetermined BSS. To this end, first a spectral clustering technique is applied that clusters the mixture samples into different sets corresponding to the different sources. Then, the inverse nonlinearities are estimated using a set of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) that are trained by minimizing a specifically designed cost function. Finally, transforming each mixture by its corresponding inverse nonlinearity results in a linear underdetermined BSS problem, which can be solved using any of the existing methods	algorithm;blind signal separation;cluster analysis;loss function;multilayer perceptron;nonlinear system;separation anxiety disorder;source separation;sparse matrix;spectral clustering;mixture;statistical cluster	Steven Van Vaerenbergh;Ignacio Santamaría	2006	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks	10.1109/TNN.2006.872358	speech recognition;index term;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;blind signal separation;multilayer perceptron;spectral clustering;artificial neural network;difference set	ML	80.7809018116467	-9.29777298938586	70011

After given a formal definition of functional backward observability (BO), an easily testable condition is found. The fulfillment of the obtained condition allows for the reconstruction of the trajectories of the system under consideration using the actual and past values of the system output and some of its derivatives. The methodology we follow consists in an iterative algorithm based upon the classical Silverman algorithm used for inversion of linear systems. By using basic module theory we manage to prove that the proposed algorithm is convergent. A direct application of studying functional observability is that a condition can be derived for systems with distributed delays also, we do this as a case of study. The obtained results are illustrated by two examples, one is merely academic but illustrates clearly the kind of systems which the proposed methodology works for and the other is a practical system with distributed delays.

Furthermore, the well-known Siegel’s theorem on the linearizability of a mapping is naturally reproduced in a corollary.

Given the characteristics of the electromechanical system to be controlled, an observer-based, discrete-time sliding mode (DTSM) servo controller with integral action is adopted. The controller is designed on the basis of an identified model of the system, whose states are estimated by means of a state observer. Different state observer structures are analyzed, and it is shown that the main characteristics of standard state-feedback-based sliding mode control systems are preserved. A theoretical analysis is also presented showing that a separation principle holds, so that the state observer and the DTSM controller can be designed independently. The performances of the designed controller are illustrated by reporting the results of tests performed on track with a racing motorcycle.	control system;motogp;overshoot (signal);performance;separation principle;servo	Alessandro Beghi;Lorenzo Nardo;Marco Stevanato	2006	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2006.872503	control engineering;variable structure system;variable structure control;simulation;sliding mode control;system identification;engineering;automotive industry;control system;control theory;state observer;observer;separation principle	Embedded	71.96324276125368	-7.760793599720238	70986

The BSS problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem with complex unmixing weight matrices where the constraints are formulated to overcome the permutation effects. This problem is then transformed into an unconstrained optimization problem, so that the conjugate gradient algorithm can be applied. The convergence of the proposed procedure is compared with the steepest descent algorithms in real and simulated environments.	algorithm;blind signal separation;constraint (mathematics);gradient descent;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation	Hai Huyen Dam;Antonio Cantoni;Sven Nordholm;Kok Lay Teo	2008	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2007.910234	gradient descent;mathematical optimization;computer science;gradient method;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;blind signal separation;conjugate gradient method;nonlinear conjugate gradient method	ML	81.02729973323683	-6.054120489150037	71029

In this paper we present an alternative to these approaches, which, while lacking optimality, provides explicit time-varying feedback laws that achieve regulation in prescribed finite time, even in the presence of non-vanishing (though matched) uncertain nonlinearities. Our approach employs a scaling of the state by a function of time that grows unbounded towards the terminal time and is followed by a design of a controller that stabilizes the system in the scaled state representation, yielding regulation in prescribed finite time for the original state. The achieved robustness to right-hand-side disturbances is not accompanied by robustness to measurement noise, which is also absent from all controllers that are nonsmooth or discontinuous at the origin. © 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	image scaling;initial condition;nonlinear system;optimal control	Yongduan Song;Yujuan Wang;John Holloway;Miroslav Krstic	2017	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2017.06.008		Robotics	69.88401202492128	0.07755872622351553	71590

In fact, this is the wellknown phenomenon of finite-time stability. However, in this paper, we will prove that for fractionalorder nonlinear system described by Caputo’s or Riemann–Liouville’s definition, any equilibrium cannot be finite-time stable as long as the continuous solution corresponding to the initial value problem globally exists. In addition, some examples of stability analysis are revisited and linear Lyapunov function is used to prove the asymptotic stability of positive fractional-order nonlinear systems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to design an AQM controller with only an output (queue size) measurement, a novel TCP window size observer is first proposed. Then, the control law is developed by applying an observer-based backstepping design technique. The amplitude limits on the control input is addressed, namely, packet dropping or marking ratio must fall between 0 and 1. An estimation of the domain of attractiveness is given with a Lyapunov level set.	active queue management;asymptotically optimal algorithm;block cipher mode of operation;feedback;item unique identification;lyapunov fractal;network packet;operating point;optimal control;tcp tuning	Yi Fan;Zhong-Ping Jiang;Shivendra S.

Conventional linear state estimators do not have sufficient accuracy under the existence of external disturbances and model uncertainty. With our proposed estimator, output-tracking performance can achieve improved robustness. Integral and discontinuous actions are introduced to alleviate the estimation error caused by disturbances and model uncertainty, while the multirate technique is used to obtain a smoother control input and higher bandwidth. Integral action and the multirate technique also alleviate the chattering caused by the discontinuous control action. Simulations and experiments have been carried out to validate our proposed multirate state estimator. Finally, an experimental implementation of proposed seeking control for single-stage and dual-stage actuated hard disk drives is demonstrated.	computer simulation;experiment;hard disk drive	Keitaro Ohno;Roberto Horowitz	2005	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2004.839567	control engineering;variable structure control;mathematical optimization;estimator;systems modeling;uncertainty;system identification;engineering;control theory;feedback;mathematics;observer;bandwidth;statistics;robustness	Robotics	72.09681491208774	-7.09927056250556	71683

The designed controller is a linear feedback controller composed with a nonlinear modulo or sawtooth function, which can lead to uniformly bounded state vectors of the controlled system with positive Lyapunov exponents, thereby yielding chaotic dynamics. We mathematically prove that the controlled system is indeed chaotic in the sense of Li and Yorke. A few potential applications of the new chaotification algorithm are briefly discussed.

The class of nominal closed loop systems considered for the constrained output regulation problem i s str ctly proper and minimum phase, assuming for each output measurement constraint one availa ble actuator and the first Markov parameter to be full rank. This necessitates the open-loop p lant to have the same input-toconstrained-output characteristics. The advantage of the considered class of nominal systems is that an output constraint translates directly into a state c onstraint for which it is possible to use a particular non-smooth Lyapunov function. The non-smooth Lyapunov function is defined by the level of the output constraint creating an invariant set for which the strict output constraints are satisfied. The override strategy is designed to retain a m i imal effect on the nominal control loop in case no output constraint is violated.

The existence and the uniqueness of the solution to the main system with respect to FBN are proved via fixed point theory. Based on Hilbert–Schmidt operator theory and analytic semigroup principle, the mild solution of the stochastic neural networks is obtained. By applying the stochastic analytic technique and some well-known inequalities, the asymptotic stability criteria and the exponential stability condition are established. Both numerical example and practical application for synchronization control of multiagent system are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed techniques.	agent-based model;asymptote;brownian noise;contraction mapping;correctness (computer science);fbn1 gene;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point number;fixed-point theorem;functional approach;lyapunov fractal;markov chain;mean squared error;multi-agent system;neural networks;noise-induced hearing loss;numerical analysis;routh–hurwitz stability criterion;schmidt decomposition;stochastic neural network;theory;exponential	Wuneng Zhou;Xianghui Zhou;Jun Yang;Jun Zhou;Dongbing Tong	2018	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2674692	operator theory;fixed-point theorem;artificial neural network;stochastic neural network;analytic semigroup;mathematical optimization;stochastic process;exponential stability;mathematics;brownian noise	ML	72.85558670161329	2.396233100145553	72623

For linear systems, our work about the BIBS and the BIBO stabilities does not concern the state controllability or the state observability. The data-driven methods can analyze the stabilities by doing some simple experiments and observations, while not identifying the corresponding parameter matrices. Our methods are easier to understand and more convenient to use in engineering practice.	bibo stability;experiment;linear system;nonlinear system	Zhuo Wang;Derong Liu	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2014.2308146	control engineering;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Robotics	69.17267793078427	1.7847782288467726	72928

In particular, we answer to the following questions: (i) What happens with the solutions of a time-varying non-linear system which is globally uniformly stable (GUS), when it is perturbed by the output of a globally exponentially stable (GES) system, in particular, when both systems form a cascade? (ii) If a time-varying non-linear system is globally uniformly asymptotically stable (GUAS), is this stability properly preserved when it is perturbed by an exponentially decaying input? Our proofs are based on a standard ‘delta-epsilon’ Lyapunov analysis.

The main key ingredient is to find canonical forms for the original systems, from a family of fractional differential primitive elements based on output of each system, taking into account the Liouvillian feature. Fractional order dynamical controllers are designed to solve the generalized multi-synchronization problem. Moreover, it is shown that adding diffusive coupling terms in the dynamical controllers solves the synchronization problem with complex interaction between slave systems, with any type of interplay. Finally, some numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	chaos theory	Christopher D. Cruz-Ancona;Rafael Martínez-Guerra	2017	J.

The source distribution is updated so that, at each grid point, the number of current dipoles equals the total source strength estimate of the pre-specified current dipoles. The source strength of a pre-specified current dipole is estimated by projecting the vector of minimum norm estimate to the space spanned by the three column vectors, corresponding to the three amplitudes of the current dipole, of the resolution matrix. The norm of the projected vector yields the source strength estimate of the current dipole. Exact inverse solutions are obtained by this source iteration of minimum norm (SIMN) algorithm for noiseless MEG signals from multi-point sources provided the sources are sufficiently sparse and there are no substantial cancellations among the signals of the sources. For noisy data, a set of """"noise sources"""" is introduced. The diagonal matrix formed by the """"noise source numbers"""" plays the role of regularization matrix and Tikhonov regularization is applied to initialize the """"noise source numbers"""". Application to the source localization of real EEG data is also presented."""	algorithm;electroencephalography;electromagnetic phenomena;estimated;focal (programming language);iteration;magnetoencephalography;matrix regularization;noise generator;numerous;projections and predictions;recursion;signal-to-noise ratio;solutions;sparse matrix	Wei-Kuang Liang;M.

By utilizing the Lyapunov function methods combined with the Razumikhin technique, several criteria on exponential stability are analytically derived, which are substantially an extension and a generalization of the corresponding results in recent literature. Compared with some existing works, a distinctive feature of this brief is to address exponential stability problems for any fixed-time delays. It is shown that the delayed linear differential equations can be globally exponentially stabilized by impulses even if it may be unstable itself. An example and its simulation are also given to illustrate the theoretic results.	control theory;lyapunov fractal;simulation;time complexity	Jin Zhou;Quanjun Wu	2009	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2009.2027947	exponential error;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;exponential integrator;linear differential equation;control theory;mathematics;stability theory;exponential stability;systems biology;artificial neural network	EDA	74.56127119560682	2.9013247540188787	73676

The main idea of the synchronization stability criterion is based on stability analysis of zero solution of linearized dynamical systems. By rigorous theoretical analysis, a general synchronization stability criteria is derived for N coupled systems with the first state variable diffusive coupling. This criterion is convenient for us to explore the synchronization of a class of coupled dynamical systems. Finally, the famous Lorenz system and Hindmarsh-Rose(HR) neuron are used to test our theoretical analysis.

In recent years a rather large body of literature related to this topic has developed. These works isolate some desired property of a grasp and use this property as the definition of stable grasp. To varying degrees, these approaches ignore the system dynamics. The purpose of this article is to put grasp stability on a more basic and fundamental foundation by defining grasp stability in terms of the well-established stability theory of differential equations. This approach serves to unify the field and to bring a large body of knowledge to bear on the field. Some relationships between the stability concepts used here and the previously used grasp stability concepts are discussed. A hierarchy of three levels of approach to the problem is treated. We consider that the grasp force applied is a basic consideration, in terms of ensuring both that there is sufficient force to prevent dropping the object and that the forces are not too large to cause breakage. As a result, we first investigate the use of constant force grasps. It is shown that with the proper combination of finger locations and grasp forces, such grasps can be Liapunov stable, and methods are presented that help find such grasps. It is also shown that such grasps cannot be asymptotically stable. To produce asymptotic stability, one must alter the forces applied to an object when the object deviates from equilibrium, and a linear feedback force law is given for this. It results in local asymptotic stability guaranteeing convergence to the desired grasp equilibrium from all states within a region of attraction in the state space. Some of the results are similar to results obtained previously, but this time they have a stronger meaning in terms of the dynamic response of the system. In the third level, a nonlinear force law is given that, to within certain limitations, produces global asymptotic grasp stability, so that all initial states are guaranteed to converge to the desired grasp equilibrium. The method is robust to large classes of inaccuracies in the implementation.		Fuhua Jen;Moshe Shoham;Richard W. Longman	1996	I. J.

A procedure of designing a linear (decentralized) feedback control law which will stabilize a given symmetric composite system with uncertainty is presented by using the Riccati equation approach. A feature of the procedure is that the stabilizing control law can be conducted by solving two lower-order Riccati equations (or inequalities). The uncertainties considered in the systems may be time-varying. However, the values of the uncertainties are constrained to lie within some known admissible bounds.	feedback;optimal control	Guang-Hong yang;Si-Ying Zhang	1995	Automatica	10.1016/0005-1098(94)00135-6	control engineering;mathematical optimization;decentralised system;engineering;control system;riccati equation;control theory;feedback;mathematics;systems design	Robotics	71.72553209739468	-3.2371865932069825	73884

eeccd5de3a2a50be7cf83a4eaaba0c71c1d84640	analyzing the stability of switched systems using common zeroing-output systems	switches lyapunov methods switched systems stability analysis asymptotic stability trajectory linear systems	This paper introduces the notion of common zeroing-output systems (CZOS) to analyze the stability of switched systems. The concept of CZOS allows one to verify weak zero-state detectability. It characterizes a common behavior of any individual subsystem when the output signal for each subsystem is “approaching” zero. Heuristically speaking, it removes the effect of switching behavior, and thus enables one to analyze stability properties in systems with complex switching signals. With the help of CZOS, the Krasovskii–LaSalle theorem can be extended to switched nonlinear time-varying systems with both arbitrary switching and more general restricted switching cases. For switched nonlinear time-invariant systems, the needed detectability condition is further simplified, leading to several new stability results. Particularly, when a switched linear time-invariant system is considered, it is possible to generate a recursive method, which combines a Krasovskii–LaSalle result and a nested Matrosov result, to find a CZOS if it exists. The power of the proposed CZOS is demonstrated by consensus problems in literature to obtain a stronger convergence result with weaker conditions.	consensus (computer science);heuristic;linear time-invariant theory;nonlinear system;recursion;time complexity;time-invariant system	Ti-Chung Lee;Ying Tan;Iven M.

We consider two-version tasks composed of a mandatory and an optional part to be scheduled according to the FC-RMS. In FC-RMS, the controller provides a feedback strategy for deciding about the execution or rejection of the optional sub-tasks. By modeling the task execution times as random variables, we first find the statistical model of FC-RMS and then we design a pure optimal controller and an optimal controller with feedforward integral compensation. The comparison of these two schemes with common Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller highlights the benefit of the optimal scheme with integral compensation. The results are demonstrated through the real implementation of FC-RMS on RT-Linux.	active directory rights management services;aperiodic graph;control theory;feedback;feedforward neural network;integral cryptanalysis;linux;optimal control;overshoot (signal);pid;rtlinux;rate-monotonic scheduling;real-time transcription;rejection sampling;scheduling (computing);settling time;statistical model;windows rt	Tolga Ayav;Giancarlo Ferrari-Trecate	2005		10.1007/11569596_91	pid controller;real-time computing;computer science;control theory;separation principle	Embedded	71.32268196283687	-6.894813699606767	74447

In this paper, several multi-scroll chaotic attractors are generated from a five-term system by adding a piecewise linear function. Moreover, some basic properties in terms of symmetry and dissipation, equilibrium points, eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrices, Lyapunov exponent spectrum, bifurcation diagram, and Poincare map are studied. In particular, an analog circuit is designed to implement the proposed multi-scroll attractors, which are different from the traditional attractors. Furthermore, an integrated circuit diagram is designed to realize the fractional-order multi-scroll attractors. Finally, the performed experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis, and our work lends itself to many potential applications in engineering. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley u0026 Sons, Ltd.

These models belong to a class of dynamical systems called Variable Structure Systems (VSS). From a classical design point of view, it is of interest to know the dynamical behavior of the system when some parameters are varied. Usually, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is adopted to control a DC–DC converter. When this kind of control is used, the resulting mathematical model is nonautonomous and periodic. In this case, the global Poincaré map (stroboscopic map) gives all the information about the system. The classical design in these electronic circuits is based on a stable periodic orbit which has some desired characteristics. In this paper, the main bifurcations which may undergo this orbit, when the parameters of the circuit change, are described. Moreover, it will be shown that in the three basic power electronic converters Buck, Boost and Buck–Boost, very similar scenarios are obtained. Also, some kinds of secondary bifurcations which are of interest for the global dynamical behavior are presented. From a dynamical systems point of view, VSS analyzed in this work present some kinds of bifurcations which are typical in nonsmooth systems and it is impossible to find them in smooth systems.	bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;boost;chaos theory;dc-to-dc converter;diagram;diode;dynamical system;electronic circuit;hoc (programming language);hopf bifurcation;mathematical model;numerical analysis;numerical method;piecewise linear continuation;pulse-width modulation;quasiperiodicity;variable structure system	Luis Benadero;Abdelali El Aroudi;Gennaro Olivar;Eliezer Toribio;E.

We consider uncertain or ill-defined nonaffine nonlinear systems and employ a neural network (NN) with flexible structure, i.e., an online variation of the number of neurons. The NN approximates and adaptively cancels an unknown plant nonlinearity. A control law and adaptive laws for the weights in the hidden layer and output layer of the NN are established so that the whole closed-loop system is stable in the sense of Lyapunov. Moreover, the tracking error is guaranteed to be uniformly asymptotically stable (UAS) rather than uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) with the aid of an additional robustifying control term. The proposed control algorithm is relatively simple and requires no restrictive conditions on the design constants for the stability. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is shown through the simulation of a simple nonaffine nonlinear system.	algorithm;artificial neural network;control theory;controllers;lyapunov fractal;neural network simulation;neuron;nonlinear system;optimal control;round-off error;stable angina;uniformly-labeled [u-13c]glucose;unmanned aerial vehicle;weight	Jang-Hyun Park;Sung-Hoe Huh;Seong-Hwan Kim;Sam-Jun Seo;Gwi-Tae Park	2005	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks	10.1109/TNN.2004.841786	robust control;mathematical optimization;adaptive control;nonlinear system;lyapunov function;control theory;mathematics;tracking error;closed system;artificial neural network	Robotics	71.35622688337678	-5.0339866531680615	75232

The proposed method consists of the following three parts: (a) frequency-domain ICA with direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, (b) null beamforming based on the estimated DOA, and (c) integration of (a) and (b) based on the algorithm diversity in both iteration and frequency domain. The unmixing matrix obtained by ICA is temporally substituted by the matrix based on null beamforming through iterative optimization, and the temporal alternation between ICA and beamforming can realize fast- and high-convergence optimization. The results of the signal separation experiments reveal that the signal separation performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to that of the conventional ICA-based BSS method, even under reverberant conditions.	acoustic cryptanalysis;beamforming;blind signal separation;direction of arrival;emoticon;experiment;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;offline learning;online algorithm;online and offline;simulation;source separation;the matrix	Hiroshi Saruwatari;Toshiya Kawamura;Tsuyoki Nishikawa;Akinobu Lee;Kiyohiro Shikano	2006	IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TSA.2005.855832	speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;signal processing;mathematics;iterative method;beamforming;frequency domain;statistics	ML	78.35024943182356	-9.063481368502426	75331

The mixed time-delays are composed of discrete and distributed delays, both of which are mode-dependent. In addition, the distributed time-delays are characterized by the upper and lower bounds, both of which are mode-dependent. By constructing new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, a unified framework is established to derive sufficient conditions for the concerned systems to be globally exponentially stable in mean square.

Here, we introduce a notion of incremental stability for stochastic control systems and provide its description in terms of existence of a notion of so-called incremental Lyapunov functions. Moreover, we provide a backstepping controller design scheme providing controllers along with corresponding incremental Lyapunov functions rendering a class of stochastic control systems, namely, stochastic Hamiltonian systems with jumps, incrementally stable. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we design a controller making a spring pendulum system in a noisy environment incrementally stable.	control system;control theory;dynamical system;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerical stability;stochastic control	Pushpak Jagtap;Majid Zamani	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7799092	control engineering;stochastic process;mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;backstepping;control system;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	68.76393023509661	1.5574274599248028	76477

Each circuit can be identified without ambiguity from the Jacobian matrix of the system. Of special relevance are those circuits (or unions of disjoint circuits) that involve all the variables of the system. We call them """"nuclei"""" because, in the same way as, in Biology, the cell nucleus contains essential genetic information, in nonlinear dynamics, nuclei are crucial elements in the genesis of steady states. Indeed, each nucleus taken alone can generate one or more steady states, whose nature is determined by the sign patterns of the nucleus. There can be up to two nuclei in 2D systems, six in 3D systems, … n! in nD systems. However, many interesting systems of high dimensionality have only two, sometimes even one, nucleus. This paper is based on an extensive exploitation of the Jacobian matrix of systems, in order to figure the global structure of phase space. In nonlinear systems, the value, and often the sign, of terms of the Jacobian matrix depend on the location in phase space. In contrast with a current usage, we consider this matrix, as well as its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, not only in close vicinity of steady states of the system, but also everywhere in phase space. Two distinct, but complementary approaches are used here. In Sec. 2, we define frontiers that partition phase space according to the signs of the eigenvalues (or of their real part if they are complex), and where required, to the slopes of the eigenvectors. From then on, the exact nature of any steady state that might be present in a domain can be identified on the sole basis of its location in that domain and, in addition, one has at least an idea of the possible number of steady states. In Sec. 3, we use a more qualitative approach based on the theory of circuits. Here, phase space is partitioned according to the sign patterns of elements of the Jacobian matrix, more specifically, of the nuclei. We feel that this approach is more generic than that described in Sec. 2. Indeed, it provides a global view of the structure of phase space, and thus permits to infer much of the dynamics of the system by a simple analysis of sign patterns within the Jacobian matrix. This approach also turned out to be extremely useful for synthesizing systems with preconceived properties. For a wide variety of systems, once the partition process has been achieved, each domain comprises at most one steady state. We found, however, a family of systems in which two steady states (typically, two stable or two unstable nodes) differ by neither of the criteria we use, and are thus not separated by our partition processes. This counter-example implies non-polynomial functions. It is essential to realize that the frontier diagrams permit a reduction of the dimensionality of the analysis, because only those variables that are involved in nonlinearities are relevant for the partition process. Whatever the number of variables of a system, its frontier diagram can be drawn in two dimensions whenever no more than two variables are involved in nonlinearities. Pre-existing conjectures concerning the necessary conditions for multistationarity are discussed in terms of the partition processes."""	diagram	René Thomas;Marcelle Kaufman	2005	I. J.

The time delay is assumed to be time-varying. In such neural networks, the features of stochastic systems, interval systems, time-varying delay systems and Markovian switching are taken into account. The mathematical model of this kind of neural networks is first proposed. Secondly, the global exponential stability in the mean square is studied for the SIDANN with Markovian switching. Based on the Lyapunov method, several stability conditions are presented, which can be expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. As a subsequent result, the stochastic interval additive neural networks with time-varying delay are also discussed. A sufficient condition is given to determine its stability.

By employing the new formulation, random dropout rates are transformed into stochastic parameters in the system’s representation. A generalized     H    ∞    -norm for systems with stochastic parameters and both stochastic and deterministic inputs is derived. The stochastic     H    ∞    -norm of the filtering error is used as a criterion for filter design in the NCS framework. A set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is given to solve the corresponding filter design problem.

The stability domain of a steady state is completely characterized with respect to some characteristic parameters of the system, in the case of a neural network with ring or hub structure. These simplified connectivity structures play an important role in characterizing the network's dynamical behavior, allowing us to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the behavior of recurrent networks. Based on the stability analysis, we are able to identify the critical values of the fractional order for which Hopf bifurcations may occur. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings and to show potential routes towards the onset of chaotic behavior when the fractional order of the system increases.

After showing that optimal infinite horizon trajectories possess a uniform convergence property, we show that exponential stability may also be obtained with a sufficient horizon when an upper bound on the infinite horizon cost is used as terminal cost. Combining these important cases together with a sandwiching argument, we are able to conclude that exponential stability is obtained for input-constrained receding horizon schemes with a general nonnegative terminal cost for sufficiently long horizons. Region of attraction estimates are also included in each of the results.	dini derivative;exponential time hypothesis;horizon effect;nonlinear system;time complexity	Ali Jadbabaie;John Hauser	2005	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2005.846597	control engineering;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;control theory;mathematics;exponential stability;model predictive control	Robotics	70.17365433031284	-2.6536131685562383	78404

The parameter uncertainty belongs to a given convex polytope and the communication limitations include measurement quantization, signal transmission delay, and data packet dropout, which appear typically in a network environment. The problem of H infin  filter design is first solved for a nominal system subject to the aforementioned information limitations, which is then extended to the uncertain case based on the notion of quadratic stability. To further reduce the overdesign in the quadratic framework, this paper also proposes a parameter-dependent filter design procedure, which is much less conservative than the quadratic approach. The quadratic and parameter-dependent approaches provide alternatives for designing robust H infin  filters with different degrees of conservativeness and computational complexity. Two examples, including a mass-spring system, are utilized to illustrate the design procedures proposed in this paper.		Huijun Gao;Tongwen Chen	2007	IEEE Trans. Automat.

144edc7058e1f4264b21a55602a52cbe4e099d13	a new chaotic system with stable equilibrium: from theoretical model to circuit implementation		Recent evidences suggest that complex behavior such as chaos can be observed in a nonlinear system with stable equilibria. However, few studies have investigated chaotic systems with only one stable equilibrium. This paper introduces a new 3-D chaotic system having only one stable equilibrium. Dynamics of the new system are discovered by using phase portraits, basin of attraction, bifurcation diagram, and maximal Lyapunov exponents. It is interesting that the system has a state variable related with the freedom of offset boosting. In addition, we have investigated the anti-synchronization of the system via an adaptive control. Furthermore, the feasibility of the system is also discussed through presenting its electronic circuit implementation.	bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;chaos theory;computer simulation;electronic circuit;lyapunov fractal;maximal set;nonlinear system	Xiong Wang;Viet-Thanh Pham;Sajad Jafari;Christos K.

Constructive conditions are given that are necessary and sufficient for the stabilizability of systems which are periodic stabilizable. The conditions are in form of a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problemwhose solution provides the switching law and a family of state feedback gains stabilizing the system as well as a bound on the exponential decreasing rate.

Only recently has the idea of coherence gained more serious footing, particularly with the recent advances of finite-time studies of nonautonomous dynamical systems. Here we define shape coherent sets as a means to emphasize the intuitive notion of ensembles which “hold together” for some period of time, and we contrast this notion to other recent perspectives of coherence, notably “coherent pairs,” and likewise also to the geodesic theory of material lines. We will relate shape coherence to the differential geometry concept of curve congruence through matching curvatures. We show that points in phase space where there is a zero-splitting between stable and unstable foliations locally correspond to points where curvature will evolve only slowly in time. Then we develop curves of points with zero-angle, meaning nonhyperbolic splitting, by continuation methods in terms of the implicit function theorem. From this follows a simple ODE description of the boundaries of shape coherent sets. We will illustrate our method with popular benchmark examples and further investigate the intricate structure of foliation geometry.	benchmark (computing);coherence (physics);congruence of squares;continuation;control theory;dynamical system;in-phase and quadrature components;splitting circle method	Tian Ma;Erik M.

From an experimental point of view, the detection of flag chaotic dynamics were scarce, based on the flapping amplitude and the maximal Lyapunov exponent. In practice, tracking the flapping amplitude is difficult and flawed in the large oscillation limit. Also, computing the maximal Lyapunov exponent from time series of limited size requires strong assumptions on the attractor geometry, without getting insurance of their reliability. For bypassing these issues, (1) we use a time series which takes into account the whole dynamics of the flag, by using the flapping moment which integrates its displacements, and (2) we apply an algorithm of detection of chaos based on recurring values in time series.	algorithm;chaos theory;lyapunov fractal;maximal set;time series	Emmanuel Virot;Davide Faranda;Xavier Amandolese;Pascal Hémon	2017	I.

e3b565c52edfc8bb30c94d3f2a693ffb96ea3277	passivity analysis of markov jump bam neural networks with mode-dependent mixed time-delays via piecewise-constant transition rates		Passivity problem is studied for Markov jump bi-directional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with both mode-dependent mixed time delays and time-varying transition rates. In this paper, we consider both discrete delay and distributed delay which are all switching based on Markov process   r(t)     r  (  t  )       . Time-varying transition rates are, respectively, discussed under the cases of known transition rates and partly unknown transition rates. The mode-dependent time-varying character of transition rates is supposed to be piecewise-constant. By utilizing LMIs technique and a class of Lyapunov functionals, a switching delay passivity criterion underlying known transition rates is derived, which can be easily checked by the Matlab LMI Tool Box. Furthermore, we extend the result to passivity analysis of Markov jump BAM neural networks with partly unknown transition rates. The results obtained relate on not only switching discrete delays but also switching distributed delays. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the results.	artificial neural network;markov chain	He Zhang;Huihui Ji;Zhiyong Ye;Senping Tian	2016	J.

Under the proposed terminal sliding mode controller, the system states can be driven to reach the new terminal sliding mode manifold and stay on it forever, resulting in the convergence to equilibrium in a finite time.

The book should, however, also be of interest to (i) engineers who have a working knowledge of 'classical' control theory, but need to get into--or freshen up--multivariable state-space design, or (ii) practitioners who have no prior experience with controls software tools and who need a first introduction into the use such tools for state-space design. The book assumes only a basic familiarity with feedback control (equivalent to a single introduction-level controls course). All state-space concepts are introduced gradually as they are needed in the various design examples. The book even includes an Appendix with a brief refresher of the basic Linear Algebra concepts used throughout the text--although this Appendix would be inadequate to anyone totally unfamiliar with matrix theory it will certainly help the slightly rusty practitioner. The book also gives an introduction to the use of Computer-Aided Control System Design (CACSD) software for controller design. The book is sprinkled with design examples featuring the terminal output from the CACSD sessions. These examples are introduced with enough comments so that you do not really need any previous experience with the CACSD tools used to be able to understand them. This is not, however, a book suitable for controls practitioners wanting to improve their dexterity with various CACSD tools as the example sessions do not go beyond simple calls to pre-programmed algorithms. Moreover, much of the information on different CACSD tools is quite outdated. Time domain representations started to be used for control-system design in the early 1960's. Over the next decade or so researchers came up with a number of basic state-space methods for the time-domain, these methods eventually resulted in a first set of practical numerical algorithms for solving multivariable control problems. Although refined over the years, most of these methods and algorithms remain in use today and serve as a basis for control books such as the one reviewed here. If you got your formal education in the 1970's or earlier, chances are that your undergraduate controls courses focused on 'classical' frequency-based analysis and design (remember Bode and Nyquist?). Even if you got your education more recently, you might have had the bad luck of only coming into contact with 'classical' control concepts such as Bode diagrams and feedback through occasional side notes in circuit design and other electronics courses. If you belong to any of these two groups, or if you are still at the beginning of your formal controls education, this book is for you. The authors start with a brief but strong introductory section describing the evolution of modern multivariable"""	algorithm;book;circuit design;computer terminal;control system;control theory;diagram;feedback;linear algebra;numerical analysis;state space;systems design	Magnus Rimvall	1994	Automatica	10.1016/0005-1098(94)90041-8	mathematics	Graphics	69.79234151542997	-6.059773653076921	81393

An existing off-line robust MPC enables the on-line computation as simple as searching a state feedback gain among the look-up table. We consider enlarging the region of attraction of the off-line MPC by incorporating free perturbation items. First, a larger ellipsoidal region of attraction is off-line constructed, in which a simple optimization problem is solved on-line. Then, outside of this larger ellipsoid, a standard robust MPC is solved on-line such that the overall region of attraction can be rendered as a much larger nonellipsoidal one. The proposed approach possesses all the merits of the off-line MPC and greatly enlarges the region of attraction.

The key idea is to replace the LSS by a non-switched system with extended input and output vectors – called the envelope system – which is able to reproduce the dynamical behavior of the original LSS by applying a certain feedback law. The envelope system can be reduced using standard model order reduction schemes and then transformed back to an LSS. Furthermore, we present an upper bound for the output error of the reduced-order LSS and show how to preserve quadratic Lyapunov stability. The approach is tested by means of various numerical examples demonstrating the efficacy of the presented method.

Finite-time partial stability involves dynamical systems whose part of the trajectory converges to an equilibrium state in finite time. Since finite-time convergence implies non-uniqueness of system solutions in backward time, such systems possess non- Lipschitzian dynamics. In this paper, we address finite-time partial stability and uniform finite-time partial stability for nonlinear dynamical systems. Specifically, we provide Lyapunov conditions involving a Lyapunov function that is positive definite and decrescent with respect to part of the system state, and satisfies a differential inequality involving fractional powers for guaranteeing finite-time partial stability. In addition, we show that finite-time partial stability leads to uniqueness of solutions in forward time and we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for continuity of the settling-time function of the nonlinear dynamical system.	dynamical system;feedback;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;scott continuity;settling time;social inequality	Wassim M.

1c14e39465607865023d8decce4e2a3bc52e96fd	imusic: iterative music algorithm for joint sparse recovery with any rank	sparse recovery	We propose a robust and efficient algorithm for the recovery o f the jointly sparse support in compressed sensing with mult iple measurement vectors (the MMV problem). When the unknown mat rix of the jointly sparse signals has full rank, MUSIC is a guaranteed algorithm for this problem, achieving the funda mental algebraic bound on the minimum number of measurement s. We focus instead on the unfavorable but practically signific ant case of rank deficiency or bad conditioning. This situati on arises with limited number of measurements, or with highly correla t d signal components. In this case MUSIC fails, and in pract ice none of the existing MMV methods can consistently approach t he algebraic bounds. We propose iMUSIC, which overcomes the se limitations by combining the advantages of both existing me thods and MUSIC. It is a computationally efficient algorithm with a performance guarantee. I. I NTRODUCTION Compressed sensing addresses the reconstruction of a spars e ignal from its linear measurements, fewer than the number of unknowns. Algorithms and theory have been developed to solv e this underdetermined inverse problem with the sparsity pr or on the solution. The single measurement vector (SMV) proble m corresponds to the reconstruction of a single sparse signa l. The multiple measurement vectors (MMV) problem addresses t h joint reconstruction of N jointly sparse signals, which share a common support, from their N measurement vectors obtained with a common measurement mat rix. Let X0 ∈ Kn×N 1 denote a matrix with jointly sparse columns. Then, the joint reconstruction from MMV can be formulated as an inverse problemY = AX with a matrix variableX ∈ Kn×N whereY ∈ K denotes the multiple measurements Y = AX0 obtained with measurement matrix A ∈ Km×n. The set of indices of the nonzero rows of X0 is called the row support ofX0. Various applications can be formulated as MMV problems. In t he mid 1990’s, Bresler and Feng introduced “spectrumblind sampling” [1], [2] – the first compressed sampling sche me and theory. Their scheme enables sub-Nyquist minimum-ra te sampling and perfect reconstruction of multi-band signals ( nalog or discrete, in one or more dimensions) with unknown but sparse spectral support. They reduced the spectrum-blind r econstruction problem to a finite-dimensional MMV problem. Rao et al. (cf. [3], and the references therein) introduced an MMV form ulation and methods for the recovery of sparse brain excitations. Malioutovet al. posed the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation problem as a MMV problem [4]. For the typically small number of sources in this problem, the indicator funct ion of the quantized angles can be modeled to be sparse. Reconstruction Algorithms have been developed to exploit t he joint support structure in the MMV problem. Bresler and Feng proposed to use MUSIC [5] for the case where the nonzero r ows ofX0 have full rank [1], [2], [6]. They also proposed methods based on a greedy search (a normalized version of ort hog nal matching pursuit), on alternating projections, an d o approximate dynamic programming. Malioutov et al. proposedl1-SVD, which relaxes the combinatorial support recovery problem to a cost penalized by a mixed norm [4]. Inspired by the successful algorithms for the SMV case in com pressed sensing, analogous algorithms have been proposed and analyzed for the MMV case. These include extension of bas is pursuit to mixed norm minimization, [7], and of SMV best s-sparse solvers such as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) a nd FOCUSS to the MMV case [8], [7], [9]. Although MMV algorithms empirically performed better than their SMV cou nterparts, the improvement owing to the joint reconstructi on has not yet been theoretically quantified. Under a favorable setting where the matrix composed of the no nzer rows ofX0 has full rank, MUSIC is guaranteed to recover the joint support and hence achieves the so called al g braic bound. However, if the number of measurement vector sN is smaller than the sparsity level s, then no more thanN rows ofX0 can be linearly independent, and rank deficiency might arise. In other applications, such as spectrum blind sampli ng or the DOA problem, N can be large or even infinite. Even in this case though, the rank might be smaller than s or the condition number of the submatrix of nonzero rows of X0 can be very large. For example, the condition number of the nonzero rows ofX0 in the DOA problem can be large due to coherence between the sources or the multi-path effect. Under these un favorable settings, existing MMV algorithms do not achieve th algebraic bound. We propose a new robust and efficient algorithm, iMUSIC (Iter a ive MUSIC Algorithm) to recover the joint support in the MMV problem. It is robust against rank deficiency and/or i ll-conditioning, its computational requirements are simi lar to This work was supported in part by NSF grant No. CCF 06-35234. 1 Throughout,K will denote the scalar field.

A novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed, where triple integral terms are used and a secondary delay-partition approach (SDPA) is employed. Compared with the existing delay-partition approaches, the proposed approach can exploit more information on the time-delay intervals. By taking full advantage of a modified Wirtinger's integral inequality (MWII), improved delay-dependent stability criteria are derived, which guarantee the existence of desired state estimator for delayed neural networks (DNNs). A better estimator gain matrix is obtained in terms of the solution of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In addition, a new activation function dividing method is developed by bringing in some adjustable parameters. Three numerical examples with simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed methods.	artificial neural network	Kaibo Shi;Xinzhi Liu;Yuanyan Tang;Hong Zhu;Shouming Zhong	2016	Inf.

While minimum-dwell time results require the subsystems to be asymptotically stable, mode-dependent dwell-time results can consider unstable subsystems and dwell-times within a, possibly unbounded, range of values. The proposed approach is related to Lyapunov looped-functionals, a new type of functionals leading to stability conditions affine in the system matrices, unlike standard results for minimum dwell-time. These conditions are expressed as infinite-dimensional LMIs which can be solved using recent polynomial optimization techniques such as sum-of-squares. The specific structure of the conditions is finally utilized in order to derive dwell-time stability results for uncertain switched systems. Several examples illustrate the efficiency of the approach.	affine scaling;control theory;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;polynomial	Corentin Briat;Alexandre Seuret	2013	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2012.2220031	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Embedded	68.80632349843663	0.8372329099210912	83005

Here the mixed time-varying delays contain both discrete and distributed time-varying delays. Based on a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional combined with a zero equation, a suitable ( H_{infty } ) filter is obtained for the static neural networks model. The filter can be solved by a linear matrix inequality (LMI). Two numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed method. In addition, the obtained filter can be applied to design the control systems with delays.	filter design;neural networks	Guoquan Liu;Shumin Zhou;Xianxi Luo;Keyi Zhang	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-42294-7_10	real-time computing;control theory	EDA	71.62181397866827	1.2508837597510178	83716

Firstly, some sufficient conditions for the exponential stability and weighted H∞ disturbance attenuation performance of the underlying system are derived via the average dwell time approach. Then, based on the obtained results, a state feedback controller design is proposed to guarantee that the resulting closed-loop system is exponentially stable and achieves a prescribed disturbance attenuation level γ. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. & 2013 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1a478a88bff5d42ec6b65636cedee452097c12e3	a new 4d hyperchaotic system with high complexity		In chaos engineering, especially for chaos-based communication, chaotic systems require high complex, strong robustness and well-distributed bandwidth. In this paper, we present a new four-dimensional (4D) hyperchaotic system, which satisfies these three significant properties at the same time. Instead of traditional evaluation method of the positive Lyapunov exponents, the complexity of the system is measured by the topological entropy. We find out that it has much larger topological entropy and Kaplan-Yorke dimension compared with the systems reported before, therefore it may have better engineering application value.	bifurcation theory;chaos theory;dynamical system;encryption;hausdorff dimension;kaplan–meier estimator;lyapunov fractal;topological entropy	Lijuan Chen;Song Tang;Qingdu Li;Shouming Zhong	2018	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/j.matcom.2017.10.002	topological entropy;mathematics;robustness (computer science);mathematical optimization;lyapunov exponent;bandwidth (signal processing);control theory	DB	73.33294430454507	0.4776469918981801	83923

The motivation for considering this problem is provided by wireless networked control systems and control of nonlinear systems under asynchronous measurement sampling. In order to regulate the state of the system towards an equilibrium point while minimizing a given performance index, we propose a Lyapunov-based model predictive controller which is designed taking data losses explicitly into account, both in the optimization problem formulation and in the controller implementation. The proposed controller allows for an explicit characterization of the stability region and guarantees that this region is an invariant set for the closed-loop system under data losses, if the maximum time in which the loop is open is shorter than a given constant that depends on the parameters of the system and the Lyapunov-based controller that is used to formulate the optimization problem. The theoretical results are demonstrated through a chemical process example.	control system;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;sampling (signal processing)	David Muñoz de la Peña;Panagiotis D.

No. WO87/00363 PCT Pub. Date Jan. 15, 1987.A control circuit for an electric motor is proposed, whose rate of rotation and rotational direction depends on a control signal (Ue) at the input terminal (10). The rotational direction is given by means of a determined control signal level being exceeded or fallen short of. The rate of rotation is controlled by means of a pulse width modulation of the control signal (Ue). There is a nonlinear relationship between the change in the pulse duty factor of the pulse width modulation and the control signal. The mean adjusting speed of an actuating motor accordingly adapts to the control deviation signal of an actuating control.

Three global smooth time-varying control laws are proposed with the aid of different techniques. The first proposed control law makes the state of the closed-loop system asymptotically converge to zero, while the second and the third control laws make the state of the closed-loop system globally exponentially converge to zero. Moreover, the exponential convergence rate of the state of the closed-loop system can be arbitrarily assigned with the third control law. Simulation results show that the proposed control laws are effective.	control theory;converge;optimal control;rate of convergence;simulation;time complexity;underactuation	Wenjie Dong;Yi Guo	2005	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2005.849248	control engineering;mathematical optimization;convergence;nonlinear control;stability;underactuation;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	71.34863892898494	-4.810249005029488	84978

It is found that Hopf bifurcation occurs when these parameters pass through some critical values where the conditions for local asymptotical stability of the equilibrium are not satisfied. By analyzing the characteristic equation and using the frequency domain method, the existence of Hopf bifurcation is proved. The stability of bifurcating periodic solutions is determined by the harmonic balance approach, Nyquist criterion, and graphic Hopf bifurcation theorem. Moreover, a critical condition is derived under which the stability is not guaranteed, thus a necessary and sufficient condition for ensuring the local asymptotical stability is well understood, and from which the essential dynamics of the delayed neural network are revealed. Finally, numerical results are given to verify the theoretical analysis, and some interesting phenomena are observed and reported.	anatomic bifurcation;artificial neural network;asymptote;bifurcation theory;biological neural networks;harmonic balance;hopf bifurcation;numerical analysis;nyquist rate;nyquist stability criterion;recurrent neural network;solutions	Wenwu Yu;Jinde Cao;Guanrong Chen	2008	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks	10.1109/TNN.2007.912589	infinite-period bifurcation;mathematical optimization;transcritical bifurcation;computer science;period-doubling bifurcation;recurrent neural network;machine learning;biological applications of bifurcation theory;calculus;control theory;mathematics;bifurcation theory;saddle-node bifurcation;frequency domain;artificial neural network;hopf bifurcation;bifurcation diagram	ML	75.61680276134877	2.207938854983932	84992
264dceea03e7f17f8c6797443dc7b3f166e79a8b	delay compensated control of the stefan problem		This paper presents a control design for the one-phase Stefan problem under actuator delay via a backstepping method. The Stefan problem represents a liquid-solid phase change phenomenon which describes the time evolution of a material's temperature profile and the interface position. The actuator delay is modeled by a first-order hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE), resulting in a cascaded transportdiffusion PDE system defined on a time-varying spatial domain described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Two nonlinear backstepping transformations are utilized for the control design. The setpoint restriction is given by the initial internal energy of the physical system and the stored energy injected by past input heat arising from the delay initial condition, which guarantees a physical constraint on the proposed controller for the melting process. This constraint ensures the exponential convergence of the moving interface to a setpoint and the exponential stability of the temperature equilibrium profile and the delayed controller in the H1 norm.	control theory;first-order predicate;initial condition;nonlinear system;setpoint (control system);simulation;time complexity	Shumon Koga;Miroslav Krstic	2017	2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2017.8263826	initial value problem;stefan problem;control theory;backstepping;time evolution;setpoint;control theory;hyperbolic partial differential equation;computer science;exponential stability	Robotics	76.79848527056059	0.4885725224457521	85271

The model has the form of a ring oscillator and includes only three couplings, which is considered to be one of minimal chaotic neural networks. Chaotic oscillations emerge through the cascades of period-doubling bifurcations when the strength of at least one coupling differs from the others.

A triple parameter estimation scheme consisting of ELS, RPE and a hybrid of the two, denoted HPE, is proposed, The purpose of the HPE scheme is to permit information flow from the ELS to RPE algorithms so as to effectively project RPE into a stability domain, and to have it avoid local prediction error index minima that are not the global minimum,	algorithm;estimation theory;extreme loading for structures;least squares;maxima and minima;recursion;state space	John B.

In the original dual-stage servo control approach, micro-actuator saturation was addressed using the Circle Criterion to guide the controller design. However, such an approach does not allow the fine-tuning of seeking and settling speeds and also limits the class of linear controllers for the secondary loop due to the Circle Criterion. Anti-windup compensation removes many of these limitations and improves settling duration, disturbance rejection, recovery from saturation in the secondary actuator loop, and design flexibility. A general anti-windup (AW) compensator is presented in discrete time bringing together a number of AW concepts and results previously given in continuous time. Robustness is taken into account and performance requirements are expressed via frequency weights.

5c2c08108b95deb069aca4b1c32dbfd7c31750d5	hidden oscillations in aircraft flight control system with input saturation		Abstract   The presence of actuator saturation can dramatically degrade the system performance. Since the feedback loop is broken when the actuator saturates the unstable modes of the regulator may then drift to undesirable values. The consequences are that undesired nonlinear oscillations appear and that the settling time may unacceptably increase. Rigorous analysis of nonlinear aircraft models is a very difficult task, that is why a numerical simulation is often used as an analysis and design tool. In this paper difficulties of numerical analysis related to the existence of hidden oscillations in the aircraft control system are demonstrated.	control system	Boris R. Andrievsky;Nikolay V.

However, most of them assume that the delays are constant. Th is paper considers time-varying, possibly unbounded, delays and establishes asymptotic stability an d bounds the decay rate of a significant class of nonlinear positive systems which includes positive line ar systems as a special case. Specifically, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for delay-inde pendent stability of continuous-time positive systems whose vector fields are cooperative and homogeneous . We show that global asymptotic stability of such systems is independent of the magnitude and variatio n of the time delays. For various classes of time delays, we are able to derive explicit expressions that qu ntify the decay rates of positive systems. We also provide the corresponding counterparts for discret e-time positive systems whose vector fields are non-decreasing and homogeneous.	nonlinear system;positive systems	Hamid Reza Feyzmahdavian;Themistoklis Charalambous;Mikael Johansson	2014	SIAM J.

Nicola and S.A. Campbell, J. Comput. Neurosci., 35 (2013), pp. 87–108]. The mean field system for a network of neurons with spike frequency adaptation is typically a pair of differential equations for the mean adaptation and synaptic gating variable of the network. These differential equations are nonsmooth, and, in particular, are piecewise smooth continuous (PWSC). Here, we analyze the smooth and nonsmooth bifurcation structure of these equations and show that the system is organized around a pair of co-dimension-two bifurcations that involve, respectively, the collision between a Hopf equilibrium point and a switching manifold, and a saddle-node equilibrium point and a switching manifold. These two co-dimension-two bifurcations can coalesce into a co-dimension-three nonsmooth bifurcation. As the mean field system we study is a nongeneric piecewise smooth continuous system, we discuss possible regularizations of this system and how the bifurcations which occur are related to nonsmooth bifurcations displayed by generic PWSC systems.	action potential;bifurcation theory;biological neuron model;null (sql);synaptic package manager	Wilten Nicola;Sue Ann Campbell	2016	SIAM J.

By taking the control input as a function of system states, we can transform the stabilization design into a stability problem. The known stability results on the nonlinear autonomous system are then employed to derive the asymptotically stabilizing controllers by solving an algebraic equation. Existence conditions of the asymptotic stabilizing feedback controller for the driftless systems by employing the stability criteria on linear systems and a class of third-order homogeneous systems are obtained to demonstrate the application of the approach.

First, the concept of the Filippov solution is extended to functional differential equations with discontinuous right-hand sides and mixed delays via functional differential inclusions. The global dissipativity of the Filippov solution to the considered BAM neural networks is proven using generalized Halanay inequalities and matrix measure approaches. Second, to realize global exponential complete synchronization of BAM neural networks with multivariate discontinuous activations, discontinuous state feedback controllers are designed using functional differential inclusions theory and nonsmooth analysis theory with generalized Lyapunov functional method.

This system is dealt with in spite of the fact that quadrature signals can be generated by a simple two-phase oscillator. the latter generates only two of the signals needed in a four-phase system. the rest of the phases signals could nevertheless be obtained by inventing the originally existing signals. It appears, however, that for certain applications the generation of all four signals in a completely cyclic and symmetrical manner (the one described here) is preferable. It is envisaged that one such application is related to recent methods of actively feeding phased array antennas, where each element in the array is connected to an appropriate oscillator phase stage.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Most of the paper deals with the development of an appropriate generator model. the non-linear oscillator dynamics is treated comprehensively. the peculiar behaviour associated with the limit cycle dynamics and with other manifestations of the system dynamics is investigated.

As a result, it is believed that the system with certain additions may reveal chaotic dynamic behaviour. the realization of the system in electronic hardware is also discussed.		B. Z. Kaplan;D.

The main idea is to construct new piecewise time-varying Lyapunov functionals/functions such that they are decreasing at switching time instants in spite of their discontinuity at those switching time instants. Then the constructed piecewise time-varying Lyapunov functionals/functions are used to derive sufficient conditions for the existence of delay-independent minimum dwell time, which guarantee the exponential stability of switched delay systems for any bounded delays. The theoretical findings are validated by an illustrative example.	lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;reflections of signals on conducting lines;switching time;time complexity	Wu-Hua Chen;Wei Xing Zheng	2010	49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2010.5717020	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;exponential stability	Embedded	69.20060338673814	0.5478936812980604	88729

Similarly to the corresponding continuous-time results these conditions provide an efficient tool for analysis and synthesis of linear systems with time delay.

Based on the geometrical configuration of activation functions, the phase space R(n) can be divided into several Φη-type subsets. Accordingly, a new set of regions Ωη are proposed, and rigorous mathematical analysis is provided to derive the existence of equilibrium point and its local μ-stability in each Ωη. It concludes that the n-dimensional neural networks can exhibit at least 3(n) equilibrium points and 2(n) of them are μ-stable. Furthermore, due to the compatible property, a set of new conditions are presented to address the dynamics in the remaining 3(n)-2(n) subset regions. As direct applications of these results, we can get some criteria on the multiple exponential stability, multiple power stability, multiple log-stability, multiple log-log-stability and so on. In addition, the approach and results can also be extended to the neural networks with K-level nonlinear activation functions and unbounded time-varying delays, in which there can store (2K+1)(n) equilibrium points, (K+1)(n) of them are locally μ-stable. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our results.

Relied on the use of auxiliary matrices and a positive scalar, a novel necessary and sufficient condition for the bounded real lemma is derived for discrete-time singular systems. The characterization is reduced to a strict linear matrix inequality (LMI) when the scalar is fixed, and the resulting LMI is non-conservative as long as the scalar is chosen sufficiently large. Moreover, the result is further expanded to H∞ controller design, and a numerically efficient and reliable design procedure is given. Since no particular restriction is imposed on the auxiliary matrices, the proposed result outperforms the existing methods in the literature. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the present result.	feedback;linear matrix inequality;linear time-invariant theory;numerical analysis;numerical method;robust control;social inequality;time complexity;time-invariant system	Yu Feng;Mohamed Yagoubi	2013	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2013.2256051	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;reliability;control theory;mathematics;matrix decomposition;hidden markov model;symmetric matrix	Robotics	69.07992883549038	0.6284333209015651	89085

Our method first transforms a recurrence plot into a figure of a reduced number of points yet preserving the main and fundamental recurrence properties of the original plot. This resulting figure is then reinterpreted as a complex network, which is further characterized by network statistical measures. We illustrate the computational power of RDE-CN approach by time series by both the logistic map and experimental fluid flows, which show that our method distinguishes different dynamics sufficiently well as the traditional recurrence analysis. Therefore, the proposed methodology characterizes the recurrence matrix adequately, while using a reduced set of points from the original recurrence plots.	time series	Diego G. de B.

In applying QFT to design robust feedback control systems, the generation of plant templates is an essential step. For a system with affinely dependent parameters and the parameter domain is a box, it is well known that the boundary of a plant template is included in the image of the set of edges of the parameter domain box. One can obtain the plant template from the image of the set of edges. However, this approach to the generation of the plant template leads to heavy computational burden since it wastes much computational effort computing the images of points on edges which lie in the interior of the plant template. In this paper, an efficient algorithm is proposed to identify, from an edge of the parameter domain box, the set of parameter points whose image lies in the interior of the plant template. The computational burden for generating the plant template thus can be obviously reduced by eliminating the identified sets of parameter points in the plant template generation procedure. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.		Shih-Feng Yang	2009	J.

The entropy of a curve, first introduced within the theory of thermodynamics of plane curves, has been used to quantify the irregularity of a curve. This paper extends the concept to higher dimensions and provides an algorithmic procedure to evaluate the entropy of a curve evolving in the phase space according to the equations of a dynamical system. The thermodynamic indicator is eventually used to infer some properties about the dynamical system. In particular, according to the proposed indicator, all linear systems evolve at entropy zero, while higher entropies characterise nonlinear systems, leading to an effective criterion for their classification.	dynamical system;linear system;nonlinear system	Aldo Balestrino;Andrea Caiti;Emanuele Crisostomi;Giorgio Grioli	2008	2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2008.4738723	entropy;linear dynamical system;mathematical optimization;joint entropy;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;dynamical systems theory;binary entropy function;transfer entropy;nonlinear system;maximum entropy probability distribution;principle of maximum entropy;dynamical system;control theory;measure-preserving dynamical system;mathematics;recurrence period density entropy;maximum entropy thermodynamics;joint quantum entropy;configuration entropy;linear system;maximum entropy spectral estimation;entropy rate;entropy	Robotics	80.03893851958976	3.9341245504330575	89381

These correspond to homoclinic orbits in the phase space of the equation, and the possible pulse types are studied in some detail. Sufficiently close to the conditions under which a homoclinic orbit exists, the solutions take the form of trains of well-separated pulses. A measure of closeness to homoclinic conditions provides a small parameter for the development of an asymptotic solution consisting of superposed, isolated pulses. The solvability condition in the resulting singular perturbation theory is a timing map relating successive pulse spacings. This map of the real line onto itself, together with the known form of the homoclinic orbit, provides a concise and accurate solution of the equation.		Neil J. Balmforth;Glenn R. Ierley;Edward A.

The SO can be implemented in parallel with awide range of ‘‘performancebased’’ adaptive control laws, i.e., adaptive control laws that seek to improve closed-loop performance, but may be susceptible to instability in the presence of unaccounted model uncertainty. In this architecture, the performance-based adaptive control law designates candidate controllers based on performance considerations, while the SO supervises this selection based upon online robust stability considerations. A particular selection of a performance-based adaptive control law is not specified. Rather, this selection can be from a wide range of adaptive control schemes. This paper provides stability proofs for the SO architecture and presents a simulation that illustrates the applicability of the proposed method. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore a novel integration operator and the differentiation rule for fractional systems is presented. The identification is exact in that no approximations of the novel operator are used.

The new control scheme is characterized by a discrete-time integral sliding manifold which inherits the desired properties of the continuous-time integral sliding manifold, such as full order sliding manifold with pole assignment, and elimination of the reaching phase. In particular, comparing with existing discrete-time sliding-mode control, the new scheme is able to achieve more precise tracking performance. It will be shown in this work that, the new control scheme achieves O(T2) steady-state error for state regulation with the widely adopted delay-based disturbance estimation. Another desirable feature is, the proposed DISMC prevents the generation of overlarge control actions due to deadbeat response, which is usually inevitable due to the existence of poles at the origin for a reduced order sliding manifold designed for sampled-data systems.

LQG-balanced realizations are those for which the optimal cost operator for the system and its dual system are equal (and diagonal). The class of systems we consider is that of distributional resolvent linear systems which includes well-posed linear systems as a subclass. We prove the existence of LQG-balanced realizations under a finite cost condition for both the system and its dual system. We also show that an LQG-balanced realization of a well-posed transfer function is well-posed. We further show that approximately controllable and observable LQG-balanced realizations are unique up to a unitary state-space transformation. Finally, we show that the spectrum of the product of the optimal cost operator of a system and its dual system is independent of the particular realization. Our method of proof shows the connections with coprime factorizations, Lyapunov-balanced realizations, and discrete-time systems. The main reason for studying LQG-balanced realizations is that truncated LQG-balanced realizations provide a good approximation of the original system. We show that, under certain conditions, this is also true in the infinite-dimensional case by proving an error bound in the gap-metric.	approximation;distributional semantics;linear system;lyapunov fractal;observable;resolution (logic);state space;transfer function;well-posed problem	Mark R.

We show that practical uniform global asymptotic stability (pUGAS) is equivalent to the existence of a bounded uniformly globally weakly attractive set. This result is valid for a wide class of distributed parameter systems, including time-delay systems, switched systems, many classes of PDEs and evolution differential equations in Banach spaces. We apply our results to show that existence of a non-coercive Lyapunov function ensures pUGAS for this class of systems. For ordinary differential equations with uniformly bounded disturbances, the concept of uniform weak attractivity is equivalent to the well-known notion of weak attractivity.

Sufficient and necessary conditions for preserving stability, for all small enough values of delay and @e, are obtained in two cases: in the case of delay proportional to @e and in the case of independent delay and @e. In the second case, the sufficient conditions are given in terms of an LMI. A delay-dependent LMI criterion for the stability of singularly perturbed differential-difference systems is derived.

a74b482508546e92fcdcdbd9a7ec89120b4b6c71	asymptotic stability of markovian switching genetic regulatory networks with leakage and mode-dependent time delays		The problem of stability analysis of Markovian switching genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) with leakage and mode-dependent time-varying delays along Brownian motions is reported here. The GRNs are composed of   N     N        modes which switches from one mode to another according to a Markov chain with known transition probabilities. The regulatory functions of GRNs are assumed to be sector-like nonlinear functions. By applying delay-fractioning approach, the sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the stability of Markovian switching GRNs with leakage and mode-dependent time-varying delays in the mean-square sense. Also, the corresponding results are obtained for the GRNs without leakage delays. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results, repressilator model of  Escherichia coli  is analyzed in the end.	gene regulatory network;spectral leakage	Kuru Ratnavelu;M.

This paper deals with a state observation problem when the dynamic model of a plant contains uncertainties or it is completely unknown. Differential neural network (NN) approach is applied in this uninformative situation but with activation functions described by wavelets. A new learning law, containing an adaptive adjustment rate, is suggested to imply the stability condition for the free parameters of the observer. Nominal weights are adjusted during the preliminary training process using the least mean square (LMS) method. Lyapunov theory is used to obtain the upper bounds for the weights dynamics as well as for the mean squared estimation error. Two numeric examples illustrate this approach: first, a nonlinear electric system, governed by the Chua's equation and second the Lorentz oscillator. Both systems are assumed to be affected by external perturbations and their parameters are unknown.

Some necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for the global stabilization of BCNs by SDSFC. Different from conventional state feedback controls, new phenomena observed the study of SDSFC. Based on the controllability matrix, we derive some necessary and sufficient conditions under which the trajectories of BCNs can be stabilized to a fixed point by piecewise constant control (PCC). It is proved that the global stabilization of BCNs under SDSFC is equivalent to that by PCC. Moreover, algorithms are given to construct the sampled-data state feedback controllers. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the obtained results.	algorithm;boolean;control theory;feedback;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point number;numerical linear algebra;numerical method;portable c compiler;sampling - surgical action;turing completeness	Yang Liu;Jinde Cao;Liangjie Sun;Jianquan Lu	2016	Neural Computation	10.1162/NECO_a_00819	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	70.50334174826712	0.3406873839984889	90973

A switched delay system model is obtained based on the event-time-driven scheme. To solve the stability problem of the new NCS model, a new approach based on the Lyapunov functional exponential estimation method is introduced. By using this method, sufficient conditions are developed to guarantee exponential stability of the considered system. The results obtained may be less conservative than the existing ones from the perspective of maximum allowable transfer interval because the unavailable time is considered in this article.

The stability of equilibria and the existence of Hopf bifurcations are considered. The explicit formulas determining the direction, stability and period of the bifurcating periodic solutions are obtained by employing the normal form theory and the center manifold theorem. Numerical simulations and experimental results are given to verify the theoretical analysis. Hopf bifurcation analysis can explain andpredict the periodic orbit in the chaotic system with direct time delay feedback. We also find that the control law can be applied to the chaotic system only with two stable node-foci for the purpose of control and anti-control of chaos.

The first, integral sliding mode control, is used to compensate for the disturbance/uncertainty, which is unmatched by the second control. The second sliding mode control is designed to achieve the stabilization of the harmonic oscillator system while the system is in the integral sliding mode. The first (integral) and second sliding mode controls are implemented in both formats: traditional sliding mode control that requires high-frequency oscillating control action and second-order sliding mode (super-twisting) control that is continuous and provides for the higher accuracy of stabilization. It is shown that the output of the double-fold sliding mode controlled second-order harmonic oscillator is robust to bounded disturbances and model parameter uncertainties. Computer simulations are performed to manifest the theoretical analysis. r 2009 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Fractional controllers can increase the stability and robustness. Regardless of advantages of fractional controllers, they are still not common in congestion control in TCP networks. The network parameters are time-varying, so the robust stability is important in congestion controller design. Therefore, we focused on the robust controller design. The fractional PID controller is developed based on active queue management (AQM). D-partition technique is used. The most important property of designed controller is the robustness to the time-varying parameters of the TCP network. The vertex quasi-polynomials of the closed-loop characteristic equation are obtained, and the stability boundaries are calculated for each vertex quasi-polynomial.

It achieves finite time convergence by means of a continuous action, without using information about derivatives of the sliding constraint. Thus, chattering associated to traditional sliding-mode observers and controllers is reduced. The stability and finite-time convergence analysis have been jointly addressed from different points of view, most of them based on the use of scaling symmetries (homogeneity), or non-smooth Lyapunov functions. Departing from these approaches, in this contribution we decouple the stability analysis problem from that of finite-time convergence. A nonlinear change of coordinates and a time-scaling are used. In the new coordinates and time–space, the transformed system is stabilized using any appropriate standard design method. Conditions under which the combination of the nonlinear coordinates transformation and the time-scaling is a stability preserving map are given. Provided convergence in the transformed space is faster than O(1/τ)—where τ is the transformed time— convergence of the original system takes place in finite-time. The method is illustrated by designing a generalized super-twisting observer able to cope with a broad class of perturbations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Different from the prior research works, the effects of both variation range and probability distribution of the time delay are involved in the proposed method. First, a modeling method is proposed by translating the probability distribution of the time delay into parameter matrices of the transformed DRNN model, where the delay is characterized by a stochastic binary distributed variable. Based on the new method, the global exponential stability in the mean square sense for the DRNNs with stochastic delay is investigated by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and exploiting some new analysis techniques. A numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed method.	artificial neural network;bernoulli polynomials;broadcast delay;lyapunov fractal;mean squared error;neural networks;numerical analysis;recurrent neural network;stochastic process;time complexity	Dong Yue;Yijun Zhang;Engang Tian;Chen Peng	2008	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks	10.1109/TNN.2008.2000166	probability distribution;stochastic process;mathematical optimization;computer science;recurrent neural network;machine learning;calculus;control theory;mathematics;exponential stability;artificial neural network;statistics	Robotics	73.59755012313974	0.8005027238451098	93243

1f642fd0a9910d8a60e0d74b0bd9350dbef11bff	a new approach to adaptive control: no nonlinearities	model reference control;linear time varying control;adaptive control;time varying parameter;linear time varying;first order;model uncertainty;model matching;linear time invariant;asymptotic behaviour;uncertain system	In adaptive control the goal is to design a controller to control an uncertain system whose parameters may be changing with time. Typically the controller consists of an identi-er (or tuner) which is used to adjust the parameters of a linear time-invariant (LTI) compensator, and under suitable assumptions on the plant model uncertainty it is proven that good asymptotic behaviour is achieved, such as model matching (for minimum phase systems) or stability. However, a typical adaptive controller does not track time-varying parameters very well, and it is often highly nonlinear, which can result in undesirable behaviour, such as large transients or a large control signal. Furthermore, most adaptive controllers provide only asymptotic tracking, with no ability to design for a pre-speci-ed settling time. Here we propose an alternative approach, which yields a linear periodic controller. Rather than estimating the plant or compensator parameters, instead we estimate what the control signal would be if the plant parameters were known. In this paper we argue the utility of this approach and then examine the -rst order case in detail, including a simulation. We also explore the bene-ts and limitations of the approach. c © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

We first analyze the dynamic behavior of a neural network model on an arbitrary convex domain. Then, we analyze two specific cases: when the convex domain is a ball, and the case when the convex domain is a simplex. The equilibrium points of the proposed neural models are located and their stability is investigated.

Speed and position are estimated through the detection of irregularities in the rotor and, hence, the results are independent of machine parameters. These irregularities generate amplitude oscillations in the currents generated by the high frequency carrier, which are proportional to the rotor position. At the same time, the frequency of these amplitude modulations is proportional to machine speed. In induction machines, the amplitude of these signals is too low to estimate position accurately. However, special electronic circuits, designed and implemented with analog multipliers and filters, have permitted measurement of very low speeds with high precision. Computer simulations and some experiments have been carried out, and they have shown that it is possible to measure speeds as low as 20 r.p.m. In the case of salient-pole synchronous machines, the method is useful to measure rotor position due to the high irregularities produced by the poles, which are easily computed because of the important amplitude variations detected in the high frequency carrier.	carrier frequency	Juan W.

These are systems having only two (possibly vector) input channels: one is delay free and the other is delayed. We present a solution based on the reduction of the problem to an equivalent delay-free problem via simple loop shifting arguments. This results in a solution based on two standard algebraic Riccati equations, which are associated with the delay-free version of the problem. The optimal controller is in the dead-time compensator form. We also derive an explicit and transparent expression for the cost of delay and (in the case when the problem is solvable without the delayed channel) a numerically stable form of the optimal solution, which includes exponentials of Hurwitz matrices only. The approach is readily extendible to more general multiple input/output delay cases.	h2 database engine;mathematical optimization	Leonid Mirkin;Zalman J.

While most of the work in the literature focuses on stability conditions for interconnected systems using passivity indices, here we focus on passivity and passivation of the feedback interconnection of two input feed-forward output-feedback (IF-OF) passive systems. The conditions are given to determine passivity indices in feedback interconnected systems. The results can be viewed as the extension of the well-known compositional property of passivity. We also consider the passivation problem which can be used to render a non-passive plant passive using a feedback interconnected passive controller. The passivity indices of the passivated system are also determined. The results derived do not require linearity of the systems as it is commonly assumed in the literature.	block cipher mode of operation;feedback;interconnection;offset binary;whole earth 'lectronic link	Feng Zhu;Meng Xia;Panos J.

Consequently, the controller design that minimizes the wavefront is given by the solution of a discrete-time Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) problem. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the structure of the LQG controller that minimizes the residual wavefront variance. It is shown that the LQG controller is an integral controller when the DM has no dynamics, there is no computational delay (the total loop delay is one frame), and the PSD of the incident wavefront decreases by f −2 at all frequencies. Non-zero computational delays result in a multivariable generalization lead element being added to the controller with the zero of the lead element at the origin.	ambient occlusion;apache axis;discrete-time signal;soft-in soft-out decoder	Douglas P.

First, the BCN under consideration is split into a finite number of subsystems with no time delays. Second, the observability of the BCN is verified by testing the observability of the so-called observability constructed path (a special subsystem without time delays) based on graph theory. These results extend the recent related results on the observability of BCNs. Examples are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the results.		Dapeng Jiang;Kuize Zhang	2018	J.

Then by using the D-partition technique the entire stabilizing set is obtained in the plane of the remaining controller parameters. Finally some formulas and charts are derived for achieving the desired specifications.

The above mentioned constraint is feasible in certain real-world problems of usefulness, for instance, when discussing ultimate boundedness in dynamic systems which guarantees Lyapunov stability. This fact makes the proposed analysis to be potentially useful to investigate global stability properties in dynamic systems in the potential presence of some locally unstable equilibrium points.

To overcome this difficulty a new concept named by finite-extraction systems is proposed. For finite-extraction systems their trajectories vary little in a very short time. Depending on this concept and the extended generator formula for GSHS, the LaSalle stability Theorem is extended to general stochastic hybrid systems.	control theory;hybrid system	Haijun Liu;Xiaowu Mu	2009	Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2009.5399805	control engineering;mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;network switch;control theory;mathematics;markov process;differential equation;hybrid system	Robotics	68.64338672549535	2.28956652361733	95178

Here the mixed time delays are assumed to be discrete and distributed time delays and the uncertainties are assumed to be time-varying norm-bounded parameter uncertainties. By constructing a novel Lyapunov functional and introducing some appropriate free-weighting matrices, delay-dependent passivity analysis criteria are derived. Furthermore, the additional useful terms about the discrete time-varying delay will be handled by estimating the upper bound of the derivative of Lyapunov functionals, which is different from the existing passivity results. These criteria can be developed in the frame of convex optimization problems and then solved via standard numerical software. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.	artificial neural network;stochastic neural network	Hongyi Li;Chuan Wang;Peng Shi;Huijun Gao	2010	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2010.04.019	mathematical optimization;discrete time and continuous time;convex optimization;lyapunov function;control theory;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;artificial neural network	ML	71.60899976659988	1.6454937916306378	95224

Our note reveals the complete role of this test matrix for fully characterizing the componentwise asymptotic stability (CWAS) of interval matrix systems. CWAS is a special type of AS which ensures the flow invariance of certain time-dependent sets with respect to the state-space trajectories.

In this context, we also consider the related fundamental notions of broken symmetry, bifurcation and chaos. That of bifurcation is a very sophisticated mathematical concept, which displays a number of local and global behaviors of those spaces within which a large variety of natural forms unfold. The suited theoretical framework for understanding deeply the concept of bifurcation is the study of singularities of mappings, their topological structures and their classification into equivalence classes. Furthermore, we consider the fundamental role played by the phenomena of breaking symmetry and chaos in the evolution and organization of various natural and living systems. In the last part of the paper, we present some striking features and results of nonlinearity and stability in the framework of the geometrical theory of dynamical systems.	bifurcation theory;chaos theory;dynamical system;fractal;living systems;nonlinear system;symmetry breaking;turing completeness	Luciano Boi	2011	I.

First, the semi-closed-loop control is employed as the system architecture. Then the transfer functions of the motor with and without loading are established. Moreover, the phase lead compensation controller is designed. Finally, to verify the feasibility and the effectiveness, the approaches of control simulation by Simulink software and experiment setup are presented and conducted. The results show that the designed phase lead controller can effectively improve the problem of phase lag occurring during the arising stage of the output. In addition, the tracking error is significantly reduced.	control system;control theory;experiment;national supercomputer centre in sweden;planetary scanner;semiconductor industry;simulation;simulink;systems architecture;transfer function	Wen-Hsiang Hsieh;I-Chih Li	2011	IJMIC	10.1504/IJMIC.2011.039705	pid controller;control engineering;motion control;feasibility study;simulation;systems modeling;cam;engineering;group delay and phase delay;control theory;tracking error;transfer function;systems architecture	Robotics	72.72069763485135	-7.5894190157995185	95736

The underlying continuous phenomena may, however, occur at a time scale much faster than the system behavior of interest. In such situations, it is desirable to approximate the detailed continuous-time behavior by discontinuous change. Two classes of discontinuous change can be identified: pinnacles and mythical modes. This work shows how pinnacles are well modeled using a hyperreal notion of time while a superdense notion of time applies well to mythical modes. Thus, the combination, called hyperdense time, is proposed to allow for the expression of the semantics of both pinnacles and mythical modes. Further, the hyperdense semantic domain is translated into a computational representation as a three-dimensional model of time. In particular, continuous-time behavior is mapped onto floating point numbers, while the mythical mode and pinnacle event iterations each map onto an integer dimension. A modified Newton's cradle is used as a case study and to illustrate the computational implementation.	3d modeling;approximation algorithm;cyber-physical system;dynamical system;embedded system;iteration;newton	Pieter J.

The interconnection of a system having two input-to-state gains with a system having a single ISS gain is analyzed. By employing the Small Gain Theorem for the local (resp. non-local) gains composition, it is concluded about the local (resp. global) stability of the origin (resp. of a compact set). Additionally, if the region of local stability of the origin strictly includes the region attraction of the compact set, then it is shown that the origin is globally asymptotically stable. An example illustrates the approach.	existential quantification;expanded memory;interconnection;maxima and minima;maximal set;quantum nonlocality	Humberto Stein Shiromoto;Vincent Andrieu;Christophe Prieur	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6759951	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;exponential stability	Vision	70.55267278406278	2.2590236365488896	95954

In this paper, we propose a method to robustify a system which has been stabilised using IDA-PBC with respect to constant, matched disturbances via the addition of integral action. The proposed controller extends previous work on the topic by being robust against the damping of the system, a quantity which may not be known in many applications.	interconnection;nonlinear system;periodic boundary conditions;robustification;simulation	Joel Ferguson;Alejandro Donaire;Romeo Ortega;Richard H.

The problem formulation requires preserving a number of original system characteristics and making use of a low energy control. The proposed method follows a frequency harmonic balance technique employed in the approximate analysis of complex nonlinear phenomena. The design procedure is applied to the well-known Chua's circuit showing the main characteristics of the approach: it gives reasonably accurate results, partly intuitive in nature, by means of quite simple computations.	chaos theory;chua's circuit;distortion	Roberto Genesio;Alberto Tesi	1993	Journal of Circuits, Systems, and Computers	10.1142/S0218126693000125	control engineering;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics	EDA	79.3235432445606	1.7961917182755347	96892

This approach reveals that controllability of continuous-time periodic systems can be connected to necessary and sufficient conditions expressed explicitly with Fourier coefficients of the system matrices, which can be interpreted in a way similar to what we have seen in linear time-invariant cases. These controllability conditions shed new light upon structural characteristics of continuous-time periodic systems that are hard to know by means of existing time-domain controllability criteria in the literature. Controllability canonical decomposition of linear continuous-time periodic systems is revisited through state coordinate transforms of strong analytic features. The results are heuristic and significant for examining structural characteristics of continuous-time periodic systems and extending controllability-related techniques that are widely employed in linear time-invariant systems to linear continuous-time periodic systems.

In this model, the output nodes are defined as the Heaviside function. Subsequently, its finite time convergence property and the exact convergence time are analyzed. However, the discovered characteristics of this model are based on the assumption that there are no physical defects during the operation. In this brief, we analyze the convergence behavior of the Wang's kWTA model when defects exist during the operation. Two defect conditions are considered. The first one is that there is input noise. The second one is that there is stochastic behavior in the output nodes. The convergence of the Wang's kWTA under these two defects is analyzed and the corresponding energy function is revealed.	additive white gaussian noise;analog;anatomic node;artificial neural network;convergence (action);mathematical optimization;network model;noise-induced hearing loss;population parameter;rate of convergence;simulation;software bug;utility functions on indivisible goods;wang and landau algorithm;weapon target assignment problem	John Sum;Andrew Chi-Sing Leung;Kevin I.-J.

Firstly, by constructing a proper variable substitution,the original system is transformed into the first order differential system. Next, constructing a useful Lyapunov function, a suitable controller and using inequality techniques, some new testable algebraic criterion are obtained for ensuring the finite-time synchronization goal. Moreover, we discussed deeply on the relation between the parameter ξi and estimated value of settling time in the different cases, and we can obtain the minimum estimated value of settling time. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results have been illustrated via two numerical examples.	artificial neural network;computer simulation;control theory;information processing;linear algebra;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;secure communication;settling time;social inequality	Dasong Huang;Minghui Jiang;Jigui Jian	2017	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2017.05.075	control theory	Robotics	72.59002511428365	2.0343627441663283	98311

This paper extends Chang transformation from slowly-varying LTV systems to LTV systems, when the singularly perturbed system has a semi-proper coefficient matrix A22(t) and LTV system ẇ(t) = A22(t)w(t) is exponentially stable. Instead of using frozen-time eigenvalues based on slowly time-varying conditions, PD-eigenvalues for LTV systems are employed to characterize the exponential stability, thereby circumventing the slowly-varying constraint. Our results provide a larger bound on epsilon, which is a gauge on the validity of the Chang transformation, in some situations than using previous techniques. We have also recast the original Chang transformation so as to provide more insight into the decoupled subsystems. The insight will be useful in subsequent investigation on estimate of the Singular Perturbation Margin (SPM) for LTV systems. An equivalence relationship has recently been established for LTI system between the SPM and the Phase Margin (PM). The new results in this paper will facilitate the development of a PM-type stability margin metric for LTV systems, and for nonlinear, time-varying systems in the future.	backward compatibility;coefficient;contraction mapping;coupling (computer programming);language technologies institute;linear approximation;linear time-invariant theory;nonlinear system;phase margin;pseudospectrum;semiconductor industry;super paper mario;time complexity;turing completeness	Xiaojing Yang;J.

In the paper a novel stochastic Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy system is introduced to represent approximately existing randomness in many real-world systems. By recapitulating the general architecture of the stochastic T–S fuzzy rule-based system, weanalyze systematically approximating capability of the stochastic system to a class of stochastic processes. By the canonical representation of the stochastic processes, the stochastic fuzzy system is capable of with arbitrary accuracy providing the approximation to the stochastic processes in mean square sense. Finally, an efficient algorithm for the stochastic T–S fuzzy system is developed. A simulation example demonstrates how a stochastic T–S fuzzy system can be constructed to realize the given stochastic process, approximately. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The system moves in a resistive fluid and is controlled by angular oscillations of the tail relative to the main body. The resistance force acting upon each body is assumed to be a quadratic function of its velocity. Under certain assumptions, a nonlinear equation is derived that describes the progressive motion of the system as a whole. The average velocity of this motion depending on the angular oscillations of the tail is estimated. The optimal control problem for the time history of these oscillations that maximizes the average velocity of the progressive motion is formulated and solved. Explicit expressions for the maximum average velocity and the corresponding optimal angular motion of the tail are obtained. The results correlate well with observations of swimming and can be applied to swimming robotic systems.	angularjs;computational fluid dynamics;nonlinear system;optimal control;quadratic function;robot;velocity (software development)	Felix L.

By using the idea of delay-partitioning approach, an appropriate delay partitioning point of h2 − h1 ∈ [0, h2] has been selected. Based on this delay partitioning point, a new augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed. Then, the free-matrix-based integral inequality is employed to estimate the derivative of LyapunovKrasovskii functional. As a result, less conservative criteria are presented.

Rational functions can take on a wide range of forms, such as the well-known pole-like shape. The approach is a possible alternative for the well-known independent component analysis when the theoretical sources are not independent, such as for frequency spectra, or when only a small number of samples is available. The technique uses a low-rank decomposition on the tensorized version of the observed data matrix. The deterministic tensorization with Löwner matrices is comprehensively analyzed in this paper. Uniqueness properties are investigated, and a connection with the separation into exponential polynomials is made. Finally, the technique is illustrated for fetal electrocardiogram extraction and with an application in the domain of fluorescence spectroscopy, enabling the identification of chemical analytes using only a single excitation-emission matrix.	blind signal separation;experiment;exponential polynomial;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;low-rank approximation;open-source software;real life;sampling (signal processing);synthetic intelligence;whole earth 'lectronic link	Otto Debals;Marc Van Barel;Lieven De Lathauwer	2016	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2015.2500179	data modeling;mathematical optimization;computer science;yttrium;mathematics;blind signal separation;stress;matrix decomposition;statistics;polynomial	ML	81.68740192847984	-7.732449051847676	98726

81cb092d37e209babb00fb64eac17bb3a60ab5c0	grid evolution method for doa estimation		Off-grid direction of arrival (OGDOA) estimation methods deal with the situations where true direction of arrivals (DOAs) are not on the discretized sampling grid. However, existing OGDOA estimation methods are faced with a tradeoff between density of initial grid and computational workload. Furthermore, these methods fail if more than one true DOA is located in a same grid interval. In order to speed up the OGDOA estimation methods and solve the problem of more than one DOA in one initial grid interval, a grid evolution direction of arrival (GEDOA) estimation method is proposed. Based on the combination of OGDOA estimation methods and grid refinement, this new approach makes the grid nonuniformly evolve from coarse to dense. The proposed method contains two subprocesses, i.e., learning process and fission process. The learning process aims to update locations of grid points and estimate DOAs. The fission process aims to generate new grid points and guarantees that there is only one DOA in a grid interval. The two processes iterate alternatively. Finally, an adaptive and nonuniform grid and an estimated spatial spectrum based on this grid are achieved. Compared with the previous methods, GEDOA has better computational efficiency because fewer grid points are used at each iteration. Furthermore, GEDOA has better resolution and lower MSE at relative high SNR. This is because that the evolved grid obtained by this new approach is information adaptive. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	direction of arrival;discretization;iteration;numerical linear algebra;refinement (computing);sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;singlet fission	Qianli Wang;Zhiqin Zhao;Zhuming Chen;Zaiping Nie	2018	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2018.2814998	control theory;workload;grid;mathematical optimization;iterative method;speedup;discretization;sampling (statistics);mathematics;direction of arrival;image resolution	HPC	81.82721774713382	-4.014553105958234	99260

Taking into account the limited availability of on-line sensors for the AD processes, in this contribution is assumed that only the methane outflow rate is available for on-line measurement. The estimation technique is based on a local coordinate transformation that lead the original two-dimensional system to an observable normal form. In order to provide robustness properties under perturbation/uncertainty conditions a super-twisting algorithm is proposed. The observer convergence is analyzed by using Lyapunov stability techniques. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the estimation scheme for a four-dimensional AD model with uncertainties associated with unmodeled dynamics and disturbances in the inflow composition.	algorithm;limited availability;lyapunov fractal;non-volatile memory;numerical linear algebra;numerical method;observable;online and offline;sensor;simulation	Gerardo Lara-Cisneros;Denis Dochain	2018	2018 5th International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)	10.1109/CoDIT.2018.8394870	robustness (computer science);anaerobic digestion;coordinate system;observer (quantum physics);process control;lyapunov stability;volatile fatty acids;control theory;mathematics;observable	Robotics	69.95973678580053	-5.115553130853771	99279

However, many such applications in science and engineering can be efficiently modeled using the concept of positive systems and the nonlinear counterpart monotone systems. It is therefore of great interest to see how such models can be used for control. This paper demonstrates how positive systems can be exploited for analysis and design of large-scale control systems. Methods for synthesis of distributed controllers are developed based on linear Lyapunov functions and storage functions instead of quadratic ones. The main results are extended to frequency domain input–output models using the notion of positively dominated system.

This problem is of great importance in many applications and is typically solved by maximizing the cross-correlation between the two signals. Inspired by compressive sensing, in this paper, we seek to estimate the shift directly from compressed signals. We show that under certain conditions, the shift can be recovered using fewer samples and less computation compared to the classical setup.

In this paper, complete periodic synchronization is considered for the delayed neural networks with discontinuous activation functions. Under the framework of Filippov solution, a novel control method is presented by using differential inclusions theory, nonsmooth Lyapunov method and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. Based on a newly obtained necessary and sufficient condition, several criteria are derived to ensure the global asymptotical stability of the error system, and thus the response system synchronizes with the drive system. Moreover, the estimation gains are obtained. With these new and effective methods, complete synchronization is achieved. Simulation results are given to illustrate the theoretical results.	neural networks	Xiaoyang Liu;Jinde Cao;Gan Huang	2010	I. J.

These systems have a characteristic property that the dynamics discontinuously behaves due to jumps at hitting borders in the state space. In general, it is difficult to obtain analytical solutions in this class. Thus a numerical method is indispensable for the bifurcation analysis in the impact oscillators; however, unfortunately, it has not been established. Therefore, we proposed a numerical method for the bifurcation analyses in the impact oscillator with a fixed border and applied the proposed method to the Rayleigh-type oscillator.	bifurcation theory;ecosystem;numerical method;rayleigh–ritz method;state space	Akiko Takahashi;Kunichika Tsumoto;Kazuyuki Aihara;Takuji Kousaka	2011	2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)	10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043331	classical mechanics;control engineering;transcritical bifurcation;numerical analysis;period-doubling bifurcation;biological applications of bifurcation theory;homoclinic bifurcation;control theory;mathematics;bifurcation theory;saddle-node bifurcation;oscillation;quantum mechanics;bifurcation diagram	EDA	80.46178918291899	3.3444547548240835	100199

The resolution of a LQ-optimal control problem for this model provides a stabilizing feedback for a nominal system with unbounded operators. The model consists of an extended abstract differential equation whose state components are the boundary input, the state (up to an affine transformation) and a Yosida-type approximation of the output of the nominal system. It is shown that, under suitable conditions, the model is well-posed and, in particular, that the dynamics operator is the generator of an analytic C0-semigroup and the model is observable. A LQ-optimal control problem is posed for the model, and a general method of resolution based on the problem of spectral factorization of a multi-dimensional operator-valued spectral density is described. It is expected that this approach will lead hopefully to a good trade-off between the cost of modelling and the efficiency of methods of resolution of control problems for such systems.	approximation algorithm;control system;control theory;image resolution;letter-quality printer;observable;optimal control;resolution (logic);spectral density;well-posed problem	Jérémy R.

Based on a mathematical model that includes delays and processors with different processing velocities, this model is transformed into a special case of delayed cellular neural networks model. A systematic method of controller synthesis is derived, based on two coupled linear matrix inequalities - one guaranteeing global convergence and the other guaranteeing performance in the linear region of operation.

The considered neural networks are disturbed by Wiener processes, and possess interval uncertainties in the system parameters. A sufficient condition, which does not only guarantee the global exponential stability but also provides more exact characterizations on the decay rate and the coefficient, is established in terms of a novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional equipped with appropriately constructed exponential terms and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. The estimates of the decay rate and the coefficient are obtained by solving a set of LMIs, which can be implemented easily by effective algorithms. In addition, slack matrices are introduced to reduce the conservatism of the condition.

A well-known problem when dealing with complex biosystems is represented by the retroactivity effect, which can significantly modify the dynamics of interconnected subsystem, with respect to the behaviour they exhibit when disconnected from each other. In this paper, we illustrate a minimal CRN that implements a subtraction operation between two input molecular fluxes. In order to assess its effectiveness as a module of a more complex system, we analyse its retroactivity upon interconnection. More specifically, we connect the subtraction module with an upstream module, which determines the dynamics of the inputs species, and with a downstream transcriptional module, which acts as a load. By comparing the dynamics of the loaded and unloaded subtractor, we show that the retroactivity can be attenuated when the dynamics of the subtractor and of the load system evolve over different timescales. This result, obtained through a singular perturbation analysis, is confirmed by means of numerical simulations.	biological factors;biological system;chemical reaction network theory;complex system;computer simulation;control system;control theory;controllers;downstream (software development);embedded system;embedding;feedback;generic drugs;interconnection;numerical analysis;perturbation theory;singular;subtractor;synthetic intelligence;transcription, genetic	Mariaconcetta Bilotta;Carlo Cosentino;Declan G.

A novel approach to this problem, based on deriving bounds for the norms of system solutions, is developed. A sharp estimate for the maximal Lyapunov exponent of the solutions, expressed in the bounds for the uncertain parameters, is found. The subsystems, for which the obtained estimate is attained, are indicated. Using these results, a delay-independent necessary and sufficient stability condition for the considered set of systems is derived. For a system with prescribed parameters, sufficient conditions for exponential stability and upper bound for the maximal Lyapunov exponent are obtained.

In particular, by utilizing the local properties of saturation nonlinearity and Lyapunov stability theory, a novel linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based condition is proposed that not only ensures the nonexistence of overflow oscillations, but also yields the \(H_{\infty }\) interference rejection performance of 2-D digital filters under the overflow constraint. It is worth mentioning here that in contrast to the traditional approaches based on modeling the saturation with a global sector-bound condition, the proposed approach provides a less conservative bound for the attenuation of disturbances and renders the idea of minimum word length for realizing the 2-D (Roesser) filter to eliminate overflow oscillations and attain the specified \(H_{\infty }\) interference attenuation performance index. Finally, a numerical simulation example is also provided, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over the existing techniques.

3f19137cba6e54da5bd05a3c3c5fcd184641f933	nonlinear least squares algorithm for canonical polyadic decomposition using low-rank weights		The canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) is an important tensor tool in signal processing with various applications in blind source separation and sensor array processing. Many algorithms have been developed for the computation of a CPD using a least squares cost function. Standard least-squares methods assumes that the residuals are uncorrelated and have equal variances which is often not true in practice, rendering the approach suboptimal. Weighted least squares allows one to explicitly accommodate for general (co)variances in the cost function. In this paper, we develop a new nonlinear least-squares algorithm for the computation of a CPD using low-rank weights which enables efficient weighting of the residuals. We briefly illustrate our algorithm for direction-of-arrival estimation using an array of sensors with varying quality.	least squares;levenberg–marquardt algorithm	Martijn Bousse;Lieven De Lathauwer	2017		10.1109/CAMSAP.2017.8313141	tensor;signal processing;non-linear least squares;blind signal separation;least squares;sensor array;algorithm;nonlinear system;mathematics;weighting	ML	79.10257237257159	-7.069909514164883	101769

Since parameters in the connection weight matrices are state-dependent, that is to say, the connection weight matrices jump in certain intervals, the mathematical model of the coupled inertial memristive neural networks can be considered as an interval parametric uncertain system. Based on the interval parametric uncertainty theory, two different synchronization criteria for memristor-based neural networks are obtained by applying the p-matrix measure (p=1,2,∞,ω), Halanay inequality and constructing suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. Two simulation examples with fully-connected and nearest neighboring topology are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the obtained theoretical results.

The proposed solution to the control problem is a tube-based MPC ensuring robustness and constraints fulfilment. Reachable sets are calculated online taking into account the system dynamics by means of an adaptive local control law and additive uncertainties. The proposed method represents a trade-off between small conservativeness and efficient real-time execution. This approach is applied to solve the trajectory tracking problem of a mobile robot. Simulation results provide a comparison between the tube-based MPC scheme and established motion control algorithms, showing the efficient execution and satisfactory behaviour of the proposed controller.

In the case of discrete-time systems, the problem can be solved by using the conventional state augmentation approach. However, this approach is not suitable for the continuous-time case. In this paper, we will propose a unified approach to study the <i>H</i><sub>∞</sub> fixed-interval smoothing problem for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems with <i>l</i> output delays. By introducing a suitable stochastic linear time-delay models in an indefinite space, it is shown that the <i>H</i><sub>∞</sub> fixed-interval smoother can be obtained by calculating <i>H</i><sub>2</sub> fixed-interval smoother for time-delay systems in an indefinite space. Therefore, based on the orthogonal projection theory in an indefinite space, the <i>H</i><sub>∞</sub> fixed-interval smoothers for time-delay systems are designed by performing <i>l</i>+1 Riccati equations with the same dimension as the original systems. Moreover, a necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the <i>H</i><sub>∞</sub> fixed-interval smoother will also be given.	navier–stokes equations;smoothing;time complexity	Hongguo Zhao;Peng Cui;Wei Wang;Deyun Yang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2012.2223696	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;control theory;mathematics;estimation theory;statistics	Embedded	68.41877610675	2.8503102852732813	103156

During wave transformation for the sampled-data system, a unit delay arises due to causality of the reflection wave. This delay makes the wave transformation in the sampled-data system different from the standard one in the continuous-time system. The unit delay on the reflection wave occasionally becomes a passive element. From the passivity condition of the sampled-data system, the wave impedance can be designed such that wave transformation using delayed reflection provides the effect of positive damping and thus a stable haptic interface is achieved in the sampled-data system. For a passive haptic device, although it is always considered stable because of its passive nature, the oscillatory motion appears during the wall-following task with force approximation. Various experiments for a two-linked passive haptic device show that a stable haptic interface can be accomplished for the wall-following task through wave transformation using delayed reflection.	approximation;bilateral filter;broadcast delay;causality;characteristic impedance;data system;experiment;haptic technology;r language;sampling (signal processing);test engineer	Jae-Hyeong Lee;Changhyun Cho;Munsang Kim;Jae-Bok Song	2006	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/156855306776014385	control engineering;computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;haptic technology	Robotics	75.05526906280818	-8.01984172225173	103340

The approach is based on a useful sampled-data nonlinear system simulation method, which involves the addition of an extra state variable for each nonlinear element. The nonlinear estimator is developed along the lines of the basic Kalman state estimation, using quasilinearization instead of the Taylor series linearization used in extended Kalman filters. It is demonstrated that this new method out performs the extended Kalman filter in terms of the mean-square error of the state estimate. This estimator was used effectively for state estimation in cases where the extended Kalman filter does not converge. Moreover the new method is directly applicable to feedback systems with multiple nonlinearities and stochastic disturbances.	algorithmic efficiency;converge;embedded system;extended kalman filter;linear system;mean squared error;nonlinear element;nonlinear system;simulation	Jastej S.

Ultimate variations of auxiliary functions are considered for existence of asymptotic gain and a gauge design is introduced for switching-uniform adaptive control by partial state feedback and output feedback of switched systems subject to unmeasured dynamics and persistent dwell-time switching. The usage of the controlled dynamics as a gauge for the instability mode of the unmeasured dynamics makes it possible to design a control rendering the evolution of the overall system interchangeably driven by the stable modes of the controlled and unmeasured dynamics. Unmeasured-state dependent control gains are dealt with and unknown time-varying parameters are attenuated via asymptotic gain. Verification of asymptotic gain conditions is based on the relation between dissipation rates of unmeasured dynamics and timing characterizations ¿p and T p of switching sequences.	authorization;block cipher mode of operation;emoticon;event dispatching thread;ieee xplore;instability;maximal set;nonlinear system;persistence (computer science);programming paradigm;rise time;scott continuity;social inequality;transponder timing;utility functions on indivisible goods;vergence	Thanh-Trung Han;Shuzhi Sam Ge;Tong Heng Lee	2010	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2009.2034927	control engineering;electronic engineering;systems modeling;uncertainty;adaptive control;nonlinear system;stopping time;lyapunov function;control system;control theory;dwell time;mathematics;switching time;information technology;instability;hybrid system	Robotics	71.64340815698914	-3.7504442888873872	104374

7e544ce4ae0ba09a4bb09e1eaf13a655281621e4	fuzzy responses and bifurcations of a forced duffing oscillator with a triple-well potential	fuzzy uncertainty;possibility measure;membership distribution function;fuzzy response;generalized cell mapping	Responses and bifurcations of a forced triple-well potential system with fuzzy uncertainty are studied by means of the Fuzzy Generalized Cell Mapping (FGCM) method. A rigorous mathematical foundation of the FGCM is established as a discrete representation of the fuzzy master equation for the possibility transition of continuous fuzzy processes. The FGCM offers a very effective approach for solutions to the fuzzy master equation based on the min–max operator of fuzzy logic. A fuzzy response is characterized by its topology in the state space and its possibility measure of membership distribution functions (MDFs). A fuzzy bifurcation implies a sudden change both in the topology and in the MDFs. The response topology is obtained based on the qualitative analysis of the FGCM involving the Boolean operation of 0 and 1. The MDFs are determined by the quantitative analysis of the FGCM with the min–max calculations. With an increase of the intensity of fuzzy noise, noise-induced escape from each of the potential wells defines two types of bifurcations, namely catastrophe and explosion. This paper focuses on the evolution of transient and steady-state MDFs of the fuzzy response. As the intensity of fuzzy noise increases, steady-state MDFs cover a bigger area in the state space with higher membership values spreading out to a larger area. The previous conjectures are further confirmed that steady-state MDFs are dependent on initial possibility distributions due to the nonsmooth and nonlinear nature of the min–max operation. It is found that as time goes on, transient MDFs spread around three potential wells. The evolutionary orientation of transient MDFs aligns with unstable invariant manifolds leading to stable invariant sets. Two examples of additive and multiplicative fuzzy noise are given.

38b7e45e36fc3e33d609d4ef57d5e0bb3ae418ba	design of switched controllers using an enhanced passivation method		This paper studies an enhanced passivation method for feedback interconnected switched controllers consisting of N sub-controllers. It is shown that stability and passivity of the closed-loop system are achieved through the feedback interconnection of the passivated switched controller. The passivation technique is established through finding a common gain for the switched controller and therefore the switched controller is passivated by a single input-output passivation matrix. This approach significantly reduces the implementation cost for the design of switched controllers. A design example is provided to verify the capability of the developed method.	disk controller;interconnection	Vahideh Ghanbari;Meng Xia;Panos J.

Reason behind this, is the emerging need to understand physiological phenomenon from systems theory. It is not only helpful to support respiration externally, it is useful for prediction and taking preventive measures also. Several Researchers have modeled respiratory system from system level and investigated these issues. Certain phenomenon like Periodic Breathing, Sleep Apnea could be satisfactorily explained from these models. Respiratory models are developed based on physiological laws and mass balance equations of three compartments, namely, Brain, Body and Lungs. Efforts are put in a direction to capture physiological phenomenon as close as possible and they are broadly classified as complete model. Coupled, nonlinear, delay differential equations are used to describe these models and certain physiological condition can be simulated with some approximation. Obtaining analytical solutions are difficult and numerical technique is used to solve these systems.  This work includes modeling of Chemical regulatory system proposed by Milhorn et al Here, all the equations are modeled in Simulink and Numerical simulation was performed for three different conditions, viz. Normal condition, Hypoxia condition (Oxygen level is decreased), Hypercapnia condition (Carbon Dioxide level is increased). Simulation of these conditions show change in alveolar ventilation rates for sustainable body function as reported in literature, where input variables are assumed to change as step function. However, this assumption may not always hold, because, diffusion of gas from lungs to blood is not possible instantaneously. Here, we have assumed input variable to alter following a ramp function and simulation is performed with different slope of the ramp. Results are in close agreement with the experimental data.	approximation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;simulink;systems theory;viz: the computer game;wake-sleep algorithm	Tanmay Pal;Srinivasu Maka	2012		10.1145/2345396.2345483	control engineering;simulation;computer science;control theory;modeling and simulation;mathematics;systems theory	Metrics	80.35959734831172	0.4353495122047841	104975
c48bfc07e0c1f69c35b64232e4fcb4569a0b0321	on the properties of the rank-two null space of nonsparse and canonical-sparse blind deconvolution		Blind deconvolution is a ubiquitous nonlinear inverse problem in applications such as wireless communications and image processing. This problem is generally ill-posed, and there have been efforts to use sparse models for regularization to promote signal identifiability. Herein, the ambiguity in blind deconvolution is characterized by lifting to a rank-one matrix recovery problem and analyzing the rank-two null space of the resultant linear operator. A novel dimension-wise tight representation of this rank-two null space is stated and proved to show unidentifiability of blind deconvolution for almost every pair of unconstrained input signals. This representation is further used to establish, somewhat surprisingly, the ill-posedness of the canonical-sparse blind deconvolution problem by exemplifying the dimension of the unidentifiable signal sets. An important conclusion of this paper is that canonical sparsity occurring naturally in applications may be insufficient for signal identifiability in blind deconvolution, necessitating the use of coding.	blind deconvolution;image processing;kernel (linear algebra);lambda lifting;nonlinear system;resultant;sparse matrix;well-posed problem	Sunav Choudhary;Urbashi Mitra	2018	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2018.2815014	kernel (linear algebra);image processing;mathematical optimization;deconvolution;sparse matrix;blind deconvolution;identifiability;inverse problem;convolution;mathematics	ML	80.89049491904431	-4.915188241303686	105124

As important features of the proposed design method, wemention that it can handle a general LFT structure for the uncertainty and it is based on stability conditions that can be numerically solved by means of LMIs and a line search. Moreover, the switching rule as well as the state feedback gains are determined from the minimization of a guaranteed cost function derived from a multi-objective criterion.

The bifurcation sets are calculated by employing the generalized algebra criterion in high dimensional system. The obtained bifurcation sets partition the two dimensional parameter space in terms of the qualitatively different behaviors of the HH model. Thus the neuron's information encodes the stimulus information, and vice versa, which is significant in neuron control. The study is of some biological significance and suggest that the aberration of dynamics in bio-systems may account for diseases caused by electric exposure.	bifurcation theory;british informatics olympiad;hodgkin–huxley model;huxley: the dystopia;neuron;source-to-source compiler	Huiyan Li;Yanqiu Che;Hanqiao Gao;Feng Dong;Jiang Wang	2007	2007 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Intelligent Control	10.1109/ISIC.2007.4450897	classical mechanics;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics;bifurcation theory	Visualization	80.87942964620072	1.3178990731616427	106219

A sufficient condition, which does not only guarantee the exponential stability and admissibility but also gives the estimates of decay rate and decay coefficient, is established in terms of the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique and a new Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional. The estimating procedure is implemented by solving a set of LMIs, which can be checked easily by effective algorithms. Under the proposed condition, the algebraic subsystems possess the same decay rate as the differential ones. Moreover, a state feedback stabilizing controller which makes the closed-loop system exponentially stable and admissible with a prescribed lower bound of the decay rate is designed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.		Zhan Shu;James Lam	2008	Int. J.

A simple and systematic design is presented for a new OFC, which is applicable for all observable plant systems, either with more outputs than inputs or with at least one stable transmission zero ( or for most observable plants). This new OFC can generate a signal Kx( t) where K = KC¯ and where K is a free OFC parameter and C is predetermined by the design of the dynamic part of OFC. This Kx( t) is exactly compatible with the static output feedback ( SOF) control signal Ky CX( t) where K is free and C is given. Furthermore, because the rank of C¯ is maximized by our design, and it ranges between the plant system order and the rank of C, this new OFC can completely unify the existing result of OFC which estimates x( t) and the existing result of SOF.

I N T R O D U C T I O N O u t p u t regula t ion problem is the problem of controlling the ou tpu t of a control system so as to achieve asympto t i c t racking of prescribed reference t ra jec tor ies a n d / o r asympot ic rejection of undesired d is turbance signals. I t is a central problem in control theory. This problem has been solved for nonlinear control systems with a Poisson s table exosystem by Isidori and Byrnes [1]. The problem of designing observers for nonlinear systems was in t roduced by Thau [3]. Over the past three decades, considerable a t ten t ion has been paid in the l i te ra ture to the construct ion of observers for nonlinear systems. In [4], a Lyapunov-l ike method was presented for exponent ia l observer design. In [5], Xia and Gao derived a necessary condit ion for the existence of an exponent ia l observer for nonlinear systems. Explicit ly, in [5], Xia and Gao showed tha t a local exponent ia l observer exists for a nonlinear sys tem only if the l inearizat ion of the nonlinear syst em is detectable . In [2,6,7], the exponent ia l observer design problem was complete ly solved for Lyapunov s table nonlinear systems using classical and geometrical methods. In this paper , we present a new method for solving the exponent ia l observer design problem for a special t ype of Lyapunov s table nonlinear systems, namely neut ra l ly s table systems. Our method is to set up the observer design problem as an ou tpu t regulat ion problem and solve the new problem using the ou tpu t regulat ion techniques of Isidori and Byrnes [1]. 0893-9659/03/$ see front matter (~) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

O U T P U T R E G U L A T I O N OF N O N L I N E A R S Y S T E M S In this section, we consider a nonlinear system of the form = f (z , ~) + g(x)u, = s ( o ~ ) , e = h(x) + q(w), (i) where x E R n is the state, u E R m the input, and e E R p the error between the plant output h(x) and the reference signal -q (w) . The state x is defined in a neighborhood X of the origin of R '~. The dynamics ~b = s(w) is the exosystem for plant (1). The state w of the exosystem is defined in a neighborhood W of the origin of R ~. We assume that the functions f , g, s, h, and q a r e C 1 and also thgt f(0, 0) = 0, g(0) = 0, s(0) = 0, h(0) = 0, and q(0) = 0. Next, we define a basic output regulation problem for plant (1). DEFINITION 1. The state feedback regulator problem for plant (1) is to find, i f possible, a state feedback law of the form u = ~(~, ~), where a(x , w) is a C 1 mapping defined on X x W such that the following two conditions axe satisfied. 1. The equilibrium x = 0 of : f (x , o) + g(x) ~(~, o) is locally exponentially stable. 2. There exists a neighborhood U C X x W of (0, O) such that, for each initial condition (x(O), w(O)) E U, the solution of the composite system = f (x , w) + g(x)c~(x, ~), = S(~), satisfies IIh(x(t)) + q(w(t))ll <_ Mexp( -a t ) I Ih (x (O) ) + q(w(O))ll, for some positive constants M and a. Next, we define a neutrally stable nonlinear system. DEFINITION 2.

However, in these works, at least the linear growth bound is assumed to be known in designing stabilizing controllers. In our work, we propose an adaptive output feedback control scheme in which the high-gain parameter is tuned on-line. Thus, a priori knowledge on the linear growth bound of system nonlinearities is not required in our scheme.	block cipher mode of operation;nonlinear system	Ho-Lim Choi;Jong-Tae Lim	2005	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2005.01.009	control engineering;mathematical optimization;a priori and a posteriori;nonlinear system;engineering;principle;control theory;mathematics;state observer;satisfiability	Robotics	71.52982969296126	-4.117571499105193	107781

Sufficient conditions are established for associative encoding and recall of the periodic patterns associated with the external stimuli. Both continuous-time-continuous-state and discrete-time-continuous-state models are discussed. It is shown that when the neuronal gain is dominated by the neuronal dissipation on average, associative recall of the encoded temporal pattern is guaranteed and this is achieved by the global asymptotic stability of the encoded pattern.	convergence (action);hopfield network;neuron;neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinoses	K.

To improve the separation performance, we have proposed multistage ICA, in which frequency-domain ICA and time­ domain ICA (TDICA) are cascaded. For temporally correlated signals, we must use TDICA with a nonholonomic constraint to avoid the decor­ relation effect. However, the stability cannot be guaranteed in the non­ holonomic c回e. Also, in the holonomic case, the sound quality of the separated signal is distorted by the decorrelation effect. To solve the problem of the stability, we perform TDICA with the holonomic con­ straint. To avoid the distortions, we estimate the distortion components by TDICA with the holonomic constraint ai1d we compensate the sound qualities by using the estimated components. The stability of the pro­ posed algorithm can be guaranteed by the holonomic constraint, and the proposed compensation work prevents the distortion. The experiments in a reverberant room reveal that the algorithm results in higher stability and higher separation performance.	algorithm;blind signal separation;decorrelation;distortion;experiment;holonomic (robotics);independent computing architecture;mcgurk effect;multiple encryption;multistage amplifier;nethack;sound quality	Tsuyoki Nishikawa;Hiroshi Saruwatari;Kiyohiro Shikano;Atsunobu Kaminuma	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30110-3_111	computer vision;speech recognition;distortion;computer science;machine learning;signal processing;control theory;mathematics	AI	78.1653715955987	-9.104679828245338	108640
25ee647bf781ee9da413135868efdb807888411d	input to state stability of bipedal walking robots: application to durus		Bipedal robots are a prime example of systems which exhibit highly nonlinear dynamics, underactuation, and undergo complex dissipative impacts. This paper discusses methods used to overcome a wide variety of uncertainties, with the end result being stable bipedal walking. The principal contribution of this paper is to establish sufficiency conditions for yielding input to state stable (ISS) hybrid periodic orbits, i.e., stable walking gaits under model-based and phase-based uncertainties. In particular, it will be shown formally that exponential input to state stabilization (e-ISS) of the continuous dynamics, and hybrid invariance conditions are enough to realize stable walking in the 23-DOF bipedal robot DURUS. This main result will be supported through successful and sustained walking of the bipedal robot DURUS in a laboratory environment.	addendum;centrifugal governor;emoticon;humanoid robot;lyapunov fractal;microsoft windows 98;nonlinear system;optimal control;petri net;pixel;robust control;social inequality;system dynamics;the matrix;time complexity;underactuation;windows 95	Shishir Kolathaya;Jake Reher;Aaron D.

To date, these systems are mostly handled by computing a quantifier-free equivalent form by means of Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD). However, CAD restricts its input to be conjunctions and disjunctions of polynomial constraints with rational coefficients, while some applications such as camera control involve systems with arbitrary forms where time is the only universally quantified variable. In this paper, the handling of universally quantified variables is first related to the computation of inner-approximation of real relations. Algorithms for solving non-linear real constraint systems with universally quantified variables are then presented along with the theoretical framework on inner-approximation of relations supporting them. These algorithms are based on the computation of outer-approximations of the solution set of the negation of involved constraints. An application to the devising of a declarative modeller for expressing camera motion using a cinematic language is sketched, and results from a prototype are presented.	algorithm;approximation;automated planning and scheduling;coefficient;computation;computer-aided design;control engineering;existential quantification;laurent polynomial;modeller;maximal set;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;prototype;quantifier (logic);requirement;universal quantification	Frédéric Benhamou;Frédéric Goualard	2000		10.1007/3-540-45349-0_7	motion control;mathematical optimization;simulation;constraint satisfaction;artificial intelligence;mathematics;interval arithmetic;algorithm	AI	74.8624724646454	-3.5889034705842633	108830

Each CVS consists of a cluster of unstable matrices, which are simultaneously block-triangularizable. This type of SLSs cannot be addressed by existing results. A decomposition method is used to decompose the original system into several lower dimensional SLSs at the diagonal block positions. Our results show that the original higher dimensional SLS is asymptotically stable if all these lower dimensional SLSs are asymptotically stable. The synergy between the continuous of each lower dimensional SLSs and the discrete dynamics is fully utilized by the cycle analysis method to derive sufficient conditions on the robust stability of each lower dimensional SLS. With our method, all CVSs in a cycle instead of each individual CVS is taken as an analysis unit. The condition on the stability of SLSs can then be relaxed in the sense that Lyapunov functions are only required to be non-increasing along each type of cycle instead of each CVS.	complex system;computation;concurrent versions system;control theory;discrete mathematics;finite-state machine;fitts's law;linear system;lyapunov fractal;redundancy (engineering);stable model semantics;standard sea level;synergy;systems theory;triangular matrix	Zhengguo Li;Changyun Wen;Yeng Chai Soh	2007	2007 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Intelligent Control	10.1109/ISIC.2007.4450867	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	68.41282016995184	0.9620390396457787	109141

A novel concept that can make use of more relaxed variables by employing the new type of augmented matrices with Kronecker product operation is proposed. The proposed method can handle multitude of Kronecker product operation in Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, and introduce more arbitrary matrices to reduce the conservatism. Since the expression based on linear matrix inequality is used, the synchronisation criteria can be easily checked in practice.

Such a problem is common in many practical situations, including, for example, vehicle attitude control, robotic manipulator positioning, deployment of multistable structures, etc. Our aim is to characterize, both for continuous and discrete-time models, control properties and switching policies ensuring that any possible state trajectory of the closed-loop system is robustly asymptotically convergent to one of the desired ‘‘target points’’. First we will show that in the discrete-time case, conditions guaranteeing the asymptotic stability to a set of points can be derived by exploiting the intrinsic ‘‘holding’’ nature of the discrete-time framework. Such results can be extended to continuous time by means of standard sample-and-hold techniques. However, this kind of solution is revealed to be very conservative and then not realistically employable in many contexts. For such a reason further less restrictive policies will be introduced and investigated; these are mostly based on the concept of ‘‘strategy holding’’ in time (by providing a slower switching policy sampling time) and space (by using hysteresis regions). Those strategies will be characterized both in terms of global stabilizability and in terms of switching flexibility, i.e., the capability to react in a convenient way to sudden state changes. Driven by the above analysis an ‘‘opportunistic switching’’ strategy combining all the advantages of the strategies considered will be proposed and analyzed. Synthesis results are presented, providing a constructive procedure to design the proposed control laws. The paper is concluded with an application example based on the attitude control of a Ducted-Fan Aerial Vehicle, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a practical application. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The reaching law determines the sliding variable rate of change proportional to the negative value of the hyperbolic tangent of this variable. The approach proposed in this paper helps satisfy input and state constraints in the controlled system, and at the same time it does not unduly damp the system convergence rate in the vicinity of the sliding plane. In the second part of this paper we apply the proposed reaching law to solve the periodic review inventory management problem, with suppliers' constraints explicitly taken into account.	computer simulation;inventory;lossy compression;moore's law;rate of convergence	Piotr Lesniewski;Andrzej Bartoszewicz	2014	2014 19th International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)	10.1109/MMAR.2014.6957364	control engineering;economics;operations management;control theory	Robotics	70.23126167649008	-3.1496580957296323	110284

To describe the range of random trajectories, we use the method of stochastic sensitivity functions. We consider the problem of designing a given stochastic sensitivity function, discuss problems of controllability and reachability. Complete stochastic controllability is only possible when the control’s dimension coincides with the system’s dimension. Otherwise, the design problem becomes ill-posed. To solve it, we propose a regularization method that lets us produce a given stochastic sensitivity function with any given precision. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated with the example of controlling stochastic oscillations in a brusselator model.

When the system matrix is nonsingular, it is very easy to derive the discrete-time Floquet transformation, however, when the system matrix is singular, the derivation is essentially different from the continuous-time case. A necessary and sufficient condition for Floquet transformation to exist has been already known and this paper aims to give a simpler proof, by which all the similarity classes of Floquet transformations could be made clear. And also an extension of Floquet transformations to non-autonomous systems is shown.	autonomous system (internet);linear system;time-invariant system;turing completeness	Yoshikazu Hayakawa;Tomohiko Jimbo	2008	2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2008.4738701	control engineering;floquet theory;discrete mathematics;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Embedded	69.40624442519605	2.737873970265974	111126

Some sufficient conditions which guarantee finite-time stable, stabilization, and boundedness of switched nonlinear systems with time-delay are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

Generally speaking, a hybrid system is a dynamical system with continuous dynamics, discrete dynamics, and the interaction between them. Hybrid systems are important from both the practical and theoretical points of view. Indeed, hybrid systems naturally represent a wide class of practical systems which are subject to known or unknown abrupt parameter variations, and which undergo sudden change of system structures due to the failure of a component. Another practical motivation for studying hybrid dynamical systems stems from the fact that the hybrid control scheme provides an effective approach for controlling highly nonlinear complex dynamical systems and systems with large uncertainties and/or unknown parameters (Liberzon, 2003; McClamroch & Kolmanovsky, 2000). In fact, as the complexity of the system dynamics increases, it is more and more impractical to design one single controller for achieving desired global performance. It is thus a common practice to design more than one controller, each at a different operating region, and a switching mechanism that coordinates the switching among them. From theoretical viewpoints, the interactions between low-level continuous dynamics and high-level discrete logics, mainly governed by the switching and impulse mechanisms, bring new challenges beyond the conventional system theory (Branicky, Borkar, & Mitter, 1998; Sun & Ge, 2005). The monograph under review provides a timely and comprehensive lecture note on the study of an important class of hybrid systems—the switched and impulsive systems.	complex dynamics;dynamical system;high- and low-level;hybrid system;interaction;international standard book number;nonlinear system;springer (tank);system dynamics;systems theory	Zhendong Sun;Shuzhi Sam Ge	2006	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2006.04.013	control theory;mathematics;system analysis;engineering physics	Robotics	76.9517984563449	-0.2133636375803609	111246

The approach taken is to use feedback of a single state variable in a simple PD (proportional and differential) format. First, the unstable fixed points in the n-scroll Chua's circuit are classified into two different types according to the characteristics of the eigenvalues of the linearized system matrix at the fixed points. Then, the controllability of these two-types of fixed points is studied. Theoretical analysis shows that the first type of unstable fixed points can be stabilized, at which Hopf bifurcation can also be generated. Control results of the n-scroll Chua's circuit are then demonstrated. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results show that the proposed chaos control method is indeed effective.	chua's circuit	Yan-Li Zou;Xiao-Shu Luo;Pin-Qun Jiang;Bing-Hong Wang;Guanrong Chen;Jin-Qing Fang;Hong-Jun Quan	2003	I.

For 2-D systems, only two changes in the parameter value are needed in order to stabilize a UPO embedded in the chaotic attractor. The method is general and can be applied to any discrete chaotic system, in which a parameter is accessible and can be changed around a nominal value. To validate and visualize the applicability of the method, an electronic circuit is designed, which resembles the dynamics of the Hénon system, and the control scheme is successfully tested on this circuit. The experimental results show good performance of the method in the presence of noise in the signals, uncertainties in the model, and disturbances in the real circuit system.	chaos control;chaos theory;control theory;electronic circuit;embedded system;hénon map;linear model;perturbation theory;poincaré plot	Alexander Jimenez Triana;Guanrong Chen;Alain Gauthier	2015	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2014.2387553	classical mechanics;control engineering;electronic circuit;uncertainty;control of chaos;stability;computer science;engineering;noise;control system;discrete system;control theory;mathematics;attractor;statistics;robustness	EDA	79.05358085915402	1.6246288385521341	111604

The network is modeled by a nonlinear fluid flow model corresponding to two classes of traffic, namely the premium traffic and the ordinary traffic. The proposed congestion controller does take into account the associated physical network resource limitations and is shown to be robust to the unknown and time-varying delays. Our proposed decentralized congestion control strategy is developed on the basis of Diff-Serv architecture by utilizing a robust adaptive technique. A Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) condition is obtained to guarantee the ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system. Numerical simulation implementations are presented by utilizing the QualNet and Matlab software tools to illustrate the effectiveness and capabilities of our proposed decentralized congestion control strategy.	baudot code;benchmark (computing);control theory;differentiated services;fo (complexity);linear matrix inequality;log management;matlab;network congestion;network packet;nonlinear system;simulation;social inequality;steady state	Rui Ru Chen;Khashayar Khorasani	2011	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2010.08.019	robust control;active traffic management;network traffic control;simulation;systems modeling;adaptive control;telecommunications;linear matrix inequality;differentiated service;decentralised system;process capability index;engineering;control theory;mathematics;network congestion;slow-start	Networks	74.2091577135261	-4.481717638427426	111673

The resultant model is referred to as a novel interval dynamic BAM (IDBAM) model. By combining a number of different Lyapunov functionals with the Razumikhin technique, some sufficient conditions for the existence of unique equilibrium and robust stability are derived. These results are fairly general and can be verified easily. To go further, we extend our investigation to the time-varying delay case. Some robust stability criteria for BAM with perturbations of time-varying delays are derived. Besides, our approach for the analysis allows us to consider several different types of activation functions, including piecewise linear sigmoids with bounded activations as well as the usual C/sup 1/-smooth sigmoids. We believe that the results obtained have leading significance in the design and application of BAM neural networks.	activation function;artificial neural network;bidirectional associative memory;biological neural networks;content-addressable memory;lyapunov fractal;neural network simulation;piecewise linear continuation;qt interval feature (observable entity);resultant;sigmoid function	Xiaofeng Liao;Kwok-Wo Wong	2004	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)	10.1109/TSMCB.2003.821455	index term;stability;piecewise linear function;lyapunov function;computer science;dynamical system;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;bidirectional associative memory;activation function;artificial neural network	ML	74.42670518337721	2.6625190195719624	111804

More precisely, all that is known about the systems is their nonzero pattern, i.e., the locations of the nonzero entries in the coefficient matrices. We characterize the patterns that guarantee controllability and observability, respectively, for all choices of nonzero time functions at the matrix positions defined by the pattern, which extends a result by Mayeda and Yamada for time-invariant systems. As it turns out, the conditions on the patterns for time-invariant and for time-varying discrete-time systems coincide, provided that the underlying time interval is sufficiently long. In contrast, the conditions for time-varying continuous-time systems are more restrictive than in the time-invariant case.	coefficient;the matrix;time complexity;time-invariant system	Gunther Reissig;Christoph Hartung;Ferdinand Svaricek	2014	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2014.2320297	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;control theory;mathematics	Embedded	69.73886409943542	3.49772948150625	112171

de77b71a57d90ad4ca97924f248d24e50f89b3de	a 3-d novel jerk chaotic system and its application in secure communication system and mobile robot navigation		In this work, we study the complex dynamics of a six-term 3-D novel jerk chaotic system with two hyperbolic sinusoidal nonlinearities, which was proposed by Vaidyanathan et al. Arch Control Sci 24(3):375–403, 2014, [98]. The initial study in this chapter is to analyze the eigenvalue structures, various attractors, Lyapunov exponent analysis, Kaplan Yorke dimension, FFT analysis and Poincare map analysis. We have studied the dynamic behavior of the system in the case of the bidirectional coupling via a linear resistor. Both experimental and simulation results have shown that chaotic synchronization is possible. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the bidirectional coupling method scheme between two identical 3-D novel jerk chaotic systems in a secure communication system is presented in detail. Also, the driving strategy of a mobile robot is studied, in order to generate the most unpredictable trajectory. Kinematics model of the robot’s movement has been created and combined with the networking system of a 3-D novel jerk circuit so that the movement of the robot is very difficult to predict. Finally, numerical simulations by using MATLAB 2010, experimental results, as well as the implementation of circuit simulations by using Proteus has been performed in this study.	chaos theory;mobile robot;secure communication	Aceng Sambas;Sundarapandian Vaidyanathan;Mustafa Mamat;W.

In this article, we compare two balanced truncation methods as a means of designing low-order controllers for a nonlinear cable-mass system. The first is the standard technique of balanced truncation. The second, linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) balanced truncation, can be thought of as balancing based on the controller, and states that are important from the perspective of control and filter design are retained. The control design applied to each reduced-order model is the central controller. We provide an overview of the central controller and devote attention to the design of this controller in the presence of balancing. Also described in this article is a method for reducing computational time in solving algebraic Riccati equations for the design of low-order LQG balanced controllers.		Belinda A. Batten;Katie A.

It is assumed that the continuous controller has access to the current switching mode and can be of the form of an ensemble of mode-dependent state feedback controllers. The fastest stabilizing rate under the given information structure is proposed as a quantitative metric of the system’s stabilizability, and its bounds are derived using seminorms.

Thus currently most of it appears characterized by some slow switching condition with average dwell time satisfying a certain lower bound. However, in cases of nonlinear systems, when the switching seizes to be slow there may well appear non-expected complexity phenomena of particularly different nature. A fast switching condition with average dwell time satisfying an upper bound is explored and established. Thus the theory is extended by shading new light on the underlying, switching caused, system complexities. A comparison analysis of these innovated characterizations via slightly different overview yielded new results on the transient behaviour of switched nonlinear systems, while preserving the system stability.

The nonlinear physical phenomenon of stochastic resonance generally occurs in bistable systems excited by a random noise plus a sine. Such systems force cooperation between the input noise and the input sine: Provided a fine tuning between the noise amplitude and the dynamics, the system reacts periodically. The interesting fact is that the local output signal-to-noise ratio presents a maximum when plotted against the input noise amplitude. In this paper we recall the main results for the discrete-time nonlinear AR(1) systems. We then show how stochastic resonance can be used to detect small noisy sine and that the classical incoherent detector can be improved in some non-Gaussian contexts.	autoregressive model;bistability;noise (electronics);nonlinear system;signal-to-noise ratio;stochastic resonance	Steeve Zozor;Pierre-Olivier Amblard	2000	2000 10th European Signal Processing Conference			Robotics	81.10286034103447	0.630745590766516	113814

Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions for exponential stability are derived, respectively, for stabilizing delayed impulses and destabilizing delayed impulses. It is shown that even if all the subsystems governing the continuous dynamics without impulse input delays are not exponential stable, if impulsive and switching signal satisfy a dwell-time upper bound condition, stabilizing delayed impulses can stabilize the systems in the exponential stability sense. Moreover, it is also shown that if the magnitude of the delayed impulses is sufficiently small, the exponential stability properties can be derived irrespective of the size of the impulse input delays under some conditions. The opposite situation is also developed. The efficiency of the proposed results is illustrated by two numerical examples.

By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional including double integral terms having two different exponential decay rates and utilizing linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique with the help of slack variables, some sufficient conditions for globally exponential stabilization results are obtained by designing of delayed state-feedback controller. The novelty of this paper includes: (i) although many papers dealt with dynamics of neural networks with leakage delay, there is little work on design of feedback controller. Even there is almost no result that deals with the delay-feedback controller for such delay systems, which is the main motivation of this paper; (ii) the derived delay-dependent stability criteria establish the relationship between leakage delay and time delay in the feedback term, which can be easily checked via the MATLAB LMI toolbox; (iii) we consider the general case that the control term is given in the form of Bu, where B is an n×m real matrix. Such case is more difficult to handle than the special case that B is unit matrix. It indicates that the controller can be used in all states or in some states by proper selection of the matrix B. The effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper is illustrated via numerical examples.	artificial neural network;broadcast delay;checking (action);controller (computing);controllers;extravasation;feedback;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;matlab;neural network simulation;numerical analysis;numerical method;paper;slack variable;social inequality;spectral leakage;the matrix;exponential	Haitao Zhu;R.

With the benefits of the two norms, this novel formulation is able to promote both sparsity and binary property effectively. Simulations show that our proposed method outperforms many sophisticated techniques especially under small noise.

The explicit parameterization of the desired filter is also given. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed approach. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The “programmable vector field” approach is a commonly proposed method for distributed manipulation control. In [13] it was shown that when one takes into account the discreteness of actuator arrays and the mechanics of actuator/object contact, the controls designed by the programmable vector field approach can be unstable at the desired equilibrium configuration. We show here how a discontinuous feedback law that locally stabilizes the manipulated object at the equilibrium can be combined with the programmable vector field approach to control the object’s motions. We prove that the combined system is globally exponentially stabilizable even in the presence of changes in contact state. Simulations illustrate the results.	computer simulation;control theory;time complexity	Todd D. Murphey;Joel W.

The proposed recurrent neural network is globally exponential stability and converges to the optimal solutions of the higher quadratic programming. An op-amp based on the analogue circuit realization of the recurrent neural network is described. The recurrent neural network proposed in the paper is simple in structure, and is more stable and more accuracy for solving the higher quadratic programming than some existed conclusions, especially for the case that the number of decision variables is close to the number of the constraints. An illustrative example is discussed to show us how to design the analogue neural network using the steps proposed in this paper.	analogue electronics;artificial neural network;operational amplifier;quadratic programming;recurrent neural network;time complexity	Wudai Liao;Jiangfeng Wang	2009	2009 International Joint Conference on Computational Sciences and Optimization	10.1109/CSO.2009.235	operational amplifier;mathematical optimization;computer science;recurrent neural network;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;quadratic programming;artificial neural network	AI	73.46001248587841	4.116129293429114	115708

The Average Dwell time (ADT) property defines restricted classes of switching signals which provide sufficient conditions for proving stability of switched systems. In this paper, we use a specialization of the Hybrid I/O Automaton model to capture both the discrete and the continuous mechanisms of hybrid systems. Based on this model, we develop methods for automatically verifying ADT properties and present simulation relations for establishing equivalence of hybrid systems with respect to ADT. Given a candidate ADT for a hybrid system, we formulate an optimization problem; a solution of this problem either establishes the ADT property or gives an execution fragment of the system that violates it. For two special classes of hybrid systems, we show that the corresponding optimization problems can be solved using standard mathematical programming techniques. We formally define equivalence of two hybrid systems with respect to ADT and present a simulation relation-based method for proving this equivalence. The proposed methods are applied to verify ADT properties of a linear hysteresis switch and a nondeterministic thermostat.	hybrid system;hysteresis;input/output automaton;mathematical optimization;network switch;optimization problem;partial template specialization;simulation;turing completeness;two-hybrid screening;verification and validation	Sayan Mitra;Nancy A.

A novel event-triggered scheme has been proposed, which can lead to a significant reduction in information communication in a network. By utilizing stochastic analysis and properties of the Kronecker product, consensus criteria are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities, which can be readily solved using the standard numerical software.

Associated with each Markovian jump linear system is a switched linear system, so we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for almost sure uniform stabilization and disturbance attenuation for Markovian jump linear systems as well. The results lead to semidefinite programming–based controller synthesis techniques, from which optimal finite-path-dependent linear dynamic output feedback controllers arise naturally. In particular, under the notion of path-by-path optimal disturbance attenuation, finite-path-dependent controllers can outperform the usual modedependent ones.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;block cipher mode of operation;computation;computational complexity theory;control system;control theory;linear matrix inequality;linear system;optimal control;path dependence;scheduling (computing);semidefinite programming;social inequality	Ji-Woong Lee;Geir E.

Roll angle and roll rate cannot be measured directly when IMUs are disabled. A dynamic linear observer is designed to estimate the tracking errors of the roll angle and equivalent roll angular velocity with respect to their desired states. Moreover, based on the centre manifold theory and on the equivalent control, the closed-loop system is asymptotically convergent. The theoretical results are confirmed by computer simulations.

Instead of using the moving average (MA)-based noise model commonly used for adaptive digital control of linear discrete-time stochastic systems in the literature, an adjustable auto-regressive moving average (ARMA)-based noise model with estimated states is constructed for state-space self-tuning control of nonlinear continuous-time stochastic systems. By taking advantage of a digital redesign methodology, which converts a predesigned high-gain analog tracker/observer into a practically implementable low-gain digital tracker/observer, and by taking the non-negligible computation time delay and a relatively longer sampling period into consideration, a digitally redesigned predictive tracker/observer has been newly developed in this paper for adaptive chaotic orbit tracking. The proposed method enables the development of a digitally implementable advanced control algorithm for nonlinear stochastic and chaotic hybrid systems.	hybrid system;nonlinear system;self-tuning;state space	Shu-Mei Guo;Leang-San Shieh;Ching-Fang Lin;Jagdish Chandra	2001	I.

Furthermore, the results are extended to the robust passivity analysis with mixed time delays that consist of both the discrete and distributed time delays, and the uncertainties are assumed to be time-varying norm bounded parameter uncertainties. By constructing a new Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and introducing some appropriate free-weighting matrices, a delay-dependent passivity criterion is derived in terms of LMIs whose feasibility can be easily checked by some available software packages.

f4b0cca08e6c6079df56e1c3a2c269cc1cc9b590	entropy measures as geometrical tools in the study of cosmology		Classical chaos is often characterized as exponential divergence of nearby trajectories. In many interesting cases these trajectories can be identified with geodesic curves. We define here the entropy by S = ln χ(x) with χ(x) being the distance between two nearby geodesics. We derive an equation for the entropy, which by transformation to a Riccati-type equation becomes similar to the Jacobi equation. We further show that the geodesic equation for a null geodesic in a double-warped spacetime leads to the same entropy equation. By applying a Robertson–Walker metric for a flat three-dimensional Euclidean space expanding as a function of time, we again reach the entropy equation stressing the connection between the chosen entropy measure and time. We finally turn to the Raychaudhuri equation for expansion, which also is a Riccati equation similar to the transformed entropy equation. Those Riccati-type equations have solutions of the same form as the Jacobi equation. The Raychaudhuri equation can be transformed to a harmonic oscillator equation, and it has been shown that the geodesic deviation equation of Jacobi is essentially equivalent to that of a harmonic oscillator. The Raychaudhuri equations are strong geometrical tools in the study of general relativity and cosmology. We suggest a refined entropy measure applicable in cosmology and defined by the average deviation of the geodesics in a congruence.	amiga walker;chaos theory;congruence of squares;entropy (information theory);geodesic grid;jacobi method;time complexity	Gilbert Weinstein;Yosef Strauss;Sergey Bondarenko;Asher Yahalom;Meir Lewkowicz;Lawrence Paul Horwitz;Jacob Levitan	2018	Entropy	10.3390/e20010006	functional equation;binary entropy function;maximum entropy probability distribution;summation equation;riccati equation;characteristic equation;joint quantum entropy;partial differential equation;quantum mechanics	ML	82.63147457026719	3.692623250185273	116734

In the behavioral framework, these problems can be considered as special cases of balanced truncation of strictly half line dissipative system behaviors, where the number of input variables of the behavior is equal to the positive signature of the supply rate. Instead of input-state-output representations, the balancing algorithm uses normalized driving variable representations of the behavior. We show that the diagonal elements of the minimal solution of the balanced algebraic Riccati equation are the singular values of the map that assigns to each past trajectory the optimal storage extracting future continuation. Since the future behavior is only an indenite inner product space, the term singular values should be interpreted here in a generalized sense. We establish some new error bounds for this model reduction method.	algebraic riccati equation;algorithm;continuation;dissipative system;linear algebra;truncation	Harry L.

To divided into two subsystems to achieve asymptotic stability by decoupled method for a class of fourth-order nonlinear system. The fuzzy-neural network (FNN) is the main regulator controller, which is used to approximate an ideal computational controller. The compensation controller is designed to compensate for the difference between the ideal computational controller and the FNN controller. A tuning methodology is derived to update weight parts of the FNN. Using Lyapunov law, we derive the decoupled sliding-mode control law and the related parameters adaptive law of FNN. Finally, the decoupled sliding-mode with fuzzy-neural network control (DSMFNNC) is used to control three highly nonlinear systems and confirms the validity of the proposed approach. The method can control one-input and multi-output nonlinear systems efficiently. Using this approach, the response of system will converge faster than that of previous reports. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Our aim is to find a set as small as possible to bound the states starting from the origin by inputs with peak values. The Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional together with free-weighting matrix technique are proposed to derive some sufficient conditions for the existence of an ellipsoidal bound to estimate the states. This method eliminates the conservatism generated by Jensen’s inequality and obtains a much tighter reachable set bound. In addition, the number of variables to be determined is smaller than the previous result based on the maximal Lyapunov functional. Finally, an example illustrates the merits of our proposed results.	broadcast delay;cobham's thesis;computational complexity theory;jensen's inequality;linear system;lyapunov fractal;maximal set;numerical analysis;social inequality	Zhiqiang Zuo;Yinping Chen;Yijing Wang;Michael Z.

The controller to be designed is supposed to include additive gain variations. By using Lyapunov stability theory and adding slack matrix variables, new sufficient conditions are derived to design the event-triggered parameters and the controller gains. Compared with the existing non-fragile dynamic output feedback controller design methods, the structural restriction on the Lyapunov matrix is relaxed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by two examples.	linear system	Dan Liu;Guang-Hong yang	2018	Inf.

By constructing appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing Newton-Leibniz formulation and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, a delay-interval-dependent condition is developed to estimate the neuron state with some available output measurements such that the error-state system is global asymptotically stable. Two examples are given to show the effectiveness and decreased conservatism of the proposed criterion in comparison with some existing results. It is noteworthy that the traditional assumptions on the differentiability of the time-varying delays and the boundedness of their derivative are removed.	artificial neural network	Huiwei Wang;Qiankun Song	2010	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2009.12.017	mathematical optimization;linear matrix inequality;computer science;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;activation function;artificial neural network	ML	72.89343347116144	2.0129269127050673	117928

Rather than requiring the user to provide an explicit error tolerance numerically, we let the user to specify only the target rendering speed. Our system can then calculate an appropriate error tolerance adaptively to satisfy the user’s performance goal. The system is realized using fuzzy logic control, which enables run-time adaptation based on iterative feedback control and knowledge acquired from past experience. We describe the process of constructing the fuzzy logic control system, and show that the system can successfully steer the performance of volume rendering.	algorithm;computer performance;control system;error-tolerant design;feedback;fuzzy logic;image quality;iterative method;logic control;numerical analysis;operating system;rendering (computer graphics);volume rendering	Xinyue Li;Han-Wei Shen	2001		10.2312/VisSym/VisSym01/253-262	control engineering;real-time computing;simulation;computer science	Visualization	70.86690272462788	-9.077662704829137	117953

For this, we first distinguish between robust and fragile couples, i.e., couples which have one or two stable equilibria. We also distinguish between high and low quality relationships by looking at the sign of the feelings among the partners. Finally, we split fragile couples into two distinct classes, namely those that starting from the state of indifference evolve toward their most positive equilibrium, as opposed to those that have an unfavorable evolution. The boundaries separating the various classes in any two dimensional parameter space are either bifurcation curves or special curves characterized by the annihilation of a suitably defined indicator associated to the equilibria or to their basins of attraction. The analysis is performed in part analytically and in part numerically (through continuation methods), and is mainly focused on the role of the appeals of the individuals. The results are in agreement with common wisdom and observations and show, in particular, that love stories can evolve positively in the long run, even if one of the two individuals has negative feelings in the initial phase of the relationship.	bifurcation theory;continuation;mathematical model;numerical analysis;robustness (computer science);synergy	Sergio Rinaldi;Fabio Della Rossa;Fabio Dercole	2010	I.

This adaptive control algorithm does not involve modifications like data normalization, use of deadzones, or injection of persistently excited signals. Also it requires no a priori knowledge of system modelling errors. It is shown that global robustness properties still hold when this simple algorithm is applied to systems with bounded disturbances and arbitrarily small fast parasitic dynamics. The problem of indirect decentralized adaptive control of interconnected systems is also considered. We use the above adaptive algorithm to design completely decentralized local adaptive controllers for each isolated subsystem by ignoring interactions between subsystems. We show that the local controllers designed in this way are robust in the sense that all signals in the closed loop adaptive system are bounded for bounded initial conditions, reference inputs, disturbances and an arbitrarily small amount of interaction between subsystems and unmodelled dynamics of each subsystem.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive system;gradient;initial condition;interaction;optimal control	Changyun Wen;David John Hill	1992	Automatica	10.1016/0005-1098(92)90056-L	control engineering;mathematical optimization;discrete time and continuous time;stability;adaptive control;decentralised system;control theory;mathematics;estimation theory;statistics;robustness	Robotics	71.55568698112906	-4.835508678316805	118724

The drawback of this quantity is that it misses information on the oscillation property. To complement the quantity, another notion of the sum of imaginary parts is proposed in this paper. Further an algebraic method to compute this new quantity is suggested. This paper also shows that the performance limitation of the LQG problem in the SIMO plant case can be characterized in terms of the sum of roots. It is demonstrated by way of a design example that two contributions make it possible to minimize the achievable performance over plant parameters under a constraint on the oscillation of the closed-loop system.	complement (complexity);imaginary time;linear algebra;mathematical optimization	Soichiro Fukamachi;Masaaki Kanno;Shinji Hara	2014	53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2014.7040435	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	68.65808654536838	-3.151614380342169	119025

PID tuning methods are widely used to control stable processes. However, PID controller for unstable processes is less common. In this paper, the PID controller parameters can be determined by the ANFIS. Because the de)nitions of gain and phase margin equations are complex, an analytical tuning method for achieving speci)ed the gain and phase margins is not yet available. In this paper, the ANFIS is adopted to identify the relationship between the gain-phase margin speci)cations and the PID controller parameters. Then, it is used to automatically tune the PID controller parameters for di;erent gain and phase margin speci)cations so that neither numerical methods nor graphical methods need be used. A simple method is also developed to estimate the stabilizing region of PID controller parameters and valid region for gain-phase margin. Even for unreasonable speci)cations, out of the valid region, the ANFIS can still )nd suitable PID controller to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system. Simulation results show that the ANFIS can achieve the speci)ed values e=ciently. c © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

More recently, neural network and genetic algorithm controllers have started to be applied to complex, non-linear dynamic systems. The control of chaotic dynamic systems poses a series of especially challenging problems. In this paper, an adaptive control architecture using neural networks and genetic algorithms is applied to a complex, highly nonlinear, chaotic dynamic system: the adaptive attitude control problem (for a satellite), in the presence of large, external forces (which left to themselves led the system into a chaotic motion). In contrast to the OGY method, which uses small control adjustments to stabilize a chaotic system in an otherwise unstable but natural periodic orbit of the system, the neuro-genetic controller may use large control adjustments and proves capable of effectively attaining any specified system state, with no a prioriknowledge of the dynamics, even in the presence of significant noise.	artificial neural network;chaos theory;control of chaos;control theory;dynamical system;genetic algorithm;linear system;nonlinear system	Dimitris C.

A criterion for regularity-impulsiveness-free of each subsystem is presented. A solution to switching-impulsiveness-free for switched descriptor systems is provided. A novel type of piecewise Lyapunov functionals is introduced. This type of Lyapunov functionals can efficiently overcome the switching jump of adjacent Lyapunov functionals at switching times. By applying this type of Lyapunov functionals and algebraic manipulations, the delay-independent conditions for uniform exponential admissibility is established on the minimum dwell time.	time complexity	Xiuyong Ding;Xiu Liu;Shouming Zhong	2014	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2013.11.107	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Logic	68.85670036829733	0.7241937155658903	119929

This ensures asymptotic stability of the designed feedback system. To this end, we provide certificates of positivity for polynomials in the simplicial Bernstein form. Subsequently, the state space is partitioned into simplices. On each simplex, we simultaneously compute Lyapunov and control functions. With this control, the equilibrium is asymptotically stable.	algorithm;barycentric subdivision;bernstein polynomial;control engineering;control function (econometrics);lyapunov fractal;phil bernstein;state space;subdivision surface	Tareq Hamadneh;Rafael Wisniewski	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8431599	automation;control theory;mathematical optimization;computer science;barycentric coordinate system;state space;polynomial;simplex;stability theory;lyapunov function;exponential stability	Robotics	69.80964160304852	-2.198563059557278	120006

As Hahn-loser, Sarpeshkar, Mahowald, Douglas, and Seung (2000) showed, networks of this type can be efficiently built in silicon and exhibit the coexistence of digital selection and analog amplification in a single circuit. To obtain this behavior, the network must be multistable and nondivergent, and our conditions allow determining the regimes where this can be achieved with maximal recurrent amplification. The first condition can be applied to nonsymmetric networks and has a simple interpretation of requiring that the strength of local inhibition match the sum over excitatory weights converging onto a neuron. The second condition is restricted to symmetric networks, but can also take into account the stabilizing effect of nonlocal inhibitory interactions. We demonstrate the application of the conditions on a simple example and the orientation-selectivity model of Ben-Yishai, Lev Bar-Or, and Sompolinsky (1995). We show that the conditions can be used to identify in their model regions of maximal orientation-selective amplification and symmetry breaking.	aharonov–bohm effect;analog;analogue electronics;choose (action);circuit design;coexist (image);commutation theorem;convergence (action);dynamical system;gtf2ird1 gene;interaction;large;matching;maximal set;monostable;multivibrator;neural network simulation;neuromorphic engineering;neuron;piecewise linear continuation;population parameter;recurrent neural network;selectivity (electronic);silicon;symmetry breaking;utility functions on indivisible goods;weight	Heiko Wersing;Wolf-Jürgen Beyn;Helge J.

Hierarchical stability conditions based on linear matrix inequalities are obtained from an extensive use of the Bessel inequality applied to Legendre polynomials of arbitrary orders. While this inequality has been only used for constant discrete and distributed delays, this paper generalizes the same methodology to time-varying delays. We take advantages of the dependence of the stability criteria on both the delay and its derivative to propose a new definition of allowable delay sets. A light and smart modification in their definition leads to relevant conclusions on the numerical results.	bessel filter;legendre polynomials;linear matrix inequality;linear system;numerical analysis;polynomial;social inequality	Alexandre Seuret;Fr&#x00E9;d&#x00E9;ric Gouaisbaut	2018	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2017.2730485	control theory;inequality;mathematics;legendre polynomials;bessel function;mathematical optimization;matrix (mathematics);numerical stability;linear system;bessel's inequality;mathematical analysis;symmetric matrix	EDA	71.10446609902138	2.230761356731469	120148
0de6bccdf6ce384d8e4e44716abbf1354eb97aa6	design of synthesizing multi-valued high-capacity auto-associative memories based on complex-valued networks		This paper presents a novel design method which is aimed to synthesize arbitrary multi-valued auto-associative memories via complex-valued neural networks. Globally exponential stable criteria are obtained to guarantee that the unique storage prototype can be retrieved. The proposed procedure enables auto-associative memories to be synthesized by satisfying the constraints of inequalities rather than the learning procedure. The main emphasis of the research presented here is on multi-valued high-capacity auto-associative memories via complex-valued networks. The designed auto-associative memories with ((2r+2)^n) high memory capacities are robust with respect to design parameter selection and extend the scope of application of complex-valued neural networks. The approach of external inputs via complex-valued neural networks avoids spurious equilibria and retrieves the stored patters accurately. Some applicable experiments are given to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority.

Large-scale interconnected systems consist of a number of discrete-time interconnected Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) subsystems. First, a novel Delay-Dependent Piecewise Lyapunov–Krasovskii Functional (DDPLKF) is proposed, in which both the upper and the lower bound of delays are considered. Then, two improved delay-dependent stability conditions are established based on this DDPLKF in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). The merit of the proposed conditions lies in its reduced conservatism, which is achieved by circumventing the utilization of some bounding inequalities for cross products of two vectors and by considering the interactions among the fuzzy subsystems in each subregion. A decentralized generalized H2 state feedback fuzzy controller is designed for each subsystem. It is shown that the mean-square stability for discrete T–S fuzzy large-scale stochastic systems can be established if a DDPLKF can be constructed and a decentralized controller can be obtained by solving a set of LMIs. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	interaction;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;stochastic process	Jiangrong Li;Junmin Li;Zhile Xia	2011	Applied Mathematics and Computer Science	10.2478/v10006-011-0046-6	control engineering;mathematical optimization;linear matrix inequality;fuzzy number;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	71.15435130405493	1.452354307619729	120593

An iterative procedure based on the linear quadratic Gaussian optimal control model is developed for solving the optimal control of this stochastic system. The optimal state estimate provided by Kalman filtering theory and the optimal control law obtained from the linear quadratic regulator problem are then integrated into the dynamic integrated system optimisation and parameter estimation algorithm. The iterative solutions of the optimal control problem for the model obtained converge to the solution of the original optimal control problem of the discrete-time nonlinear system, despite model-reality differences, when the convergence is achieved. An illustrative example is solved using the method proposed.

Frequently these are problems that require solving a nonlinear equation system and/or finding the global optimum of a nonconvex function. Thus, the reliability with which these computations can be done is often an important issue. Interval analysis provides tools with which these reliability issues can be addressed, allowing such problems to be solved with complete certainty. This paper will focus on three types of applications: 1) Parameter estimation in the modeling of phase equilibrium, including the implications of using locally vs. globally optimal parameters in subsequent computations; 2) Nonlinear dynamics, in particular the location of equilibrium states and bifurcations of equilibria in ecosystem models used to assess the risk associated with the introduction of new chemicals into the environment; 3) Molecular modeling, with focus on transition state analysis of the diffusion of a sorbate molecule in a zeolite.	computation;ecosystem model;estimation theory;global optimization;interval arithmetic;maxima and minima;molecular modelling;nonlinear system;system of polynomial equations	Youdong Lin;C.

The discrete-time adaptive control composed of NF dynamic inversion and NF variable structure control (NF-VSC) is developed to stabilize the closed-loop system and ensure the high-quality tracking.

Given a measure of quantization coarseness, a mode-dependent logarithmic quantizer and amode-dependent linear state feedback law can achieve optimal coarseness for mean square quadratic stabilization of a Markov jump linear system, similar to existing results for linear time-invariant systems. The sector bound approach is shown to be non-conservative in investigating the corresponding quantized state feedback problem, and then a method of optimal quantizer/controller design in terms of linear matrix inequalities is presented. Moreover, when the mode process is not observed by the controller and quantizer, a mode estimation algorithm obtained by maximizing a certain probability criterion is given. Finally, an application to networked control systems further demonstrates the usefulness of the results. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The stability problem is considered as a robust stability one with respect to an auxiliary system which may be defined very freely. The proposed method allows a very important generalisation related to the usual problem statement in the literature when the auxiliary system is defined by deleting the whole delayed dynamics. Conditions are established that ensure that the Laplace operator characterising the system has a bounded inverse on the closed complex right-half plane. The analysis is slightly modified for investigating uniform stability dependent of delay.	time complexity	Manuel de la Sen;Ningsu Luo;Aitor J.

This paper has been digitized, optimized for electronic delivery and stamped with digital signature within the project DML-CZ: The Czech Digital Mathematics Library This paper studies the constrained robust adaptive stabilization problem for a class of lower triangular systems with unknown control direction. A robust adaptive feedback control law for the systems is proposed by incorporating the technique of Barrier Lyapunov Function with Nussbaum gain. Such a controlled system arises from the study of the constrained robust output regulation problem for a class of output feedback systems with the unknown control direction and a nonlinear exosystem. An application of the constrained robust adaptive stabilization design leads to the solution of the constrained robust output regulation problem in the sense that the output tracking error is constrained within the prescribed barrier limit while asymptotically approaching to zero and the closed loop signals are all bounded for all the time.

The internal model controller structure is first reviewed in the context of the YJBK parametrization of all stabilizing controllers, and its appropriateness for the control of open-loop stable plants is discussed. Using a series-parallel identification model, it is then shown how, for a stable plant, one can adapt the internal model on-line and guarantee stability and asymptotic performance in the ideal case i.e. in the absence of modelling errors. This is achieved without having to check any strictly positive real conditions or requiring any persistent excitation. By robustifying the adaptive law using standard approaches from the robust adaptive control literature, the robustness of the scheme to the presence of modelling errors, such as unmodelled dynamics, is also established. The theoretical developments here complement the reported industrial successes of internal model control schemes.	requirements analysis	Aniruddha Datta;James Ochoa	1996	Automatica	10.1016/0005-1098(96)85557-9	control engineering;series and parallel circuits;von neumann stability analysis;internal model;simulation;stability;adaptive control;engineering;adaptive system;control theory;mathematics;system analysis;robustness	Robotics	71.71265782971139	-4.923009407652009	122124

Results about preservation of stability and passivity of classical linear time-invariant systems are extended to one more general family of matrix functions. Based on these results, a new approach to the problems of stabilization and passification of distributed-order linear time-invariant systems is presented. Also a result that extends the known techniques for pole placement of classical linear time-invariant systems to the new class of distributed-order linear time-invariant systems is given. Examples are given to show the validity of theoretical results. & 2013 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach – Ever since Poicare, deterministic chaos is ultimately connected with exponential divergence of nearby trajectories, unpredictability and erratic behaviour. Here, the authors propose an alternative approach in terms of complexity theory and transcendence. Findings – In this paper, the authors were able to reproduce previous results easily, due to new theorems. Originality/value – The paper updates previous results and proposes a more complete understanding of the phenomenon of deterministic chaos, also making possible connections with number theory, combinatorics and possibly quantum mechanics, as in quantum mechanics there does not exist the notion on nearby trajectories.	chaos theory;computational complexity theory;quantum mechanics;time complexity;transcendence	Kostas Karamanos;Aristotelis Gkiolmas;Constantine Skordoulis	2011	Kybernetes	10.1108/03684921111142476	symbolic dynamics;combinatorics;number theory;discrete mathematics;determinant;design methods;computer science;artificial intelligence;chaos theory in organizational development;mathematics;chaos theory;quantum chaos	Theory	81.81266246714397	3.4473697716996883	122168

In this case, it is known that the slow dynamics is constrained to be in a proper subspace of the state-space, with the optimal input for the slow dynamics implementable by feedback. In this technical note we show that both the fast dynamics and the slow dynamics can be implemented by a feedback controller. Moreover, we show that the feedback controller cannot be a static feedback controller but can be PD, i.e., proportional+differentiate exactly once, in the state. We show that the closed loop system is a singular descriptor state space system and we also characterize the conditions on the system/performance index for existence of inadmissible initial conditions, i.e., initial conditions that cause impulsive solutions. There are no inadmissible initial conditions in the controlled system if and only if in the strictly proper transfer matrix from the unpenalized inputs to the penalized states, there exists at least one maximal minor of relative degree equal to the number of unpenalized inputs. In addition to the above, we prove solvability of the infinite horizon singular LQ problem under milder assumptions than in the literature.	apache axis;closed-loop transfer function;control theory;feedback;imaginary time;initial condition;letter-quality printer;loss function;maximal set;optimal control;state space;transfer matrix	Rachel K.

It can be argued that such a model is as comprehensive as one would like to be when studying perturbations of neural networks since delay siganalling and noise are accounted for.

This property captures the responsiveness of a system with respect to applied inputs, which is quantified via the norm of an output. As a main contribution, we obtain several Lyapunov-like sufficient conditions for norm-controllability, some of which are based on higher-order derivatives of a Lyapunov-like function. Various aspects of the proposed concept and the sufficient conditions are illustrated by several examples, including a chemical reactor application. Furthermore, for the special case of linear systems, we establish connections between norm-controllability and standard controllability.	dynamical system;image scaling;linear system;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;reactor (software);responsiveness;wavelet	Matthias Albrecht Müller;Daniel Liberzon;Frank Allgöwer	2011	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/CDC.2011.6160557	control engineering;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Embedded	69.95368414266274	1.9926874660096692	123086

Furthermore, we show that if there is a common quadratic Lyapunov function for stability and certain ℒ2 gain of all subsystems, then the switched system is stable and has the same ℒ2 gain under arbitrary switching.

To cope with the majority of real-size applications, the simplified model is assumed to incorporate a variable or unknown time delay. Therefore, the core of the PI-PID regulator is an effective identification algorithm suitable for the on-line estimation of the unknown time delay in sampled systems. In the development, particular emphasis is given to all those aspects which make an algorithm really applicable in an industrial environment, such as start-up and initial tuning phase, choice of the sampling period, ease of the control synthesis criterion.

When perturbed terms in the model of the neural network satisfy Lipschitz condition, some algebraic criteria are obtained. The results obtained in this paper show that if an equilibrium of the neural network is the interior point of a sub-region, and an appropriate matrix related to this equilibrium has some stable degree to stabilize the perturbation, then the equilibrium of the delayed cellular neural network can still remain the property of exponential stability. All results in the paper is only to compute eigenvalues of matrices. All results obtained in this paper include the deterministic neural network as special case.	recurrent neural network	Wudai Liao;Xuezhao Yang;Zhongsheng Wang	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-01507-6_33	stochastic neural network;mathematical optimization;cellular neural network;discrete mathematics;random neural network;computer science;state space;recurrent neural network;machine learning;interior point method;control theory;mathematics;lipschitz continuity;activation function;exponential stability;artificial neural network;satisfiability	ML	74.49474687141917	3.2197771108627933	124013

We consider dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations and establish the continuity properties of the given and relaxed (in the sense of Filippov) systems with respect to controls and initial state variables. The approach based on the set-valued analysis makes it possible to study discontinuous models in the abstract setting and to obtain general theoretical results. The latter can be effectively applied to vide classes of variable structure control systems. In particular, this paper deals with applications of the above-mentioned continuity and approximability to some hybrid control systems and to the classical sliding mode control processes.	approximation algorithm;control system;dynamical system;nonlinear system;scott continuity	Vadim Azhmyakov;Magnus Egerstedt;Leonid M.

Some sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the pth moment exponential stability and pth moment global asymptotic stability of stochastic functional differential equations with infinite delay by using Razumikhin method and Lyapunov functions. Based on the obtained results, we further study the pth moment exponential stability of stochastic recurrent neural networks with unbounded distributed delays. The result extends and improves the earlier publications.

In the present work, these results are extended to neurons with sigmoidal input-output functions. The existence conditions of the map in the absence of recurrent connections and afferent autocorrelations are derived. Then, by utilizing the mathematically convenient d-function expansion for well-localized yet otherwise arbitrary recurrent connections, the master equation is reduced into a partial differential equation guaranteed to possess analytic solutions with given boundary conditions (as addressed in the corresponding Cauchy problem). The receptive fields and the excitable regions of the map can thus be studied by standard methods of second-order partial differential equations of elliptic or hyperbolic type	dynamical system;map;self-organization	J.

Despite this intrinsic limitation, the problem of reconstructing the initial state and the inaccessible inputs from the available measurements has recently attracted remarkable interest, owing to its impact on the synthesis of enhanced-reliability control systems. This contribution consists of a geometric method which solves the unknown-state, unknown-input reconstruction problem in discrete-time systems with invariant zeros anywhere in the complex plane, except the unit circumference. The case of systems with the invariant zeros in the open set outside the unit disc is regarded as the basic one. The difficulties related to the presence of those invariant zeros are overcome by accepting a reconstruction delay commensurate to the invariant zero time constants and the accuracy required for reconstruction. The solution devised for that case also applies to systems without invariant zeros. However, in this case, reconstruction is exact and the delay depends on the number of iterations needed for a certain conditioned invariant algorithm to converge. Finally, the more general case of systems with invariant zeros lying anywhere in the complex plane, with the sole exception of the unit circumference, is reduced to the fundamental one through the synthesis of an appropriate filter.	minimum phase	Giovanni Marro;Elena Zattoni	2010	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2010.02.012	mathematical optimization;discrete time and continuous time;invariant polynomial;engineering;control system;invariant measure;invariant;control theory;mathematics;geometry;time constant	Robotics	69.3588200163989	-4.278917008300813	125439

While CS literature has mostly focused on problems involving 1-D and 2-D signals, many important applications involve signals that are multidimensional. We propose the use of Kronecker product matrices in CS for two purposes. First, we can use such matrices as sparsifying bases that jointly model the different types of structure present in the signal. Second, the measurement matrices used in distributed measurement settings can be easily expressed as Kronecker products. This new formulation enables the derivation of analytical bounds for sparse approximation and CS recovery of multidimensional signals.	compressed sensing;sparse approximation;sparse matrix	Marco F.

The main feature is automatic kick attenuation while drilling reservoir sections. A simple mathematical model is presented that captures the dominant phenomena of the drilling system and forms the basis for observer and control design. A switched pressure control algorithm for feedback control of the choke valve opening and the back-pressure pump is proposed, and asymptotic stability properties are established. Kick attenuation is guaranteed for a set of reservoir models, including the most common ones. As part of the control scheme, novel observers for estimation of the flow rate through the bit and kick detection are developed. Simulation results obtained with a high fidelity drilling simulator are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed switched control scheme.	algorithm;data drilling;dynamical system;feedback;mathematical model;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Jing Zhou;Øyvind Nistad Stamnes;Ole Morten Aamo;Glenn-Ole Kaasa	2011	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2010.2046517	control engineering;engineering;control system;control theory;feedback;mechanical engineering	Robotics	72.78759749125437	-7.2710269522507245	126385

This note examines how this effect is manifested in the corresponding parameter identification problem. Our work shows that standard ideas such as persistent excitation in a trajectory can be explained by symmetry. Moreover, by understanding how symmetry affects the dynamics, it may be possible to obtain sufficient information to achieve full identification even when typical trajectories are not persistently exciting. Alternately, our analysis shows how properly interpreting the output of the identification process can give useful information even if full identification is not possible.

These applications mainly rely on the observation that given signals are normally well described by low-dimensional subspaces of some proper bases or dictionaries. According to sparse representation theory, an unknown signal s ∈ R in the linear representation of columns of a dictionary matrix D ∈ R can be faithfully recovered from the measurements y ∈ R (M ≪ N) if s is sparse i.e. it contains significantly fewer measurements than the ambient dimension of the signal. The reconstruction of s is solved by the following sparsity-driven l1-based linear programming problem [1,2]:	column (database);computer vision;dictionary;interference (communication);linear programming;pattern recognition;signal processing;sparse approximation;sparse matrix	Minh Dao;Xiang Xiang;Bulent Ayhan;Chiman Kwan;Trac D.

We consider the classical problem of determining control laws and smallest buffer levels guaranteeing that an unknown bounded demand is always satisfied. A simple model with n decoupled integrators and n additive bounded disturbances is employed. The coupling arises from bounds on the total production capacity and on the total demand. Invariant set theory for linear and switched linear systems is exploited to compute robust positive invariant sets and controlled robust invariant sets for two commonly adopted scheduling policies. This paper provides the explicit expression of the invariant sets for any arbitrary n.

Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) is an important algorithm for the above CS problem. In conventional research, the pre-designed measurement matrix is applied in the CS sensing system accurately. However, because of the non-ideality of the physical system, there exists some perturbation between the actual and the pre-designed measurement matrix. This kind of perturbation is named as Measurement Matrix Uncertainty (MMU). In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named as Matrix-Uncertain SBL (MU-SBL) in order to extend SBL into CS signal reconstruction under MMU. In MU-SBL, MMU effects are absorbed into an independent non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) Gaussian noise vector, whose variances are estimated based on the variances of the perturbation matrix and the reconstruction results from SBL. In general, MU-SBL iterates between non-i.i.d. noise variances estimation and SBL sparse signal reconstruction. Finally, MU-SBL is also applied to multipath sparse Single-Input-Single-Output Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (SISO-OFDM) channel estimation based on CS, in which MMU comes from the nonlinearity of Power Amplifier (PA). MU-SBL is shown to outperform conventional SBL by the simulation results on both the artificial Gaussian sparse signal reconstruction and OFDM sparse channel estimation.	algorithm;audio power amplifier;channel state information;compressed sensing;linear equation;mimo-ofdm;memory management unit;multipath propagation;multiplexing;nonlinear system;reconstruction conjecture;signal reconstruction;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;sparse matrix	Shengchu Wang;Yunzhou Li;Jing Wang	2013	2013 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing	10.1109/WCSP.2013.6677226	electronic engineering;machine learning;sparse approximation;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	78.93143978959374	-7.071397906541775	127071

We develop a geometric methodology to detect a fault in presence of a disturbance signal. In other words, the detection decision making process is decoupled from the disturbance signal. Specifically, we first consider the invariant subspaces of Inf-D systems and derive sufficient conditions for convergence of the computing algorithm corresponding to conditioned invariant subspaces. Then, by using the developed methodology necessary and sufficient conditions for solvability of the FD problem are provided.	algorithm;fault detection and isolation	Amir Baniamerian;Nader Meskin;Khashayar Khorasani	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7798461	control engineering;mathematical optimization;convergence;nonlinear system;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;fault detection and isolation;hilbert space	Robotics	68.35600055840628	0.9547651290408868	127912

This scenario is not covered by smooth techniques of chaos analysis or other techniques like the extension of Melnikov’s method for nonsmooth systems. In consequence, we propose to use an approximate model of the discontinuous system for which this technique can be applied, and compare the responses of both systems, the discontinuous and the approximate, when this last model is close, in a certain way, to the discontinuous system. One of the discontinuous terms, given by a sign function, is approximated by a saturation with high slope at the equilibrium point. Some conditions that determine the chaotic behavior of the approximate system are formally established, and the convergence of its chaotic orbits to some orbits of the discontinuous system, when the slope of the approximation is large enough, is shown. In particular, we show the similarity of the dynamical behavior of both systems where a chaotic behavior can be displayed, for a parameter region determined by the application of the Melnikov technique to nonsmooth systems. A comparison of the Feigenbaum diagrams, for a parameter range obtained from the application of this technique, shows the similarity of their dynamics and the chaotic nature of the discontinuous system.	approximation algorithm;chaos theory;dynamical system;experiment;feigenbaum constants;numerical analysis;reflections of signals on conducting lines;voronoi diagram	Jose Castro;Joaquin Alvarez	2015	I.

This contribution presents a new parameter-adaptive PID-controller, which is based on an explicit combination of a two-stage square-root parameter estimator and a numerical controller parameter optimization procedure. It can be applied to a wide range of dynamic processes as well as to the self-tuning of controller parameters during the implementation phase, as for continuing adaptive control. The adaptive control algorithms are implemented on a microprocessor-based controller. Application results are shown for self-tuning control of an air conditioner.	mathematical optimization;pid;stepwise regression	Friedrich Radke;Rolf Isermann	1987	Automatica	10.1016/0005-1098(87)90074-4	pid controller;control engineering;electronic engineering;controller;digital control;adaptive control;computer science;engineering;control theory;mathematics;estimation theory	Vision	71.65043456994191	-7.59521997492063	128133

Using the theory of uncertain dynamical systems, robust non-linear control strategies, with guaranteed tracking properties that can be quantified given bounds on the extent of model uncertainty, sensor noise, input disturbances, etc., are derived. A torque optimization strategy is also utilized to optimize the joint torques in the event of actuator saturation. The algorithm has been implemented using a single Motorola 12MHz MC68000 microprocessor on a three-link revolute joint manipulator constructed by the School of Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. Experimental results are presented here showing the feasibility and performance of the control stragegy.	algorithm;control system;dynamical system;image noise;mathematical optimization;microcontroller;microprocessor;motorola 68000;nonlinear system;robot	Mark W.

Better tracking allows for more data to be stored on a single disk. There are several factors which make this control problem difficult, such as high-frequency resonant modes, unknown disturbances, and a preset sampling rate. The resonant modes of a disk drive are often uncertain and vary between units and can also lie near or beyond the Nyquist frequency. Suppressing these modes can be difficult. However, a multirate adaptive notch filter and adaptive bandwidth controller is proposed to suppress these resonant modes. A robust online estimator that estimates the mode frequencies is used to allow the multirate adaptive notch filter to track the disk drive's modes. By adding a multirate scheme to the adaptive notch filter, it can suppress modes at higher frequencies, which are close to or beyond the Nyquist frequency of the preset sampling rate. As the multirate adaptive notch filter tracks the plant mode frequencies, the adaptive bandwidth controller ensures that stability and performance requirements are satisfied by using the online estimate of the mode frequencies. An adaptive disturbance rejector is added to the adaptive mode-suppression scheme and broken into two parts: a part to suppress the repeatable runout and another to attenuate the residual disturbance by using a neural model. Both parts are adapted online and combined with the mode-suppression scheme to ensure good disturbance rejection even in the presence of unknown or changing resonant modes. Simulation results with a hard disk drive as the application are included and show that the adaptive mode-suppression scheme is able to maintain stability and better performance than a nonadaptive counterpart for an uncertain resonant-mode frequency. When combined with the adaptive disturbance-rejection scheme, stability is maintained and an improvement of as much as 14.3% in 3sigma is seen. This improvement in tracking can allow for data to be stored more densely on a single disk, providing larger storage media for the same size of disk drive.	adaptive filter;adaptive system;bandwidth (signal processing);disk storage;feedforward neural network;hard disk drive;nyquist frequency;rejection sampling;requirement;sampling (signal processing);scheme;simulation;triple modular redundancy;zero suppression	Jason Levin;Petros A.

Although the uncontrolled device is asymptotically stable, active control is required to: (i) ensure that a finite radial air gap is maintained at all times, and (ii) attenuate the oscillations of the flywheel which reduce the efficiency of the motor generator. The paper presents the design of gain scheduled discrete time linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controllers for this rotordynamic system. Real time experiments are conducted to investigate the performance of the controllers. The result indicates that the LQR controller with approximate system velocities is easier to implement than the LQG controller, and also provides superior performance.	computer data storage;optimal control;radial (radio);radial basis function	Jr-Yi Shen;Brian C.

6971a1f57c770dcfc26f6bfa505de0ac9b1ae806	cycle periods of perturbed dynamical systems	dynamic system	In this paper we investigate the behavior of the fundamental periods of cycles of a perturbed dynamical system. Several of the results of Hdjek [2] and Ura [3] are generalized to perturbed dynamical systems. In particular, it is shown that the fundamental periods of cycles of a regularly perturbed planar dynamical system vary continuously. I f a cycle of a dynamical system is perturbed, it may change into a nonperiodic trajectory. Even if this does not occur and the perturbed cycles remain orbitally close to the unperturbed cycle, the fundamental periods may not vary continuously. For example, x(4)+ 5x (2) +4x = 0 has 2rr-periodic solutions sin 2 t + a sin t which tend uniformly to the u-periodic solution sin 2t as a -> 0. We shall show that this example is typical in the sense that the fundamental periods of cycles of a perturbed dynamical system vary lower semicontinuously. However, such a situation cannot occur in a planar dynamical system under regular perturbations where the fundamental periods vary continuously. In what follows R and R 2 will denote the real line and the plane respectively.

The traditional approach based on Lyapunov functions is not suitable for a system with many flows due to its complexity. In this paper, we present a normalized model to capture the essential system dynamics. Based on this normalized model, we find its equilibrium point and local stability criterion, which closely match the existing results. This, in turn, reinforce the correctness of our normalized model. We then proceed with a numerical analysis to obtain the global stability. Our results show that by properly choosing RED parameters, we can always make the TCP/RED system globally stable. In addition, our numerical results also show that any locally stable TCP/RED system is mostly globally stable as long as the number of flows is large.	complexity;correctness (computer science);lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;system dynamics	Xinbing Wang;Do Young Eun	2005	IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2005.

MMOs have been observed and studied for over thirty years in chemical, physical and biological systems. Few attempts have been made thus far to classify different patterns of MMOs, in contrast to the classification of the related phenomena of bursting oscillations. This paper gives a survey of different types of MMOs, concentrating its analysis on MMOs whose small-amplitude oscillations are produced by a local, multiple-time-scale “mechanism.” Recent work gives substantially improved insight into the mathematical properties of these mechanisms. In this survey, we unify diverse observations about MMOs and establish a systematic framework for studying their properties. Numerical methods for computing different types of invariant manifolds and their intersections are an important aspect of the analysis described in this paper.	biological system;dynamical system;mixed-signal integrated circuit;neural oscillation	Mathieu Desroches;John Guckenheimer;Bernd Krauskopf;Christian Kuehn;Hinke M.

718df192d6ffe4bbc57f561bb513f6a9ae9fa4b9	an iterative lmi-based reduced-order observer design for fractional-order chaos synchronization	nonlinear fractional order systems;chaos synchronization;reduced order observer;iterative lmi	In this paper, attempts are made to design a reduced-order observer for a nonlinear Lipschitz class of fractional-order systems. It is assumed that nonlinear terms not only depend onmeasurable states but depend on unknown states and inputs as well. The sufficient conditions for stability of the observer based on the Lyapunov technique are derived and converted into linearmatrix inequalities (LMIs). To overcome themain drawback of previous research studies which assumed that the sum of terms in infinite series coming from fractional derivative of a Lyapunov function is bounded and its upper bound is predefined, we used an iterative LMI-based algorithm to find out this bound. A four-wing chaotic system is implemented in both PSpice and MATLAB software as a case study. Simulation results are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed iterative LMI-based reduced-order observer in tracking the unmeasurable state variables of the chaotic fractional system in different initial conditions.	algorithm;chaos theory;initial condition;iteration;iterative method;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;matlab;mined;nonlinear system;simulation;synchronization of chaos	Mahdi Pourgholi;Elham Amini Boroujeni	2016	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-016-0253-3	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	68.56062322955401	-0.2616747134689575	130537

By using the conjugate system of the complex-valued neural networks and Brouwer?s fixed point theorem, sufficient conditions to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium are obtained. Some criteria on globally exponential stability of the equilibrium of the complex-valued neural networks are also established by using a delay differential inequality. These results are easy to apply to the study of the complex-valued neural networks whether their activation functions are explicitly expressed by separating their real and imaginary parts or not. Two examples with numerical simulations are given to highlight the effectiveness of the obtained results.	artificial neural network	Jie Pan;Xinzhi Liu;Wei-Chau Xie	2015	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2015.02.024	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;control theory;mathematics	ML	73.8841021210597	2.8190266661059993	130802

This holds for identical linear systems with eigenvalues either on the imaginary axis or in the open left half-plane, whilst for eigenvalues in the open right half-plane, we present a counterexample in which the strong solution to the associated algebraic Riccati equation is not diffusive. For nonidentical systems satisfying the internal model principle for synchronization, we show that a certain part of the coupling must be diffusive. For equally chosen weights in the cost functional, we show that the dimension of the associated algebraic Riccati equation can be reduced significantly.	algebraic riccati equation;apache axis;imaginary time;linear algebra;linear system;mathematical optimization;while	Jan Maximilian Montenbruck;Gerd S.

We analyze a number of features of this learning for a finite number of neurons and finite number of patterns. We discuss how the system behaves in the large but finite N limit. We analyze the basin of attraction of the patterns that have been learned, and we show that it is exponentially small in the age of the pattern.

In this paper we consider a linear parameter-varying model of the crane, where the time-varying parameter is the length of the suspending rope. We consider the set of models given by frozen values of the rope length and show how all these models can be reduced to a single time-invariant model using a suitable time scaling. The time scaling relation can be used to derive a control law for the time-varying system that implements an implicit gain scheduling. Using a Lyapunov-like theorem, it is also possible to find relative upper bounds for the rate of change of the varying parameter that ensure the stability of the time-varying system.	core rope memory;image scaling;lyapunov fractal;optimal control;scheduling (computing);time-invariant system	Giorgio Corriga;Alessandro Giua;Giampaolo Usai	1998	IEEE Trans.

The novelty of the proposed approach is the design of a nonsmooth switching line, based on the quantization of the uncertainties affecting the system. The quantized uncertainty levels allow one to define nested box sets in the auxiliary state space, i.e., the space of the sliding variable and its first time derivative, and select suitable control amplitudes for each set, in order to guarantee the convergence of the sliding variable to the sliding manifold in a finite time. The proposed algorithm is theoretically analyzed, proving the existence of an upperbound of the reaching time to the origin through the considered quantization levels.

In addition to the extension to asymmetric sector conditions, the current approach, based on the recent work of Leonov (2005), yields results that are both necessary and sufficient for absolute stability. An asymmetric sector condition allows different sector bounds to be imposed in different regions of the state space, and removes the restriction that the system nonlinearity be confined to only the first and third quadrants. This work applies to second-order systems. The necessary and sufficient conditions are derived by comparing the vector field of the nonlinear system with that of certain piecewise linear systems. As an example, stabilization of a supercavitating (underwater) vehicle system is considered and it is shown that the new results are less conservative than those obtained with classical theory, which requires imposition of a symmetric sector condition.	linear system;nonlinear system;piecewise linear continuation;state space	Guojian Lin;Bala Balachandran;Eyad H.

Commonly, the uniform projection scheme on a hypersphere is used to estimate the local mean. However, the unbalanced data distribution in high-dimensional space often conflicts with the uniform samples and its performance is sensitive to the noise components. Considering the common fact that the vibration signal is generated by three sensors located in different measuring positions in the domain of the structural health monitoring for the key equipment, thus a novel trivariate empirical mode decomposition via convex optimization was proposed for rolling bearing condition identification in this paper. For the trivariate data matrix, the low-rank matrix approximation via convex optimization was firstly conducted to achieve the denoising. It is worthy to note that the non-convex penalty function as a regularization term is introduced to enhance the performance. Moreover, the non-uniform sample scheme was determined by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to the obtained low-rank trivariate data and then the approach used in conventional MEMD algorithm was employed to estimate the local mean. Numerical examples of synthetic defined by the fault model and real data generated by the fault rolling bearing on the experimental bench are provided to demonstrate the fruitful applications of the proposed method.	alcam gene;alcam wt allele;acclimatization;algorithm;approximation;automation;conflict (psychology);convex function;convex optimization;experiment;fault model;feature extraction;hilbert–huang transform;information processing;ising model;mathematical optimization;natural science disciplines;noise reduction;numerical method;numerous;penalty method;principal component analysis;signal processing;simulation;singular value decomposition;state or province of exposure to illness:loc:pt:^patient:nom;synthetic intelligence;test bench;unbalanced circuit;funding grant;sensor (device)	Yong Lv;Houzhuang Zhang;Cancan Yi	2018		10.3390/s18072325	hilbert–huang transform;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;engineering;convex optimization;bearing (mechanical)	ML	81.36465969339726	-7.674946347638122	132975

We first propose our main result, an output feedback control procedure, taking advantage of measurements of the uncertain part, able to globally stabilize the system toward an adjustable equilibrium point in the positive orthant. Though quite general, this result is based on hypotheses that might be difficult to check in practice. Then in a second step, through a theorem on a class of nonnegative systems linking the existence of a positive equilibrium to its global asymptotic stability, we propose other hypotheses for our main result to hold. These new hypotheses are more restrictive but much simpler to check.

2725c8ee1fc3e3ff3acb70415a8585f595cdee42	stabilization of max-plus-linear systems using receding horizon control - the unconstrained case		Max-plus-linear (MPL) systems are a class of discrete-event systems that can be described by models that are “linear” in the max-plus algebra. MPL systems arise in the context of e.g. manufacturing systems, telecommunication networks, railway networks, and parallel computing. We derive a receding horizon control scheme for MPL systems that guarantees a priori stability (in the sense of boundedness of the normalized state) of the closed-loop system in the “unconstrained” case. We also discuss the main properties of the resulting receding horizon controllers.	control theory;hybrid system;linear system;multiphoton lithography;parallel computing;petri net;recueil des historiens des croisades	Ion Necoara;Ton J.

The approximation error, which is captured by means of the stochastic L 2 gain, is bounded from above by twice the sum of singular numbers associated to the truncated states, similar to the case of linear time-invariant systems. A two step model reduction algorithm for hidden Markov models is also developed. The first step relies on the aforementioned balanced truncation algorithm due to a topological equivalence established between hidden Markov models and a subclass of stochastic jump linear systems. In a second step the positivity constraints, which reflect the hidden Markov model structure, are enforced by solving a low dimensional optimization problem.	algorithm;approximation error;hidden markov model;linear system;linear time-invariant theory;markov chain;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;time complexity;time-invariant system;truncation;turing completeness	Georgios Kotsalis;Alexandre Megretski;Munther A.

Conditions on the nondivergence and global attractivity are established by using local inhibition, respectively. Moreover, exponential convergence of the networks is studied by using local invariant sets. The analysis in the paper employs results from the theory of differential equations with discontinuous right-hand sides as introduced by Filippov.

One such interpretation of system structure is a system's signal structure, characterized as the open-loop causal dependencies among manifest variables and represented by its dynamical structure function. Although this notion of structure is among the weakest available, previous work has shown that if no a priori structural information is known about the system, not even the Boolean structure of the dynamical structure function is identifiable. Consequently, one method previously suggested for obtaining the necessary a priori structural information is to leverage knowledge about target specificity of the controlled inputs. This work extends these results to demonstrate precisely the a priori structural information that is both necessary and sufficient to reconstruct the network from input-output data. This extension is important because it significantly broadens the applicability of the identifiability conditions, enabling the design of network reconstruction experiments that were previously impossible due to practical constraints on the types of actuation mechanisms available to the engineer or scientist. The work is motivated by the proteomics problem of reconstructing the Per-Arnt-Sim Kinase pathway used in the metabolism of sugars.	boolean network;causal filter;dynamical system;experiment;gene regulatory network;interconnection;linear time-invariant theory;proteomics;sensitivity and specificity	J.

However, flexibility brings with it unwanted oscillations and severe chattering which may even lead to an unstable system. To tackle these challenges, a two-time scale controller is presented to track a desired tip point signal and at the same time mitigate the tip point vibration. To obtain more precise information of the tip point location and facilitate the easy extension to multiple-flexible-link problems, a camera is used to provide vision feedback in which the delayed vision signal is compensated by the state estimator and predictor. The controller is experimentally verified, and shown to exceed the performance of other tested controllers.	control theory;experiment;kerrison predictor;point location;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;steady state;stemming	Yunjun Xu;Erich Ritz	2009	2009 American Control Conference	10.1109/TCST.2008.2011890	robust control;control engineering;variable structure control;linear-quadratic regulator;simulation;internationalization and localization;compliant mechanism;stability;sliding mode control;boundary layer;strain gauge;engineering;vibration;vibration control;point location;control theory;feedback;software testing;robotics;visual servoing;oscillation;arm architecture	Robotics	73.06375283560348	-8.814524211630538	133756

The map definition is based on the hyperbolic tangent function, so it is called the tanh map. We demonstrate that the Lyapunov exponent of the tanh map is robust, remaining practically unaltered with the variation of its parameters. As the main application, we consider a chaotic communication system based on symbolic dynamics with advantages over current approaches that use piecewise linear maps. In this context, we propose a new measure, namely, the spread rate, to study the local structure of the chaotic dynamics of a one-dimensional chaotic map.	chaos theory;lyapunov fractal;map;piecewise linear continuation;robustness (computer science)	Daniel P.

This article describes an adaptive algorithm that adaptively adjusts the controller parameters to suit the trajectory signal. The algorithm can be used for both minimum and nonminimum systems. Taking full advantage of the ability to preview the reference trajectory, tuning of the gain compensation filter can be made in advance to further reduce the tracking error when there are changes in the dominant frequency component of the trajectory signal. The advance learning can be done completely before the actual run, and appropriate controller parameters are simply recalled during the actual run to minimize the real-time computation. Advance learning can also be done during the actual run by running the estimator ahead of time to ensure faster convergence; hence there will be smaller tracking error when there are changes in the pattern of the reference trajectory. This look-ahead learning can significantly improve the tracking error.		M. M. Mustafa;N. R.

9363939808d7b53c3542f4f8b940b94efebc4902	computation of lower bounds for the induced l2 norm of lpv systems		SummaryrnrnDetermining the induced norm of a linear parameter-varying (LPV) system is an integral part of many analysis and robust control design procedures. Most prior work has focused on efficiently computing upper bounds for the induced norm. The conditions for upper bounds are typically based on scaled small-gain theorems with dynamic multipliers or dissipation inequalities with parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions. This paper presents a complementary algorithm to compute lower bounds for the induced norm. The proposed approach computes a lower bound on the gain by restricting the parameter trajectory to be a periodic signal. This restriction enables the use of recent results for exact calculation of the norm for a periodic linear time varying system. The proposed lower bound algorithm also returns a worst-case parameter trajectory for the LPV system that can be further analyzed to provide insight into the system performance.

The (position and velocity) observer is based on the Riemannian structure of the configuration manifold endowed with the kinetic energy metric and is intrinsic. They proved local convergence. When the system is conservative, we propose an intrinsic reduced order (velocity) observer based on the Jacobi metric, which can be initialized such that it converges exponentially for any initial true velocity. For non-conservative systems the observer can be used as a complement to the one of Aghannan and Rouchon. More generally the reduced observer provides velocity estimation for geodesic flow with position measurements. Thus it can be (formally) used as a fluid flow soft sensor in the case of a perfect incompressible fluid. When the curvature is negative in all planes the geodesic flow is sensitive to initial conditions. Surprisingly in this case we have global exponential convergence and the more unstable the flow is, faster is the convergence.	algorithm;complement (complexity);control theory;converge;gyroscope;initial condition;instability;jacobi method;lagrangian system;local convergence;maupertuis' principle;maximal set;nonlinear system;time complexity;topography;utility;velocity (software development)	Silvere Bonnabel	2010	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2010.2052481	lagrangian mechanics;local convergence;lagrangian system;systems modeling;topology;convergence;nonlinear control;design methods;metric;system identification;manifold;calculus;compressibility;mathematical model;kinetic energy;contraction;mathematics;geometry;curvature;mechanical system;lie group;initial value problem;measurement	Robotics	73.73872778846282	-5.092200985245642	135223

Using the notion of dissipativity, the interconnection of systems is guaranteed to be finite-gain stable under the condition that the dc loop gain is contractive. This work builds on Griggs, and exploits a new set of frequency dependent triplets that was introduced in above reference to “mix” two unconditional stability statements, i.e., small-gain and passivity. Unlike the above reference the present work explores the important question of how a conditional stability statement as needed when two negative-imaginary systems are connected in a feedback loop can be “mixed” with an unconditional stability statement as needed when two contractive systems are connected in a feedback loop. The usefulness of the proposed analytical framework is demonstrated via a numerical example.	causal filter;imaginary time;interconnection;linear time-invariant theory;numerical analysis;positive feedback;time complexity;time-invariant system	Sourav Patra;Alexander Lanzon	2011	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2011.2122670	control engineering;electronic engineering;von neumann stability analysis;positive feedback;stability;lti system theory;feedback loop;control theory;feedback;mathematics;linear system;numerical stability	Visualization	68.96131070240247	1.5594355433659384	135491

These eVEHs are fundamentally nonlinear regardless of whether a linear or nonlinear resonator is being used. The model of the system under investigation has the form of a piecewise-smooth dynamical system of a Filippov type that has a specific discontinuity in the form of a hold-on term. We use a perturbation technique called the multiple scales method to develop a theory to analyze the steady-state dynamics of the system, be it with a linear or a nonlinear resonator. We then analyze the stability of the steady-state orbit to determine when the first doubling bifurcation occurs in the system. This gives an upper bound on the region of steady-state oscillations which allows us to determine a theoretical limit on the power convertible by the eVEH. We then turn our discussion to the nonlinear behavior we see in the system's transition to chaos. Since the eVEH studied here is a Filippov type system, sliding modes and sliding bifurcations are possible in the system. We discuss the evolution of the sliding region and give particular examples of sliding phenomena and sliding bifurcations. An understanding of sliding phenomena is required for analyzing the transition to chaos since segments of sliding motion appear on trajectories that undergo period-doubling bifurcations. The transition to chaos is explained in detail by the example of the system with a linear resonator, however we discuss examples of the system with mechanical nonlinearities and discuss the difference between the linear and nonlinear cases.

The existence of the game value is proved. For the proof of the related dynamic programming principle (DDP) for the lower and upper value functions, the measurability problem, of the same kind as mentioned in the paper of Fleming and Souganidis, is also encountered, and we are able to get around it via a delicate adaptation of their technique. Moreover, the traditional direct method to prove the time continuity of lower and upper value functions also gives rise to a serious measurability problem. To get around the new difficulty, a subtle dynamic programming argument is developed to obtain the time continuity, which in return is used to derive the DDP for random intermediate times from the DDP with deterministic intermediate times.	data-directed programming;direct method in the calculus of variations;dynamic programming;minimax;scott continuity;viscosity solution	Shanjian Tang;Shui-hung Hou	2007	SIAM J.

Little research is proposed for the intrinsic analysis of an affine-type fuzzy system. Further, the controllers to regulate or to achieve servo control of affine TS-based nonlinear systems are also few. Both affine-type fuzzy regulation and servo control design scheme are theoretically derived. A simple Lyapunovbased stability criterion and some extra conditions are proposed to guarantee the global stability of the generated closed-loop fuzzy systems. The exponential stability of the feedback fuzzy system is ensured under some conditions. The performance of the proposed fuzzy controllers and fuzzy servo controllers is examined by three case studies. Simulation results show that the proposed controllers can stabilize these affine fuzzy systems and the proposed servomechanism can adapt itself to various incoming signals in very short time spans. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Several sufficient conditions are derived for ascertaining the existence of 3n equilibrium points and the exponential stability of 2n equilibrium points via state space partition by using the geometrical properties of activation functions and algebraic properties of nonsingular M-matrix. Compared with existing results, the conditions herein are much more computable with one order less linear matrix inequalities. Furthermore, the attraction basins of these exponentially stable equilibrium points are estimated. It is revealed that the attraction basins of the 2n equilibrium points can be larger than their originally partitioned subspaces. Three numerical examples are elaborated with typical nonmonotonic activation functions to substantiate the efficacy and characteristics of the theoretical results.	activation function;artificial neural network;computable function;linear algebra;linear matrix inequality;neural networks;non-monotonic logic;numerical analysis;recurrent neural network;simulation;state space;time complexity	Peng Liu;Zhigang Zeng;Jun Wang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems	10.1109/TSMC.2015.2461191	artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics	ML	74.28397224693788	3.0464867930035737	137770

In order to alleviate some of these limitations, it may be desirable to derive simple control policies, such as step functions with fixed magnitude and length (or temporal pulses). In this technical note, we further develop a recently proposed pulse-based solution to the convergence problem, i.e., minimizing the convergence time to the target exponentially stable equilibrium, for monotone systems. In particular, we extend this solution to monotone systems with parametric uncertainty. Our solutions also provide worst case estimates on convergence times. Furthermore, we indicate how our tools can be used for a class of nonmonotone systems, and more importantly how these tools can be extended to other control problems. We illustrate our approach on switching under parametric uncertainty and regulation around a saddle point problems in a genetic toggle switch system.	best, worst and average case;koopmans' theorem;switch;synthetic biology;monotone	Aivar Sootla;Damien Ernst	2018	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2017.2736941	mathematics;control theory;monotone polygon;step function;mathematical optimization;convergence problem;parametric statistics;exponential stability;optimal control;saddle point;pulse (signal processing)	ML	69.43263101331425	1.2337717533488726	138321

One of the two ratchets is acting as a drive system, while the other one represents the response system. Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, the essential conditions, under which the error nonlinear system is transformed into an equivalent passive system and globally asymptotically stabilized at equilibrium points, are established. With these results, synchronization, not only between two non-identical ratchets with known parameters but also between two different uncertain ratchets, are realized via adaptive passive controllers and parameter update algorithm. The direction of transporting particles can be dominated along expected one and it is useful to control the motion of tiny particles, ratchetlike devices in nanoscience.

Through introducing two new concepts-the Lip constant of a nonlinear operator and strongly equivalent metrics of a norm-we show that the nonlinear discrete dynamical systems are exponentially stable on the bounded set if and only if the corresponding nonlinear operator is contractive under some strongly equivalent metrics, or if and only if the Lip constant of the nonlinear operator is less than one. In the latter case, we further show that the infimum of the exponential bounds of trajectories of the system equals exactly to the Lip constant. Based on the obtained results, we clearly explain how trajectory convergence properties of the systems are determined quantitatively by the Lip constant and strongly equivalent metrics. The obtained results not only are of importance in understanding the essence of exponential stability and trajectory convergence properties of nonlinear discrete dynamical systems on bounded sets of the state space but also provide some new, useful criteria of testing exponential stability and estimating convergence speed of trajectories of the systems.	bibo stability;coefficient;dynamical system;exponential map (discrete dynamical systems);fastest;nonlinear system;numerical stability;state space;time complexity	Lisheng Wang;Zongben Xu	2007	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2007.906193	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;nonlinear system;control theory;mathematics;exponential stability	ML	70.1003942283914	2.065228052562584	138698

By defining new Lyapunov functions and by making use of novel techniques to achieve delay dependence, several new conditions are obtained for the asymptotic stability of these systems. The merit of the proposed conditions lies in their less conservativeness, which is achieved by circumventing the utilization of some bounding inequalities for cross products between two vectors and by paying careful attention to the subtle difference between the terms Sigmam=k-dk k-1(middot) and Sigma m=k-dM k-1(middot), which is largely ignored in the existing literature. These conditions are shown, via several examples, to be much less conservative than some existing result	lyapunov fractal	Huijun Gao;Tongwen Chen	2007	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2006.890320	robust control;control engineering;discrete time and continuous time;von neumann stability analysis;lyapunov function;networked control system;calculus;control theory;mathematics	Embedded	71.5519958804374	-1.6930858056591016	138737

By using some adaptive gains designed in the sliding surface function, the virtual input and the controllers, not only the mismatched perturbations are automatically overcome during the sliding mode, but also the property of asymptotical stability of controlled systems is achieved at the same time. Furthermore, the knowledge of the upper bound of partial perturbations is not required. Controlling a two-link robot manipulator is given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control scheme.	asymptote;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system	Yaote Chang	2009	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2009.2033748	control engineering;mathematical optimization;adaptive control;backstepping;nonlinear system;control system;automatic control;control theory;mathematics;robotics	Robotics	71.81160967184294	-4.351620729699285	138938

To solve this problem, a feedback compensator is used, which is decomposed into an observer part, a state predictive part, and a static feedback part. Then, the analysis of the closed loop system is made on an equivalent linear system without delay. Based on the geometric approach, we solve two different disturbance attenuation problems, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for their solvability.	block cipher mode of operation;closed-loop transfer function;coupling (computer programming);display lag;feedback;linear system;optimal control	Michael Di Loreto;Jean Jacques Loiseau;Jean-François Lafay	2005	Proceedings of the 44th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1016/j.automatica.2007.12.003	control engineering;electronic engineering;optimal control;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Robotics	71.99158692002035	-3.351763545864838	138980

More concretely, the first Lyapunov exponent and the attractor plot were obtained for the time series data of x- and y-directional eye-gaze locations. An attempt was made to compare the first Lyapunov exponent and the attractor plot during a visual search task as a function of layout complexity of the display and to verify whether chaotic properties existed in the fluctuation of eye-gaze locations, and to examine how the scaling properties change as a function of the layout complexity. First Lyapunov exponent of the time series of eye-gaze locations took positive values, and tended to increase with the increase of search task difficulty (layout complexity). The attractor plot drew a trajectory like an ellipse, and the variation in attractor plots tended to be more complicated with the increase of task difficulty.	dynamical system;lyapunov fractal	Atsuo Murata;Tomoya Matsuura	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20916-6_8	nonlinear system;lyapunov exponent;attractor;eye movement	ML	80.33326034036395	3.023930448025918	139053

Network-based T–S fuzzy dynamic positioning system (DPS) models for the UMV are first established. Then, stability and stabilization criteria are derived by taking into consideration an asynchronous difference between the normalized membership function of the T–S fuzzy DPS and that of the controller. The proposed stabilization criteria can stabilize states of the UMV. The dynamic positioning performance analysis verifies the effectiveness of the networked modeling and the controller design.	abetimus sodium;actuator device component;appendix;controllers;forty nine;fuzzy set;hp 48 series;lyapunov fractal;model–view–controller;pictbridge;positioning system;routh–hurwitz stability criterion;sampling (signal processing);social inequality;t-norm fuzzy logics;unmanned aerial vehicle;yaws	Yongjun Wang;Qing-Long Han;Minrui Fei;Chen Peng	2018	IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics	10.1109/TCYB.2018.2829730	robustness (computer science);control theory;mathematical optimization;fuzzy logic;vehicle dynamics;control theory;mathematics;asynchronous communication;membership function;dynamic positioning	Robotics	68.79070493578784	-1.2825267169253751	139252

In particular, a well-designed sensing matrix can reduce the coherence between the atoms of the equivalent dictionary, and as a consequence, reduce the reconstruction error. In some applications, the signals of interest can be well approximated by a union of a small number of subspaces (e.g., face recognition and motion segmentation). This implies the existence of a dictionary which leads to block-sparse representations. In this work, we propose a framework for sensing matrix design that improves the ability of block-sparse approximation techniques to reconstruct and classify signals. This method is based on minimizing a weighted sum of the interblock coherence and the subblock coherence of the equivalent dictionary. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves signal recovery and classification ability of the Block-OMP algorithm compared to sensing matrix optimization methods that do not employ block structure.	approximation algorithm;cache coherence;compressed sensing;detection theory;dictionary;experiment;facial recognition system;mathematical optimization;openmp;semidefinite programming;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;weight function	Kevin Rosenblum;Lihi Zelnik-Manor;Yonina C.

The methodology can be applied to non-minimum phase systems if the non-minimum phase zeros are modeled to a sufficient accuracy. The control architecture is comprised of a linear controller and a neural network. The neural network operates over a tapped delay line of memory units, comprised of the system's input/output signals. The adaptive laws for the neural-network weights employ a linear observer of the nominal system's error dynamics. Ultimate boundedness of the error signals is shown through Lyapunov's direct method.

Based on the asymptotical property of the parametric generalized algebraic Riccati equations, a low-and-high gain state feedback control law and a scheduling technique are proposed.When applied to the singular system subject to input saturation and external disturbance, the semi-global finite-gain Lp-stabilization and semiglobal/global asymptotic stabilization are obtained simultaneously. The obtained results reduce to the existing ones for non-singular linear systems when the linear singular system reduces to a non-singular system. Furthermore, our results also improve the semi-global stabilization results for singular systems with saturation in the absence of the external disturbance. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Since friction is generally velocity dependent and controlled mechanical systems are often equipped with position sensors only, friction compensation requires some form of velocity estimation. Here, the velocity estimate is provided by a reduced-order observer. The friction is modeled by a set-valued velocity map including an exponential Stribeck curve. For the resulting discontinuous closed-loop dynamics, both the case of exact friction compensation and nonexact friction compensation are investigated. For the case of exact friction compensation, design rules in terms of controller and observer parameter settings, guaranteeing global exponential stability of the set-point are proposed. If the proposed design rules are not fulfilled, the system can exhibit a nonzero steady-state error and limit cycling. Moreover, in the case of nonexact friction compensation, it is shown that undercompensation leads to the existence of an equilibrium set and overcompensation leads to limit cycling. These results are obtained both numerically and experimentally.	experiment;motion compensation;numerical analysis;robot;sensor;steady state;time complexity;velocity (software development)	Niels Mallon;Nathan van de Wouw;Devi Putra;Henk Nijmeijer	2006	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2005.863674	control engineering;engineering;calculus;control theory;mathematics;robotics;exponential stability;mechanical system	Robotics	73.44750102547022	-5.0495512197194445	140462

The results illustrate that behaviors constrained by local order properties extend beyond the well-studied class of linear positive systems and monotone systems, which both require a constant cone field and a linear state space.	positive systems;state space;whole earth 'lectronic link;monotone	Fulvio Forni;Rodolphe Sepulchre	2016	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2015.2437523	control engineering;mathematical optimization;manifold;trajectory;control theory;mathematics;open system;oscillation	Visualization	69.27466759579448	2.4714017046146615	140526

The proposed controller avoids the pre-identification training phase of the forward model by taking into consideration model uncertainty when calculating the control law. It is suitable for linear and nonlinear, deterministic and stochastic control systems that are characterized by functional uncertainty. Convergence of the proposed DHP adaptive critic method to the correct value of the cost function is proven by evaluating analytically the correct value of the cost function, which satisfies the Bellman equation, and compares it to that calculated by the proposed method in a simple linear quadratic example. Moreover, the performance of the proposed cautious controller is demonstrated on linear one-dimensional and multidimensional examples.	stochastic process	Randa Herzallah	2007	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2007.01.023	control engineering;systems modeling;stochastic control;artificial intelligence;deterministic system;control theory;mathematics;bellman equation;artificial neural network;satisfiability	Robotics	73.23856583342861	-5.23264426731557	140682

It is shown that RCAC is able to stabilize the plant despite the high-frequency dynamics, unless the controllability of unstable modes is not lost due to sampling. However, the intersample command-following performance may be nonzero due to aliasing of disturbances.	aliasing;control theory;converge;numerical analysis;nyquist frequency;rejection sampling;sampling (signal processing)	E.

A model of fractal dynamics is proposed. The characteristics of fractal dynamics are studied in the frequency and time domains. It is shown that with fractal parasitic dynamics SM control systems will always feature chattering and non-ideal closedloop performance.

Under several conditions, the boundaries of the attracting basins of the stable equilibria of a completely stable CNN system are composed of the closures of the stable manifolds of unstable equilibria of (n - 1) dimensions. As demonstrations of this idea, under the conditions proposed in the literature which depicts stable and unstable equilibria, we identify the attraction basin of each stable equilibrium of which the boundary is composed of the stable manifolds of the unstable equilibria precisely. We also investigate the attracting basins of a simple class of symmetric 1-D CNNs via identifying the unstable equilibria of which the stable manifold is (n - 1) dimensional and the completely stable asymmetric CNNs with stable equilibria less than 2n.	arabic numeral 0;control theory;dimensions;equilibrium;less than;neural network simulation;neural networks;pattern formation;saturation arithmetic;stable model semantics;unstable medical device problem;manifold	Wenlian Lu;Lili Wang;Tianping Chen	2011	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks	10.1109/TNN.2010.2102048	mathematical optimization;cellular neural network;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;artificial neural network	Robotics	74.79565574927447	2.964775869413577	141009

Exploiting this extension, we give several results concerning stability and robustness for a homogeneous in the bi-limit vector field. The second tool is a new recursive observer design procedure for a chain of integrator. Combining these two tools we propose a new global asymptotic stabilization result by output feedback for feedback and feedforward systems.	approximation;block cipher mode of operation;feedforward neural network;nonlinear system;recursion (computer science)	Vincent Andrieu;Laurent Praly;Alessandro Astolfi	2008	SIAM J.

The technique involves the use of the solution of the algebraic Riccati equation for the infinite-time case (hence the technique is approximate) and the change of variables that converts a state-dependent, nonlinear, differential Riccati equation (SD-DRE) to a linear differential Lyapunov equation (DLE) which can be solved in analytical form.

Linear matrix inequalities are derived from both dissipation-based constraint and dissipation inequality for the closed-loop system. The dissipation-based constraint facilitates the stabilization with ΔVk  0 and decreasing (not necessarily monotoincally), instead of ΔVk < 0 along the trajectory.

To do this, the useful ranking information of the normalized fuzzy weighting functions is utilized in order to give a denser subdivision of the normalized fuzzy weighting function space and therefore essentially yields the proposed ranking-based switching mechanism. Based on the obtained switching mechanism, a family of switching observers can be developed for the purpose of guaranteeing the estimation error system to be asymptotically stable with less conservatism than the existing results available in the references. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the advantages of the proposed method. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

By considering the distribution of membership functions in a unified membership space, a graphical approach is provided to analyze the conservativeness of membership-dependent stability conditions. Membership function extrema are used to construct a simple and tighter convex polyhedron that encloses the membership trajectory and produces less conservative linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions. The cases of both type-1 and interval type-2 T-S fuzzy systems are considered, and comparison with existing methods is made in the proposed membership vector framework.	aleurites (plant);angiotensin ii receptor, type 2;appendix;bees;checking (action);earthbound;fuzzy control system;graphical user interface;linear matrix inequality;maxima and minima;membership function (mathematics);natural science disciplines;pollard's p − 1 algorithm;polyhedron;social inequality;vertex (graph theory)	Xiaozhan Yang	2019	Fuzzy Sets and Systems	10.1016/j.fss.2018.01.018		Embedded	71.42259516394596	0.20561711082179984	142016

In many multiscale bases (e.g. wavelets), signals of interest (e.g. piecewise-smooth signals) not only have few significant coefficients, but also those significant coefficients are well-organized in trees. We propose to exploit this sparse tree representation as additional prior information for linear inverse problems with limited numbers of measurements. In particular, our proposed algorithm named tree-based orthogonal matching pursuit (TOMP) is shown to provide significant better reconstruction compared to methods that only use sparse representation assumption.	algorithm;coefficient;matching pursuit;signal reconstruction;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;wavelet	Chinh La;Minh N.

These changes may cause fast continuous transients in state variables. Time scale and parameter abstractions simplify the analysis of these transients, causing discontinuities in the state variables. The two abstraction types have a very different impact on the analysis of system behavior. We have developed a systematic modeling approach that introduces formal semantics for behavior generation. This paper discusses the implementation of this scheme in a hybrid observer designed to track embedded system behavior. The resultant observer is based on piecewise simpler continuous models with mode transitions defined between them. Actual mode transitions in the system are provided by a digital controller and directly obtained from measuring physical variables.	dynamical system	Pieter J.

In a signal processing system, the problem arises of processing the random projections directly, without first reconstructing the signal. In this paper, we show that circulant sensing matrices allow to perform a variety of classical signal processing tasks such as filtering, interpolation, registration, transforms, and so forth, directly in the compressed domain and in an exact fashion, i.e., without relying on estimators as proposed in the existing literature. The advantage of the techniques presented in this paper is to enable direct measurement-to-measurement transformations, without the need of costly recovery procedures.	circulant matrix;compressed sensing;dimensionality reduction;filter (signal processing);interpolation;signal processing;sparse matrix	Diego Valsesia;Enrico Magli	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853750	computer vision;mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;signal processing;mathematics;compressed sensing	Robotics	77.46492721662548	-6.699505328052001	142552

If the influence of an exogenous periodic excitation is sufficiently long, the internal circadian “clock” adjusts the phase and period to the external signal. The pattern of zeitgeber's oscillations is then reproduced for a long duration by the pacemaker, even when isolated from the environment. In recent years, the phenomenon of entrainment of biological clocks has been the subject of extensive experimental research, mainly focusing on revelation of dependencies between the “free-run” and disturbed circadian cycles. Meanwhile, the mathematical model of entrainment is still far from being well understood; to the best of the authors' knowledge, neither conventional mathematical definitions of entrainment nor mathematical proofs of this property for realistic models of circadian oscillators have been elaborated. In this paper, we make a substantial effort towards filling this gap, by considering dynamics of Goodwin-type oscillators under periodic excitations. We show that any periodic external signal gives birth to a periodic solution of the same period, which is in general non-unique. Along with increasing signal amplitude, the forced solution becomes not only unique but also asymptotically stable. This sheds light on the mathematical meaning of the entrainment phenomena and confirms the entrainability of circadian rhythms by sufficiently strong periodic signals, reported in the biological literature.	artificial cardiac pacemaker;brainwave entrainment;clock signal;electronic oscillator;emitter-coupled logic;experiment;kinetics internet protocol;mathematical model;numerical stability;oscillator (cellular automaton);repressilator;routh–hurwitz stability criterion;simulation;the matrix;type system	Anton V.

To achieve the result, we first consider the system representations based on rough path analysis; then, we provide the notion of asymptotic stability in roughness to analyze the stability for the systems. In the procedure, we also confirm that the system representations include stochastic differential equations; we also found that asymptotic stability in roughness is the same property as uniform almost sure asymptotic stability provided by Bardi and Cesaroni. After the discussion, we confirm that there is a case that deterministic noises are capable of making the origin become asymptotically stable in roughness while stochastic noises do not achieve the same stabilization results.	bounded variation;dynamical system;path analysis (statistics)	Yuki Nishimura	2015	CoRR	10.1002/rnc.3553	control engineering;mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;control theory;mathematics	ML	69.55051893487227	1.2025932667904229	142918

The effect of both variation range and distribution probability of the time delay are taken into account in the proposed approach. The stochastic disturbances are described in terms of a Brownian motion and the time-varying delay is characterized by introducing a Bernoulli stochastic variable. By employing a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, sufficient delay-distribution-dependent conditions are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that guarantee the existence of the state estimator which can be checked readily by the Matlab toolbox. The main feature of the results obtained in this paper is that they are dependent on not only the bound but also the distribution probability of the time delay, and we obtain a larger allowance variation range of the delay, hence our results are less conservative than the traditional delay-independent ones. One example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed result.

A method for fault detection (FD) of networked control systems with unknown network-induced delay and unknown input based on eigendecomposition, adaptive evaluation and adaptive threshold is proposed in this paper. In the method, a known structure matrix of network-induced delay which is supposed to be smaller than one sampling period is extracted by eigendecomposition and an observer based residual generator is constructed. Then an adaptive evaluation function is proposed to ensure the optimal robustness to network-induced delay and unknown input at the evaluation stage based on the Parity Space approach. Finally, based on the estimation of the maximal influence of unknown random delay and unknown input on the evaluation function, adaptive threshold is designed to enhance robustness of the FD system and reduce the miss detection rate as much as possible.	control system;evaluation function;fault detection and isolation;maximal set;network computing system;primary source;sampling (signal processing)	Yongqiang Wang;Hao Ye;Guizeng Wang	2007	Int.

First, the NCS is modelled as a linear system with an interval time– varying delay. Second, a delay decomposition approach is developed to derive a less conservative bounded real lemma (BRL). Based on this BRL, delay-dependent conditions for the existence of a state feedback controller, which ensures internally asymptotic stability and a prescribed H1 performance level of the closedloop system, are derived in terms of a nonlinear matrix inequality. Third, the nonconvex feasibility problem is converted into a nonlinear minimization problem subject to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), from which the suitable controller can be designed by an iterative algorithm. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.	algorithm;control system;control theory;iterative method;linear matrix inequality;linear system;network computing system;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;social inequality	Xian-Ming Zhang;Qing-Long Han	2009	Eur.

For a small number of samples, such methods are exposed to performance breakdown, as the sample covariance matrix can largely deviate from the true covariance matrix. In this paper, the problem of DOA estimation performance breakdown is investigated. We consider the structure of the sample covariance matrix and the dynamics of the root-MUSIC algorithm. The performance breakdown in the threshold region is associated with the subspace leakage where some portion of the true signal subspace resides in the estimated noise subspace. In this paper, the subspace leakage is theoretically derived. We also propose a two-step method that improves the performance by modifying the sample covariance matrix such that the amount of the subspace leakage is reduced. Furthermore, we introduce a phenomenon named as root-swap which occurs in the root-MUSIC algorithm in the low sample size region and degrades the performance of the DOA estimation. A new method is then proposed to alleviate this problem. Numerical examples and simulation results are given for uncorrelated and correlated sources to illustrate the improvement achieved by the proposed methods. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are combined with the pseudo-noise resampling method to further improve the performance.	direction of arrival;kernel density estimation;numerical method;paging;resampling (statistics);root-finding algorithm;signal subspace;simulation;spectral leakage	Mahdi Shaghaghi;Sergiy A.

The scheme is described in two steps, namely the perturbation and the incremental steps, when the time delay and the feedback gain are taken as the bifurcation parameters. As for applications, the method is employed to investigate the delay-induced weak resonant double Hopf bifurcation and dynamics in the van der Pol-Duffing and the Stuar-Landau systems with delayed feedback. For bifurcation parameters close to a double Hopf point, all solutions arising from the resonant bifurcation are classified qualitatively, and expressed approximately in a closed form by the perturbation step of the PIS. Although the analytical expression may not be accurate enough for bifurcation parameters away from the double Hopf point, it is used as an initial guess for the incremental step which updates the approximate expression iteratively and performs parametric continuation. The analytical predictions on the two systems show that the delayed feedback can, on the one hand, drive a periodic solution into an amplitude death island where the motion vanishes and, on the other hand, create complex dynamics such as quasi-periodic and co-existing motions. The approximate expression of periodic solutions with parameter varying far away from the double Hopf point can be calculated to any desired accuracy by the incremental step. The validity of the results is shown by their consistency with numerical simulations. It is seen that as an analytical tool the PIS is simple but efficient.	amplitude death;approximation algorithm;bifurcation theory;broadcast delay;complex dynamics;computer simulation;continuation;feedback;hopf bifurcation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;quasiperiodicity;resonance	Jian Xu;Kwok Wai Chung;Chuen-Lit Chan	2007	SIAM J.

Moreover, these stability criteria are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which can be efficiently solved via the standard numerical packages.

The background of this study is the important role played by the sampling period in embedded networked control systems. It is shown that the optimal H infin/H infin fault-detection performance index will become worse, if the sampling period is increased by an integer multiple. The main tool used for the analysis is the lifting technique, which bridges systems with different sampling periods.	control system;embedded system;lambda lifting;sampling (signal processing)	Ping Zhang;Steven X.

Similarly to stability, Lyapunov functions and contraction metrics play important roles in the study of incremental stability. In this paper, we provide characterizations and descriptions of incremental stability in terms of existence of coordinate-invariant notions of incremental Lyapunov functions and contraction metrics, respectively. Most design techniques providing controllers rendering control systems incrementally stable have two main drawbacks: they can only be applied to control systems in either parametric-strict-feedback or strict-feedback form, and they require these control systems to be smooth. In this paper, we propose a design technique that is applicable to larger classes of (not necessarily smooth) control systems. Moreover, we propose a recursive way of constructing contraction metrics (for smooth control systems) and incremental Lyapunov functions which have been identified as a key tool enabling the construction of finite abstractions of nonlinear control systems, the approximation of stochastic hybrid systems, source-code model checking for nonlinear dynamical systems and so on. The effectiveness of the proposed results in this paper is illustrated by synthesizing a controller rendering a non-smooth control system incrementally stable as well as constructing its finite abstraction, using the computed incremental Lyapunov function.	approximation;control system;dynamical system;hybrid system;lyapunov fractal;model checking;nonlinear system;numerical stability;recursion	Majid Zamani;Nathan van de Wouw;Rupak Majumdar	2013	Systems & Control Letters	10.1016/j.sysconle.2013.07.002	control engineering;mathematical optimization;lyapunov function;control theory;mathematics	Embedded	68.91720328131042	1.7702443423614533	144789

The delay-independent and delay-dependent stability criteria are established. Unlike some results in the literature, all of the established results do not depend on the derivatives of the time-varying delays and the time-varying parameter. Therefore, the proposed methods are suitable for the cases with very fast time-varying delays and parameter.	dynamical system;linear system;numerical stability	Bugong Xu	2004	ICARCV 2004 8th Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision Conference, 2004.	10.1109/ICARCV.2004.1469421	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;linear system;small-gain theorem	EDA	69.30470667274909	0.9803865084398342	144863

Several new stability theorems are obtained by developing a method—proof by contradiction. Moreover, the results are applied to investigate the p th moment exponential stability of stochastic neural networks with Levy noise. In particular, the time-varying delay in our results is not required to be differentiable, even not continuous. The obtained results improve greatly some previous works given in the literature. In particular, our method can easily correct the incorrect proofs appeared in two recent papers. Finally, two examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

These models are comprised of ordinary differential equations that describe some atom of dynamic behavior. Once the equations are known and networked together, a numerical integrator is employed to compute out the actual audio samples that correspond to the output of the network. It is shown that the use of UDS can simplify and improve some of the existing digitization schemes for solving non-linear and implicit equations that commonly present themselves in physical modeling, virtual analog, and computer music generally.

Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions for exponential stability are derived, respectively, for two kinds of delayed impulses (i.e., destabilizing delayed impulses and stabilizing delayed impulses). It is shown that if a nonlinear impulsive time-delay system without impulse input delays is exponentially stable, then under some conditions, its stability is robust with respect to small impulse input delays. Moreover, it is also shown that for a stable nonlinear impulsive time-delay system, if themagnitude of the delayed impulses is sufficiently small, then under some conditions, the delayed impulses do not destroy the stability irrespective of the sizes of the impulse input delays. The efficiency of the proposed results is illustrated by three numerical examples. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

With the use of the skew-symmetric property of induction motors, a two-stage design technique is applied to construct an observer-based controller for velocity tracking control. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, a voltage-control type of drive system is set up to perform the task of velocity tracking. The main computing facility consists of two personal computers, PC 486 and PC 286, of which one is to perform the calculation of the control law and the other is to provide the function of pulse width modulation (PWM) and to generate the gating pulses.

The existing technique concerns only a restrictive class of systems for which many assumptions should be satisfied. The generalization aims then at avoiding those assumptions. The advantages of generalizing this technique are to determine linear feedback controllers that asymptotically stabilize a wide class of systems which are subject to input constraints without violating these constraints, to derive a simple formula for the state feedback and to assign the whole spectrum when stable poles are not suitably located for performances. Moreover, there will be no need to assume a lack of overlap between open and closed-loop spectra. Illustrative examples are presented to point out these advantages.	assignment problem;tandy 1000	Hamid Maarouf	2017	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2017.01.024	full state feedback;control engineering;mathematical optimization;sylvester equation;control theory;mathematics	Vision	69.10112277107123	-2.9307901854291316	146521

As in classical field oriented control, the three voltage inputs are designed so that the direct axis component of the stator current vector is driven to zero; the controllers generate, as an intermediate step, the reference signals for the field current and for the quadrature axis component of the stator current vector, which respectively determine the direct axis component of the damping winding flux vector and the electromagnetic torque. Simulation results are provided for a 20-KW synchronous machine, which show the effectiveness of the two proposed control algorithms.	algorithm;amplitude damping channel;block cipher mode of operation;closed-loop transfer function;nonlinear system;optic axis of a crystal;optimal control;r.o.t.o.r.;simulation	Riccardo Marino;Patrizio Tomei;Cristiano Maria Verrelli	2008	Eur.

In this paper we present an algorithm for signal reconstruction given such a set of measurements. This algorithm generalises and extends previous iterative hard thresholding algorithms and we give sufficient conditions for successful reconstruction of the original data signal. In addition we show that by underestimating the sparsity of the data signal we can increase the success rate of the algorithm. We also present a number of modifications to this algorithm: the incorporation of a least squares step, polynomial acceleration and an adaptive method for choosing the steplength. These modified algorithms converge to the correct solution under similar conditions to the original un-modified algorithm. Empirical evidence show that these modifications dramatically increase both the success rate and the rate of convergence, and can outperform other algorithms previously used for signal reconstruction in compressive sensing.	adaptive algorithm;compressed sensing;converge;iterative method;least squares;nyquist rate;polynomial;rate of convergence;requirement;signal reconstruction;simulation;sparse matrix;thresholding (image processing);vergence	Graeme Pope	2009	CoRR		signal reconstruction;mathematical optimization;empirical evidence;information theory;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;rate of convergence;compressed sensing;least squares;statistics	ML	79.22955564362742	-5.99950279891197	146758

The eigenvalue decomposition, the singular value decomposition, the diagonalization of a positive definite linear combination or the joint diagonalization, of the spectral correlation density matrices of the whitened measurements allows the identification of the mixing system at each frequency up to constant diagonal and frequency dependent permutation and phase ambiguity matrices. Two efficient algorithms to fix the permutation problem and to remove the phase ambiguity based on cyclostationarity are also presented. The new approaches exploit the fact that the inputs are cyclostationary with the same cyclic frequency. Simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of this approaches. Furthermore, the AJD approach is applied to biomechanical signals for separation ends.	algorithm;blind signal separation;cyclostationary process;density matrix;mimo;mixing (mathematics);simulation;singular value decomposition;source separation;spectral correlation density;system identification	Khalid Sabri;Mohamed El Badaoui;François Guillet;Alain Belli;Guillaume Y Millet	2008	2008 16th European Signal Processing Conference		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;electronic engineering;mathematics	Metrics	81.05779330644708	-7.693481512056307	147069

An abstract nonlinear control system is considered for which we assume that there exists a linear feedback law that makes the origin of the closed-loop system globally asymptotically stable. This controller is then modified via a cone-bounded nonlinearity. Well-posedness and stability theorems are stated. The first theorem is proved thanks to the Schauder fixed-point theorem and the second one with an infinitedimensional version of LaSalle’s invariance principle. These results are illustrated on a linear Korteweg-de Vries equation by some simulations and on a nonlinear heat equation.	cone;control system;fixed-point theorem;hilbert space;nonlinear system;simulation	Swann Marx;Vincent Andrieu;Christophe Prieur	2017	MCSS	10.1007/s00498-017-0205-x	control theory;mathematics;hilbert space;nonlinear control;dissipative operator;control theory;nonlinear system;stability theory;heat equation;mathematical analysis;bounded function;law	ML	70.56291929053214	2.197154695604657	147233

Both state feedback and output feedback are considered. A linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed to estimate, for a given controller and a given finite-level quantizer, a set of admissible initial states and an associated attractor set in a neighborhood of the origin such that all state trajectories starting in the first set will converge to the attractor in a finite time and will never leave it. Furthermore, when two such sets are a priori specified, we develop sufficient conditions to design a finite-level logarithmic quantizer for a given stabilizing state or output feedback controller.	control system	Carlos E. de Souza;Daniel Ferreira Coutinho;Minyue Fu	2010	Eur.

Under some weak conditions, the unique equilibrium state of a passive system is stable. However, to ensure asymptotic stability, strict passivity and a detectability property are required. Although strict passivity may be enforced via a damping injection that feeds back the passive output, this signal may be noisy or unmeasurable - the paradigmatic example being velocity in mechanical systems. In this paper a sampled integral-approximation stabilization (SIAS) technique for asymptotic regulation of passive systems, that requires only the knowledge of the time integral of the passive output - i.e. position in mechanical systems - is proposed. As a generalization of the previous result, it is shown that SIAS is applicable to cascade connections of passive systems measuring only the storage function of the first subsystem and the output of the second one. Several examples, including a planar elbow manipulator and the controlled rigid body dynamics are shown to satisfy the required assumptions for the application of the SIAS.	approximation;asymptote;numerical integration;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;sampling (signal processing);velocity (software development)	Daniele Casagrande;Alessandro Astolfi;Romeo Ortega	2009	Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2009.5400188	damping;control engineering;mathematical optimization;rigid body dynamics;thermodynamic equilibrium;network switch;control theory;mathematics;mechanical system;satisfiability	Robotics	69.08562986346408	-4.202476217295325	147914

This non-Markovian system is modeled as an augmented linear Markovian system, which includes a principal system to be controlled and multiancillary systems representing the effect of the internal modes of the non-Markovian environment. The colored noise generated by the multiancillary systems disturbs the principal system through a direct interaction. Based on this model, a whitening quantum filter can be obtained for estimating the dynamical variables of both the principal and multiancillary systems, which can be used for feedback control. To reject the colored noise, a linear quadratic Gaussian controller is designed to drive the dynamical variables of the principal system to track those of a reference system. In examples, we show that colored noise with both rational and nonrational spectra in linear non-Markovian quantum systems can be efficiently rejected using our tracking control strategy.	colors of noise;control theory;decorrelation;dynamical system;feedback;quantum system	Shibei Xue;Michael R.

The model proposed in both [TurKor, Tur] describes how the population, state resources and internal conflict influence each other over time. We show that one can obtain an upward sweep in the population by altering particular parameters of the system of differential equations constituting the model given in [TurKor, Tur]. Moreover, we show that such a system has a nonstable critical point and propose an approach for determining bifurcation points in the parameter space for the model.	bifurcation theory;critical point (network science);population	Richard E.

In this paper, we study an analogous strategy utilizing entanglement in a feedback control problem and show that, in the problem of cooling a nano-mechanical oscillator, it indeed can lower the control cost function below the limit attainable by the standard control method.	feedback;quantum entanglement	Naoki Yamamoto;Tomoaki Mikami	2017	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-017-1629-4	quantum metrology;quantum capacity;control theory;mathematics;quantum sensor;quantum mechanics	Theory	78.3491645958522	-1.4497059091973	148348

The proposed technique involves partitioning the delay range into an integer number of segments. A novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is defined to develop the stability criterion in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). By employing Wirtinger inequality, a tighter bounding technique for integral terms arising in the derivative of LKF is developed. The proposed result ensures that the singular system is regular, impulse free and stable. Further, it is shown with the help of numerical examples that the proposed result is less conservative as compared to other recently reported results.	broadcast delay;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;norm (social);numerical analysis;numerical method;routh–hurwitz stability criterion;social inequality	Pankaj Mukhija;Indra Narayan Kar;R.

The proposed method is based on Karhunen-Loève theorem. After investigating the optimization problem of representing the process with an finite linear combination of orthogonal functions in L2 space by means of the least squared method, the variance of random variables involved in the model is found the key metric in efficiency evaluation of a given functional model. Then, the coefficients of the 3D continuous HRTF model are analyzed. The results show that the efficiency of the model in spatial component expansion is around 70% and the best choice in frequency component expansion is the spherical Bessel function.	bessel filter;coefficient;function model;head-related transfer function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem	Mengqiu Zhang;Rodney A.

By virtue of appropriate Lyapunov-like functions and some inequality techniques, some algebraic criterions in linear matrix inequality form for the existence of positive invariant sets and global exponential attractive sets are obtained. Meanwhile, the estimations of the global exponential attractive sets are given out. The results derived here generalize and improve the earlier publications by removing the usual assumptions for the boundedness, monotonicity and differentiability on the activation functions.

In this way to minimise the chattering effect we will adopt as a starting point the multimodel approach to change the commutation of the sliding mode control (SMC) into fusion using a first order then a high order sliding mode control with single sliding surface and, then, with several sliding surfaces. For that the stability conditions invoke the existence of two Lyapunov-type functions, the first associated to the passage to the sliding set in finite time, and the second with convergence to the desired state. The approaches presented in this work are simulated on the immersion control of a submarine mobile which presents a problem for the actuators because of the high level of system non linearity and because of the external disturbances. Simulation results show that this control strategy can attain excellent performances with no chattering problem and low control level.	control theory;high-level programming language;immersion (virtual reality);lyapunov fractal;performance;simulation	Ahmed Rhif;Zohra Kardous;Naceur Benhadj Braiek	2013	CoRR		control engineering;variable structure control;simulation;sliding mode control;engineering;control theory	Robotics	70.72766487133869	-8.839873768901334	149032

This paper formulates the problem of noise control in a one-dimensional acoustic duct in a form that lends itself to the application of feedback control theory. In contrast to most of the literature on the subject which uses feedforward techniques, a feedback approach is used. Inconsistencies that appear in previous feedback control models are rectified, controllers are designed using precompensated linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) synthesis, and experimental verification of the control designs is presented. The experimental results show a reduction of about 5-12 dB over a frequency range from 150-350 Hz.	acoustic cryptanalysis;control theory;feedback;feedforward neural network;frequency band;rectifier (neural networks)	Jeongho Hong;James C.

The DVIs describe the dynamics of a general system evolving in a compact convex subset of the state space. In particular, they include the dynamics of the full-range (FR) model of cellular neural networks (CNNs), which is characterized by hard-limiter nonlinearities with vertical segments in the i-v characteristic. The approach is based on the following two main tools: 1) a set-valued derivative, which enables to compute the evolution of a Lyapunov function along the solutions of the DVIs without involving integrations, and 2) an extended version of LaSalle's invariance principle, which permits to study the limiting behavior of the solutions with respect to the invariant sets of the DVIs. Then, this paper establishes conditions for convergence (complete stability) of DVIs in the presence of multiple equilibrium points (EPs), global asymptotic stability (GAS), and global exponential stability (GES) of the unique EP. These conditions are applied to investigate convergence, GAS, and GES for FR-CNNs and some extended classes of FR-CNNs. It is shown that, by means of the techniques developed in this paper, the analysis of convergence and stability of FR-CNNs is no more difficult than that of the standard (S)-CNNs. In addition, there are significant cases, such as the symmetric FR-CNNs and the nonsymmetric FR-CNNs with a Lyapunov diagonally stable matrix, where the proof of convergence or global stability is much simpler than that of the S-CNNs.	artificial neural network;calculus of variations;convex set;current–voltage characteristic;expectation propagation;full-range speaker;limiter;lyapunov fractal;state space;time complexity;variational inequality	Mauro Di Marco;Mauro Forti;Massimo Grazzini;Paolo Nistri;Luca Pancioni	2008	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2008.925820	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;cellular neural network;computer science;control theory;mathematics	ML	72.59725516929112	3.5762494023822593	149096

A novel chaotic annealing recurrent neural network (CARNN) is proposed for ESA to solve those problems in the general ESA and improve the capability of global searching. The paper converts ESA into seeking the global extreme point where the slope of Cost Function is zero, and applies a CARNN to finding the global point and stabilizing the plant at that point. ESA combined with CARNN doesn't make use of search signals such as sinusoidal periodic signals, which solves those problems in previous ESA and improves the dynamic performance of the ESA system greatly. During the process of optimization, chaotic annealing is realized by decaying the amplitude of the chaos noise and the probability of accepting continuously. The process of optimization was divided into two phases: the coarse search based on chaos and the elaborate search based on RNN. At last, CARNN will stabilize the system to the global extreme point. At the same time, it can be simplified by the proposed method to analyze the stability of ESA. The simulation results of a simplified UAV tight formation flight model and a typical testing function proved the advantages mentioned above.

The separation is made possible thanks to side information on the dependence nature of the considered sources. In this work, we first show how this side information can be used to achieve desired source separation using joint matrix decomposition techniques. Indeed, in the case of statistically independent sources, many BSS methods are based on joint matrix diagonalization. In our case, we replace the target diagonal structure by appropriate non diagonal one which reflects the dependence nature of the sources. This new concept is illustrated with two simple 2×2 source separation exampleswhere second-order-statistics and high-order-statistics are used respectively.	dependent source;source separation	Abdelouahab Boudjellal;Karim Abed-Meraim;Adel Belouchrani;Philippe Ravier	2014	2014 22nd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		econometrics;mathematical optimization;sparse matrix;mathematics;blind signal separation;statistics	HPC	80.2190595480936	-7.98636679876164	149253
2995c60f953ff679cdd1091f6089ffdd73d8d7fa	fast tcp: some fluid models, stability and hopf bifurcation	stability;limit cycles;fast tcp;drop tail	We study FAST TCP, a new transmission control protocol that uses queueing delay as its feedback measure. We highlight two continuous-time models proposed for FAST that represent two operating regimes: (i) queueing delay forms a large component of the endto-end delay, (ii) propagation delay is the dominant component of the end-to-end delay. These models when coupled with the integrator model for the queue, are shown to yield qualitatively similar results. We then study one of these models in different queueing regimes. In the scenario where the queue can be modelled as an integrator, we conduct a detailed local stability analysis. This yields strict bounds, on the system parameters and round-trip time, to ensure local stability. We show that the system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, when these bounds are violated, leading to the emergence of limit cycles in the systemdynamics. As limit cycles could be detrimental to network performance,we conduct a detailed Hopf bifurcation analysis using Poincaré normal forms and center manifold theory. This enables us to characterise the type of the Hopf bifurcation and determine the orbital stability of the limit cycles. We then consider a regime with smaller queues, where end systems react primarily to packet loss. In this regime, larger thresholds could lead to instability. Packet-level simulations corroborate our analytical insights; non-linear oscillations are indeed observed in the queue size. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

For this class of Markovian jump systems, called short-time Markovian jump systems in this paper, the state boundedness during the short-time Markovian jump interval is of great interest. By introducing the concepts of finite-time stochastic stability and boundedness, sufficient conditions ensuring short-time Markovian jump system to be H∞ finite-time stochastic bounded are derived. Then, the control synthesis problem is studied, where both asymptotic stability and finite-time stochastic boundedness are considered. Finally, an LMI-based design algorithm is proposed to solve the control synthesis problem. Several numerical examples are given to illustrate the results proposed in this paper.	algorithm;control theory;linear matrix inequality;local optimum;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;optimal control;stochastic gradient descent	Weiming Xiang;Jian Xiao;Lu Han	2013	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-013-9594-3	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	EDA	70.89563392838903	1.0294990044911392	149275

Russell and Weiss [SIAM J. Control Optim., 32 (1994), pp. 1-23] suggested an infinite-dimensional version of the Hautus test, which is necessary for exact observability and sufficient for approximate observability of exponentially stable systems. In this paper it is shown that this Hautus test is sufficient for exact observability of certain exponentially stable systems generated by a $C_0$-group, and it is proved that the Hautus test is in general not sufficient for approximate observability of strongly stable systems even if the system is modeled by a contraction semigroup and the observation operator is bounded.

It is first shown that the problem of finding the magnitude and phase of the uncertain fractional-order system over a frequency range can be formulated as a interval constraint satisfaction problem and then solved using branch and prune algorithm. The algorithm guarantees that the magnitude and phase responses are computed to prescribed accuracy. The other advantage of the method is that the magnitude and phase can be computed without any kind of integer-order approximation of the given fractional-order system. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated on three examples including a practical application of a gas turbine plant.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;approximation;bode plot;computation;constraint satisfaction problem;frequency band;frequency response;interval arithmetic;local consistency;software propagation	Paluri S.

4b28b3a43c3d1d9d07e0e79cbd82fb5700ed0c3d	improved support recovery guarantees for the group lasso with applications to structural health monitoring		This paper considers the problem of estimating an unknown high dimensional signal from noisy linear measurements, when the signal is assumed to possess a group-sparse structure in a known, fixed dictionary. We consider signals generated according to a natural probabilistic model, and establish new conditions under which the set of indices of the non-zero groups of the signal (called the group-level support) may be accurately estimated via the group Lasso. Our results strengthen existing coherence-based analyses that exhibit the well-known “square root” bottleneck, allowing for the number of recoverable nonzero groups to be nearly as large as the total number of groups. We also establish a sufficient recovery condition relating the number of nonzero groups and the signal to noise ratio (quantified in terms of the ratio of the squared Euclidean norms of nonzero groups and the variance of the random additive measurement noise), and validate this trend empirically. Finally, we examine the implications of our results in the context of a structural health monitoring application, where the group Lasso approach facilitates demixing of a propagating acoustic wavefield, acquired on the material surface by a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, into antithetical components, one of which indicates the locations of internal material defects.

Recently the intermittent, digital-like nature of the neural feedback control of balance has become evident. Here, semidiscretization methods for DDEs are used to investigate an unstable dynamic system subjected to a digital controller in the context of a switching model for postural control. In addition to limit cycle and chaotic (“microchaos”) oscillations, transiently stabilized balance states are possible even though both the open-loop and the closed-loop systems are globally unstable. The possibility that falls can be an intrinsic component of neural control of balance may provide new insights into how the risk of falling in the elderly can be minimized.	control theory;dynamical system;feedback;inverted pendulum;limit cycle	Tamás Insperger;John Milton;Gábor Stépán	2015	SIAM J.

We start with the definition of T-step common Lyapunov functions (CLFs), which is a relaxation of traditional CLFs. Then, for a time-varying DTNSS, by constructing such a T-step CLF, a necessary and sufficient condition for its ULES is provided. Afterwards, we strengthen it based on a T-step Lipschitz continuous CLF. Especially, when the system is time-invariant, by the smooth approximation theorem, the Lipschitz continuity condition of T-step CLFs can further be replaced by continuous differentiability; and when the system is time-invariant and homogeneous, due to the extension of Weierstrass approximation theorem, T-step continuously differentiable CLFs can even be strengthened to be T-step polynomial CLFs. Furthermore, three illustrative examples are additionally used to explain our main contribution. In the end, an equivalence ...	nonlinear system;time complexity	Junjie Lu;Zhikun She	2016	Int. J.

Mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) have been observed both experimentally and numerically in various prototypical systems in the natural sciences. In the present article, we propose a mathematical model problem which, though analytically simple, exhibits a wide variety of MMO patterns upon variation of a control parameter. One characteristic feature of our model is the presence of three distinct time-scales, provided a singular perturbation parameter is sufficiently small. Using geometric singular perturbation theory and geometric desingularization, we show that the emergence of MMOs in this context is caused by an underlying canard phenomenon. We derive asymptotic formulae for the return map induced by the corresponding flow, which allows us to obtain precise results on the bifurcation (Farey) sequences of the resulting MMO periodic orbits. We prove that the structure of these sequences is determined by the presence of secondary canards. Finally, we perform numerical simulations that show good quantitative agreement with the asymptotics in the relevant parameter regime.	bifurcation theory;emergence;experiment;geometric median;mathematical model;neural oscillation;numerical analysis;perturbation theory;poincaré plot;simulation	Martin Krupa;Nikola Popovic;Nancy J Kopell	2008	SIAM J.

To design the learning filters, we convert the convergence condition of the ILC into the model-matching problem and get the stable and proper learning filter by solving the Nevanlinna's algorithm. To show the usefulness of the proposed algorithm, some design examples are included.	minimum phase;system camera	Cheol Lae Roh;Moon No Lee;Myung Jin Chung	1996	Int. J.

The discrete dynamic model proposed herein is derived from both the flow–density–speed fundamental diagram and Greenshield’s model. The model employs occupancy as its variable and the ratio of free flow and average speed as its control parameter. The function form of the model is equal to logistic map that bifurcates when the value of the control parameter increases. Chaotic traffic means that traffic becomes unstable and unpredictable, which is dangerous for driving. Therefore, this study considers the implementation of chaotic control in signal or ramp metering design so as to stabilize the chaotic traffic phenomena. These results are illustrated by numerical examples. r 2005 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.		Shih-Ching Lo;Hsun-Jung Cho	2005	J.

Particularly intricate dynamics arises when the local flow curves towards the switching manifold from both sides, a case referred to as the Teixeira singularity. The flow locally performs two different actions: it winds around the singularity by crossing repeatedly through, and passes through the singularity by sliding along, the switching manifold. The case when the number of rotations around the singularity is infinite has been analysed in detail. Here we study the case when the flow makes a finite – but previously unknown – number of rotations around the singularity between incidents of sliding. We show that the solution is remarkably simple: the maximum and minimum number of rotations made anywhere in the flow differs only by one, and increases incrementally with a single parameter: the angular jump in the flow direction across the switching manifold, at the singularity.	angularjs;maxima and minima;network switch;singularity project;technological singularity;velocity (software development)	S.

We also propose solutions to the problem for which all the poles, except the fixed poles of the problem, are freely placed. These fixed poles are also characterized as some particular invariant zeros. As a corollary, we propose a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of internally stable solutions, which generalizes the sufficient condition proposed by Basile and Marro.	rejection sampling	Basilio Del-Muro-Cuéllar;Michel Malabre	2001	Automatica	10.1016/S0005-1098(00)00157-6	full state feedback;control engineering;mathematical optimization;engineering;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Robotics	69.24035155803408	-3.103641138496728	151632

We develop a PDE-based predictor-feedback boundary control law, which compensates the transport dynamics of the actuator and guarantees global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. The stability proof is based on an infinite-dimensional backstepping transformation that is introduced, with the aid of which, a Lyapunov functional is constructed. The relation of the PDE-ODE cascade to an ODE system with a state-dependent input delay, which is defined implicitly via an integral of the ODE state, is also highlighted and the corresponding equivalent predictor-feedback design is presented. The practical relevance of our control framework is illustrated in an example that is concerned with the control of a metal rolling process.	coefficient;display lag;input lag;kerrison predictor;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;optimal control;relevance;software propagation	Mamadou Diagne;Nikolaos Bekiaris-Liberis;Andreas Otto;Miroslav Krstic	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7798737	control engineering;mathematical optimization;backstepping;nonlinear system;engineering;process control;control theory;mathematics;actuator	Robotics	69.5531375510531	-1.3600443080187106	151920
ba1f0c49f1e9c532ad590a31dcd0e1e154b0eab1	a simple dds algorithm for tds: an example		This paper is aimed at the presentation and simulation verification of a novel simple and fast delay dependent stability (DDS) testing algorithm for linear timeinvariant time delay systems (LTI TDS). The algorithm can be used for systems with multiple delays and/or those with many controller parameters. Value ranges of delays and tunable parameters decide about the (exponential) stability of LTI TDS and the goal is to determine such ranges that might not be convex. Our numerical gridding iterative DDS algorithm is based on the finite dimensional approximation of the characteristic quasipolynomial by means of the Taylor series expansion or a Padé-like approach followed by the Regula-Falsi result enhancement. Stability regions are sought through the determination of crossing delays (or parameters) which cause the system stability switching. Numerical simulation experiments performed in MATLAB environment prove a sufficient accuracy and the practical usability of the proposed DDS algorithm. INTRODUCTION Delays in system dynamics constitute one of decisive factors on system stability. They can appear as a natural consequence of plant internal retarded feedbacks (Pekař et al. 2009; Zítek 1983), or more frequently, due to delayed control feedback systems. During recent decades, many approaches and methods on the decision about stability of linear time-invariant time delay systems (LTI TDS) with fixed parameters and delays and have been published, see e.g. (Gu et al. 2003; Michiels and Niculescu 2007; Richard 2003). However, delays and/or controller parameters may vary or can be undetermined, therefore there it emerges the task of the decision about the possible parameters or delays ranges which keeps a LTI TDS stable. We decide between delay-independent stability (DIS) (Delice and Sipahi 2010; Ergenc 2010) which is satisfied if the system is stable for any delay values vector, and delay-dependent stability (DDS) investigating admissible ranges of delays inside which the system remains stable (Olgac et al. 2007; Shao et al. 2013). Both the problems are usually studied via heavy mathematical tools, such as Ljaponov-Krasovskii matrices. A powerful idea is the searching of crossing delays (or verifying their existence) that make the system switching to stability/instability due to root continuity property via, for instance, the so-called Rekasius transformation (Rekasius 1980) which represents one of practically applicable means for DDS. The goal of this paper is to investigate and present a simple and computationally fast (by using an advanced polynomial-root finding computer program function) algorithm determining the crossing delays by using the iterative polynomial approximation of the characteristic quasipolynomial. The well-know Taylor series expansion constitutes the main tool for this task; furthermore, the Regula-Falsi principle, utilized consequently, makes the estimation more accurate. The methodology can also be applied for the determination of controller parameters which keeps the feedback system stable with fixed (nominal) delays. A rather detailed simulation example performed in MATLAB and Simulink environment provides the reader with the demonstration and verification of the algorithm and it proves a very good accuracy. LTI TDS AND ITS STABILITY The aim of this section is to briefly introduce a LTI TDS model, its exponential stability and some spectral properties. LTI TDS Model Let the system be governed by transfer function ( ) ( ) ( ) τ τ , / , s a s b s G = , where ( ) τ , s a , ( ) τ , s b are (retarded) quasipolynomials in ∈ s  of the form ( ) ( ) ∑ ∑ ∑ − = = = − + = 1 0 1 1 , exp , n i hj L k k k ij i ij n i s s q s s q τ λ τ (1) where ∈ ij q , ∈ k ij , λ 0 and [ ] L τ τ ,.. 1 = τ stands for independent delays.

Definition 1. The spectral abscissa is ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 , : Re max : = = τ τ τ σ σ α m a Property 1. Isolated poles behave continuously and smoothly with respect to τ on ; however, the function ( ) τ α may be nonsmooth or even non-Lipschitz at a finite number of points (Vanbiervliet et al. 2008). Definition 2. The system (1) is exponentially stable if ( ) 0 < τ α with a fixed τ . In the light of Property 1 and Definition 2, the stability can switch if the rightmost pole crosses the imaginary axis at crossing frequencies ( ) { } 0 , j : : 0 = ∈ = + τ Ω ω ω a  for some corresponding crossing delays τ . Definition 3. The system (1) is DIS if and only if ( ) 0 , ≠ τ s a for any ∈ s 0+ and + ∈ 0  τ . It is DDS if and only if ( ) 0 , ≠ τ s a for all ∈ s 0+ and some open and bounded sets ∞ ∈ + \ 0 L i  τ , ,... 2 , 1 = i Hence, if the system is DIS, then ( ) 0 0 < α . Lemma 1. A quasipolynomial ( ) τ , s q has roots ω j = s if and only if the polynomial ( ) ( ) s T s T s i i i s q + − → − 1 1 exp , ˆ τ τ (2) has the same roots for some [ ] L T T T ,..., , : 2 1 = T ,  ∈ i T . Transformation (2) is called the exact Rekasius transformation (Rekasius 1980) and it is widely used to determinate the set { } ∈ l l l , ,T Ω , Ul l Ω Ω = , and, consequently, Ω , { } l τ for DDS; however, such algorithms are mostly computationally heavy (Ergenc 2010). DDS ALGORITHM Now we intent to present our novel simple iterative gridding algorithm that estimates crossing delays by means of a rational approximation yet without the Rekasius transformation. The successive calculation of the well-known Taylor series expansion (in the neighborhood of the current leading root) followed by the (linear) Regula-Falsi zero point estimation is used to determine sets Ω , { } l τ . Polynomial roots then can be easily and quickly computed by means of a standard software tool, e.g. in MATLAB, for fixed delay values. The gridding procedure ensures a sufficiently fast yet accurate crossing delays approximation even if the number of polynomial zeros seeking calculations is high. Preliminaries For a given characteristic quasipolynomial ( ) τ , s a with fixed τ let us introduce the approximate polynomial ( ) ( ) ∑ = = n i i i s a s a ˆ 0 ˆ , ˆ τ τ (3) of the appropriate order, for which it holds that ( ) ( ) μ ,.., 1 , 0 , , ˆ ,	apache axis;approximation algorithm;broadcast delay;computer program;exptime;enterprise content management;experiment;false position method;ibm security directory server;imaginary time;instability;international standard book number;iterative method;language technologies institute;linear time-invariant theory;matlab;numerical analysis;polynomial;programming tool;property (philosophy);quasi-polynomial;root-finding algorithm;scott continuity;series expansion;simple rational approximation;simulation;simulink;smoothing;stani michiels;stellar classification;system dynamics;time complexity;time-invariant system;transfer function;usability;verification and validation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Libor Peka&#x0159;	2015		10.7148/2015-0246	exponential stability;instability;taylor series;exponential function;polynomial;spectral abscissa;mathematics;algorithm;bounded function;properties of polynomial roots	AI	69.67461682369049	-5.971533594026056	151988

We analyze the asymptotic properties of the blinking system as time goes to infinity. The trajectories of the averaged and blinking system cannot stick together forever but the trajectories of the blinking system may converge to an attractor of the averaged system. There are four distinct classes of blinking dynamical systems. Two properties differentiate them: single or multiple attractors of the averaged system and their invariance or non-invariance under the dynamics of the blinking system. In the case of invariance, we prove that the trajectories of the blinking system converge to the attractor(s) of the averaged system with high probability if switching is fast. In the noninvariant single attractor case, the trajectories reach a neighborhood of the attractor rapidly and remain close most of the time with high probability when switching is fast. In the non-invariant multiple attractor case, the trajectory may escape to another attractor with small probability. Using the Lyapunov function method, we derive explicit bounds for these probabilities. Each of the four cases is illustrated by a specific example of a blinking dynamical system.	converge;dynamical system;lyapunov fractal;with high probability	Martin Hasler;Vladimir N.

A clear understanding of the dynamical properties of a recurrent neural network is necessary for efficient applications of the network. This paper studies the global convergence of general Lotka-Volterra recurrent neural networks with variable delays. The contributions of this paper are: 1) sufficient conditions are established for lower positive boundedness of the networks; 2) global exponential stability conditions are obtained for the networks. These conditions are totally independent of the variable delays which are therefore allowed to be uncertain; 3) novel Lyapunov functionals are constructed to establish delays dependent conditions for global asymptotic stability, and 4) simulation results and examples are provided to supplement and illustrate the theoretical contributions presented.	artificial neural network;computation;dynamical system;local convergence;lotka–volterra equations;lyapunov fractal;recurrent neural network;simulation;time complexity	Zhang Yi;Kok Kiong Tan	2005	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2005.853940	mathematical optimization;lyapunov function;computer science;recurrent neural network;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;artificial neural network	ML	74.09381815463142	2.4533297873606665	152111

For a given family of exponential stable subsystems, this paper focuses on finding conditions to guarantee the overall DPSS’ exponential stability. Based on semigroup theory, by applying piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals method incorporated average dwell time approach, sufficient conditions for exponential stability are derived. These conditions are given in the form of linear operator inequalities (LOIs) where the decision variables are operators in Hilbert space, and the stability properties depend on switching rule. Being applied to heat switched propagation equations, these LOIs are reduced to standard Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed result.		Leping Bao;Shumin Fei;Lei Yu	2014	J.

Since a general method for the analysis of hybrid systems is not available, some researchers have focused on specific types of hybrid systems. Piecewise affine (PWA) systems are one of the subsets of hybrid systems. The identification of PWA systems includes the estimation of the parameters of affine subsystems and the coefficients of the hyperplanes defining the partition of the state-input domain. In this paper, we have proposed a PWA identification approach based on a modified clustering technique. By using a fuzzy PCAguided robust k-means clustering algorithm along with neighborhood outlier detection, the two main drawbacks of the well-known clustering algorithms, i.e., the poor initialization and the presence of outliers, are eliminated. Furthermore, this modified clustering technique enables us to determine the number of subsystems without any prior knowledge about system. In addition, applying the structure of the state-input domain, that is, considering the time sequence of input-output pairs, provides a more efficient clustering algorithm, which is the other novelty of this work. Finally, the proposed algorithm has been evaluated by parameter identification of an IGV servo actuator. Simulation together with experiment analysis has proved the effectiveness of the proposed method.	algorithm;anomaly detection;cluster analysis;coefficient;dynamical system;hybrid system;k-means clustering;picasa web albums;servo;simulation;time series;whole earth 'lectronic link	Esmaeel Khanmirza;Milad Nazarahari;Alireza Mousavi	2016	EURASIP J.

The principal requirements on the system are that the LTI pair ((∂ f /∂ x )(0),  B ) is controllable and the disturbance is limited by the constraint  | f ( 0 ) + w ( t ) | ≤ M d ( 1 − t T ) η ,   M d  ≥ 0 and  η  > 0. These properties together with one technical assumption yield an answer to the problem of deciding when the null controllable region has a nonempty interior. The obtained criterion is built on the purely algebraic and/or differential manipulations with vector field  f , input matrix  B  and a bound on the disturbance  w ( t ). To prove the main result we have derived a new Gronwall-type inequality allowing the fine estimates of the closed-loop solutions. The theory is illustrated and the efficacy of proposed controller is demonstrated by the example where the null controllable region is explicitly calculated. Finally, we established the sufficient conditions to be the system under consideration with  w ( t ) ≡ 0 globally null controllable.	nonlinear system	Robert Vrabel	2018	Eur. J.

A double loops control scheme, consisting of the wheel control loop and the satellite control loop, is adopted as a method to solve problems on controllability and observability occurring in the system model. In the design of the wheel control loop, the magnetic bearing non-linearity is modelled by parameter variations and equivalent disturbances, and a structured model uncertainty matrix is used. In the satellite control loop, structural flexibility resulting from appendages attached to the satellite's main body, such as solar paddles, is considered as a model uncertainty factor causing the satellite's inertia tensor to vary in frequency domain, and an unstructured model uncertainty matrix is used. The effectiveness of the designed H ∞  controllers in improving the control performance is confirmed through computer simulations.	scroll wheel	Myeong-Ryong Nam;Tatsuaki Hashimoto;Keiken Ninomiya	1997	Eur.

7bf153b7d180e59b3a1261243c32372c3958eea0	synchronization-based passivity of partially coupled neural networks with event-triggered communication		Abstract In this paper, synchronization-based passivity of coupled neural networks (CNNs) with partial and event-triggered communication is discussed. Event conditions are designed based on the partial couplings among neural networks. A regrouping method is introduced to build a channel Laplacian matrix which contains the structural information of both couplings and channels. Based on such new matrix, a novel error system is established for the purpose of synchronizing the CNNs. A sufficient condition for solving the synchronization problem of partially coupled neural networks is given. Moreover, the same condition can also verify the passivity of networks when noise is nonzero. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the control mechanism.	artificial neural network	Chi Huang;Wei Wang;Jinde Cao;Jianquan Lu	2018	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2018.08.060	synchronizing;machine learning;artificial neural network;passivity;laplacian matrix;artificial intelligence;synchronization;matrix (mathematics);mathematics;control theory;communication channel	ML	72.20256945730546	2.336932029197115	154037

It is shown that under some conditions the nonlinear system can be either approximated by a discrete-time linear time-invariant system or a nonlinear system of reduced order. The computation of the matrices of the reduced-order system is carried out through the solutions of a set of linear matrix inequalities.

Much attention has been paid to the study of delay-independent stability of genetic regulatory networks and as a result, many sufficient conditions have been derived for delay-independent stability. Although it might be more interested in practice, delay-dependent stability of genetic regulatory networks has been studied insufficiently. Based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, in this study we will present some delay-dependent stability conditions for genetic regulatory networks.

It is not assumed that regulation is robust, nor is there a prior requirement for the system to be partitioned into separate plant and controller components. Instead, one assumes that a “signal detection” property holds. c © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	detection theory;robustness (computer science);technical standard	Eduardo D.

Exploiting the result of the unitary transformation, more credible weights can be obtained and the jointly sparse constraint can be further enhanced. Moreover, the unitary transformation incorporates the forward– backward spatial smoothing, which improves the performance of the weighted l2;1 minimization for correlated sources.

We consider a class of CPGs modeled by a set of interconnected identical neurons. Based on the idea of multivariable harmonic balance, we show how the oscillation profile is related to the connectivity matrix that specifies the architecture and strengths of the interconnections. Specifically, the frequency, amplitudes, and phases are essentially encoded in terms of a pair of eigenvalue and eigenvector. This basic principle is used to estimate the oscillation profile of a given CPG model. Moreover, a systematic method is proposed for designing a CPG-based nonlinear oscillator that achieves a prescribed oscillation profile.

Using the augmented covariance matrix, the coprime array can achieve a higher number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) to resolve more sources than the number of physical sensors. The sparse-based DOA estimation can deteriorate the detection and estimation performance because the sources may be off the search grid no matter how fine the grid is. This dictionary mismatch problem can be well resolved by the SBL using fixed point updates. The SBL can automatically choose sparsity and approximately resolve the non-convex optimizaton problem. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the underdetermined wideband DOA estimation via SBL based on coprime array. It is clear that SBL can obtain good performance in detection and estimation compared to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit least squares (SOMP-LS) , simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit total least squares (SOMP-TLS) and off-grid sparse Bayesian inference (OGSBI).	convergence (action);dictionary;direction of arrival;experiment;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point number;inference;lasso;learning disorders;local convergence;matching pursuit;numerical linear algebra;numerical method;simulation;sparse matrix;total least squares;transport layer security;ultra-wideband;sensor (device)	Yanhua Qin;Yumin Liu;Jianyi Liu;Zhongyuan Yu	2018		10.3390/s18010253	lasso (statistics);electronic engineering;matching pursuit;covariance matrix;total least squares;engineering;underdetermined system;mathematical optimization;least squares;direction of arrival;bayesian inference	ML	79.23757018879265	-7.080764535076084	156317

In particular, we consider the uncertainty of parameters in the continuous-time plant and study the problem of determining the allowable range of the uncertainty around the origin (or equivalently, the allowable range of the parameter around the nominal value) over which the sampled-data system remains internally stable and a prescribed L2 -induced norm (or equivalently, H∞ performance) level is retained. We provide an iterative procedure with guaranteed convergence that gives an exact allowable parameter range, together with rigorous arguments for the convergence. This method is free from the assumption that an associated sampled-data system has a compact transfer operator, and thus is readily applicable also to such cases when the uncertain parameter appears in the system dynamics, e.g., in polynomial forms or linear fractional forms.	data system;iterative method;profiling (computer programming)	Tomomichi Hagiwara;Kazuhiro Horiguchi	2007	Int.

In order to guarantee the existence of an optimal control without any (weak) compactness assumption on the admissible control set, we assume that the risk function M is coercive and that $\sum_{i=1}^dD_i^*D_i$ is uniformly positive, rather than to assume like in the control literature that the running risk function G is coercive with respect to the control variable. In this new setting, the running risk function G may be independent of the control variable, and therefore the so-called singular linear-quadratic (LQ) stochastic control problem is included. A rigorous theory is developed for the general stochastic LQ problem with random coefficients, and the bounded mean oscillation--martingale theory is used to account for the concerned integra...	control theory;optimal control	Michael Kohlmann;Shanjian Tang	2003	SIAM J.

Based on the ergodic theory of continuous time Markov chain, the matrix measure approach and Lyapunov theory, almost sure stability and exponential stability in the mean square for continuous time BAM neural networks are derived.

One of the two subsystems is identical to the n-dimensional autonomous system, which is called the driving system. Another subsystem, called the response system, can exhibit interesting behaviors in the neighborhood of infinity. That is, the trajectories approach infinity with complicated nonperiodic (chaotic-like) behaviors, or periodic-like behavior. In order to show the above results, we project the trajectories of the Hamiltonian systems onto n-dimensional spheres, or n-dimensional balls by using the well-known central projection transformation. Another interesting behavior is that the transient regime of the subsystems can exhibit Chua corsage knots. We next show that generic memristors can be used to realize the above Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we show that the internal state of two-element memristor circuits can have the same dynamics as n-dimensional autonomous systems.	memristor	Makoto Itoh;Leon O. Chua	2017	I. J.

First, we derive certain sufficient conditions for coexistent multiple equilibrium points, which reveals that the n-neuron competitive neural networks under study can possess as many as 4n equilibrium points. Next, we investigate local stability of those multiple equilibrium points, which shows that 3n equilibrium points are locally stable. The new multistability results are obtained by virtue of the fixed point theorem and the theory of strict diagonal dominance matrix. The theoretical results are finally validated by a numerical example along with computer simulations.	activation function;artificial neural network;computer simulation;diagonally dominant matrix;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point theorem;neuron;numerical analysis;piecewise linear continuation	Xiaobing Nie;Wei Xing Zheng	2014	2014 4th Australian Control Conference (AUCC)	10.1109/AUCC.2014.7358690	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;mathematical economics	ML	74.31569724926756	3.1143556028440496	157824

A direct adaptive control method using Gaussian neural networks is developed to compensate transient fueling dynamics and the measurement bias of mass air flow rate into the manifold. The transient fueling compensation method is coupled with a dynamic sliding mode control technique that governs fueling rate when the throttle change is not rapid. The proposed controller is simple enough for on-line computation and is successfully implemented on an automotive engine having a multiport fuel injection system.	artificial neural network;computation;flexible-fuel vehicle;gaussian (software);online and offline	Mooncheol Won;Seibum B.

We analysed the effect of delay mismatches on the closed-loop stability and derived various stability/instability characterizations. Thereby, it was assumed that the desired closed-loop transfer function was proper but not necessarily strictly proper. This may induce a sensitivity of stability with respect to infinitesimal delay mismatches and make the scheme practically unstable. We explained the instability mechanism and derived the necessary and sufficient robustness conditions using two different approaches. Under the assumption of practical stability, we then characterized the maximal delay mismatch such that stability was maintained and discussed a numerical example. Both SISO and MIMO systems are considered.	smith–volterra–cantor set	Wim Michiels;Silviu-Iulian Niculescu	2003	Int. J.

Since today's Ethernet networks and applications are sometimes operated under dynamically changing load conditions that introduce a time-varying delay in the networked control systems (NCS), linear control designs may not suffice to provide stability and/or desired performance guarantee. Research on adapting Ethernet for distributed systems is an interesting topic in the motion control industry, due its commercially off-the-shelf hardware availability and compatibility at a comparative lower price. This paper presents a linear-parameter-varying gain-scheduling (LPV GS) approach for distributed motion control via Ethernet in order to achieve the stability of the closed-loop and the quality of service (QoS).	control system;database;distributed computing;network computing system;pid;quality of service;scheduling (computing);theory	Yolanda Bolea;Antoni Grau-Saldes;Juan Gamiz-Caro	2006	2006 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation	10.1109/ETFA.2006.355458	local area network;control engineering;motion control;performance management;real-time computing;quality of service;stability;ethernet flow control;computer science;networked control system;engineering;control theory;gain scheduling;linear system;ethernet	Embedded	71.26452451798869	-8.286249284727905	158265

This leads to a comparison principle, relating input-to-state stability of an artificial discrete-time system to the same stability property of a continuous-time nominal system. As a consequence, general small-gain conditions can now be verified by finding ISS Lyapunov functions.	control theory;discrete-time signal;lyapunov fractal	Björn Rüffer	2010	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2010.2048053	control engineering;discrete time and continuous time;stability;nonlinear system;lyapunov function;calculus;control theory;feedback;mathematics	Robotics	69.53450696540095	0.7992010120533484	159030

A connection is drawn between these two interpretations of a dynamical system by establishing a link between the spectral properties of the Koopman operator and the geometric properties in the state-space.	benchmark (computing);dynamical system;ergodicity;hybrid automaton;koopmans' theorem;limit cycle;linear system;observable;semantics (computer science);semiconductor industry;state space;theory	Nithin Govindarajan;Hassan Arbabi;Louis van Blargian;Timothy Matchen;Emma Tegling;Igor Mezic	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7799266	classical mechanics;damping;mathematical analysis;topology;angular velocity;trajectory;double pendulum;control theory;mathematics;geometry;automaton;quantum mechanics	Robotics	77.22549093757569	0.7827488470813858	159348

In this paper, the singular control problem is extended to guarantee a weaker form of closed-loop stability, namely, semistability, which is of paramount importance for consensus control of network dynamical systems. Specifically, we show that the optimal state-feedback controller for the semistable linear-quadratic regulator problem can be solved using an algebraic Riccati equation. This result allows us to address the semistable singular control problem and obtain several expressions for the minimum cost of a semistabilizing singular controller. In particular, after establishing connections between Qui and Davison's formula for the minimum cost of a cheap controller and our results, we prove that the cost of a semistabilizing singular controller is zero if and only if the controlled system is minimum phase and right invertible.	algebraic riccati equation;algebraic equation;control theory;dynamical system;linear matrix inequality;linear system;minimum phase;optimal control	Andrea L'Afflitto;Wassim M.

This estimation problem has been encountered in many applications, such as communications with front-end impairments, compressed sensing, and phase retrieval. The proposed algorithm extends the prior art called generalized turbo signal recovery from a partial discrete Fourier transform matrix A to a class of general matrices. Numerical results show the excellent agreement of the proposed algorithm with the theoretical Bayesian-optimal estimator derived using the replica method.	algorithm;compressed sensing;dft matrix;detection theory;discrete fourier transform;nonlinear system;numerical method;phase retrieval;transformation matrix	Hengtao He;Chao-Kai Wen;Shi Jin	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2017.8006946	econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	79.20554752440526	-7.048675408584894	159625

Semistability is the property whereby the solutions of a stochastic dynamical system almost surely converge to (not necessarily isolated) Lyapunov stable in probability equilibrium points determined by the system initial conditions. Specifically, we provide necessary and sufficient Lyapunov conditions for stochastic semistability and show that stochastic semistability implies the existence of a continuous Lyapunov function whose infinitesimal generator decreases along the dynamical system trajectories and is such that the Lyapunov function satisfies inequalities involving the average distance to the set of equilibria.	lyapunov fractal	Tanmay Rajpurohit;Wassim M.

First, the authors formulate the solution to the general reduced-rank linear approximation problem relaxing the invertibility assumption of the input autocorrelation matrix used by previous authors. The authors' treatment unifies linear regression, Wiener filtering, full rank approximation, auto-association networks, SVD and principal component analysis (PCA) as special cases. The authors' analysis also shows that two-layer linear neural networks with reduced number of hidden units, trained with the least-squares error criterion, produce weights that correspond to the generalized singular value decomposition of the input-teacher cross-correlation matrix and the input data matrix. As a corollary the linear two-layer backpropagation model with reduced hidden layer extracts an arbitrary linear combination of the generalized singular vector components. Second, the authors investigate artificial neural network models for the solution of the related generalized eigenvalue problem. By introducing and utilizing the extended concept of deflation (originally proposed for the standard eigenvalue problem) the authors are able to find that a sequential version of linear BP can extract the exact generalized eigenvector components. The advantage of this approach is that it's easier to update the model structure by adding one more unit or pruning one or more units when the application requires it. An alternative approach for extracting the exact components is to use a set of lateral connections among the hidden units trained in such a way as to enforce orthogonality among the upper- and lower-layer weights. The authors call this the lateral orthogonalization network (LON) and show via theoretical analysis-and verify via simulation-that the network extracts the desired components. The advantage of the LON-based model is that it can be applied in a parallel fashion so that the components are extracted concurrently. Finally, the authors show the application of their results to the solution of the identification problem of systems whose excitation has a non-invertible autocorrelation matrix. Previous identification methods usually rely on the invertibility assumption of the input autocorrelation, therefore they can not be applied to this case.	artificial neural network;autocorrelation matrix;backpropagation;cross-correlation;eigenvalue;excitation;extraction;lateral thinking;least squares;linear approximation;nevus sebaceous;part dosing unit;principal component analysis;singular value decomposition;weight;deflation	Konstantinos I.

We consider the analysis and synthesis of discrete-time networked control systems (NCSs), where the plant has additive uncertainty and the controller is updated with the sensor information at stochastic time intervals. It is shown that the problem is linked to H 1-control of linear discrete-time stochastic systems and a new small gain theorem is established. Based on this result, sufficient conditions are given for ensuring mean square stability of the NCS, and the genetic algorithm is utilised to design the controller of the NCS based on a linear matrix inequality technique. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. 1. Introduction Networked control systems (NCSs) are systems in which a control loop is closed via a shared communication network. The use of a shared network in the feedback path has several advantages, including low installation cost, reducing system wiring, simple system diagnosis and easy maintenance. However, some inherent shortcomings, such as bandwidth constraints, packet delays and packet dropout, will degrade performance of NCSs or even cause instability. NCSs have received much attention during the past decade; see, for example, (2005). In the literature, stochastic approaches are typically adopted to deal with network packet dropout and to establish the stability of the NCS in the sense of mean square statistics (Ji, Chizeck, Feng, and	control system;dropout (neural networks);genetic algorithm;instability;internet access;linear matrix inequality;linker (computing);mean squared error;network computing system;network packet;primary source;social inequality;stochastic process;telecommunications network;utility functions on indivisible goods;wiring	Dongxiao Wu;Jun Wu;Sheng Chen	2010	Int.

The maximal Lyapunov exponent and correlation dimension of these data are calculated numerically and compared with the results of traffic volume. The consistency of traffic flow and individual vehicle behavior is illustrated clearly from viewpoints of chaotic analysis.	chaos theory;correlation dimension;lyapunov fractal;maximal set;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;time series	Lanjun Wang;Hao Zhang;Huadong Meng;Xiqin Wang	2008	2008 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/ITSC.2008.4732637	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	78.23982647873021	1.6821239602027862	160283

We show how the optimization of different elements within the overall controller can be addressed in an efficient fashion. These elements include local actuator gains, control modifiers, and control schedules. An evolutionary algorithm (EA) is utilized to realize multiobjective optimization on a local as well as a global level, depending on the optimization task at hand. The fitness function comprises performance metrics that incorporate stall margins, exhaust gas temperature, fan-speed tracking error, and local tracking errors. Less attention has been given in the literature to the application of optimization techniques to aircraft engine control systems design, where the controls design and optimization is performed using a full-order engine model and full control systems structures that do not oversimplify the inherent complexities in these highly complex nonlinear dynamic systems.

These are linear equations in a ring and result from a fractional representation of the systems involved. The cornerstone of the exposition is a simple parametrization of all stabilizing controllers for a given plant. One can then choose, in principle, the best controllers for various applications. These ideas evolved from early attempts to use polynomial equations in the design of discrete-time linear systems. By now they have been extended to continuous-time, infinitedimensional, time-varying and non-linear systems. INTRODUCTION O N E O F THE FEATURES of modern control theory is the growing presence of algebra. Polynomial modules were found to be useful in describing the dynamics and structure of linear systems (Kalman, Falb and Arbib, 1969; Rosenbrock, 1970; Hautus and Heymann, 1978; Blomberg and Ylinen, 1983; Fliess, 1990). In contrast to other approaches, in particular those based on state space (Kalman, 1963) and trajectory behaviour (Willems, 1986, 1989), these results revived interest in fractional representations of transfer functions. In this approach, the transfer function of a system is regarded as an element of the field of fractions associated with an appropriate ring, depending on the property of the system under study (Desoer, Liu, Murray and Saeks, 1980). The property then corresponds to a divisibility condition in the ring. As a result, the mathematical synthesis of a control system having a desired property leads to the solution of a linear diophantine equation over that ring. Quite naturally, these ideas originated in the realm of linear finite-dimensional and time-invariant systems *Received 23 April 1992; revised 27 January 1993; received in final form 16 April 1993. The original version of this paper was not presented at any IFAC meeting. This paper was recommended for publication in revised form by Editor K. J. /~str6m. t The original version of this paper was presented at the First European Control Conference, Grenoble, France, 2-5 July 1991. ~: Institute of Information Theory and Automation, Academy of Sciences, P.O.

The correspondence of algebraic and time-domain quantities is particularly simple and transparent in this case, and can be captured by polynomial rings. The first attempts to use polynomial equations in the design of control systems date back to Volgin (1962), Strejc (1967), A, str6m (1970) and Peterka (1972). The algebraic background of these polynomial manipulations was explained by Ku~ra (1973, 1974a, 1978b) and the polynomial equation approach to the analysis and synthesis of discrete-time linear control systems was fully developed in Ku~era (1979). This approach was extended to cover continuoustime systems by Hautus (1975), Pernebo (1981), Callier and Desoer (1982), Ku~era (1983a, 1986a, 1986b) and especially by Vidyasagar (1985). A particular impetus was provided by the descriptor (or semi-state, or implicit or singular) linear systems, which can easily be studied by means of transfer functions and which have brought attention to the impulsive behaviour of linear systems (Verghese, L6vy and Kailath, 1981; Lewis, 1986). In the algebraic setting, the corresponding notion of properness can be handled in a way that is similar to handling stability in linear systems (Ku~ra, 1984). Although this approach was originally applied to solve the very simplest control problems like stabilization and pole placement, it was gradually extended and found useful in solving a broad variety of problems. These include dead-beat control (Ku~era, 1980a; Ku~ra and .~ebek, 1984b), model matching (A, str6m, 1980; Kui~era, 1981), disturbance rejection (Ku/~era, 1983b; Sternad, 1987), minimum variance control (/~str6m, 1970; Peterka, 1972), shortest correlation control strategy (Ku~era, 1977), LQG or HE optimal control (Kui~era, 1979, 1980b, 1986a; Hunt, Sebek and Grimble, 1987; Hunt, 1989; Mosca, Giarr6 and Casavola, 1990; Hunt and Ku6era, 1992), H~ optimization (Kwakernaak, 1985, 1991; Grimble, 1986) and several types of tracking problem (KuiSera, 1980a; Sebek, 1982; Ku~era and Sebek, 1984a, b). Self-tuning and predictive control problems have also been addressed using this approach (.~strOm and Wittenmark, 1973; Clarke and Gawthrop, 1975; Peterka, 1984; Grimble, 1984; Sternad, 1987; Hunt, 1989), and it is most interesting to see these methods	academy;automation;control system;control theory;eddy willems;edmund m. clarke;email;emoticon;fax;feedback;information theory;ku band;linear algebra;linear equation;linear system;mathematical optimization;michele mosca;nonlinear system;optimal control;polynomial ring;rejection sampling;self-tuning;semiconductor industry;state space;time-invariant system;transfer function	Vladimír Kucera	1993	Automatica	10.1016/0005-1098(93)90003-C	parametrization;control engineering;calculus;control theory;feedback;mathematics;transfer function;linear system;polynomial	Robotics	74.5623474840179	-1.2525580784854995	160861

The fuzzy control system is formulated by a set of local Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy models (T–S fuzzy model) with aggregation. The controller is designed by state feedback for each local model separately. It is shown that under some conditions the controller designed can guarantee the global stability of the closed-loop fuzzy system. The stability of the whole closed-loop fuzzy system is also proved via the piecewise Lyapunov function. The simulation results for the fuzzy control of a nonlinear system – the ball and beam system (BB-system) – show that this method is e6ective. c © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The common way for discretization of continuous functions is obtained with uniform sampling. Our experiments show that dividing the function definition interval with non-uniform measure makes the redundant dictionary sparser, and the resulted dictionary is suitable for image denoising via sparse and redundant dictionary. In this case, the problem is to find an appropriate measure in order to construct each atom of dictionary. It has been shown that in sparse approximation context incoherent dictionary is suitable for sparse approximation method. According to this fact, we define some optimization problems to find the best parameters for distribution measure (in our study normal distribution). To obtain better convergence to optimum point, Genetic Algorithm (GA) with enough diversity on initial population is used. We show the effect of this type of dictionary design on exact sparse recovery support. Our results also show advantage of this design method on image denoising task.	compressed sensing;dictionary;discretization;experiment;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;noise reduction;nonuniform sampling;optimization problem;sampling (signal processing);software release life cycle;sparse approximation;sparse matrix	Hani Nozari;Alireza Siamy;Seyed Ali Mirkhandouzy	2012	2012 8th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP)	10.1109/CSNDSP.2012.6292661	normal distribution;mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;k-svd;computer science;linear programming;machine learning;pattern recognition;sparse approximation;mathematics;statistics;matching pursuit	Theory	80.35735002845338	-6.081107167171471	161564

This paper presents an automated vehicle control algorithm for combined longitudinal and lateral motion control of highway vehicles, with special emphasis on front-wheel-steered four-wheel road vehicles. The controller is synthesized using an online neural-estimator-based control law that works in combination with a lateral velocity observer. The online adaptive neural-estimator-based design approach enables the controller to counteract for inherent model discrepancies, strong nonlinearities, and coupling effects. The neurocontrol approach can guarantee the uniform ultimate bounds (UUBs) of the tracking and observer errors and the bounds of the neural weights. The key design features are (1) inherent coupling effects will be taken into account as a result of combining of the two control issues, viz., lateral and longitudinal control;(2) rather ad hoc numerical approximations of lateral velocity will be avoided via a combined controller-observer design; and (3) closed-loop stability issues of the overall system will be established. The algorithm is validated via a formative mathematical analysis based on a Lyapunov approach and numerical simulations in the presence of parametric uncertainties as well as severe and adverse driving conditions.	algorithm;approximation;autonomous car;control system;hoc (programming language);lateral thinking;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;optimal control;simulation;velocity (software development);viz: the computer game	Sisil Kumarawadu;Tsu-Tian Lee	2009	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2009.2020186	remotely operated underwater vehicle;control engineering;motion control;vehicle dynamics;simulation;systems modeling;stability;system identification;lyapunov function;computer science;engineering;suicide prevention;autonomous system;human factors and ergonomics;injury prevention;control theory;motion planning;tracking;tracking error;observer	Robotics	71.38530123923243	-5.774009828609061	161720

Using the properties of infinite dimensional linear systems, a necessary condition for the feedback stabilizability of delay systems is presented, which extends the well-known results for finite dimensional systems to infinite dimensional ones. This condition becomes sufficient as well if the semigroup of the delay-free system is immediately compact and the control space is finite dimensional. Moreover, under the condition that the Banach space is reflexive, a rank condition in terms of eigenvectors and control operators is proposed. When the delay-free state space and control space are all finite dimensional, a very compact rank condition is obtained. Finally, the abstract results are illustrated with examples.	linear system;state space;well-posed problem;whole earth 'lectronic link	Said Hadd;Qing-Chang Zhong	2009	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2009.2012969	mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;control system;control theory;mathematics;linear system;approximation property;banach space	SE	69.79874090569406	1.693384783024947	161809

This postnonlinear model is allowed to be overcomplete, which means that less observations than sources (m < n) are given. In contrast to Independent Component Analysis (ICA) we do not assume the sources s to be independent but to be sparse in the sense that at each time instant they have at most m−1 non-zero components (Sparse Component Analysis or SCA). Identifiability of the model is shown, and an algorithm for model and source recovery is proposed. It first detects the postnonlinearities in each component, and then identifies the now linearized model using previous results. Blind source separation (BSS) based on ICA is a rapidly growing field (see for instance [1,2] and references therein), but most algorithms deal only with the case of at least as many observations as sources. However, there is an increasing interest in (linear) overcomplete ICA [3–5], where matrix identifiability is known [6], but source identifiability does not hold. In order to approximatively detect the sources [7], additional requirements have to be made, usually sparsity of the sources. Recently, we have proposed a model based only upon the sparsity assumption (summarized in section 1) [8]. In this case identifiability of both matrix and sources given sufficiently high sparsity can be shown. Here, we extend these results to postnonlinear mixtures (section 2); they describe a model often occurring in real situations, when the mixture is in principle linear, but the sensors introduce an additional nonlinearity during the recording [9]. Section 3 presents an algorithm for identifying such models, and section 4 finishes with an illustrative simulation. 1 Linear overcomplete SCA Definition 1. A vector v ∈ R is said to be k-sparse if v has at most k non-zero entries. 2 Fabian J. Theis and Shun-ichi Amari If an n-dimensional vector is (n − 1)-sparse, that is it includes at least one zero component, it is simply said to be sparse. The goal of Sparse Component Analysis of level k (k-SCA) is to decompose a given m-dimensional random vector x into x = As (1) with a real m × n-matrix A and an n-dimensional k-sparse random vector s. s is called the source vector, x the mixtures and A the mixing matrix. We speak of complete, overcomplete or undercomplete k-SCA if m = n, m < n or m > n respectively. In the following without loss of generality we will assume m ≤ n because the undercomplete case can be easily reduced to the complete case by projection of x. Theorem 1 (Matrix identifiability). Consider the k-SCA problem from equation 1 for k := m−1 and assume that every m×m-submatrix of A is invertible. Furthermore let s be sufficiently rich represented in the sense that for any index set of n−m+ 1 elements I ⊂ {1, ..., n} there exist at least m samples of s such that each of them has zero elements in places with indexes in I and each m− 1 of them are linearly independent. Then A is uniquely determined by x except for left-multiplication with permutation and scaling matrices. Theorem 2 (Source identifiablity). Let H be the set of all x ∈ R such that the linear system As = x has an (m − 1)-sparse solution s. If A fulfills the condition from theorem 1, then there exists a subset H0 ⊂ H with measure zero with respect to H, such that for every x ∈ H \H0 this system has no other solution with this property. The above two theorems show that in the case of overcomplete BSS using (m−1)-SCA, both the mixing matrix and the sources can uniquely be recovered from x except for the omnipresent permutation and scaling indeterminacy. We refer to [8] for proofs of these theorems and algorithms based upon them. We also want to note that the present source recovery algorithm is quite different from the usual sparse source recovery using l1-norm minimization [7] and linear programming. In the case of sources with sparsity as above, the latter will not be able to detect the sources. 2 Postnonlinear overcomplete SCA	algorithm;blind signal separation;existential quantification;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;indeterminacy in concurrent computation;linear programming;linear system;nonlinear system;requirement;sensor;simulation;source separation;sparse matrix;taxicab geometry;vector graphics	Fabian J.

Besides the consolidation of acquired theoretical knowledge, the tool allows its users to apply three error patterns geometry to the signals and test minimum dimension and maximum dimension signal reconstruction algorithms. In the specific case of minimum dimension problems it can be solved using different solvers, iterative and direct linear equations methods. The developed tool allows the problem conditioning analysis through the spectral radius of the system matrix, the condition number and others parameters available in some specific methods. This feature gives the possibility to alter the problem definitions to the desired goal before the reconstruction begins and to choose the optimal method, depending on each problem constraints The time unit that measures the algorithms performance is expressed in terms of one Fourier Transform (FFT) calculation time. In this way the data is presented not in an absolute way but in a relative measure independent from the machine's architecture.	algorithm;condition number;fast fourier transform;interpolation;iterative method;linear equation;semiconductor consolidation;signal processing;signal reconstruction	Mónica Isabel Teixeira Costa;Simão Cardeal;Salviano F.

The main contribution of this paper is to transpose a classical iterative algorithm of optimization in the metric space of probability densities involved in the Bayesian methodology. The main advantage of this methodology is that it allows to address large dimensional inverse problems by unsupervised algorithms. The interest of our algorithm is enhanced by its application to large dimensional linear inverse problems involving sparse objects. Finally, we provide simulation results. First we show the good numerical performances of our method by comparing it with classical ones on a small tomographic problem. On a second time we treat a large dimensional dictionary learning problem and compare our method with a wavelet based one. keywords: ill-posed inverse problems, variational bayesian methodology, sparse signal reconstruction, infinite dimensional convex optimization	algorithm;calculus of variations;convex optimization;dictionary;iterative method;machine learning;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;performance;signal reconstruction;simulation;sparse matrix;variational principle;wavelet;well-posed problem	Aurélia Fraysse;Thomas Rodet	2014	SIAM J.

These problems naturally arise from applications, where the encoded information needs to be transmitted, for example, in signal/image processing, information and coding theory, and communications. We show that with the appropriate choices of the frames that are used for encoding, the signal with erasures occurring at known locations can be easily recovered without inverting the (sub)frame operators each time. Our new easy to implement and cost-efficient algorithm provides perfect reconstruction of the original signal. To address the problem of recovering erased coefficients from unknown locations, we propose to use a class of frames that are almost robust with respect to m-erasures. We prove that every frame with uniform excess can be rescaled to an almost robust frame and the locations of erased data can be perfectly recovered for almost all the signals. Similar results are obtained for recovering the original order of a disordered (rearranged) set of frame coefficients. Numerical examples are presented to test the main results. Whenever the received data are noise free, we can recover the original signal exactly from frame coefficients with erasures at unknown locations or from a disordered set of frame coefficients.	algorithm;coding theory;coefficient;cost efficiency;download;image processing;information needs;numerical method;offset binary;original order	Deguang Han;Wenchang Sun	2014	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2014.2320937	iterative reconstruction;residual frame;speech recognition;noise;theoretical computer science;mathematics;hafnium;encoding;robustness	Theory	76.92563150588049	-9.484850936701902	162205

41ef3b5b1c2fd7891ea043c2110c2ea1b7d25b7a	an iterative algorithm to estimate invariant sets for uncertain systems		This paper develops an iterative algorithm to estimate an invariant set for uncertain systems. The uncertain system is given as a connection of a nominal linear time-invariant system and a perturbation. The input/output behavior of the perturbation is described by integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). The proposed approach incorporates IQCs into a dissipation inequality formulation. One issue is that it is often useful to specify the IQC in the frequency domain or, equivalently, in the time-domain as a “soft” infinite-horizon constraint. However, the dissipation inequality formulation requires constraints that are valid over all finite time horizons. The main technical result is a finite-horizon bound on soft IQCs constructed using a state-feedback transformation. This forms the basis for the proposed iterative algorithm to estimate invariant sets. A simple example is provided to demonstrate the proposed approach.	algorithm;input/output;iterative method;lagrange multiplier;linear time-invariant theory;social inequality;time complexity;time-invariant system	Peter Seiler	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8431113	inequality;frequency domain;computer science;iterative method;control theory;quadratic equation;invariant (mathematics);dissipation;linear system;perturbation (astronomy)	Robotics	73.1797233692207	-1.4227540261468976	162602

The main results show that a nonholonomic macroeconomic system is controllable either by trajectories of a single-time driftless control system (single-time bang–bang controls), or by nonholonomic geodesics or by sheets of a two-time driftless control system (two-time bang–bang controls). They are strongly connected to the possibility of describing a nonholonomic macroeconomic system via a Gibbs–Pfaff equation or by four associated vector fields, based on a contact structure of the state space and our isomorphism between thermodynamics and macroeconomics that praises three laws of a nonholonomic macroeconomic system.

In this situation, for a large system with N ≥ 5, it is well known that the synchronized states and the splay-state are the only stable equilibria by Gershgorin’s theorem and linear stability analysis, whereas for low-dimensional systems with N = 2, 3 the synchronized state is the unique stable equilibrium. We present nontrivial proper subsets of synchronized and splay-state basins with positive Lebesgue measure in N-phase space. For the threshold case N = 4, we show that the splay-state is nonlinearly unstable by explicit construction of perturbations converging toward the synchronized state asymptotically.	control theory;kuramoto model;nonlinear system;splay tree	Seung-Yeal Ha;Moon-Jin Kang	2012	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/110829416	synchronization;ring network;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;stability;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Theory	81.22245392859028	3.279940052995678	162920

AIF is a summation of weighted 4th-order statistics, where the weights are determined by adaptively estimated kurtoses. In this paper, the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization is applied to the optimization of AIF. The proposed method is theoretically guaranteed to extract the independent components in the unique order of the degree of non-Gaussianity. Consequently, it enables us to fix the permutation ambiguity. Experimental results on blind image separation problems show the usefulness of the proposed method.	independent computing architecture;schmidt decomposition	Yoshitatsu Matsuda;Kazunori Yamaguchi	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-46672-9_18	arithmetic;discrete mathematics;pattern recognition	Vision	80.49284045826353	-6.7652927743622575	162963
ad311937a003c92a040a18a6855d8061ebd9065b	chaotic phase synchronization based on binary coupling signals		Synchronization of periodic signals is a well-known phenomenon in physics, engineering and many other scientific disciplines. However, even chaotic systems may be linked in a way such that their chaotic oscillations are synchronized. In particular, the case of one-directional coupling has been investigated intensely during the last years [Fujisaka & Yamada, 1983; Afraimovich et al., 1986; Pecora & Carroll, 1990; Kocarev & Parlitz, 1995] because of its potential application in communication systems (see, e.g. [Parlitz et al., 1996a] and references cited therein). Most of the studies deal with synchronization of two (almost) identical systems but also more sophisticated types of (generalized) synchronization have been investigated where (in the limit t→∞) a functional relationship exists between the states of the coupled systems [Afraimovich et al., 1986; Rulkov et al., 1995; Kocarev & Parlitz, 1996, Parlitz & Kocarev, 1999]. Another important generalization of the notion of identical synchronization is the phenomenon of phase synchronization [Rosenblum et al., 1996; Stone, 1992; Pikovsky et al., 1996; Parlitz et al., 1996b]. To investigate phase synchronization a well-defined phase variable has to be identified in both coupled systems. This can be done heuristically for strange attractors that spiral around some particular point (or “hole”) in a two-dimensional projection of the attractor like in the case of the Rössler attractor shown in Fig. 1(a). In such a case, a phase angle φ(t) can be defined that deor increases monotonically. Phase synchronization of two coupled systems occurs if the difference |φ1(t)−φ2(t)| between the corresponding phases is bounded by some constant.1 Using the phase angle φ(t) one may define a mean rotation frequency Ω = limt→∞ φ(t)/t. In the case of phase synchronization, mean rotation frequencies of the drive and the response systems coincide, i.e. also for chaotic systems phase synchronization leads in some sense to the frequency entrainment known from coupled periodic oscillations. But in contrast to periodic oscillations for chaotic phase synchronization all amplitudes remain completely uncorrelated [Rosenblum et al., 1996]. This phenomenon may be used in technical or experimental applications where a coherent superposition of several chaotic output channels is desired. In this article we consider the special case of a binary coupling signal that can take only two possible values {−1, +1} and provides a minimal information flow from the driving system to the	brainwave entrainment;carroll morgan (computer scientist);chaos theory;coherence (physics);heuristic;lawrence j. rosenblum;like button;neural oscillation;rössler attractor;synchronization (computer science);word lists by frequency	Ulrich Parlitz;Immo Wedekind	2000	I.

The state constraints are converted into state saturations by limiting the state in a unit hypercube. An improved average dwell time method is presented to take into account different decay rates of a Lyapunov function related to an active subsystem according to whether the saturations occur or not. Switched state feedback controllers are designed such that the closed-loop switched system subjects to state constraints is asymptotically stable and achieves a weighted L2-gain. Sufficient conditions for H‘ control of the switched system with state constraints are first derived. An application to a longitudinal motion of highly maneuverable aircraft technology vehicle is given to illustrate the applicability and the effectiveness of the proposed method.	control theory;lyapunov fractal;numerical aperture;time complexity	Qingyu Su;Jun Zhao	2012	J.

14c9f9e258d7827846255703cc2d1aaa7207d42b	support recovery for mwc based on random reduction and null space		The recently proposed Modulated Wideband Converter (MWC) sampling method, for sparse wideband signals, can implement sampling without distortion at a rate lower than that prescribed by Nyquist, which alleviates the pressure from high sampling rate. However, the existing recovery algorithm of MWC is far from satisfactory in terms of recovery performance. In this paper, a high-performance recovery algorithm for support is proposed, combining null space and random dimensionality reduction methods. The proposed algorithm firstly uses random transform to convert the sampling equation to a multiple-measurement-vector problem with low dimension, and then utilizes the orthogonal relation between null space and the sampling matrix to judge the support set. Finally the accurate reconstruction is performed by pseudo-inverse operation. The experimental results show that this algorithm can significantly improve the success rate of recovery compared with the traditional OMPMMV algorithm.	algorithm;dimensionality reduction;distortion;kernel (linear algebra);modulation;multiply-with-carry;sampling (signal processing);sparse matrix	Jianxin Gai;O.T.V.

The sufficient conditions of the discrete-time network do not restrict the step-size appearing in the discretization process and these conditions approach as the step-size tends to zero those of the conditions of the continuous-time networks.

The basic qualitative properties of the 3-D chaotic system have been discussed in detail. The new chaotic system has only one equilibrium point, which is a saddle-point. Hence, the system has an unstable equilibrium. The Lyapunov exponents of the 3-D chaotic system are obtained as L1 = 14.0893, L2 = 0 and L3 = −33.9828. Since the maximal Lyapunov exponent of the novel chaotic system is L1 = 14.0893, which is a large value, the novel chaotic system has strong chaotic behaviour. The Lyapunov dimension of the chaotic system is obtained as DL = 2.4146. Next, an adaptive control law has been designed to stabilise the unstable chaotic system with unknown system parameters. The adaptive control result has been established using Lyapunov stability theory. MATLAB simulations have been shown in detail to illustrate the phase portraits and adaptive control results for the novel chaotic system.	chaos theory;control theory;lyapunov fractal;matlab;maximal set;nonlinear system;optimal control;simulation;time complexity	Sundarapandian Vaidyanathan	2015	IJMIC	10.1504/IJMIC.2015.068871	control engineering;discrete mathematics;chaotic scattering;adaptive control;engineering;lyapunov equation;control theory;mathematics;synchronization of chaos;lyapunov redesign;chaotic hysteresis;lyapunov exponent	Robotics	73.65993793117403	0.8638278567154882	165141

Many systems in the interdisciplinary fields could be described by fractional-order nonlinear dynamical systems, such as viscoelastic systems, dielectric polarization, electrode-electrolyte polarization, heat conduction, resistance-capacitance-inductance (RLC) interconnect and electromagnetic waves. To deal with integer order dynamical system it would be much easier in contrast with fractional-order system. Two systems are considered as examples to illustrate the validity and advantages of this technique. We have calculated the Lyapunov exponents of these examples before and after the transformation and obtained the same conclusions. We used the integer version of our example to compute numerically the values of the fractional-order and the system paramet...	dynamical system	Gamal M. Mahmoud;Ahmed A. M. Farghaly;A. A.-H.

While the existing literature on repetitive processes is predominantly on linear systems, recent work highlights the need to develop rigorous tests for stability of nonlinear processes. Using existing results from linear repetitive process theory, we establish a differential repetitive process analogue of the well known result that the stability of a nonlinear feedback system can be verified by the stability of the linearized dynamics. In particular, we employ a 2D Lyapunov equation to show that the feasibility of a linear matrix inequality, combined with 2 small gain conditions, can guarantee stability locally around an equilibrium. Finally, we apply this result to the design and stability analysis of iterative learning control (ILC) systems, and discuss implications in the context of nonlinear ILC.	3d printing;iterative method;linear matrix inequality;linear system;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;social inequality;software propagation;system camera;utility functions on indivisible goods;whole earth 'lectronic link	Berk Altin;Kira Barton	2015	2015 54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2015.7403173	control engineering;linear stability;mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;nonlinear control;process control;lyapunov equation;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;stability theory;circle criterion;linear system	Robotics	69.43849130547255	-1.1268232829237006	165473

The same model serves both local and global stability study: by discarding the nonlinear terms and using the z-transform, stability for small-signal perturbations is checked; by keeping the nonlinear terms (products of disturbances) and using the state-plane portrait, in which equilibrium points are located, stability for large-signal perturbations is studied.

df5058535ae624b4054be42bb6ae932d35084beb	adaptive step-size iterative algorithm for sparse signal recovery		Abstract We develop an efficient algorithm, which can adaptively infer the step-size in each iteration, to recover sparse signal from compressive measurements. This algorithm is formulated as an iteratively alternating projection strategy; the first step projects the measurements/residuals to the signal space, implemented via a Bayesian model, and the second step projects the results obtained in the first step to the l 1 -ball. Variational Bayesian (VB) is employed to perform the inference of the Bayesian model and Euclidean projection (EP) is utilized to impose sparsity; thus our algorithm is dubbed VB-EP. We further derive a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the Bayesian model to speed up the inference with a pre-determined step size. The convergence of this MLE-EP algorithm is analyzed and compared with the iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm based on the restricted isometry property of the compressive sensing matrix. Simulation results verify the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.	adaptive stepsize;algorithm;detection theory;iterative method;sparse matrix	Xin Yuan	2018	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2018.06.002	iterative method;mathematical optimization;compressed sensing;restricted isometry property;mathematics;thresholding;matrix (mathematics);inference;bayesian probability;bayesian inference	ML	78.66611692118502	-6.128291089746865	167770

As soon as the path has been obtained by means of the fractional flatness, a robust path tracking based on CRONE control is presented. Flatness in path planning is used to determine the controls to apply without integrating any differential equations when the trajectory is fixed (in space and in time). Several developments have been made for fractional linear SISO systems using a transfer function approach. For fractional systems, especially in MIMO, developments are still to be made. Throughout this paper, flatness principles are applied using polynomial matrices for fractional linear MIMO systems. To illustrate the robustness performances, a third-generation multi-scalar CRONE controller is compared to a PID one.	mimo	Stéphane Victor;Pierre Melchior;Alain Oustaloup	2010	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2009.08.008	robust control;mathematical optimization;state space;control theory;mathematics;flatness	EDA	69.15803538720509	-8.84927547122714	167897

The information of the probability distribution of the discrete time delays is considered and transformed into parameter matrices of the GRN models. By introducing a new Lyapunov functional which takes into account the ranges of delays and employing some free-weighting matrices, some new delay-probability-distribution-dependent stability criteria are established in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to guarantee the GRNs to be asymptotically stable in the mean square. In addition, when estimating the upper bounds of the derivative of Lyapunov functionals, we carefully handle the additional useful terms about the distributed delays, which may lead to the less conservative results. The new criteria are applicable to both slow and fast time delays. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results and less conservativeness of the proposed method.	gene regulatory network	Wenbing Zhang;Jian-An Fang;Yang Tang	2011	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2011.03.011	probability distribution;mathematical optimization;discrete time and continuous time;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov function;control theory;mathematics;upper and lower bounds	Logic	69.1400662885668	1.197513704241326	167974

After re-interpreting the well known equations for the sensitivities of a system to parameter changes, we consider the problem of optimal control that takes into account not only the quality of control itself, but also a reduction in the influence of parameter changes. Firstly, we re-derive and elucidate known results for systems described by linear ordinary differential equations in the state-space form. Then, it is shown how to extend the well known theory of designing optimal controllers with quadratic criterion so as to cover the reduction of uncertainties in systems described by a class of linear partial differential equations. As a result, we obtain a controller that has a new modal structure in space. Furthermore, the controller incorporates additional sensitivity signals for each mode.

In this model, flow rates increase continuously until network congestion causes them to decrease discontinuously. In computer simulations of small networks, trajectories appear to approach periodic orbits for most but not all parameter values. We prove that if all the data flows are coupled, periodic orbits must be exponentially attracting and thus persist under parameter changes, regardless of network size. Furthermore, we describe the model as a discontinuous but piecewise affine map and show that trajectories must either approach a periodic orbit or come arbitrarily close to map discontinuities.	bottleneck (software);cantor set;computer simulation;flow network;network congestion;network packet;router (computing);stable model semantics;undefined behavior	Russell D.

The paper formulates steganalysis as a blind source separation problem – statistically separate the host and secret message carrying signals. A probabilistic model of the source distributions is defined based on its sparsity. The problem of having fewer observations than the number of sources is effectively handled exploiting the sparsity and a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimator is developed to chose the best estimate of the sources. Experimental details are provided for steganalysis of a discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain data embedding technique.	blind signal separation;discrete cosine transform;ibm notes;source separation;sparse matrix;statistical model;steganalysis;steganography;utility functions on indivisible goods	Aruna Ambalavanan;Rajarathnam Chandramouli	2007		10.1117/12.704726	statistical model;speech recognition;steganalysis;signal processing;discrete cosine transform;pattern recognition;blind signal separation;steganography;posterior probability;information protection policy	ML	80.04965823362437	-8.971374008638588	169308

Of primary importance in our study is what we call nonlinear normal modes (NNMs), i.e periodic solutions which represent continuations of the system’s linear normal modes in the nonlinear regime. We examine questions concerning the existence of such solutions and discuss different methods for constructing them and studying their stability under fixed and periodic boundary conditions. In the periodic case, we find it particularly useful to approach the problem through the discrete symmetries of many models, employing group theoretical concepts to identify a special type of NNMs which we call one–dimensional “bushes”. We then describe how to use linear combinations of s ≥ 2 such NNMs to construct s–dimensional bushes of quasiperiodic orbits, for a wide variety of Hamiltonian systems including particle chains, a square molecule and octahedral crystals in 1,2 and 3 dimensions. Next, we exploit the symmetries of the linearized equations of motion about these bushes to demonstrate how they may be simplified to study the destabilization of these orbits, as a result of their interaction with NNMs not belonging to the same bush. Applying this theory to the famous Fermi Pasta Ulam (FPU) chain, we review a number of interesting results concerning the stability of NNMs and higher–dimensional bushes, which have appeared in the recent literature. We then turn to a newly developed approach to the analytical and numerical construction of quasiperiodic orbits, which does not depend on the symmetries or boundary conditions of our system. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the well–known “paradox” of FPU recurrences may in fact be explained in terms of the exponential localization of the energies Eq of NNM’s being excited at the low part of the frequency spectrum, i.e. q = 1, 2, 3, .... These results indicate that it is the stability of these low–dimensional compact manifolds called q–tori, that is related to the persistence or FPU recurrences at low energies. Finally, we discuss a novel approach to the stability of orbits of conservative systems, expressed by a spectrum of indices called GALIk,	continuation;floating-point unit;linear algebra;nonlinear system;normal mode;numerical analysis;periodic boundary conditions;persistence (computer science);quasiperiodicity;recurrence relation;spectral density;thomas–fermi model;time complexity;whole earth 'lectronic link	Tassos Bountis;George Chechin;Vladimir Sakhnenko	2011	I.

The unilateral constraint involves rigid body inelastic impacts causing jumps in one of the state variables. Firstly, a non-smooth state transformation is employed to transform the unilaterally constrained system into a jump-free system. The transformed system is shown to be a switched homogeneous system with negative homogeneity degree where the solutions are well-defined. Secondly, a non-smooth Lyapunov function is identified to establish uniform asymptotic stability of the transformed system. The global, uniform, finite time stability is then proved by utilizing the homogeneity principle of switched systems. The novelty lies in achieving finite time stabilization in the presence of jumps in one of the states without the need to analyze the Lyapunov function at the jump instants. The proposed results are of theoretical significance as they bridge non-smooth Lyapunov analysis, quasi-homogeneity and finite time stability for a class of impact mechanical systems.		Harshal B.

Sufficient conditions for exponential stability criteria are developed for arbitrary switching signal with average dwell time. The results are obtained based on Lyapunov's stability analysis via Krasovsky-Lyapunov's functionals and the related stability study is performed to obtain delay-dependent results. It is proved that the stabilizing switching rule is arbitrary if all the switched subsystems are exponentially stabile. These conditions are delay-dependent and are given in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Some examples are worked out to illustrate the effectiveness of the result.

In this article, it is assumed that the upper bounds of the uncertainties and external disturbances are unknown. A modified adaptation law with σ-modification is introduced to estimate such unknown bounds, and on the basis of the updated values of these unknown bounds, a class of decentralised local state feedback controllers is constructed for robust tracking of dynamical signals. The proposed decentralised adaptive robust tracking controllers can guarantee that the tracking errors between each subsystem and the corresponding local reference model decrease uniformly asymptotically to zero. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the validity of the results.		Hansheng Wu	2009	Int. J.

We deal with this problem when the system under consideration is structured, that is, the entries of the system matrices are either fixed zeros or free parameters. With such structured systems one can associate a graph. A dedicated residual set is designed using a bank of observers for solving the FDI problem. A major tool in this analysis is the notion of input separator in the associated graph, these separators form a lattice structure. The main contribution of this paper is the formulation of necessary and sufficient solvability conditions for the FDI problem in terms of number of additional sensors measuring variables between faults and input separators in the associated graph. c © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the linear analysis, the method of multiple scales is employed to obtain the quantitative relation between the delay and the oscillation induced by it. The analytical results agree well with those obtained by the numerical method. Furthermore, the effects of other parameters are also studied. The discussions reveal that excessive transfer times may cause the oscillation and that increasing the link capacity can control the oscillatory dynamics.	broadcast delay;network congestion;ring network	Shu Zhang;Jian Xu	2012	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2012.04.064	ring network;discrete mathematics;control theory;mathematics;hopf bifurcation	Networks	77.97567317067683	3.5967998155599985	171668

Nonetheless, such devices are not selective, i.e., the ISE response can be affected by interfering ions other than the target one. With the aim of overcoming this problem, we propose a Bayesian nonlinear source separation method for processing the data acquired by an ISE array. The Bayesian framework permits us to easily incorporate prior information such as the non-negativity of the sources into the separation method. The effectiveness of our proposal is attested by experiments using artificial and real data.	american and british english spelling differences;coefficient;experiment;independent computing architecture;ionic;markov chain monte carlo;negativity (quantum mechanics);nonlinear system;selectivity (electronic);source separation	Leonardo Tomazeli Duarte;Christian Jutten;Saïd Moussaoui	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-00599-2_83	econometrics;computer science;machine learning;data mining	ML	81.62083077990907	-7.247310297876976	171746

This is not true, however, in the case of delayed oscillators, which serve as mechanical models for several surprising physical phenomena. Parametric excitation of oscillatory systems also exhibits stability properties sometimes defying our physical sense. The combination of the two effects leads to challenging tasks when nonlinear dynamic behaviors in these systems are to be predicted or explained as well. This paper gives a brief historical review of the development of stability analysis in these systems, induced by newer and newer models in several fields of engineering. Local and global nonlinear behavior is also discussed in the case of the most typical parametrically excited delayed oscillator, a recent model of cutting applied to the study of high-speed milling processes.	acoustic lobing;bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;broadcast delay;chart;collocation method;control theory;discretization;dynamical system;experiment;interrupt;newton's method;nonlinear dynamics;numerical analysis;numerical method;oscillator (cellular automaton);semiconductor industry	Gábor Stépán;Tamás Insperger;Robert Szalai	2005	I.

The system has integral-action due to using proportional+ integral+ derivative (PID) controllers. Closed-loop stability and asymptotic tracking of step-input references are achieved at each output channel when all controllers are operational. Stability is maintained when one of the controllers fails completely and is set to zero. Controller synthesis procedures are proposed for stable MIMO plants and for several unstableMIMO plant classes that admit PID controllers. These synthesis procedures are applied to various examples of process systems to illustrate the design methodology. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, generating complex multiscroll chaotic attractors via simple electronic circuits has seen rapid development. This article offers an overview of the subject on multiscroll chaotic attractors generation, including some fundamental theories, design methodologies, circuit implementations and practical applications. More precisely, the article first describes some effective design methods using piecewise-linear functions, cellular neural networks, nonlinear modulating functions, circuit component design, switching manifolds, multifolded tori formation, and so on. Based on different approaches, computer simulation and circuit implementation of various multiscroll chaotic attractors are then discussed in detail, with some theoretical proofs and laboratory experiments presented for verification and demonstration. It is then followed by some discussion on potential applications of multiscroll chaotic attractors, including secure and digital communications, synchronous prediction, random bit generation, and so on. The article is finally concluded with some future research outlooks, putting the important subject into engineering perspective.	artificial neural network;chaos theory;computer simulation;electronic circuit;experiment;focal (programming language);gadget (computer science);information system;linear function;nonlinear system	Jinhu Lu;Guanrong Chen	2006	I.

In this paper, a simplified version of the BPTT algorithm is proposed which more closely respects the principle of optimality of dynamic programming. Besides being simpler, the new algorithm is less time-consuming and allows in some cases the discovery of better control laws. A formal justification of this simplification is attempted by mixing the Lagrangian calculus underlying BPTT with Bellman-Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The improvements due to this simplification are illustrated by two optimal control problems: the rendezvous and the bioreactor.

Qiu, and Cao and Ying independently developed supervisory control theory of FDESs. We note that the controllability of events in Qiu's work is fuzzy but the observability of events is crisp, and, both the observability and the controllability of events in Cao and Ying's work are crisp. In this work, both the observability and the controllability of events are considered to be fuzzy. We set up the decentralized supervisory control theorem of FDESs in the more generic framework. In particular, based on Qiu's work, we present a detailed computing approach to verify whether the controllability and co-observability conditions hold, and this method can decide the existence of the decentralized supervisors. As well, this computing method can be applied to check the existence of the decentralized supervisors in classical discrete event systems.	control theory;fuzzy logic	Fuchun Liu;Daowen Qiu	2007	2007 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.3166/ejc.14.234-243	fuzzy logic;control engineering;discrete mathematics;observability;controllability;decentralised system;control theory;mathematics;supervisory control;finite-state machine;fuzzy control system	Robotics	73.64275030945751	-4.659536469422512	172598

Canards in slow-fast systems with (at least) two slow variables, especially near folded-node singularities, give an essential generating mechanism for mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) in the framework of smooth multiple timescale systems. There is a wealth of literature on such slow-fast dynamical systems and many models displaying canard-induced MMOs, particularly in neuroscience. In parallel, since the late 1990s several papers have shown that the canard phenomenon can be faithfully reproduced with piecewise-linear (PWL) systems in two dimensions, although very few results are available in the three-dimensional case. The present paper aims to bridge this gap by analyzing canonical PWL systems that display folded singularities, primary and secondary canards, with a similar control of the maximal winding number as in the smooth case. We also show that the singular phase portraits are compatible in both frameworks. Finally, we show using an example how to construct a (linear) global return and obtain robust PWL MMOs.

By using differential inequality techniques, some very verifiable and practical delay-dependent criteria on the existence and global exponential stability of anti-periodic solution for the model are derived. Even for the model without leakage delays, the criteria are shown to be less conservative than many recent publications. Moreover, some examples and remarks are given to demonstrate the feasibility of our method.	artificial neural network;formal verification;social inequality;spectral leakage;time complexity	Yanli Xu	2012	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-012-1330-6	mathematical optimization;calculus;control theory;mathematics	ML	72.46870694118994	2.820151347871935	172637

Firstly, a T–S fuzzy hyperbolic PDE model is assumed to be used to accurately represent the semilinear first-order hyperbolic PDE system. Subsequently, based on the T–S fuzzy PDE model, the classic variable structure control technique is adopted to develop a fuzzy output tracking controller such that the output of the semi-linear PDE system exponentially tracks a desired reference and the state of the system is uniformly bounded in the Filippov sense. By constructing a strict Lyapunov function, the sufficient condition on the existence of the fuzzy output tracking controller is derived and presented in terms of algebraic linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) in space with an equality constraint. It has been shown that when these algebraic LMIs with an equality constraint are feasible, fuzzy tracking control design can be obtained via the existing convex optimization techniques. Finally, the developed design methodology is successfully applied to the control of a semi-linear Lotka–Volterra PDE system and the achieved results illustrate its effectiveness. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we go much further and develop a methodology for the case where the uncontrolled boundary condition has anti-damping, which makes the real parts of all the eigenvalues of the uncontrolled system positive and arbitrarily high, i.e., the plant is “anti-stable” (exponentially stable in negative time). Using a conceptually novel integral transformation, we obtain extremely simple, explicit formulae for the gain functions. For the case with only boundary sensing available (at the same end with actuation), we design backstepping observers which are dual to the backstepping controllers and have explicit output injection gains. We then combine the control and observer designs into an output-feedback compensator and prove exponential stability of the closed-loop system.	block cipher mode of operation;cobham's thesis;time complexity;uncontrolled format string	Andrey Smyshlyaev;Miroslav Krstic	2009	2009 American Control Conference	10.1016/j.sysconle.2009.04.005	control engineering;boundary conditions in cfd;cauchy boundary condition;free boundary problem;backstepping;boundary value problem;calculus;robin boundary condition;control theory;mathematics;neumann boundary condition;distributed parameter system;mixed boundary condition;poincaré–steklov operator;boundary;singular boundary method	Robotics	72.25253437675238	-3.348066352146575	173055

A unified model consisting of a linear dynamic system and a bounded static nonlinear operator is employed to describe these systems, such as chaotic neural networks, Chua's circuits, Hénon map, etc. Based on the H∞ performance analysis of this unified model using the linear matrix inequality approach, H∞ state estimator are designed for this model with sensors to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the estimation error dynamic systems and to reduce the influence of noise on the estimation error. The parameters of these filters are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem. As most discrete-time chaotic systems with or without time delays can be described with this unified model, H∞ state estimator design for these systems can be done in a unified way. Three numerical examples are exploited to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator design schemes.	artificial neural network;chaos theory;chua's circuit;dynamical system;hénon map;linear matrix inequality;neural network simulation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;social inequality;unified model;sensor (device)	Meiqin Liu;Senlin Zhang;Zhen Fan;Meikang Qiu	2012	IEEE transactions on systems, man, and cybernetics.

Models of uncertainties are allowed to be nonlinearly parameterized, and required to be smooth and monotonic functions of linear functionals of the parameters. The mere assumption of existence of nonlinear operator gains for the target dynamics is sufficient to guarantee that system solutions are bounded, reach a neighborhood of the target set, and the mismatches between the modeled uncertainties and their compensator converge to zero. With respect to parameter convergence, a standard persistent excitation condition suffices to ensure that it is exponential. When a weaker, nonlinear version of persistent excitation is satisfied, asymptotic convergence is guaranteed. The spectrum of possible applications ranges from tyre-road slip control to asynchronous message transmission in spiking neural oscillators.	control theory;converge;estimation theory;neural oscillation;nonlinear system;time complexity	Ivan Tyukin;Danil V.

Both cases of time-delays namely constant and time-varying delays are treated in the switched singular systems. Based on piecewise Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, linear matrix inequality technique and an average dwell time approach, sufficient conditions which ensures that the delay-dependent exponential stability conditions for uncertain switched singular systems are discussed.

We consider uncertain quasi-polynomials whose coefficients may vary in a certain prescribed range. Our goal is to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for such uncertain quasi-polynomials to maintain stability independent of delay parameters. Our primary contributions are frequency-sweeping conditions for interval, diamond, and spherical quasi-polynomial families, which can be readily checked, requiring only the computation of two simple frequency-dependent functions. Additionally, we also obtain vertex- and edge-type results in the spirit of the Kharitonov approach known in robust stability analysis, showing that the stability of interval and diamond quasi-polynomials can be ascertained by checking the stability of certain special vertex and/or edge members in those families. Both type of results provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the quasi-polynomial families to be robustly stable independent of delay.	coefficient;computation;kharitonov's theorem;polynomial;quasi-polynomial	Jie Chen;Silviu-Iulian Niculescu;Peilin Fu	2008	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2008.923686	robust control;mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;discrete mathematics;stability;control theory;mathematics;statistics;robustness;polynomial	Theory	71.1004127438216	-2.1788457351926422	173491

We consider a control configuration where the head sensor and actuator (gate position) are located nearby. This configuration does not seem to have been explored in the literature since the control task is made considerably difficult by the aftereffect of the water reflecting wave. To design the controller, the open channel reach is modeled by a linear retarded differential equation, where the retarded part takes into account the aftereffects. Using the theory developed in Johansson (Automatica, 22, 555-560 (1986)) we design an adaptive controller that compensates for the latter. Simulation results of the proposed controller applied to a partial differential equation model of the channel are given in Constantinides et al. (Int. J. Syst.

The synchronization is carried out by designing an observer which involves a switched matrix gain. A special structure of this gain enables both an input independence of the state reconstruction error equation and a global convergence of this equation. Input independence is ensured by a suitable partial pole placement while the global convergence is based on the poly-quadratic stability concept.

The analysis of NCS has often been performed either from the network, or the control point of view and not many papers exist were the analysis of both is done in the same context. Here a simple overall analysis is presented. In the paper the procedure of obtaining the upper bound delay value in the switched Ethernet network is proposed and the obtained delay estimate is used in stability analysis of the feedback loop and in the control compensation. The upper bound delay algorithm is based on the network calculus theory, the stability analysis uses the small gain theorem, and control compensating strategy is based on Smith predictor, where however the upper bound delay is utilised in obtaining the delay estimate.	algorithm;control point (mathematics);control system;feedback;kerrison predictor;network computing system;network calculus;point of view (computer hardware company);robust control;smith predictor;telecommunications network	Jean-Philippe Georges;Nikolai Vatanski;Eric Rondeau;Sirkka-Liisa Jämsä Jounela	2006	CoRR	10.3182/20060517-3-FR-2903.00066	robust control;von neumann stability analysis;real-time computing;computer science;networked control system;elmore delay;feedback loop;control theory;upper and lower bounds	Embedded	70.06551720149159	-2.813534909072881	174582

These conditions are convex in the matrices of the system and shown to be equivalent to the nonconvex conditions proposed by Geromel and Colaneri in [12]. The convexification of the conditions is performed by a lifting process which introduces a moderate number of additional decision variables. The convexity of the conditions can be exploited to extend the results to uncertain systems, control design and `2-gain computation without introducing additional conservatism. Several examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the approach.	computation;control engineering;control system;convex hull;decision theory;discretization;lambda lifting;linear matrix inequality;nonlinear system;sampling (signal processing);scheduling (computing)	Corentin Briat	2013	CoRR		mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	68.49217196122552	-0.128625135250945	174869

The quadratic cost index involves both error and control signal costing terms. The solution for the control law is obtained using a non-linear operator representation of the plant and a linear state-equation model for the disturbance and reference models. The reference and disturbance models are represented by linear subsystems. However, the plant model can be in a very general non-linear operator form, which could involve state-space, transfer operators or non-linear function look up tables. The structure of the system and criterion is chosen so that a simple controller structure and solution is obtained. The controller obtained is simple to implement, particularly in one form, which might be considered to be a state-space version of a non-linear Smith predictor.

In this work, we analyze the cascade interconnection of such ISS systems, we characterize the finest possible decomposition of its invariant set, and we provide the admissible gain for its ISS stability. Specifically, the following two scenarios are considered: 1. the driving system exhibits multistable behavior (fixed points only); 2. the driving system oscillates or rests (periodic orbits and fixed points) while assuming the incremental ISS of the driven system. Furthermore, marginal results on the backward/forward asymptotic behavior of incremental ISS systems are presented.

To develop reliable numerical algorithms for these problems this paper focuses on the coupled Lyapunov equations which appear as a subset of the synthesis equations. In particular, this paper systematically examines the requirements of probability-one homotopy algorithms to guarantee global convergence. Homotopy algorithms for nonlinear systems of equations construct a continuous family of systems and solve the given system by tracking the continuous curve of solutions to the family. The main emphasis is on guaranteeing transversality for several homotopy maps based upon the pseudogramian formulation of the coupled Lyapunov equations and variations based upon canonical forms. These results are essential to the probability-one homotopy approach by guaranteeing good numerical properties in the computational implementation of the ho-motopy algorithms.	algorithm;computation;generic programming;local convergence;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimal projection equations;requirement;transformation matrix;transversality (mathematics);unbounded nondeterminism	Yue Wang;Dennis S.

By prescribed performance we mean that the tracking error should converge to an arbitrarily small residual set, with convergence rate no less than a prespecified value, exhibiting a maximum overshoot less than a sufficiently small prespecified constant. Visualizing the prescribed performance characteristics as tracking error constraints, the key idea is to transform the ldquoconstrainedrdquo system into an equivalent ldquounconstrainedrdquo one, via an appropriately defined output error transformation. It is shown that stabilization of the ldquounconstrainedrdquo system is sufficient to solve the stated problem. Besides guaranteeing a uniform ultimate boundedness property for the transformed output error and the uniform boundedness for all other signals in the closed loop, the proposed robust adaptive controller is smooth with easily selected parameter values and successfully bypasses the loss of controllability issue.

This very sparse prior was previously used for Wavelet-based image denoising. In this paper we consider separation of 3×3 and 2×3 noisy mixtures of audio signals, decomposed on a MDCT basis. The hierarchical formulation of the inverse prior allows for EM-based computation of MAP estimates. This procedure happens to be fast when compared to a standard more complex Markov chain Monte Carlo method using the flexible Student t prior, with competitive results obtained. Blind Source Separation (BSS) consists of estimating n signals (the sources) from the sole observation of m mixtures of them (the observations). If many efficient approaches exist for (over)determined (m ≥ n) non-noisy linear instantaneous, in particular within the field of Independent Component Analysis, the general linear instantaneous case, with mixtures possibly noisy and/or underdetermined (m < n) is still a very challenging problem. A now common approach for BSS, in particular for underdetermined mixtures, consists of exploiting source sparsity assumptions. Sparsity means that only “few” expansion coefficients of the sources on a given basis are significantly different from zero and its use to handle source separation problem (possibly underdetermined) was introduced in the seminal papers [1,2]. In [3,4] we modeled the expansion coefficients of the sources by identically and independently distributed (i.i.d) Student t processes and a Gibbs sampler (a standard MCMC simulation method) was proposed to sample from the posterior distribution of the mixing matrix, the input noise variance, the source coefficients and hyperparameters of the Student t distributions. The method was successfully applied to determined and underdetermined noisy audio mixtures, decomposed on a MDCT basis (a local cosine basis). In this paper, we give the source coefficients the Jeffrey’s inverse prior p(x) ∝ 1/|x|. This prior was used for image denoising and sparse regression in [5,6]. It provides very sparse signal estimates and, as shown in [5] in the context of denoising, is good compromise between soft and hard thresholding. Though Jeffrey’s prior corresponds to an improper probability density function, it admits a hierarchical formulation which leads to proper posterior densities, and allows for efficient EM-based computaJ.

Taking the fractional-order Chen system as a starting point, the dynamics of a modified version of that system is examined, and the composed system is hereafter realized by allowing switching between the two different subsystems. Our work first demonstrates how fractional-order chaotic systems can be realized physically. For the fractional-order switching chaotic system, a linear feedback controller and a number of synchronization schemes are designed. Our simulations show that control and synchronization of the individual subsystems can be achieved with the same feedback and synchronization controller.	chaos theory;electronic circuit simulation	Li-Lian Huang;Juan Zhang;Shuai-Shuai Shi	2015	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/j.matcom.2015.03.001	real-time computing;computer science;control theory;synchronization of chaos	Robotics	73.38067556775556	0.30146692263461605	176296

A conventional method determining a pool for each test by a simple Bernoulli random design has been proposed. However, the conventional method has the drawback that the probability of the exact recovery is smaller than that of the optimal case because the redundancy of the mixing matrix tends to be high. To avoid the high redundancy, the proposed method decides the pool sequentially by evaluating the mutual coherence at every test. The proposed method makes use of the fact that the mutual coherence is a criterion for uniqueness of the solution in linear problems. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional simple Bernoulli random design.	bernoulli polynomials;compressed sensing;mutual coherence (linear algebra)	Yohei Kawaguchi;Masahito Togami	2016	2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)	10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820730	mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics	EDA	80.51717776700728	-6.267432627416835	176704

eadf9b61d9492c4719804b7bdd288f54d7ff4739	robust nonlinear h∞ state feedback control of polynomial discrete-time systems: an integrator approach	tk electrical engineering electronics nuclear engineering	This paper investigates the problem of designing a nonlinear H∞ state feedback controller for polynomial discrete-time systems with norm-bounded uncertainties. In general, the problem of designing a controller for polynomial discrete-time systems is difficult, because it is a nonconvex problem. More precisely, in general, its Lyapunov function and control input are not jointly convex. Hence, it cannot be solved by semidefinite programming. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed, where an integrator is incorporated into the controller structure. In doing so, a convex formulation of the controller design problem can be rendered in a less conservative way than the available approaches. Furthermore, we establish the interconnection between robust H∞ control of polynomial discrete-time systems with norm-bounded uncertainties and H∞ control of scaled polynomial discrete-time systems. This establishment allows us to convert the robust H∞ control problems to H∞ control problems. Then, based on the sum of squares (SOS) approach, sufficient conditions for the existence of a nonlinear H∞ state feedback controller are given in terms of solvability of polynomial matrix inequalities (PMIs), which can be solved by the recently developed SOS solvers. A tunnel diode circuit is used to demonstrate the validity of this integrator approach.	polynomial	Shakir Saat;Sing Kiong Nguang;Chih-Min Lin;Zahriladha Zakaria	2014	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-013-9645-9	control engineering;mathematical optimization;computer science;control theory;mathematics;h-infinity methods in control theory	Robotics	69.0612175240138	-1.3405100054495669	176978

We draw nodes and saddles with their unstable manifold near the bifurcation point on the Poincare section for various values of k/sup 2/ (deviation between two oscillators' intrinsic frequencies). It is recognized that the unstable manifold changes a lot with parameter variation around the bifurcation point, and hence the associated dynamics change drastically.	bifurcation theory;control theory;nonlinear system;quasiperiodicity	Takuya Yoshimura;Kuniyasu Shimizu;Tetsuro Endo	2005	2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1466020	control engineering;nonlinear system;period-doubling bifurcation;frequency;biological applications of bifurcation theory;calculus;poincaré map;control theory;mathematics;saddle-node bifurcation;oscillation;quantum mechanics;bifurcation diagram	Arch	81.07332150113362	3.3974532321688913	177770

However, OMP usually needs more measurements than some other recovery algorithms in order to achieve equal-quality reconstructions. This article firstly illustrates the fundamental idea of OMP and the specific algorithm steps. And then, two limitations leading to the previous issue are addressed. Finally, a sorted random matrix is proposed to be used as a measurement matrix to improve those two limitations. The experimental results show the proposed measurement matrix is able to help OMP make a great progress on the quality of recovered approximations.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;approximation;compressed sensing;computation;detection theory;matching pursuit;online advertising;openmp	Zhenglin Wang;Ivan Lee	2010	2010 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications	10.1109/DICTA.2010.29	computer vision;mathematical optimization;image processing;computer science;theoretical computer science;signal processing;mathematics;compressed sensing	Robotics	77.34563342079169	-6.748668788423967	177821
42931d0badfa03b91ae9f2f21c720758a6186910	a scalar sign function approach to digital control of continuous-time chaotic systems with state constraints	chua s circuit;continuous time;chaotic system;scalar sign function;state constraint;nonlinear control;digital redesign;state constraints;optimal linear model;hybrid system;digital control	In this paper, a scalar sign function-based digital design methodology is presented to develop a digital tracking controller for the continuous-time chaotic systems with absolute value state constraints. A scalar sign function, which is the counterpart of the well-known matrix sign function, is utilized to approximately represent the absolute value state term by a rational function. As a result, the original state constrained nonsmooth nonlinear system becomes a smooth nonlinear system having rational nonlinear terms. Then, an optimal linearization technique is applied to the afore-mentioned nonlinear system for finding an optimal linearization model, which has the exact dynamics of the original nonlinear system at any operating point of interest with minimal modeling error in the vicinity of the operating point on the trajectory. To overcome the effect of modeling errors and to quickly track the desired reference signals, a high-gain optimal analog tracker is designed for the obtained linear model. For practical implementation of the high-gain analog tracker, the prediction-based digital redesign technique is utilized to obtain a low-gain digital tracker for digital control of the sampled-data nonlinear system with constrained states. Chua's chaotic circuits are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	chaos theory;scalar processor	Jian Wu;Leang-San Shieh;Jason Sheng Hong Tsai	2009	I. J.

The class of systems studied includes the family of systems under arbitrary switching, periodic systems, and systems with minimum and maximum dwell time specifications. To reach the result, we describe the set of rules that define the admissible transitions with a weighted directed graph. This allows to express the system dynamics as a time invariant difference inclusion. In turn, a modified version of the forward reachability set mapping is utilized to analyze global exponential stability. The developed framework leads to the establishment of an iterative stability verification algorithm.	algorithm;bibo stability;convex hull;convex set;directed graph;exponential time hypothesis;iterative method;linear system;reachability;system dynamics;time complexity;time-invariant system	Nikolaos Athanasopoulos;Mircea Lazar	2014	53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2014.7040241	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;control theory;mathematics	Embedded	68.74443171173203	2.2013955169723656	177854

By introducing an improved discontinuous Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF), new delay-dependent synchronization criteria are obtained using Wirtinger׳s integral inequality and mixed convex combination, which fully utilize the upper bound on variable sampling interval and the sawtooth structure information of varying input delay. The derived criteria are less conservative than the existing ones. In addition, the desired sampled-data controllers are obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities.

To understand the effects of time delay on the stability and oscillation of the manipulator, the geometric singular perturbation method is extended in dealing with delay differential equations. Bogdanov–Takens (BT) bifurcation of the fast subsystem is obtained, which leads to the existence of homoclinic orbits and is proved to be related to the formation of spiking. After the break of homoclinic orbits, Melnikov theory is introduced to predict the threshold curve indicating the occurrence of chaos. Numerical results show that with the increase of time delay, the stability of the system gets worse, and complicated oscillations including bursting, chaotic-bursting and complete chaos turn up. Besides, it is briefly summarized that the effect of the small parameter in the slow-fast system is to influence the convergence rate of solution trajectories, which is widely neglected in previous works.	bifurcation theory;dynamical system;floris takens	Jian Xu;Shanying Jiang	2015	I.

We consider the regular case (i.e., the mixing matrix has full column rank) as well as the ill-conditioned case (i.e., the mixing matrix does not have full column rank). We provide one necessary and sufficient condition for the identifiability of simultaneous blind separation. According to our identifiability condition and the existing general identifiability condition, all source signals are separated into two categories: separable single sources and inseparable mixtures of several single sources. A sufficient condition is also derived for the existence of optimal partition of the mixing matrix which leads to a unique maximum set of separations. One sufficient condition is proved to show that each maximum partition of the mixing matrix corresponds to a unique class of separated signals and as a result we can determine the number of maximum partitions from the classes of outputs under different separation matrices. For sub-Gaussian or super-Gaussian source signals, a cost function based on fourth-order cumulants is introduced to simultaneously separate all separable single sources and all inseparable mixtures. By minimizing the cost function, a gradient-based method is developed.

They are widely regarded as potential future stationary and mobile power sources. The response of a fuel cell systemdepends on the air andhydrogen feed, flowandpressure regulation, andheat and water management. In this paper, the study is concentrated on the control of the air subsystem that feeds the fuel cell cathode with oxygen—whose dynamics is described with a widely accepted nonlinear model. Due to the complexity of this model, themodel-based controllers that have been proposed for this application are designed using its linear approximation at a given equilibrium point, which might lead to conservative stability margin estimates for the usually wide operating ranges of the system. On the other hand, practitioners propose the use of simple proportional or proportional–integral controllers around the compressor flow, which ensures good performance in most applications. In this paper we provide the theoretical justification to this scheme, proving that this output variable has the remarkable property that the linearization (around any admissible equilibrium) of the input–output map is strictly passive. Hence, the controllers used in applications yield (locally) asymptotically stable loops—for any desired equilibrium point and all values of the controller gains. Ensuring stability for all tuning gains overcomes the inherent conservativeness of linearized dynamics analysis, and assures the designer on the current use of robust, high performance loops. Instrumental to prove the passivity property is the exploitation of some monotonicity characteristics of the system that stem from physical laws. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Upper bounds on the tracking error are developed. The article also analyzes the persistence (PE) of excitation conditions required for parameter convergence. In addition, to a general PE analysis, the article presents a specific analysis pertinent to approximators that are composed of basis elements with local support. In particular, the analysis shows that as long as a reduced dimension subvector of the regressor vector is PE, then a specialized form of exponential convergence will be achieved. This condition is critical, since the general PE conditions are not practical in most control applications. In addition to the PE results, this article explicitly defines the regions over which the approximator converges when locally supported basis elements are used. The results are demonstrated throughout via examples.		Jay A.

For the corresponding families of subsystems, conditions of the existence of common Lyapunov–Razumikhin functions are found. The fulfilment of these conditions provides the asymptotic stability of the zero solutions of the considered hybrid systems for any switching law and for any nonnegative delay. Some examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.	broadcast delay;nonlinear system	A. Yu. Aleksandrov;Elena B. Aleksandrova;Alexey P. Zhabko	2017	Int. J.

The latter are driven by quantum Wiener processes of the external boson fields and are specified by the system Hamiltonian and system-field coupling operators. We consider the system response to perturbations of these energy operators and introduce a transverse Hamiltonian which encodes the propagation of the perturbations through the unitary system-field evolution. This provides a tool for the infinitesimal perturbation analysis and development of optimality conditions for coherent quantum control problems. We apply the transverse Hamiltonian variational technique to a mean square optimal coherent quantum filtering problem for a measurement-free cascade connection of quantum systems.	calculus of variations;coherence (physics);coherent control;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);hudson;mean squared error;nonlinear system;perturbation theory;quantum system;software propagation;stochastic process;transverse wave;two-port network	Igor G.

The discontinuous control that leads to a finite-time reaching of the sliding surface creates fast-time transients analogous to the stable boundary layer dynamics of a singularly perturbed system. As the sliding mode is attained, the slow-time dynamics prevails, just as that of a singularly perturbed system after the boundary layer dynamics fades away. In this technical note, the problem of sliding mode control for singularly perturbed systems in the presence of matched bounded external disturbances is investigated. A composite sliding surface is constructed from solutions of algebraic Lyapunov equations which are derived from both the fast and the slow subsystems. The resultant sliding motion ensures Lyapunov stability with disturbance rejection. Two proposed schemes that ensure the asymptotic stability of the system are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated in a numerical example of a magnetic tape control system.	algebraic equation;control system;linear algebra;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;perturbation theory;rejection sampling;resultant;variable structure system	Thang Nguyen-Tien;Wu-Chung Su;Zoran Gajic	2012	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2011.2173775	control engineering;variable structure control;mathematical optimization;sliding mode control;lyapunov function;control system;control theory;mathematics;method of matched asymptotic expansions	Robotics	69.43031251030182	-2.1483397488799536	181128
3f1ddc2beb70dc752d0d2f8e26a99fa90ce1638e	safety verification using barrier certificates with application to double integrator with input saturation and zero-order hold		It is desirable to increase the control sample period in cyber-physical systems such that the available processing power and data transfer are minimized. In this paper, a safety verification technique is proposed which allows a trade-off between the size of the sample period and the convergence rate. The proposed technique is applied to a double integrator with input saturation and zero-order hold. An expression for the control law and an explicit relationship between sample period and control parameters are presented. It is shown that the proposed control law drives all state trajectories initiated in the safe set to the origin without violating safety criteria as long as the sample period remains sufficiently small. Moreover, if the control signal is bounded between the proposed limits, it is shown analytically that a pilot-based configuration also remains in the safe set. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified using numerical simulations.	computer simulation;converge;cyber-physical system;numerical analysis;optimal control;rate of convergence;verification and validation;zero-order hold	Azad Ghaffari;Imoleayo Abel;Daniel Ricketts;Sorin Lerner;Miroslav Krstic	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8430929	rate of convergence;control engineering;process control;computer science;zero-order hold;double integrator;control theory;saturation (chemistry);nonlinear system;bounded function;trajectory	EDA	68.35465682071535	-2.5108320952974585	181203

Two notions that are of particular relevance to such systems are convergence and semistability. Convergence is the property whereby every solution converges to a limit point that may depend on the initial condition. Semistability is the additional requirement that all solutions converge to limit points that are Lyapunov stable. We give new Lyapunov-function-based results for convergence and semistability of nonlinear systems. These results do not make assumptions of sign definiteness on the Lyapunov function. Instead, our results use a novel condition based on nontangency between the vector field and invariant or negatively invariant subsets of the level or sublevel sets of the Lyapunov function or its derivative and represent extensions of previously known stability results involving semidefinite Lyapunov functions. To illustrate our results we deduce convergence and semistability of the kinetics of the Michaelis–Menten chemical reaction and the closed-loop dynamics of a scalar system under a universal adaptive stabilizing feedback controller.	coco (robot);connected component (graph theory);control theory;converge;convex hull;existential quantification;expanded memory;initial condition;kinetics internet protocol;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;norm (social);relevance;social inequality;triune continuum paradigm;vergence	Sanjay P.
