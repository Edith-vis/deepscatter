19e80ad4c5356a89db9eb604dcb1af07c1993a9e	development of a medical robot system for pedicle screw surgery assisted by fluoroscopic x-ray image	surgery robot kinematics x ray imaging collision avoidance medical robotics navigation;control hardware architecture medical robot system pedicle screw surgery fluoroscopic x ray image robot technology medical application laparoscopic surgery da vinci system fluoroscopic surgery c arm system patient monitoring x ray radiation radiation exposure master slave robot system imaging robot operation bed;surgery diagnostic radiography medical image processing medical robotics patient monitoring	Converging robot technology into medical applications allowed surgeons to achieve accurate and enhanced surgical results. In laparoscopic surgery, da Vinci system consisting of master and slave robot system allows to perform operation more precisely. In fluoroscopic surgery, C-arm systems are widely used to monitor status of patient instantly during the operation. However, one of the drawbacks of the C-arm system is that surgeons are consistently exposed to X-ray radiation. This radiation exposure can be harmful to surgeons having hundreds of surgeries a year. In this paper, a system consisting of master-slave robot, imaging robot and operation bed for pedicle screw surgery is proposed. Also, its control hardware architecture and algorithm are proposed. Proposed system is validated via simulation environment.	algorithm;medical robot;robotic arm;simulation;x-ray (amazon kindle)	Duckjune Kim;Kwang-Hee Lee;Sang-Hoon Ji;Woong-Hee Shon;Young-Soo Kim	2011	Advanced Robotics and its Social Impacts	10.1109/ARSO.2011.6301959	computer vision	Robotics	73.97316051460847	-29.257316299599303	63675

If the contact location and the exchanged forces were known in real time, a safe and controlled collaboration could be established. We present a novel approach that allows localizing the contact between a robot and human parts with a depth camera, while determining in parallel the joint torques generated by the physical interaction using the so-called residual method. The combination of such exteroceptive sensing and model-based techniques is sufficient, under suitable conditions, for a reliable estimation of the actual exchanged force at the contact, realizing thus a virtual force sensor. Multiple contacts can be handled as well. We validate quantitatively the proposed estimation method with a number of static experiments on a KUKA LWR. An illustration of the use of estimated contact forces in the realization of collaborative behaviors is given, reporting preliminary experiments on a generalized admittance control scheme at the contact point.	cartesian closed category;collision detection;data validation;experiment;fundamental interaction;human–robot interaction;optimal control;range imaging;robot;sensor	Emanuele Magrini;Fabrizio Flacco;Alessandro De Luca	2014	2014 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2014.6942848	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory;robot kinematics	Robotics	69.38960698523906	-26.954634724177627	63913

However, none of the available active hand orthoses is able to address to their specific needs. In this study, the use of hydraulic technology is proposed in the design of an active hand orthosis. Commercially available components were used to identify where customization is necessary for a new electrohydraulic hand orthosis. The presented prototype was able to move four finger modules with a single actuator. The finger modules were separable and had a total mass of only 150 g, whereas the valve manifold added another 250 g. Results revealed that the prototype was able to function well with full flexion/extension cycles up to 2 Hz, but with hysteretic losses between 37–81% of the total input energy. Specialized valves and slave cylinders are required to increase efficiency at higher speeds and to obtain more robust sealing performance.	3d printing;bottleneck (software);fleming valve;hysteresis;prototype;record sealing;robotics	Ronald A.

The system includes three main operations, and they are the operations of catch, load and launch. In the catch operation, the system is capable of capturing a target cell by high-speed vision and high-frequency flow control. The captured cell is pushed into a narrow constriction for the load operation. Different durations of loading time are applied to cells for evaluating cell viscoelasticity. Finally, the cell is launched out from the constriction, and the recovery response of the cell is monitored for cell characterization. Human red blood cells are experimentally tested by the proposed system. The experimental results show that the system successfully perform the evaluation, and the viscoelastic characteristics of the cells are discussed.	cell (microprocessor);experiment;role-based collaboration	Ryo Murakami;Chia-Hung Dylan Tsai;Hiroaki Ito;Motomu Tanaka;Shinya Sakuma;Fumihito Arai;Makoto Kaneko	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487314	control engineering;electronic engineering;simulation;engineering	Robotics	75.84383540765837	-26.20898691663596	64101

For example, fast oscillating functions as audio, speech, sonar, radar, EEG and stock market are much more well represented by a frame, with similar oscillating characteristic, than by a classical orthonormal basis. In this respect, a new frame based shrinkage estimator is derived as the Empirical Regularized version of the optimal Shrinkage estimator generalized to the frame operator. An analytic expression of it is furnished leading to an efficient implementation. Results on standard and real test functions are shown. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Electrovibration is fast, consumes little power, and does not involve the use of any mechanical actuators. However, it suffers from problems such as nonuniform perceived intensity due to varying environmental impedances, as well as possible electric shock, which have to be solved for commercialization. In this paper, a current feedback method is proposed to provide uniform intensity of electrovibration, regardless of the varying environmental impedances. The proposed method can also prevent electric shock. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, a hardware prototype was developed and a user study was conducted. The user study result shows that the proposed current control method can provide significantly more uniform perceived intensity of electrovibration as compared with the conventional voltage control method.	characteristic impedance;fingertip dosing unit;lateral thinking;mental suffering;prototype;real-time clock;shock from electric current;usability testing;electric impedance;voltage	Heewon Kim;Jeonggoo Kang;Ki-Duk Kim;Kyoung-Moon Lim;Jeha Ryu	2015	IEEE Transactions on Haptics	10.1109/TOH.2015.2476810	control engineering;electronic engineering;simulation;young adult;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;vibration;electrical impedance;feedback;haptic technology	Robotics	75.9076755158429	-27.027716304651044	64780

In this paper, a constrained optimization problem is formulated so that speech distortion is minimized while distortion that includes residual noise and speech distortion is kept below the masking threshold of the clean speech. Experimental results show that the algorithm considered in this paper outperforms some of the more popular algorithms in terms of improvement in segmental signal-to-noise ratio (SegSNR) and spectral distance (SD).	algorithm;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);distortion;masking threshold;mathematical optimization;noise reduction;optimization problem;psychoacoustics;signal-to-noise ratio;speech enhancement	Seokhwan Jo;Chang Dong Yoo	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960672	computer vision;constrained optimization;speech recognition;degradation;index term;distortion;computer science;noise;speech;speech coding;pattern recognition;noise reduction;signal-to-noise ratio;frequency domain	Robotics	82.32649344027196	-32.81179250200858	65278

In almost all noise reduction systems an estimate of the current noise power spectral density (PSD) is required. As common methods for background noise estimation fail due to the non-stationary characteristics of wind noise signals, special algorithms are required. The proposed estimation technique consists of three steps: a feature extraction followed by a wind noise detection and the calculation of the current wind noise PSD. For all steps we exploit the different spectral energy distributions of speech and wind noise. In this context, the so-called signal centroids are introduced. Investigations with measured audio data show that our method can cope with the non-stationary characteristics and enables a sufficient reduction of wind noise. In contrast to other wind noise reduction schemes the proposed algorithm has low complexity and low memory consumption.	algorithm;feature extraction;microphone;noise power;noise reduction;rewriting;spectral density;stationary process	Christoph Matthias Nelke;Navin Chatlani;Christophe Beaugeant;Peter Vary	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854970	gradient noise;gaussian noise;image noise;effective input noise temperature;noise spectral density;noise;speech recognition;colors of noise;value noise;noise temperature;noise measurement;noise;noise;background noise;noise figure;noise floor;noise;noise generator;salt-and-pepper noise	EDA	81.65522015888006	-35.31472218578645	65540

Similarly, we define the state estimation problem as the problem of computing the system positions and velocities. In the present paper we propose a framework for simultaneous state and dynamics estimation. The estimation is framed in a Bayesian framework and a suitable Bayesian prior is defined to guarantee the physical consistency of the obtained estimation. The Bayesian posterior makes use of all available measurements which include encoders, gyroscopes, accelerometers, force and torque sensors. The proposed theoretical framework is validated both on simulation and on the iCub humanoid.

The estimation is performed by an iterative inverse filtering approach exploiting analytical suboptimal solutions. Starting from an initial configuration of coefficients, the procedure estimates a continuous piece-wise linear trajectory in terms of reflection coefficients. In this way, smooth trajectories can be estimated which have additionally a high time resolution. One advantage of this analysis technique is that the coefficient trajectories are estimated in the same way as they are used for the synthesis. Examples of synthesized speech signals show that the proposed algorithm suppresses artifacts which are caused by the use of time-invariant estimation procedures.	algorithm;inverse filter;iterative method;reflection coefficient;speech synthesis;time-invariant system	Karl Schnell;Arild Lacroix	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960509	filter;mathematical optimization;probability density function;speech recognition;reflection;computer science;inverse problem;lattice;control theory;reflection coefficient;mathematics;iterative method;speech synthesis	Robotics	81.75176289127451	-34.65084451061381	65854

While the use of harmonic fields can always guarantee finding an existing path, they are extremely computational intensive and a sufficiently detailed map of the environment may lead to an unfeasible solution for the path. Also, since our target application is for the navigation of a smart wheelchair, for people with severe disabilities, the path provided by the harmonic field is frequently too sharp and needs to be smoothened. In order to address the first problem, we propose a parallel algorithm implemented using Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) on the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform. And for the second problem, we developed a rubber band model that provides extra forces to be added to the attracting forces of the harmonic fields. This model assumes that the path is an elastic line, a rubber band, connecting the source and destination points. This rubber band simulates the internal tension forces trying to tighten the line. As the result section demonstrates, both the original path from the harmonic field alone and the path smoothened by the rubber band model have approximate the same length, but the first path contains many bumps, sharp angles, and zig-zags, while the second one provides a much more comfortable ride for the passenger of the wheelchair. Either one is executed in real-time, allowing the proposed method to be used for real navigation of smart wheelchairs.	approximation algorithm;cuda;computation;graphics processing unit;halting problem;interrupt;motion planning;parallel algorithm;predictive modelling;quantum harmonic oscillator;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;robot;snapshot (computer storage)	Ruizhi Z.

Noise reduction, in general, leads to speech distortion, and a balanced tradeoff between noise reduction and speech distortion must be attained. A constrained optimization problem is set to reduce noise so that speech distortion is minimized while the sum of speech distortion and residual noise is kept below the masking threshold of the clean speech. Obtaining a solution to the optimization problem may be infeasible under certain conditions, and a slack variable is introduced to allow certain deviation from the constraint conditions. To estimate the power spectral density and also the masking threshold of clean speech, a speech model that assumes coexisting deterministic and stochastic components in speech is used. Experimental results show that the considered algorithm outperforms some of the more popular algorithms in terms of improvement in segmental signal-to-noise ratio (SegSNR), spectral distance (SD), modified Bark spectral distortion (MBSD), and mean opinion score (MOS).	algorithm;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);distortion;masking threshold;mathematical optimization;noise reduction;optimization problem;psychoacoustics;signal-to-noise ratio;slack variable;spectral density;speech enhancement;stochastic process	Seokhwan Jo;Chang Dong Yoo	2010	IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASL.2010.2041119	mean opinion score;optimization problem;computer vision;constrained optimization;speech recognition;acoustics;computer science;speech;psychoacoustics;signal processing;noise;masking;noise reduction;speech processing;mathematics;deterministic system;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral density;segmentation	ML	81.57946146721292	-32.172730329035936	66386

In this paper, we propose a method that uses the generalized modulation to reshape and minimize the areas of the spectrograms of vocal signals. Instead of multiplying an exponential function with the first order phase, the generalized modulation is to multiply an exponential function whose phase is a higher order polynomial. With the proposed noise-removing algorithm based on generalized modulation, the signal part and the noise part of a vocal signal can be well separated and the effect of noise can be significantly reduced.	algorithm;analytic signal;fractional fourier transform;higher-order function;low-pass filter;modulation;polynomial;short-time fourier transform;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectrogram;time complexity	Jian-Jiun Ding;Ching Hua Lee	2013	2013 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference	10.1109/APSIPA.2013.6694168	pulse-density modulation;delta modulation;emphasis;electronic engineering;pulse-amplitude modulation;speech recognition;pulse-frequency modulation;acoustics;analog signal;noise;mathematics;analog transmission;noise floor	EDA	81.08056587201314	-34.498360734767566	66510

63b3e56c527672c127dcd9fc26c1b66f37da4434	second degree of freedom of elastic objects - adjustable poisson's ratio for mass spring models		In this paper, we show how to construct mass spring models for the representation of homogeneous isotropic elastic materials with adjustable Poisson’s ratio. Classical formulation of elasticity on mass spring models leads to the result, that while materials with any value of Young’s modulus can be modeled reliably, only fixed value of Poisson’s ratio is possible. We show how to extend the conventional model to overcome this limitation.	elasticity (data store);modulus robot	Maciej Kot;Hiroshi Nagahashi	2015		10.5220/0005303601380142		ECom	77.84198976419695	-25.275847248410596	67600

Maximum a posterior (MAP) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimators are derived based on a Gaussian statistical model. The gain function of the MAP estimator was found to be identical to the gain function used in the ideal binary mask (IdBM) that is widely used in computational auditory scene analysis (CASA). As such, it was binary and assumed the value of 1 if the local signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exceeded 0 dB, and assumed the value of 0 otherwise. By modeling the local instantaneous SNR as an F-distributed random variable, soft masking methods were derived incorporating SNR uncertainty. The soft masking method, in particular, which weighted the noisy magnitude-squared spectrum by the a priori probability that the local SNR exceeds 0 dB was shown to be identical to the Wiener gain function. Results indicated that the proposed estimators yielded significantly better speech quality than the conventional minimum mean square error spectral power estimators, in terms of yielding lower residual noise and lower speech distortion.	appendix;assumed;bitwise operation;computational auditory scene analysis;distortion;expanded memory;forty nine;intelligibility (philosophy);isoelectric point;mean squared error;normal statistical distribution;posterior cingulate cortex;series expansion;signal-to-noise ratio;statistical model;technological singularity;time complexity;unsharp masking;exponential	Yang Lu;Philipos C.

This paper introduces an optics based approach to measure catheter motion input to build a catheter navigation system. The principle of measurement, which forms foundation of catheter sensor system, is presented in terms of geometry relationship and approximation. Then calibrated motion measurement is achieved, for both translational and rotational components. A common optical mouse device is used to cheaply implement such a sensor system prototype with other necessary mechanical stages. A computer running corresponding software acquires and processes motion sense via a USB port. Partial experimental results on motion measurement are analyzed, to show proposed approach has impressive motion sense resolution. Finally, comparison between optical mouse sensor and traditional optical encoder are demonstrated and discussions on this technology and catheter manipulator system are also made for future research and work.

The joystick is fabricated using non-magnetic materials and actuated by two high-power electrostatic motor units which produce various force fields in the horizontal plane. The electrostatic motor is a synchronous drive and thus the positioning of the joystick is achieved in an open-loop control. As for force sensing, a 2-DOF force sensor is developed using non-magnetic materials and optical fibers so as to measure interaction force with a user; hence, the haptic rendering is based on the admittance control scheme that respects the rule of force-in and position-out. The operation of both the actuators and force sensor respects non-magnetic principles. Thus, the haptic joystick into which these components are integrated is expected to have high MR compatibility, although the evaluation of the MR compatibility is beyond the scope of this paper. In this paper, the device performance is evaluated in the normal environment, which verifies the operation of the unique electrostatic haptic device.	displacement mapping;force field (chemistry);haptic technology;joystick;maximum force;optical fiber	Masayuki Hara;Gaetan Matthey;Akio Yamamoto;Dominique Chapuis;Roger Gassert;Hannes Bleuler;Toshiro Higuchi	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152850	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;optical fiber;magnetic resonance imaging;neurophysiology;quantum mechanics;electrostatics	Robotics	74.7172946656174	-26.1292327373873	68082

Selecting which aspects of human hand function to emulate can be difficult, especially when little data is available on unstructured human manipulation behavior. The present work analyzes 19 hours of video with over 9000 grasp instances from two housekeepers and two machinists to find small sets of versatile human grasps. A novel grasp span metric is used to evaluate sets of grasps and pick an optimal grasp set which can effectively handle as many different objects as possible. The results show medium wrap and lateral pinch are both important, versatile grasps for basic object handling. The results suggest that three-fingertip precision grasps such as thumb-2 finger, tripod, or lateral tripod can be used to handle dexterous manipulation of a wide range of objects. The recommended grasp sets can help aid difficult design decisions for robotic and prosthetic hands, as well as suggesting important human hand functionality to restore during hand surgery or rehabilitate in an impaired hand.	arm architecture;emulator;lateral computing;lateral thinking;robot;robotic arm;self-replicating machine;tripod	Ian M.

A linear parameter varying (LPV) identification algorithm was used to estimate the Hammerstein system relating ankle position to the reflex EMG response. The estimated Hammerstein system comprised a time-invariant (TI) linear element and a TV static nonlinearity that resembled a half-wave rectifier with a threshold and linear gain. The results demonstrated a systematic change in the reflex nonlinearity with the activation level. The gain of TV nonlinearity increased with activation level reaching its peak at 20-30% maximum voluntary contraction and then decreased. The threshold of the nonlinearity decreased with increasing activation level reaching it minimum at the same point where the gain was maximal. Using the LPV-Hammerstein method in this work, the underlying TV dynamics were extracted from small number of trials. Thus, this method can be used to study stretch reflexes in subjects with neuromuscular disorders.	activation function;electromyography;extraction;isometric contraction;linear iga bullous dermatosis;maximal set;muscle;neuromuscular diseases;nonlinear system;population parameter;reaching;rectifier device component;reflex action;reflex motion descriptor;time-invariant system;algorithm;linear element;lopinavir	Mahsa A.

1c4be0ba2455d5c881857e34ed52c75701d94f15	biomimetic design of an ultra-compact and light-weight soft muscle glove		Wearable robotic hand devices can support people doing hand-intensive tasks by reducing the physical stress and strain on the human hand. For the safety and comfort of the user, such a device should be compatible and inconspicuous. Based on these two requirements, this paper presents a biomimetic design of a wearable robotic hand device called soft muscle glove, aiming to restore the salient features and functionalities of the human hand. Inspired by the hand musculature, the soft structure of the glove contains strings, bands and shape memory alloy (SMA) spring actuators to replicate the functionalities of tendons, pulleys and muscles in the human hand. The low-mass and small-size SMA spring actuator allows an ultra-compact and light-weight design of the glove with high dexterity. The glove weighs in total 85.03 g inclusive of the actuators and microcontroller. The performance of the muscle glove was experimentally investigated through hand function tests. The experimental results suggest that the glove can achieve functional range of motion of the human hand and can perform a wide range of grasp types defined in grasp taxonomy. Moreover, the grasping performance of the muscle glove with coupled and uncoupled flexion of the finger joints was compared. The uncoupled control shows a better matching between the grasp posture and the objects form, contributing to more efficient force transmission. This confirms the benefits of the proposed highly biomimetic design.	biomimetics	Zhejun Yao;Christine Linnenberg;Andreas Argubi-Wollesen;Robert Weidner;Jens Peter Wulfsberg	2017	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-017-0767-y	microcontroller;sma*;actuator;hand musculature;engineering;simulation;wearable computer;pulley;grasp	SE	71.97307979659014	-25.969189382866592	68934

In order to improve adaptation to environmental changes, softness at the module level might be beneficial. However, coping with softness requires a fundamental rethinking of the way modules are built. A major challenge is to develop a connection mechanism that does not limit the softness of the modules, does not require precise alignment and allows for easy detachment. In this paper, we propose a soft active connection mechanism based on electroadhesion. The mechanism uses electrostatic forces to connect modules. The method is easy to implement and can be integrated in a wide range of soft module types. Based on our experimental results, we conclude that the mechanism is suitable as a connection principle for lightweight modules when efficiency over a wide range of softness, tolerance to alignment and easy detachment are desired. The main contributions of this paper are (i) the qualitative comparison of different connector principles for soft modular robots, (ii) the integration of electroadhesion, featuring a novel electrode pattern design, into soft modules and (iii) the demonstration and characterization of the performance of functional soft module mockups including the connection mechanism. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden and The Robotics Society of Japan, 2012	electroadhesion;nv network;robot;robotics	Jürg Germann;Michael Dommer;Ramon Pericet-Camara;Dario Floreano	2012	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/156855312X626325	control engineering;simulation;environmental change;coulomb's law;computer science;engineering;connectivity;self-reconfiguring modular robot;engineering drawing	Robotics	73.81342799387413	-24.159060221924854	69435

Design and optimization of trawl-doors using computational models are a key factor in minimizing the fuel consumption. This paper presents an optimization algorithm for the shape design of trawl-door shapes using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models. Accurate CFD models are computationally expensive. Therefore, the direct use of traditional optimization algorithms, which often require a large number of evaluations, may prohibitive. The proposed approach is iterative and uses low-order local response surface approximation models of the expensive CFD model, constructed in each iteration, to reduce the number of evaluations. The algorithm is applied to the design of a two-element trawl-door (slat and airfoil), involving four design variables controlling the angle of attack and the slat position and orientation. The results show that a satisfactory design can be obtained at the cost of a few iterations of the algorithm.		Elvar Hermannsson;Leifur Þ. Leifsson;S.

Instead of using human passengers as test subjects, a robotic propulsion system is employed to propel the wheelchair in a highly repeatable manner, providing a controlled input torque. It is found that rolling resistance is significantly dependent on the acceleration of the wheelchair, and that the conventional models in which rolling resistance is represented as a Coulomb-type force, are insufficient to describe the dynamic behavior of the wheelchair during acceleration and deceleration.	control system;experiment;flow-based programming;mathematical model;propel;repeatability;robot;sl-1;stationary process;wheels	Efrain Teran;Jun Ueda	2014	2014 IEEE International Workshop on Advanced Robotics and its Social Impacts	10.1109/ARSO.2014.7020996	simulation	Robotics	69.34650721230636	-25.654268253071805	70410
d5f45598a12f7af52314a63c38fce7327b660b59	constructive understanding and reproduction of functions of gluteus medius by using a musculoskeletal walking robot		Several factors affect the performance of humanoid walking. One factor is the complex nature of lower limbs, especially the muscles around the pelvis that contribute significantly to the stability and adaptivity of humanoid locomotion. The significance of this muscle group assures a impact on the facility of walking robots once the nature of its contribution is understood, and it can be replicated on robots. To propose a mechanical structure that facilitates walking in robots, we realized a muscle by modeling its pelvis region like that of a humanoid and developing a musculoskeletal humanoid robot. Especially, we focused on the gluteus medius, which is important for the general stability against frontal movements of the hip. Furthermore, it passively changes its influence on such motions; this is helpful during the different phases of locomotion. These changes depend on the alignment of the pelvis and femur. We confirmed the viability of the robotic gluteus medius, which was simplified to a model of two partial muscles by accomplishing the walking using this robot. This accomplishment verifies our hypothesis that using this model, the supporting functionality for the locomotion of the muscle can be reproduced and enhances the biological plausibility.	mobile robot	Hirofumi Shin;Shuhei Ikemoto;Koh Hosoda	2018	Advanced Robotics	10.1080/01691864.2018.1434015	constructive;physical medicine and rehabilitation;engineering;control theory;humanoid robot;biological plausibility;robot;medius;pelvis	Robotics	68.71343070167713	-27.13912796768495	70747

This is critical since pHRI devices are being developed for rehabilitation or assistance where the user may not be able to provide full strength or speed to counteract accidental movements caused by a motor driven robot. This paper demonstrates effective friction compensation and an interaction controller that increases overall transparency of a passively actuated pHRI device, the Brake Actuated Manipulator (BAM). We analyze the friction compensator's stability with passivity theory, and evaluate the proposed interaction control scheme on the BAM with real time experiments during display of virtual environments composed of non-linear Coulomb or viscous friction. Results show excellent force tracking performance during display, and indicate that passively actuated pHRI devices can be transparent despite notions that brakes are poor actuators.	error-tolerant design;experiment;human–robot interaction;nonlinear system;remote manipulator;virtual reality	Brian Dellon;Yoky Matsuoka	2010	2010 IEEE Haptics Symposium	10.1109/HAPTIC.2010.5444651	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	69.13942089906972	-25.61157584089487	71183

In this paper, an optimization problem is solved to find a quadratic B-spline curve whose Hausdorff distance to the given polyline tool path is within a given precision. Furthermore, adopting time parameter for the fitting curve, we combine the usual two stages of tool path generation and optimal velocity planning to derive a one-step solution for the CNC optimal interpolation problem of polyline tool paths. Compared with the traditional decoupled model of curve fitting and velocity planning, experimental results show that our method generates a smoother path with minimal machining time. The explicit Hausdorff distance of a line segment and a quadratic curve is given.G01 codes can be fitted by quadratic B-splines with confined error.We combine the tool path generating and optimal velocity planning in one step.We simulate the manufacture process with our proposed method.	b-spline;curve fitting;interpolation	Zhengyuan Yang;Li-Yong Shen;Chun-Ming Yuan;Xiao-Shan Gao	2015	Computer-Aided Design	10.1016/j.cad.2015.04.010	mathematical optimization;mathematics;geometry;engineering drawing;curve fitting	EDA	69.35894362382336	-37.90347717098708	71255

In this paper, therefore, the authors firstly propose a small-sized and light-weight robotic hand designed according to the concept of extracting required minimum motor functions and implementing them to the robot, and secondly propose a new robot hand capable of properly realizing a pinching motion with finger tips, by adding the minimum required degree of supplementary freedom which can be realized only with a machine. In the new robot hand, the authors mainly focus on additions of the degrees of freedom of independent motion to the terminal fingers and the degree of freedom of twisting motion to the thumb. Experiments were carried out to investigate force control characteristics of the finger tip joint. The results showed that providing the finger tip with rich force control performance even with weak force is effective for securing delicate control characteristics in a humanoid robot hand.

Quick treatment is important for patients who have shock by internal bleeding. Therefore, focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST), which is a simple and quick diagnostic method, was developed as a first lifesaving step in a hospital. However, a shock patient has little time, and transportation to a hospital may take too long. Therefore, we aim at development of a system which enables FAST at injury scene by assistance of bystander. To develop the system, life-saving flow and a FAST device are significant issues. First, we constructed a diagnosis and treatment scenario. Then, we developed a tele-echography robot system which has 4-DOF that a bystander could attach. This robot is attached to each roughly FAST areas of patient body by a bystander and remotely fine-tuned position by a doctor in a hospital. In this way, a bystander may not do an exact positioning. In addition, the robot has a mechanism to generate contact force between echo probe and patient body surface by two springs. This mechanism not only fit in patient body motion but also reducing the number of controlled axis. To confirm the medical applications of the scenario and the robot, we performed experiments with some examinees and doctors. We confirmed effectiveness of the mechanism and that a bystander could attach the robot to each roughly FAST areas of patient body. We also confirmed that a doctor could do FAST with the robot by remote-controlled on the roughly FAST areas in approximately three minutes. These results show that the robot would enable FAST by assistance of bystander, and the scenario would make FAST faster than the time required transporting the patient to the hospital.	apache axis;experiment;medical ultrasound;remote control;robot;television;wearable computer	Keiichiro Ito;Shigeki Sugano;Hiroyasu Iwata	2010	2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2010.5649708	focused assessment with sonography for trauma;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;biological engineering	Robotics	73.93685179588331	-30.027689029503154	71888

The effective joint dynamics of the user can be altered using a wearable system, providing assistance when a task is performed. The authors have investigated an Active/Passive Pneumatic Actuator (AP2A) for an assistive device, which has a simple structure and responds as a passive nonlinear spring with controllable stiffness. This paper introduces a novel controller for the AP2 $A$ and validates the performance through experiments. The developed controller is found to stabilize at the desired stiffness response within 1 second, confirming the ability of the AP2 $A$ to act as an adjustable passive nonlinear spring.

It is formed by a cascade of machine learning algorithms (kNN and SVM) and uses information obtained by a 6 axis force/torque sensor and, if available, information from the built-in sensors of the robotic gripper. Beyond measuring the success or failure of the entire operation, this architecture makes it possible to detect in real-time when an object is slipping during the picking. Therefore, force and torque signatures are collected during the picking movement of the robot, which is decomposed into five different stages that allows to characterize distinct levels of success over time. Several trials were performed using an industrial robot with two different grippers for picking a long and flexible object. The experiments demonstrate the reliability of the proposed approach under different picking scenarios since, it obtained a testing performance (in terms of accuracy) up to 99.5% of successful identification of the result of the picking operations, considering an universe of 400 attempts.	algorithm;antivirus software;apache axis;binary classification;canonical account;experiment;industrial robot;machine learning;real-time clock;real-time computing;robot end effector;sensor	Eduardo Moreira;Luís F.

Previous approaches to modulation spectral filtering, which made use of incoherent detection of real and positive modulating envelopes for each frequency sub-band, have not offered effective and distortion-free signal modification. Based upon a recent observation that the modulating envelopes are potentially complex, coherent detection is instead proposed. Details are provided for accurate carrier estimation, and tests on both synthetic signals and music, show that modulation filtering is indeed distortion-free. The coherent modulation filtering method is applied to single-channel music sound source separation with promising results for music and other signal separation and modification applications.	carrier recovery;coherent;covox speech thing;distortion;estimation theory;single-sideband modulation;source separation;synthetic intelligence	Les E.

These optimizations improve computation time in general and reduce the expected solution complexity from O(n) to nearly O(nm + m), where n and m are the number of contacts and rigid bodies. For a fixed number of bodies the expected complexity is therefore close to O(n). Our method also improves numerical robustness, and removes the need to explicitly compute the large matrices associated with rigid body contact problems.	complementarity theory;computation;lemke's algorithm;linear complementarity problem;robustness (computer science);simulation;time complexity	John E.

726dd6389fbf1b8fec4a8408d6bad2c04bce7595	skin normal force calibration using vacuum bags		This paper presents a proof of concept to calibrate iCub's skin using vacuum bags. The main idea of the method consists of inserting the skin, made of distributed capacitive sensors, in a vacuum bag and then decreasing the pressure in the bag to create a uniform pressure distribution on the skin surface. The capacitance changes of each sensor were then related to the applied differential pressure using a least square fitting with a fifth order polynomial model. After calibration, integration of the pressure distribution over the skin geometry provides us with the net normal force applied to the skin. Experiments were conducted using the forearm skin of the iCub humanoid robot and the calibration results were validated using standard weights. The validation results indicate acceptable average errors in force prediction.	experiment;humanoid robot;icub;polynomial;sensor;skin (computing);vacuum cleaner	Joan Kangro;Silvio Traversaro;Daniele Pucci;Francesco Nori	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989052	control engineering;simulation;engineering;engineering drawing	Robotics	78.3103025913469	-25.44238457580054	73805

The main goal of the POROS project is to demonstrate that patient positioning systems (PPS) based on industrial robots are reliable solutions for these treatments. However, due to its high number of degrees of freedom (6 DOF), size, and especially important payload weight, such an industrial robot, rigid by definition, holds elastic and geometric deformations. A method to calibrate this type of system in order to take into account these deformation errors, for different payloads, is presented in this article. As the patient weight varies and can reach high values, the rigid model is completed by a flexible one taking into account these deformations. Then, this model with a physical meaning of its parameters is calibrated, in order to reduce the positioning errors. The results of the rigid and the flexible model are compared, indicating that a flexible model is more adapted for the high accuracy requirements of a PPS. Validation results confirm the effectiveness of this model.	ambiguous name resolution;calibration (statistics);computation;control system;distortion;industrial robot;nonlinear system;positioning system;requirement	Nolwenn Kammerer;Yann Perrot	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)	10.1109/CoASE.2012.6386334	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	72.43631759391862	-28.897013452534775	74235

A disadvantage of the design is that they tend to unintentionally waste the users' energy and increase pain and discomfort. Insight to dynamical crutch walking reveals an optimized design principle that harnesses the dissipated energy arising from the interaction between the crutches, the ground and the user's body. Based on the principle, we design and manufacture novel crutches that are able to store the above dissipated energy and release it at the subsequent heel-strike so as to propel the body forward in an optimized means. It eases off the user's pains and maximize the efficiency of the user's metabolic energy while maintaining a feasible crutch walking. The new product is low cost and reliable that easily accesses to the existing market. The proposed principle is extendable to other rehabilitation devices and walking robots.	extensibility;humanoid robot;mathematical optimization;propel	Guangyu Liu;Shane Xie;Longguang Yu;Shaobing Li;Dongning Chu	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913207	simulation;engineering;optimal design;dissipation;force	Robotics	74.47221673138795	-26.348431168010435	74264

Thus, various collision detection algorithms have been proposed to ensure human-robot collision safety, and these algorithms are usually model-based. However, the dynamic model of a robot arm is uncertain or unknown in cases where the arm performs a task with various objects or tools. In this paper, we propose a collision detection method for a robot arm that changes its tools or pick up various objects. For this purpose, a novel collision detection index, which is decoupled from the inevitable external force generated by the object being handled by the robot, is developed. The proposed index is verified through various simulations using a 7-DOF robot arm, and the corresponding results show that regardless of the object that is being handled, it is possible to detect collisions.	algorithm;collision detection;humanoid robot;mathematical model;robotic arm;simulation	Sang-Duck Lee;Jae-Bok Song	2015	2015 IEEE-RAS 15th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids)	10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2015.7363433	robot;mobile robot;database index;computer vision;simulation;robotic arm;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;arm solution;mathematical model;robot control;torque;force	Robotics	70.34978160876442	-24.29710025923713	74516

b22b46934e5cc79eee1b483d2cc5c2680c1880c3	investigating the performance of a wrist stabilization device for image-guided percutaneous scaphoid fixation		Conventional navigated surgery relies on placement of a reference marker on the anatomy of interest. However, placement of such a marker is not readily feasible in small anatomic regions such as the scaphoid bone of the wrist. This study aimed to develop an alternative mechanism for patient tracking that could be used to perform navigated percutaneous scaphoid fixation. A prototype wrist stabilization device was developed to immobilize the scaphoid relative to a reference marker attached to the device. A position measurement system and 3D fluoroscopy were used to study the accuracy and limitations of wrist stabilization during simulated clinical usage with a cadaver specimen. Reference markers mounted on the device were used to measure intra-device motion. Radiometallic beads implanted in the scaphoid were used to measure patient-device motion. Navigated planning and guidance of scaphoid fixation were performed in five cadaver and eight “ideally immobilized” plastic specimens. Postoperative 3D fluoroscopy was used to assess the accuracy of navigated drilling. The average intra-device motion was 1.9 mm during load application, which was elastically recovered upon release of the load. Scaphoid motion relative to the reference marker was predominately rotational with an average displacement of 1.25 mm and $$2.0^{\circ }$$ . There was no significant difference in the accuracy of navigated drilling between the cadaver specimens and the ideally immobilized group. The prototype wrist stabilization device meets the criteria for effective wrist stabilization. This study provides insight concerning proper use of the device to minimize scaphoid displacement and design recommendations to improve immobilization.	anatomic structures;biological specimen;cdisc send biospecimens terminology;cadaver;clinical act of insertion;customize;displacement mapping;forearm;gobots;guidewire device component;immobiliser;immobilization;implants;insertion mutation;jaw fixation techniques;patients;prototype;psychologic displacement;rotator cuff syndrome;scaphoid bone;session fixation;sterilization for infection control;system of measurement	Erin Janine Smith;Gregory Allan;Braden Gammon;Richard W.

These information are traditionally captured using camera-based systems which are very expensive and time-consuming to setup. This paper investigates through a series of experiments whether an integrated sensing system would provide a practical, cost-effective alternative to measuring stride-related information of sprinters. The results show that the system achieves an accuracy within 5ms for stance time and stride time measurements, and ~10cm for localisationrelated information such as CoM forward displacement and CoM stride displacement (i.e. stride length).	atmel avr;displacement mapping;expectation propagation;experiment;minimum phase;on-board data handling;scrum (software development);sesame;simpson's rule;speedrun;sprint (software development);thermal copper pillar bump	Lawrence Cheng;Huiling Tan;Gregor Kuntze;Kyle Roskilly;John Lowe;Ian N.

The wearable robotic suit was designed for walking assist by supporting the whole lower limb, and it had four degrees-of-freedom (DOF). For assisting the whole lower limb, the coordination motion among the suit's multiple joints becomes an important issue to concern. Also, the change of amplitude in a walking period should be considered. We investigated the phase differences among multiple joints and the change of amplitude of the knee flexion/extension motion in walking. In order to realize the complex phase differences among multiple joints, we proposed symmetrical and unsymmetrical inhibitory connections among neural oscillators. In order to make the amplitude changes more flexibly and naturally, we considered the measures of regulating amplitude of the knee flexion/extension motion. We investigated whether the proposed method was valid for realizing the natural trajectories of walking by conducting walking experiments. We verified that our proposal was valid for realization of the anti-phase relationship between the left and right hip joints and about 1/4πphase differences between the hip and knee joints on the ipsilateral side, and we verified that the amplitude regulation algorithm helped to realize the trajectories of natural walking.	algorithm;experiment;robot;usability;wearable computer	Xia Zhang;Minora Hashimoto	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2012.6491158	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;control theory	Robotics	69.51600828344527	-26.42048526600092	74988

Electro-Active Polymers (EAP)materials have been used to construct the muscles type four fingers hand. The main dilemma in the control of artificial muscles type fingers, is to provide an accurate fingertips tracking within the operational space. Yet, if bending angles are controlled successfully, fingertips might deviate from a desired position. This is because of finger deflections and vibrations. In this sense, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)based trajectory planning approach is proposed to calculate modifications in the command values of joint angles for tracking control problem, the position error of the tip of each finger in the operational space is minimized. Study has shown, although artificial muscles robotics hand increases a hand dexterity and allows higher hand manipulability index as compared to moving actuation system, however, accurate control of finger jointing and stuffiness remain vital issues.	artificial neural network;electroactive polymers;linear model;robotics	Ebrahim Mattar	2011	2011 UkSim 13th International Conference on Computer Modelling and Simulation	10.1109/UKSIM.2011.50	control engineering;simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence	Robotics	69.5415527441269	-24.842059109645984	75565

A human operator guides the robot in parent-child-like behavior by exerting force onto the hand of the robot. In contrast to a conventional approach of pHRI in which force/torque measurements are applied, the proposed solution is based on sensorless force control. Furthermore, we demonstrate an extension to the generic interface by implementing a number of gait control algorithms. This paper also evaluates user-acceptable robot responses while guiding a humanoid robot walking. User opinion on the presented control solution is evaluated through usability testing conducted among prospective users. The obtained results indicate that the developed interfaces present an effective solution to the problem of sensorless guidance of a walking robot.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);guidance system;humanoid robot;human–computer interaction;human–robot interaction;mobile robot;nao (robot);pid;prospective search;sensor;system identification;usability testing	Jacek Dabrowski;Polychronis Kondaxakis;Ville Kyrki	2014	The 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication	10.1109/ROMAN.2014.6926250	mobile robot;computer vision;robot end effector;simulation;articulated robot;usability;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;social robot;arm solution;robot control;torque;robotics;force;robot kinematics	Robotics	70.02729206183095	-26.26440294421145	75573

Cyber Physical Systems often include smart components that use local adaptation to improve whole system performance or to provide damage response. Evolvable and Adaptive Hardware (EAH) components, at least conceptually, are often represented as an enabling technology for such smart components. This paper will outline one approach to applying CPS thinking to better address a growing need to address Verification and Validation (V&V) questions related to the use of EAH smart components. It will argue that, perhaps fortuitously, the very adaptations EAH smart components employ for performance improvement may also be employed to maintain V&V capability.	address verification system;robot;verification and validation	John C.

A global-local modeling approach is introduced to determine the critical location in the pile where a crack is initiated using a 3-dimensional nonlinear finite element model and to implement “successive initiation.” A simulated case study is used to showcase the multistep procedure. The results indicate that for a pile subjected to the maximum stress, the first fatigue-induced crack initiates in the tip of the flange at the element immediately below the abutment. Several other cracks at different locations form in the flange of the pile while the initial crack continues to propagate in the flange to the web. The crack propagation rate increases as more cracks initiate in the flange. The propagation rate decreases when the crack reaches the web. Based on the case study presented, a crack could initiate in the pile in as little as 6 years, but it may take about 20 years for it to reach the web; however, final failure of the pile may not take place for several decades. The method can also be used as a guide in bridge foundation inspection and in the determination of the remaining life of an existing bridge. ∗To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Key to the effective operation of this 'hand', in terms of strength, compliance, compactness, speed of finger motions and the safe, secure handling needed to minimise potential damage to the grasped object and the hand itself, is the actuation. This paper describes the design, construction and testing of a 23 DOF robotic dextrous end-effector powered by powerful, yet compliant and accurate braided pneumatic Muscle Actuator (pMA)s. The paper discusses the control and drive systems and shows the hand performing a number of complex manipulative tasks involving dexterity and power and concludes by demonstrating that the hand can perform high speed tele-operated catching operations.

The device is necessary for adequate quantitative evaluation of orthodontic forces during orthodontics. The developed sensing device is composed of six-axis force sensors, tooth models, and arms for connecting sensors and tooth models. The developed device simulates rows of teeth in orthodontic operation and measures $14 \times 6$ axes force and moment from tooth models simultaneously. The averages of the difference of force and moment to theoretical values in each direction are 1.78 % (0.043 N) and 2.72 % (0.60 Nmm) respectively. The average moment applying couple forces is 17.1 % (0.81 Nmm). Then the device is able to measure more accurately as the value of the moment was larger. Therefore using our proposed device, we can conduct the orthodontic treatment which dentition moves large for attaching the rail of wire to the teeth.	alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma;apache axis;axis vertebra;coat of arms;experiment;genus axis;greater;odontogenic tissue;optic axis of a crystal;sensor (device)	Kunio Shimoda;Hiroshi Takemura;Yuuya Obara;Masahiro Shigeta;Kohei Soga;Kazuhiro Suga;Wei-Jen Lai;Sunmin Kim;Zuisei Kanno;Motohiro Uo	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512648	dentition;computer vision;orthodontics;artificial intelligence;orthodontic operation;computer science	Robotics	74.22620061537387	-29.372548921960462	76652

However, it is well lcnown that the R C C has some limitations in flexible precision assembly automation: i ts characteristics (such as the position of remote compliance center and compliance at the point) are not variable. The device has not in fact been improved since i ts invention 20 years ago. To confer more flexibility t o a robotic assembly line, we developed a cost-effective, compact, and lightweight variable R C C (VRCC). The invention of a simple but unique mechanism enabled the fabrication of the variable RCC. The device eliminates the need for an additional complex electrical control system or theory to cope with variation. Moreover, we have verified that a single V R C C duplicates the performance of a wide range of commercially available jixed-type RCC’s.	control system;robot	Sangwan Joo;Fumio Miyazaki	1998		10.1109/IROS.1998.727483	control engineering;cost-effectiveness analysis;engineering;control system;control theory;manufacturing engineering;mechanical engineering	Robotics	72.97077357227447	-24.33492187224321	76790

A purpose of the developed robot is to realize continuous operation for a long time and to improve an action autonomously. we considered three aspects of robustness, mechanical robustness, functional robustness and robustness of an action. Mechanical robustness was confirmed by the experiment that the robot fell down without mechanical failures and continued to work after falling down by using hard points. Functional robustness was designed to use power cable and to wear a suit which can be changed by required functionality. Robustness of an action was achieved as a standing up action using “StateNet”, which realized autonomous error recovery. Finally, we present a methodology to develop a humanoid robot platform which can continue to work in the real world.	autonomous robot;continuous operation;humanoid robot;robustness (computer science)	Youhei Kakiuchi;Masayuki Kamon;Nobuyasu Shimomura;Sou Yukizaki;Noriaki Takasugi;Shunichi Nozawa;Kei Okada;Masayuki Inaba	2017	2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2017.8202226	humanoid robot;robustness (computer science);control engineering;computer science;robot;continuous operation	Robotics	72.60041980010679	-24.628334873440036	78100

Because of the weakness of the signal, the background noise always dominates in the patch-clamp recordings. The threshold detector is traditionally used to denoise and restore the ionic single channel currents. However, this method cannot work satisfactorily when signal-to-noise ratio is lower. A new approach based on hidden Markov model (HMM) is presented to restore ionic single-channel currents and estimate model parameters under white background noise. In the study, a global optimization method of HMM parameters based on stochastic relaxation (SR) algorithm is used to estimate the kinetic parameters of channel. Then, the ideal channel currents are reconstructed applying Viterbi algorithm from the patch-clamp recordings contaminated by noise. The theory and experiments have shown that the method performs effectively under the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR<5.0) and has fast parameter convergence, high restoration precision and strong noise robusticity.	algorithm;circuit restoration;estimation theory;hidden markov model;ionic	X.

Previous methods achieve this by estimating excitation phases at synthesis frame boundaries, disregarding the frequency modulation that may occur between the frame boundary and the nearest modified excitation point. This approximation can produce a significant mis-alignment of the excitation phases, leading to distortion of the temporal structure of the synthetic speech. In this paper, a shape-invariant technique is proposed which aligns the excitation phases at excitation points, whilst allowing for variations in the frequency of the sinusoidal components.	approximation;distortion;modulation;shape context;speech synthesis;synthetic intelligence;while	Mat P.

40a68f436fde399ba0fd3546a2b3e92df4d58cd8	orisnake: design, fabrication, and experimental analysis of a 3-d origami snake robot		Snake robots offer a useful and unique mobility platform for search-and-rescue applications. However, existing prototypes made of rigid links and joints are hampered by a lack of flexibility that limits their utility in highly cluttered, maze-like environments, and their heavy weight limits their energy-efficiency and performance in three-dimensional (3-D) tasks. To address these challenges, this letter presents a new approach using cylindrical, origami continuum modules driven by internal cables and electric motors, as well as a local feedback control system on each module. Thus, we can distribute actuation, sensing, and control for highly scalable soft robotic continuum origami systems. Using this approach, we develop a 3-D origami robotic snake that is able to locomote using lateral undulation and sidewinding gaits similar to those used by biological snakes. The proposed snake robot is a continuously deformable, lightweight, modular, and low cost robotic system made of a folded thin plastic body. We detail the design, fabrication, and control of this first 3-D origami robotic snake prototype, focusing on the analysis of locomotion parameters for each gait. We experimentally search for the optimal parameters for both types of locomotion, with maximum speeds characterized as 40.5 mm/s (0.1 body-lengths per second) for lateral undulation and 35 mm/s (0.09 body-lengths per second) for sidewinding locomotion.	control system;experiment;feedback;lateral computing;lateral thinking;prototype;robot;scalability;triune continuum paradigm;undulation of the geoid	Ming Luo;Ruibo Yan;Zhenyu Wan;Yun Qin;Junius Santoso;Erik H.

The performance of such time–frequency (t–f) based DOA estimation algorithms depends on the resolution of the underlying TFD as a higher resolution TFD leads to better separation of sources in the t–f domain. This paper presents a novel DOA estimation algorithm that uses the adaptive directional t–f distribution (ADTFD) for the analysis of close signal components. The ADTFD optimizes the direction of kernel at each point in the t–f domain to obtain a clear t–f representation, which is then exploited for DOA estimation. Moreover, the proposed methodology can also be applied for DOA estimation of sparse signals. Experimental results indicate that the proposed DOA algorithm based on the ADTFD outperforms other fixed and adaptive kernel based DOA algorithms.

This paper then investigates the effects of an active wobbling mass that moves backward and forward in the body frame on the generated gait properties. First, we develop the reduced mathematical model for analysis and design the controller for driving the wobbling mass. Second, we show that the walking speed is successfully increased by adjusting the desired wobble frequency according to the effect of entrainment through numerical simulations. Furthermore, we conduct verification experiments using our CRW machine.	brainwave entrainment;computer simulation;experiment;mathematical model;numerical analysis;prototype;wobble frequency	Fumihiko Asano;Yukihiro Akutsu;Isao T.

Therefore, pneumatic actuators are used to develop safe and lightweight robot hands. However, the relationship between the internal pressure and contraction ratio of pneumatic actuators is nonlinear, with a hysteresis characteristic and a dead zone. Moreover, the nonlinear characteristics of pneumatic actuators change with the applied load. In this study, we proposed a hysteresis model that can express the change in these hysteresis characteristics, and we constructed a control system that integrated this hysteresis compensation by using the proposed hysteresis model.	coexist (image);control system;humans;hysteresis;nonlinear system;robot;stiffness;xfig	Akihito Ito;Naohiko Washizawa;Koh Kiyoto;Nobuyuki Furuya	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2011.6181687	control engineering;simulation;pneumatic actuator;hysteresis;computer science;engineering;control system;mathematical model;control theory	Robotics	70.51361049212686	-24.9700615045336	79450

We proposed virtual force sensing (VFS) which, is a versatile solution allowing high spatial resolution and degrees of freedom instead of embedding force sensors in robots/machines. The technological key of the VFS is the estimation of the force, exerted by the user and applied to the robots/machines, by means of function approximation whose inputs are user's biological signals such as electromyogram (EMG) and postural information. In this study, we develop a three-dimensional force-vector estimator and investigate its performance through a three-dimensional trajectory tracing task. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.	approximation;electromyography;interaction;robot;sensor;telecommuting	Tomoya Tamei;Tomohiro Shibata	2010	2010 5th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering	10.1109/SYSOSE.2010.5544098	control engineering;computer vision;simulation;information science;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;tactile sensor	Robotics	73.50982232362045	-27.196228534916987	79686
177c0c5828e529aedd62360334102332b8f4d912	design of a two-point-contact fingertip tactile force feedback device		Fingertip tactile force feedback device has been applied to a variety of systems in recent years. However, most of them assume the feedback force concentrating at a point of a plane rather than on a multi-point distribution. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel device to provide a touch sensation by generating two feedback forces distributed in two points of user¡¯s finger pad, where the local force at each point is up to 8N. It consists of a tactile feedback module and a control system. Moreover, we design remote interactive tactile experiments to verify the performance of the proposed device. Experimental results show that when the model fingertip is pressed on the different surfaces of objects in a remote environment, our device can generate the corresponding feedback forces to simulate the different touch sensations. The magnitudes of the feedback forces are approximate to those of the contact forces obtained from the model fingertip in the remote environment. Most importantly, the proposed device can bring more realistic contact force reproduction to the user.	approximation algorithm;control system;experiment;feedback;finger tree;haptic technology;simulation	Zhen Zhang;Adiljan Yimit;Xin Lu;Yoshihiro Hagihara	2017	2017 2nd International Conference on Cybernetics, Robotics and Control (CRC)	10.1109/CRC.2017.49	thumb;simulation;actuator;contact force;haptic technology;touch sensation;control system;tactile sensor;computer science	Robotics	76.38659185401576	-27.073839719515004	79902

The robotic glove leverages soft material actuator technology to safely distribute forces along the length of the finger and provide active flexion and passive extension. These actuators consist of molded elastomeric bladders with anisotropic fiber reinforcements that produce specific bending, twisting, and extending trajectories upon fluid pressurization. In particular, we present a method for customizing a soft actuator to a wearer's biomechanics and demonstrate in a motion capture system that the ranges of motion (ROM) of the two are nearly equivalent. The active ROM of the glove is further evaluated using the Kapandji test. Lastly, in a case study, we present preliminary results of a patient with very weak hand strength performing a timed Box-and-Block test with and without the soft robotic glove.	embedded system;experiment;graphical user interface;motion capture;optical fiber;robot;sensor	Panagiotis Polygerinos;Kevin C.

Comparing to the end-effector guided robots, exoskeleton robots provide better guidance on the posture of upper extremity, especially during movements with large ranges. Regarding the upper extremity, the natural coordination called shoulder rhythm is the most challenge to the ergonomic design of shoulder exoskeleton. Based on kinematic analysis of movement of shoulder complex,a nine degree-of-freedom exoskeleton rehabilitation with six degree-of-freedom shoulder actuation mechanism is proposed. In order to verify the manipulability of the proposed robot during assisting patient with performing activities of daily living (ADLs), the performance criteria, i.e., dexterity measure and manipulability ellipsoid, are used to evaluate and compare with human upper extremity. The evaluated result confirms the ergonomic design of shoulder mechanism of the rehabilitation robot on providing approximate dexterity matching that of human upper extremity in ADLs.	human factors and ergonomics;robot	Wenbin Chen;Caihua Xiong;Ronglei Sun;Xiaolin Huang	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-10817-4_107	activities of daily living;engineering;degrees of freedom	Robotics	71.52439852302929	-27.176164526756054	80671

The approach is termed as grey VAD (GVAD). In GVAD, the GM(1,1) model is used to estimate non-stationary noise in noisy speech and therefore signal component where an additive signal model is assumed. By estimated noise and signal, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated. Based on an adaptive threshold, the speech and non-speech segments are determined. The proposed GVAD is performed in the time domain and thus has less computational complexity than those frequency domain approaches. Through simulation, the GVAD is verified by cases with non-stationary noise. The result indicates that the proposed GVAD is able to detect voice activity appropriately.	computational complexity theory;norm (social);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;stationary process;utility functions on indivisible goods;voice activity detection	Cheng-Hsiung Hsieh;Ting-Yu Feng	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384480	voice activity detection;speech recognition;time domain;computer science;speech processing;thresholding;speech segmentation;estimation theory;computational complexity theory;signal-to-noise ratio;frequency domain;detection theory	Robotics	82.2853729648549	-33.93322050922196	81163

These significantly affect the robot's dexterity, manipulability, reachability, and visibility, which are essential to the success of the surgical procedure. Experienced surgeons still have difficulty solving these problems. Because of possible robot part collisions, the optimal placement of ports may differ for robotically assisted procedures in comparison to traditional MIS. This paper proposes the choice of the best port location and determination of the pose of the robot based on optimization equations that are in turn based on certain evaluation criteria. Two performance measures are proposed: the global isotropy index (GII ), which has been developed to optimize the robot's dexterity, and the efficiency index (EI) to maximize the reachability and visibility of the robot. Computerized simulations of the da Vinci surgical system for surgery in synthetic box environments are performed to find out the optimal solutions. A direct way to evaluate the feasibility of the performance measures for collision-free intervention is also illustrated. It is proved that the GII and EI are correlated and complementary. In addition, this study develops a procedure and guidelines that help the performance of an efficient intervention with the use of the da Vinci surgical system.	binary prefix;dexterity programming language;docking (molecular);internet;mathematical optimization;performance tuning;reachability;robot;simulation;synthetic data;workspace	Loi Wah Sun;Chung Kwong Yeung	2007	2007 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2007.4399354	process performance index;simulation;engineering;engineering drawing	Robotics	72.31871342767704	-29.761008182717866	81190

In this paper, we study the application of the actor-critic architecture, with neural networks for the both the actor and the critic, as a controller that can adapt to these changing dynamics of a human arm. Development and tests were done in simulation using a planar arm model and Hill-based muscle dynamics. We begin by training it using a Proportional Derivative (PD) controller as a supervisor. We then make clinically relevant changes to the dynamics of the arm and test the actor-critic's ability to adapt without supervision in a reasonable number of episodes. Finally, we devise methods for achieving both rapid learning and long-term stability.	3d modeling;artificial neural network;cluster analysis;controllers;experiment;functional electrical stimulation;inspiration function;limb structure;muscle;neural network simulation;preparation;reln wt allele;rl (complexity);reinforcement learning;shin megami tensei: persona 3	Philip S.

Traditionally, least squares minimization is used for the estimation of model parameters of the system. Motivated by the sparse nature of the excitation signal for voiced sounds, we explore the time-varying linear prediction modeling of speech signals using sparsity constraints. Parameter estimation is posed as a 0-norm minimization problem. The re-weighted 1-norm minimization technique is used to estimate the model parameters. We show that for sparsely excited time-varying systems, the formulation models the underlying system function better than the least squares error minimization approach. Evaluation with synthetic and real speech examples show that the estimated model parameters track the formant trajectories closer than the least squares approach.	coefficient;estimation theory;least squares;sparse matrix;synthetic intelligence	Ch.

195c3b594126f9a420afada04f0375e868e7ef83	joint power line interference suppression and ecg signal recovery in transform domains		Abstract This work addresses the electrocardiogram (ECG) recovery problem in the presence of power line interference (PLI) that corrupts the signal quality if it is not effectively suppressed. In this paper, the PLI is modeled as a linear superposition of sinusoidal signals, which has a sparse representation in the frequency domain. To accurately reconstruct the ECG, the time, second-order difference, and wavelet domains are exploited to sparsely represent the ECG. From the reformulations conducted, a novel joint optimization estimation is devised to simultaneously perform the ECG recovery and PLI suppression in the transform domains. Moreover, in order to solve the optimization problem, two efficient schemes based on the greedy algorithm together with the basis pursuit (BP) are developed. Finally, numerical studies demonstrate that the performance of the joint estimation algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art approaches.	detection theory;interference (communication);zero suppression	Hongqing Liu;Yong Li;Yi Zhou;Xiaorong Jing;Trieu-Kien Truong	2018	Biomed.

Alternative ultrasound modalities, such as elastography, offer promising improvements over current sonography cancer detection rates but require stability and knowledge of applied force. A human-robot scanning system could leverage the sonographer's capabilities to select transducer placement while the robot maintains stability during scanning. This paper presents a novel hybrid force velocity controller for ultrasound scanning which utilizes elastography to provide compliance feedback and improve controller performance. We explore the sensitivity of the elastography algorithm to initial elasticity assumptions and analyze the performance gains of compliance feedback. The results of our study show that our proposed controller provides a performance improvement when poor initial tissue compliance estimates are used.	algorithm;ct scan;controller (computing);elasticity (data store);elastography;medical ultrasound;robot;transducer;velocity (software development)	Michael E.

This problem can be cast as a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program which is known to be NP-hard in general. We propose three approaches to tackle it: a heuristic method, an alternate minimization method, and a convex relaxation into a semi-definite program. The last two approaches are showed to outperform the oracle multichannel Wiener filter in under-determined informed source separation tasks, using simulated and speech signals. The convex relaxation approach yields best results, including the potential for exact source separation in under-determined settings.	heuristic;linear programming relaxation;np-hardness;quadratic programming;quadratically constrained quadratic program;semiconductor industry;source separation;wiener filter	Antoine Deleforge;Yann Traonmilin	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952138	machine learning;speech recognition;mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;wiener filter;magnitude (mathematics);blind signal separation;matrix (mathematics);semidefinite programming;source separation;mathematics;quadratically constrained quadratic program;signal-to-noise ratio	ML	82.72625570683945	-36.75019816097281	81969

The near optimal sensor configuration was designed for implantable measurement system, and linear estimators were used to estimate the mentioned angles. This system was separately evaluated in a mechanical knee simulator and the effect of the imposed Abduction-Adduction rotation was also studied on the angle estimations. To reduce the power consumption of the internal system, we reduced the sampling rate and duty cycled the implantable sensors. Then we compensated the lack of information via use of kinematic information from wearable sensors to provide accurate angle estimations. As long as this smart prosthesis is not implanted yet on a subject, the angles estimations from implantable sensors and wearable sensors are realistically simulated for four subjects. The simulated angle estimations were fed to the designed data fusion algorithms to boost the estimation performance. The results were considerably improved via use of Maximum Entropy Ordered Weighted Averaging (MEOWA) fusion for flexion angles, but not for internal-external angle estimations.	algorithm;embedded system;sampling (signal processing);sensor;simulation;system of measurement;wearable computer;wearable technology	Arash Arami;Arnaud Barré;Roderik Berthelin;Kamiar Aminian	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Body Sensor Networks	10.1109/BSN.2013.6575473	estimation;simulation;computer science;linear regression;iron;statistics	Robotics	71.77287696706586	-28.331834012455904	82185

In rehabilitation for knee injuries and aiding elderly people with knee joint arthritis, it is often desired to reduce the load at the knee to help the healing process as well as to relieve pain. However, the use of passive devices may cause inconveniences in daily routines and difficulties in mobility for the user. Current robotics orthotic devices have advantages over passive devices because it is capable of aiding the knee; reduce the knee stress without affecting the mobility of the user.

We have proposed a walking support robot equipped with velocity and torque-based mechanical safety devices. The velocity-based safety device and the torque-based safety device are attached to each drive-shaft of the robot. If the velocity-based safety device detects an unexpected high angular velocity of the drive-shaft, it stops the robot. If the torque-based safety device detects an unexpected high torque of the drive-shaft, it cuts off the torque transmission and switches off all of the robot's motors. This paper proposes a new walking support robot equipped with not only the velocity-based and torque-based safety devices but also contact force-based safety devices. The contact force-based safety device stops the robot if it detects an unexpected large contact force between the robot and the environment (e.g. humans). These safety devices will work even when the computer breaks down, because they consist of only passive mechanical components without actuators, controllers, or batteries. Firstly, we describe the walking support robot with the safety devices. Secondly, we show the prototype walking support robot which we developed. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the safety devices by experiments.	angularjs;experiment;fail-safe;network switch;prototype;robot;velocity (software development)	Yoshihiro Kai;Kai Arihara	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7354084	structural engineering;control engineering;simulation;engineering;torque;force	Robotics	71.57791899824801	-25.18721276443138	82929
a070e22fb362ecce8a3e6279a79f79c42793d027	a single-channel ica-r method for speech signal denoising combining emd and wavelet	single channel independent component analysis;speech signal denoising;emd;independent component analysis;期刊论文;scica;fast independent component analysis with reference;wavelet;empirical mode decomposition	According to the problem of speech signal denoising, we propose a novel method in this paper, which combines empirical mode decomposition (EMD), wavelet threshold denoising and independent component analysis with reference (ICA-R). Because there is only one mixed recording, it is a single-channel independent component analysis (SCICA) problem in fact, which is hard to solve by traditional ICA methods. EMD is exploited to expand the single-channel received signal into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) in advance, therefore traditional ICA of multi-dimension becomes applicable. First, the received signal is segmented to reduce the processing delay. Secondly, wavelet thresholding is applied to the noise-dominated IMFs. Finally, fast ICA-R is introduced to extract the object speech component from the processed IMFs, whose reference signal is constructed by assembling the high-order IMFs. The simulations are carried out under different noise levels and the performance of the proposed method is compared with EMD, wavelet thresholding, EMD-wavelet and EMD-ICA approaches. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method exhibit superior denoising performance especially when signal-to-noise ratio is low, with a half shorter running time.	autocorrelation;coefficient;computer simulation;dependability;fast fourier transform;fastica;hilbert–huang transform;independent component analysis;noise reduction;processing delay;signal-to-noise ratio;stationary wavelet transform;thresholding (image processing);time complexity	Yangyang Qi;Fuqiang Yao;Miao Yu	2014	JCP	10.4304/jcp.9.9.2082-2090	wavelet;independent component analysis;speech recognition;computer science;hilbert–huang transform;machine learning;pattern recognition;statistics	ML	80.27727971440737	-38.009011691690056	82984

3d9f35fa43a1b3188b2b4a9da4c661e79adfc5c5	dynamic bilateral teleoperation of the cart-pole: a study toward the synchronization of human operator and legged robot		This letter presents the experimental evaluation of a bilateral feedback law for the teleoperation of an underactuated dynamic system: the Cart-Pole. This physical system illustrates another simple model, the Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP); a popular template for legged robot control and, in this letter, the mapping channel between the operator and robot. We develop a scaling strategy based on geometric and kinematic similarity in order to generate dynamically feasible trajectories for the LIP with a natural frequency different than the human's. Moreover, by modifying the classic equations for the Cart-Pole, we show how it can competently represent the proposed template quantitatively and visually. Experiments where a human operator dynamically controls slave systems with slower or faster natural frequencies illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method. This study is a step toward building a human–machine interface that dynamically synchronize operator and legged robot in order to eventually achieve complex motor behaviors.	behavior;bilateral filter;clinical use template;dynamical system;experiment;image scaling;interface device component;inverted pendulum;nevus sebaceous;robot control;test scaling;user interface	João Ramos;Sangbae Kim	2018	IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters	10.1109/LRA.2018.2852840	legged robot;engineering;control theory;control engineering;operator (computer programming);teleoperation;synchronization;cart	Robotics	69.39366225928414	-26.433315847295486	83567

In spite of many benefits of the capsule endoscope, however, it has been limited used only for esophagus and small intestine because of its mobility deficiency in the diagnosis. Therefore, in order to expand the applicable fields of the capsule endoscopy into stomach and colon, the mobility function such as 3-dimensional (D) locomotion of the capsule endoscope is indispensable. Previously, some researchers proposed the mobility mechanisms of the capsule endoscope. However, they could not realize sufficiency DOF (degree of freedom) and not show various motions of the capsule endoscope. In this paper, therefore, we propose a novel electromagnetic actuation (EMA) system which can operate 3-D locomotion of a capsule endoscope in the digestive organs. The proposed electromagnetic actuation system for guiding magnetic capsule endoscope, comprised of 5-pairs of solenoid coils and a capsule endoscope with a small magnet. By the electromagnetic field which is operated from the EMA system using the five pairs of solenoid coils, the capsule endoscope can show diverse motions for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal tract like as propulsion to any direction, steering and helical motion. Through a locomotion test, we confirm that ALICE can show the tracking angle error under 4 degrees. In addition, to verify the feasibility of ALICE as a real diagnostic device, a real camera and a FPV (First-person Point of View) control interface are integrated with ALICE. Consequently, through the basic mobility test and the in-vitro test, we verify the feasibility of ALICE system as a medical endoscopic device	airport time capsule;alice;angular defect;colon classification;guidance system;point of view (computer hardware company);tract (literature);webcam	Cheong Lee;Hyunchul Choi;Gwangjun Go;Viet Ha Le;Jong-Oh Park;Sukho Park	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2016.7866546	magnetic field;electromagnetism;engineering;magnetic resonance imaging;biological engineering;quantum mechanics	Robotics	73.87186968849082	-29.32430053802294	83752

To provide assistance and rehabilitation to individuals with upper limb dysfunction due to conditions such as stroke or spinal cord injuries, we have developed a 4DoFs exoskeleton robot (ExoRob). The ExoRob was designed to be worn on the lateral side of the upper arm, to conform to a naturalistic range of movement for the shoulder and elbow joints. This paper focuses on the modelling, design, development, and control of the ExoRob. Experiments were carried out with healthy human subjects where trajectories tracking in the form of passive rehabilitation exercises were performed. Further experiments were carried out with the master exoskeleton arm (mExoArm, an upper-limb prototype exoskeleton arm) where subjects operate the mExoArm (like a joystick) to maneuver the ExoRob to provide passive rehabilitation. Experimental results show that the ExoRob can effectively perform passive rehabilitation exercises.	electromyography;entity–relationship model;experiment;joystick;lopes (exoskeleton);lateral thinking;nonlinear system;prototype;robot	Mohammad Habibur Rahman;Maarouf Saad;Jean-Pierre Kenné;Philippe S.

The noise estimation algorithm makes use of a nonlinear model of the acoustic environment in the cepstral domain. Central to the algorithm is the innovative iterative stochastic approximation technique that improves piecewise linear approximation to the nonlinearity involved and that subsequently increases the accuracy for noise estimation. We report comprehensive experiments on SPLICE-based, noise-robust speech recognition for the AURORA2 task using the results of iterative stochastic approximation. The effectiveness of the new technique is demonstrated in comparison with a more traditional, MMSE noise estimation algorithm under otherwise identical conditions. The word error rate reduction achieved by iterative stochastic approximation for recursive noise estimation in the framework of noise-normalized SPLICE is 27.9% for the multicondition training mode, and 67.4% for the clean-only training mode, respectively, compared with the results using the standard cepstra with no speech enhancement and using the baseline HMM supplied by AURORA2. These represent the best performance in the clean-training category of the September-2001 AURORA2 evaluation. The relative error rate reduction achieved by using the same noise estimate is increased to 48.40% and 76.86%, respectively, for the two training modes after using a better designed HMM system. The experimental results demonstrated the crucial importance of using the newly introduced iterations in improving the earlier stochastic approximation technique, and showed sensitivity of the noise estimation algorithm’s performance to the forgetting factor embedded in the algorithm.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;approximation error;baseline (configuration management);cepstrum;embedded system;experiment;hidden markov model;iteration;linear approximation;noise shaping;nonlinear system;piecewise linear continuation;recursion (computer science);speech enhancement;speech recognition;stochastic approximation;word error rate	Li Deng;Jasha Droppo;Alex Acero	2003	IEEE Trans.

The essential element of the proposed method is a multi-modal interface that provides the robot with the feedback about the human motor behaviour in real-time. The human muscle activity measurements and the arm force manipulability properties encode the information about the motion and impedance, and the intended configuration of the task frame, respectively. Through this human-in-the-loop framework, the developed hybrid controller of the robot can adapt its actions to provide the desired motion and impedance regulation in different phases of the cooperative task. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach in a two-person sawing task that requires an appropriate complementary behaviour from the two agents.	characteristic impedance;computer multitasking;encode;experiment;modal logic;real-time clock;robot	Luka Peternel;Nikolaos G.

Automation in industries reduced the human effort, but still there are many industries in which human have to do complex and repetitive tasks manually. The society/companies have to pay attention on this issue due to the new laws on penibility or repetitive tasks. The objective of this paper is to experimentally validate a new dynamic muscle fatigue model using electromyography (EMG) and Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). A new model is developed by introducing a co-contraction factor 'n' in the Ruina Ma's dynamic muscle fatigue model. The experimental data of ten subjects are used to analyze the muscle activities and muscle fatigue during extension-flexion motion of the arm on a constant absolute value of the external load. The findings for co-contraction factor shows that the fatigue increases when co-contraction area decreases. The dynamic muscle fatigue model is validated using the MVC data, fatigue rate and co-contraction factor of the subjects.	automation;electrical load;electromyography;experiment;model–view–controller	Deep Seth;Damien Chablat;Fouad Bennis;Sophie Sakka;Marc Jubeau;Antoine Nordez	2016		10.1145/2927929.2927935	simulation;engineering;physical therapy;forensic engineering	HCI	70.17192007452745	-27.84841798778697	85190

However, in micro environments, manipulating objects by hand is often not feasible or practical. We have developed a two-fingered microhand, which will help to improve operation efficiency. Using the microhand, we can manipulate cells i.e., grab, rotate, carry, and so on - like when using chop sticks. The stiffness measurement of a cell is a key approach in single cell analysis techniques. It is important in indicating cell condition, because the stiffness of a cancer cell is lower than that of a normal cell as an example. In this paper, the pressure force caused in the process of cell deformation is measured via a micro force sensor attached to the root of micro glass needle. Our results point out that this can be one efficient measurement method for acquiring cell stiffness. The micro force sensor uses strain gauges to measure the strain of the glass needle so that we can find out the force generated on the micro force sensor indirectly. In this paper, two topics are discussed. One is for converting strain data to force data based on the force sensor model. The other refers to the experimental results about the stiffness measurement of the oocyte.	cell signaling;glass;sensor;stiffness;system of measurement	Daiki Kawakami;Kenichi Ohara;Tomohito Takubo;Yasushi Mae;Akihiko Ichikawa;Tamio Tanikawa;Tatsuo Arai	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2010.5723466	control engineering;calibration;strain gauge;engineering;nanotechnology;glass;strain;force;force-sensing resistor;mechanical engineering	Robotics	76.02346660642036	-25.359486322000873	85699

The automated tool planning for this process is a nontrivial problem, especially for geometry-complicated parts consisting of multiple freeform surfaces. Existing tool planning approaches are not able to deal with this kind of compound surfaces. This paper proposes a tool path planning approach which considers the tool motion performance and the thickness uniformity. There are two steps in this approach. The first step partitions the part surface into flat patches based on its topology and normal directions. The second step determines the tool movement patterns and the sweeping directions for each flat patch. Based on that, optimal tool paths can be calculated. Experimental tests are carried out on automotive body parts and the results validate the proposed approach.	motion planning	Weihua Sheng;Heping Chen;Ning Xi;Jindong Tan;Yifan Chen	2004		10.1109/ROBOT.2004.1307127	engineering;forming processes;process control;motion planning;engineering drawing;manufacturing engineering	Robotics	69.31988342686503	-33.6527525865418	86064
67af6417b190ff858d66edac93e34507ad4a42ee	phase vocoder done right		The phase vocoder (PV) is a widely spread technique for processing audio signals. It employs a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis-modify-synthesis loop and is typically used for time-scaling of signals by means of using different time steps for STFT analysis and synthesis. The main challenge of PV used for that purpose is the correction of the STFT phase. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for phase correction based on phase gradient estimation and its integration. The method does not require explicit peak picking and tracking nor does it require detection of transients and their separate treatment. Yet, the method does not suffer from the typical phase vocoder artifacts even for extreme time stretching factors.	commercial software;filter bank;gradient;image scaling;page view;phase vocoder;sensor;short-time fourier transform;transient (computer programming)	Zdenek Prusa;Nicki Holighaus	2017	2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081353	short-time fourier transform;fourier transform;electronic engineering;phase vocoder;acoustics;time–frequency analysis;audio signal;audio time-scale/pitch modification;computer science;coherence (physics)	AI	80.41641640801922	-34.572052377238506	86437

Smart copying is an intelligent version of the """"cut and paste"""" technique which amounts to replacing the missing fragment with a similar one extracted from the material preceding or succeeding the gap. The paper presents an optimal, from the statistical point of view way of crossfading the inserted fragment into the projection-based reconstruction obtained using the maximum a posteriori approach. First, a general reconstruction formula is derived allowing one to estimate unknown samples from the known (neighboring) ones. Then, it is shown that the unknown excitation appearing in the analytical reconstruction formula can be replaced with the natural excitation waveform extracted from the available portions of the signal. It is shown that the reconstruction can be carried out recursively using the appropriately configured variable-order Kalman filter. Finally, a simplified reconstruction scheme is derived, allowing one to reduce dramatically computational costs when filling very large gaps."""

Traditionally-used pressure sensor devices are expensive, sensitive to the experimental environment, and difficult to reproduce. In this paper, a physically-based cloth simulator has been tested for its usability as to measuring the cloth pressure, in order to replace physical measurement of cloth pressure that requires careful operation of pressure sensors. We use existing cloth simulator based on a particle system and measure spring forces exerted on each particle along its normal direction, divided by the summed area of triangles adjacent to that particle. To quantitatively validate the pressure values from the simulator, we have conducted comparative analysis on a set of thin-shell cylindrical tubes --- clothing pressure values have been measured by theoretical estimation and physical experiments using pressure sensors, and compared with those measured by the simulation. While their absolute pressure values differ from each other they exhibit a consistent tendency. From these comparative studies we concluded that cloth simulator can actually be used to measure tight-fit cloth pressure, and further conducted the clothing pressure measure on 3D human body models using the simulator.	cloth modeling;experiment;fits;normal (geometry);particle system;qualitative comparative analysis;sensor;simulation;usability	Hyewon Seo;See-Jo Kim;Frederic Cordier;Kyunghi Hong	2007		10.1145/1236246.1236308	human body;simulation;pressure measurement;quantitative analysis;pressure sensor;comparative research;particle system;computer graphics (images)	HCI	79.52966581708257	-25.660339311210254	88799

The aim of this analysis is to determine  the valid orientations of the inspection devices used in probe operations and non-contact scanning operations on a Coordinate  Measuring Machine (CMM). A STL model has been used for dis-cretizing the inspection part in a set of triangles, which permits  the application of the developed system to any type of part, regardless of its shape and complexity. The methodology is based  on the application of computer graphics techniques such as ray-tracing, spatial subdivision and back-face culling. This analysis  will take into account the real shape and geometry of the inspection device and the constraints imposed by the CMM on which  it is mounted. A simplified model has been developed for each inspection device component using different basic geometrical  shapes. Finally, collision-free orientations are clustered for minimizing the orientation changes during the inspection process.  	accessibility;ray tracing (graphics)	Braulio Jose Alvarez;Pedro Fernández;Jose Carlos Rico;Gonzalo Valiño	2008		10.1007/978-90-481-2311-7_39	ray tracing;computer vision;computer science;engineering drawing;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	69.45426451974602	-34.52770064244313	88817

The method uses a recursive adaptive gradient descent technique with the cost function designed to maximize the kurtosis of the output (separated) signals. The choice of kurtosis maximization as an objective function (which acts as a measure of separation) is supported by experiments with a number of speech signals as well as spherically invariant random processes (SIRP’s) which are regarded as excellent statistical models for speech. Development and analysis of the adaptive algorithm is presented.

The teleoperator grasp performance was also compared with two reference conditions: bare hands and fingers in brackets.

Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that this holding pivot point is critical for the correct perception of the haptic properties assigned to the virtual objects. We also study the physical inertia effects of the end effector on the non-uniform stiffness perception of simulated virtual objects. To the best of our knowledge, no such combined consideration of holding pivot point and device structure related inertia has so far been made for works in 6-DOF haptic rendering. We have instrumented the end effector of a haptic interface with a membrane potentiometer to measure the user's primary holding pivot point in real-time. Accordingly, a preliminary adaptive feedback method is developed to render the appropriate forces/torques to compensate for the effects of the end effector's inertia on the haptic stiffness perception.	complex adaptive system;control point (mathematics);feedback;glitch;haptic technology;potentiometer;real-time clock;robot end effector;scott continuity;simulation;stiffness	Jilin Zhou;François Malric;Emil M.

a7e565713dc4dd3f95c151d3bef50c24d627d0ec	the co-gripper: a wireless cooperative gripper for safe human robot interaction		In this paper, we introduce a set of guidelines for the design of grippers suitable for a safe human robot/interaction in cooperative tasks. Modularity, adaptability, robustness, intuitive control, limited weight are some of the key elements that could allow to effectively spread these devices in industrial and service applications. Following such guidelines, we present the prototype of the Co-Gripper: a robotic device for cooperative manipulation tasks with humans. The gripper is composed of two pairs of fingers, actuated with two motors, that can be controlled in a coordinated way or independently. Each finger has a modular underactuated structure, composed of three phalanges connected by passive joints. The gripper is wireless, so it can be easily connected both to the robotic arms and on passive structures. We designed a wearable wireless control interface composed of a ring and a bracelet allowing a simple and intuitive activation of the gripper without limiting human operator's manipulation capabilities. We performed a set of tests to quantify gripper performance and to exploit its potentialities in human-robot cooperation tasks.

This phenomenon is called biodynamic feedthrough (BDFT). Signal cancellation is a possible way of mitigating biodynamic feedthrough. It makes use of a BDFT model to estimate the involuntary control inputs. The BDFT effects are removed by subtracting the modeled estimate of the involuntary control input from the total control signal, containing both voluntary and involuntary components. The success of signal cancellation hinges on the accuracy of the BDFT model used. In this study the potential of signal cancellation is studied by making use of a method called optimal signal cancellation. Here, an identified BDFT model is used off-line to generate an estimate of the involuntary control inputs based on the accelerations present. Results show that reliable signal cancellation requires BDFT models that are both subject and task dependent. The task dependency is of particular importance: failing to adapt the model to changes in the operator's neuromuscular dynamics dramatically decreases the quality of cancellation and can even lead to an increase in unwanted effects. As a reliable and fast on-line identification method of the neuromuscular dynamics of the human operator currently does not exist, real-time signal cancellation is currently not feasible.	clock feedthrough;failure;loss of significance;online and offline;real-time clock;regular language description for xml;runlevel;task manager;unix signal	Joost Venrooij;Mark Mulder;René van Paassen;David A.

The model is applied to a ball and socket joint system with soft cartilage. The functional role of the soft cartilage material is replaced by a nonlinear stiffness field, whose properties are defined with relation to the ball position with respect to any fixed reference point within the socket.

For many people with muscle weakness, assistive devices provide the means to regain mobility and independence. These devices range from well-established technology, such as wheelchairs, to newer technologies, such as exoskeletons and exosuits. For assistive devices to be used in everyday life, they must provide assistance across activities of daily living (ADLs) in an unobtrusive manner. This article introduces the Myosuit, a soft, wearable device designed to provide continuous assistance at the hip and knee joint when working with and against gravity in ADLs. This robotic device combines active and passive elements with a closed-loop force controller designed to behave like an external muscle (exomuscle) and deliver gravity compensation to the user. At 4.1 kg (4.6 kg with batteries), the Myosuit is one of the lightest untethered devices capable of delivering gravity support to the user's knee and hip joints. This article presents the design and control principles of the Myosuit. It describes the textile interface, tendon actuators, and a bi-articular, synergy-based approach for continuous assistance. The assistive controller, based on bi-articular force assistance, was tested with a single subject who performed sitting transfers, one of the most gravity-intensive ADLs. The results show that the control concept can successfully identify changes in the posture and assist hip and knee extension with up to 26% of the natural knee moment and up to 35% of the knee power. We conclude that the Myosuit's novel approach to assistance using a bi-articular architecture, in combination with the posture-based force controller, can effectively assist its users in gravity-intensive ADLs, such as sitting transfers.	ability to sit question;activities of daily living (activity);assistive technology;controllers;hereditary diseases;hip joint;knee joint;muscle weakness;poor posture;powered exoskeleton;robot;self-help devices;synergy;tendon structure;textiles;wearable technology;nervous system disorder;wheelchair	Kai Schmidt;Jaime E.

This paper proposes an approach to automating the determination of undercut regions and their releasing directions for complex parts in STL format. The end result of research will provide an impactful tool for manufacturing automation, and further enhance our advance mold design and manufacturing abilities. Specific research topics include: (1) automatic segregation of undercut regions and regular regions for each of the inner loops, (2) automatic selection of undercut regions for each of the inner loops, (3) automatic determination of releasing directions for each of the undercut regions, and (4) automatic grouping of undercut regions to produce sliders. Several real-life parts, such as cell phone component and car lamp component, are used as testing examples to implement the proposed approach and algorithms. While these example parts contain a large number of complicated free-form surfaces, the implementation results show that undercut regions and their releasing directions can be found within acceptable range of time.	algorithm;automation;inner loop;langton's loops;mobile phone;real life;stl (file format);xslt/muenchian grouping	Alan C.

The arm is unique in that it achieves reasonable performance for the envisioned tasks (backlash-free, sub-3mm repeatability, moves at 1.5m/s, 2kg payload) but with a significantly lower parts cost than comparable manipulators. The paper explores the design decisions and tradeoffs made in achieving this combination of price and performance. A new, human-safe design is also described: the arm uses stepper motors with a series-elastic transmission for the proximal four degrees of freedom (DOF), and non-series-elastic robotics servos for the distal three DOF. Tradeoffs of the design are discussed, especially in the areas of human safety and control bandwidth. The arm is used to demonstrate pancake cooking (pouring batter, flipping pancakes), using the intrinsic compliance of the arm to aid in interaction with objects.	interaction;repeatability;robot;robotic arm	Morgan Quigley;Alan T.

Experiments on synthetic and real music data in a source separation context show that such decomposition is suitable for audio signal.

d3abecbcbf1fcc0a6bb8bd289d3980fe9bf41f6b	a systematic approach for kinematic design of upper limb rehabilitation exoskeletons		Kinematic structure of an exoskeleton is the most fundamental block of its design and is determinant of many functional capabilities of it. Although numerous upper limb rehabilitation devices have been designed in the recent years, there is not a framework that can systematically guide the kinematic design procedure. Additionally, diversity of currently available devices and the many minute details incorporated to address certain design requirements hinders pinpointing the core kinematics of the available devices to compare them against each other. This makes the review of literature for identifying drawbacks of the state of the art systems a challenging and puzzling task. In fact, lack of a unifying framework makes designing rehabilitation devices an intuitive process and prone to biases from currently available designs. This research work proposes a systematic approach for kinematic design of upper limb rehabilitation exoskeletons based on conceptual design techniques. Having defined a solution neutral problem statement based on the characteristics of an ideal device, the main functionality of the system is divided into smaller functional units via the Functional Decomposition Method. Various directions for concept generation are explored and finally, it has been shown that a vast majority of the current exoskeleton designs fit within the proposed design framework and the defined functionalities. INTRODUCTION Currently, Physical Therapy (PT) and Occupational Therapy (OT) are the main two treatment options for rehabilitation of patients with movement disabilities [1]. On the other hand, robotic based therapy has proven to be an effective solution for the ever-increasing demands of rehabilitation since it can address several of the challenges facing effective rehabilitation of stroke patients [2, 3]. Robotic systems can make high intensity and customized exercises available to a large group of people, presumably at a lower cost [4]. Providing therapy to stroke patients is a labor-intensive task and this fact limits the amount of therapy that the patients can receive due to the fatigue of the therapists and the limited amount of time a therapist can spend with a patient. Considering that intensity and duration of the therapy is a determining factor for the success of rehabilitation, robotic systems can provide intensive high quality training experience to the patients while reducing the physical burden of the therapy on the therapists. One therapist can supervise many patients in the same amount of time and resultantly patients can have longer therapy sessions. Additionally, rehabilitation robots have been very promising in adding a new dimension to the type of therapies stroke patients can get. Design and utilization of games for providing therapeutic exercises and augmentation of virtual experiences such as virtual reality [5, 6] into rehabilitation devices are examples of new technologies which are aimed at improving the mental engagement of patients in therapy exercises. Due to the many benefits rehabilitation robots can offer, there have been a surge for using robots for rehabilitation purposes. Various robotic devices have been designed for rehabilitation of upper limb in the past 20 years [7]. Design of an effective rehabilitation device requires knowledge of human anatomy, rehabilitation techniques and without any doubt, profound robotics knowledge. Kinematics of the rehabilitation robots is one of the most important and challenging aspect of their design due to the complications in modeling biological joints. As a matter of fact, designing a structure that does not limit the human range of motion while avoiding kinematic incompatibilities and the resultant hyperstaticity is a major challenge [8]. Although many upper limb rehabilitation devices have been designed in the recent years, there is not a framework that can systematically guide the kinematic design procedure. Additionally, diversity of currently available devices [7] and the many minute details incorporated to address certain design requirements hinders pinpointing the core kinematics of devices. This makes the review of literature for identifying the drawbacks of the state of the art systems a challenging and puzzling task. In fact, lack of a unifying framework makes designing rehabilitation devices an intuitive process and prone to biases from currently available designs and hinders the thorough exploration of the space of feasible design concepts. Conceptual design techniques has long been used in the design of complicated industrial systems and commercial product development [9]. These approaches facilitate the generation of new ideas and foster inventiveness by providing a systematic methodology for design process [10]. This paper proposes a general framework for kinematic design of rehabilitation exoskeletons using conceptual design techniques. The focus of this research is on the design of exoskeletons since end effector based devices suffer from issues such as limited range of motion and uncontrolled torque transfer to the joints of patient arm and there is a consensus among rehabilitation researchers that exoskeletons surpass end effector based systems. By identifying the kinematic characteristics of an ideal exoskeleton, a solution neutral problem statement is proposed. Next, the main functionality of the system is divided into smaller functional units via the Functional Decomposition Method. Having smaller functional units that are meant to achieve a specific functionality facilitates the generation of ideas. Some guidelines are proposed for concept generation and example design concepts are generated. It has been shown that a vast majority of the current exoskeleton designs fit within the proposed design framework and the defined functionalities. In other words, we believe that solution neutral functional description of the exoskeleton’s kinematics provides a means for categorizing currently available designs and identifying their drawbacks. This paper is organized as follows: SYSTEMATIC DESIGN METHODLOGY Conceptual design techniques are widely used in the industry to address the multi-dimensional and multi-domain challenges of designing a new product based on the opportunities in the market, needs of the customers and the goals of the company [9]. Using a systematic design approach is advantageous due to several reasons, out of which the following are chosen due to brevity considerations. Within the systematic design frameworks, design task is seen as a process with certain steps which can effectively organize the efforts. Also, clarity of the overall process enables iterative improvement of the design within several generations of the product. Additionally, systematic design approaches enable thorough exploration of the space of feasible designs. Conceptual design techniques play an important role in achieving this by decoupling the functionalities of the system and decomposing it into smaller and more specific functionalities which can be studied independently for idea generation [11]. In fact, conceptual design is intended to provide an abstract explanation of how to achieve the desired functionality of the device. Functional modeling of the system via verb-noun pairs is the essential step for achieving such functional decomposition of the system [10]. KINEMATIC DESIGN FRAMEWORK As the first step of a systematic design procedure [10], the solution neutral problem statement (SNPS) is defined. By reviewing the expected functionalities and kinematic properties of an ideal rehabilitation exoskeleton in the literature, the following SNPS is proposed: “Design an exoskeleton that is kinematically compliant with human arm and does not constrain the natural motion of it”. From the perspective of the kinematics, exoskeleton can be defined as an open kinematic chain that is connected to human body though more than one physical human robot interface (pHRI). It is worth mentioning that while there can be closed kinematic chains, also known as mechanisms, embedded into the structure of an exoskeleton (e.g. ARMin [12, 13], NeuroExos [14]), such devices are still an open kinematic chain as a whole. It is also important to note that the above SNPS is tailored for the kinematic design of a rehabilitation exoskeleton and thus it is only reflecting desired kinematic characteristics. Within a broader scope, other functionalities of the rehabilitation device such as its ergonomics and training capabilities might also be included in the SNPS definition. Functional modeling of an exoskeleton is not possible by focusing on its kinematics only since the kinematic structure of an exoskeleton is a fundamental characteristic that is inseparable from the functionality of the device. Following the convention of Pahl and Beitz [9], the following functional model is proposed for the rehabilitation exoskeleton: Figure 1. Functional Model of the Rehabilitation Device The control block in the functional model of the system is responsible for actuating the device and controlling the behavior of the device respectively. “Interact with Arm” is a functional block modeling the physical interaction of the exoskeleton with human arm. Figure 2 shows the “Functional Decomposition” of this block to clarify the sub functionalities need for achieving it: Figure 2. Functional Decomposition of the Interact with Arm Block The interaction of the exoskeleton with the patient arm can be studied in two levels: the therapeutic and the kinematic interaction. Rehabilitation exoskeletons can be functioning in assistive (partial or full) or resistive modes depending on the higher-level training command. These sub-functions are directly related to how the device is actuated and how the force required to achieve the therapeutic goals is created. On the other hand, kinematic compatibility of the device is directly related to how the device can conform to human arm and thus can be analyzed	categorization;coupling (computer programming);display resolution;embedded system;experience;function model;human factors and ergonomics;human–computer interaction;iterative method;kinematic chain;new product development;rehabilitation robotics;requirement;resultant;robot end effector;separable polynomial;uncontrolled format string;video game rehabilitation;virtual reality	Rana Soltani-Zarrin;Amin Zeiaee;Reza Langari;Richard Malak	2017	CoRR		engineering;control engineering;conceptual design;rehabilitation;kinematics;functional decomposition;problem statement	EDA	71.46280290188272	-27.06658352002138	93781
16a5e131c40d1c16614736b8d2f68cf9ee1a2595	nonstationary noise psd matrix estimation for multichannel blind speech extraction		Noise power spectral density PSD matrix estimation is one of the most important components of a multichannel blind speech extraction framework, as it largely determines the amount of residual noise at the output of a spatial filter. Optimality of well-known spatial filters, such as the multichannel Wiener filter, is only ensured if the PSD matrices of the noise and the desired speech are accurately estimated. In practical situations, where the noise is nonstationary, temporal averaging over time frames where the desired signal is inactive does not provide sufficiently fast tracking of the noise PSD matrix, resulting in high residual noise at the spatial filter output. Therefore, approaches that estimate the PSD matrices using narrowband signal detection have been proposed. Following the well-known single- and multichannel minima-controlled recursive averaging MCRA approaches, in this paper, we focus on narrowband speech presence probability-based noise PSD matrix estimators, which are suitable for blind scenarios where the location and the propagation vector of the desired speech source are unknown. The main contributions of the paper are a maximum likelihood interpretation of the multichannel MCRA, and a coherent-to-diffuse ratio-based a priori speech absence probability SAP estimator. The latter is a key parameter that determines the accuracy of the noise PSD matrix estimates in nonstationary scenarios. In this paper, we confirm the importance of the a priori SAP and show that its control is crucial for source extraction in nonstationary environments.	coherence (physics);detection theory;maxima and minima;noise power;recursion;software propagation;spatial reference system;spectral density;whole earth 'lectronic link;wiener filter	Maja Taseska;Emanuel A.

This system is controlled using a rate control strategy, so that the operator may manage to perform very slow injections with accuracy and safety.

In opposition to the short time Fourier transform (STFT)-based time–frequency signal representation, wavelet packet decomposition can lead to better representation of non-stationary parts of the speech signal (e.g. consonants). The vowels are well described with an AR model as in LPC analysis. The proposed Root-Log compression scheme is used to perform the computation of the wavelet packet parameters. The separately extracted WPD and AR-based parameters are combined together and then transformed with the usage of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to finally produce a lower dimensional output feature vector. The noise robustness is improved with the application of proposed wavelet-based denoising algorithm with a modified soft thresholding procedure and time–frequency adaptive threshold. The proposed voice activity detector based on a skewness-to-kurtosis ratio of the LPC residual signal is used to effectively perform a frame-dropping principle. The speech recognition results achieved on Aurora 2 and Aurora 3 databases show overall performance improvement of 44.7% and 48.2% relative to the baseline MFCC front-end, respectively. r 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a markerless human-robot interface that incorporates Kalman filters (KFs) and particle filters (PFs) to track the posture of human hands. This method allows one operator to control dual robot manipulators by using his/her double hands without any contact devices or markers. The algorithm employs Leap Motion to determine the orientation and the position of the human hands. Although the position and the orientation of the hands can be obtained from the sensor, the measurement errors increase over time due to the noise of the devices and the tracking error. The PFs and KFs are used to estimate the position and the orientation of the human hand. Due to the limitations of the perception and the motor, a human operator cannot accomplish high-precision manipulation without any assistance. An adaptive multispace transformation is employed to assist the operator to improve the accuracy and reliability in determining the posture of the manipulator. The greatest advantage of this method is that the posture of the human hands can be estimated accurately and steadily without any assistant markers. The human-manipulator interface system was experimentally verified in a laboratory, and the results indicate that such an interface can successfully control dual robot manipulators even if the operator is not an expert.	algorithm;experiment;human–computer interaction;kalman filter;particle filter;poor posture;robot	Guanglong Du;Ping Zhang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2014.2362095	control engineering;computer vision;estimation;simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;mathematics;robot control;tracking;robot kinematics;statistics;quaternion	Robotics	69.63136851336371	-27.141851400693625	95540

Numerous studies have been conducted on the driving mechanism, motion planning and trajectory tracking methods of spherical robots, yet very limited studies have been conducted regarding the obstacle avoidance capability of spherical robots. Most of the existing spherical robots rely on the """"hit and run"""" technique, which has been argued to be a reasonable strategy because spherical robots have an inherent ability to recover from collisions. Without protruding components, they will not become stuck and can simply roll back after running into bstacles. However, for small scale spherical robots that contain sensitive surveillance sensors and cannot afford to utilize heavy protective shells, the absence of obstacle avoidance solutions would leave the robot at the mercy of potentially dangerous obstacles. In this paper, a compact magnetic field-based obstacle detection and avoidance system has been developed for miniature spherical robots. It utilizes a passive magnetic field so that the system is both compact and power efficient. The proposed system can detect not only the presence, but also the approaching direction of a ferromagnetic obstacle, therefore, an intelligent avoidance behavior can be generated by adapting the trajectory tracking method with the detection information. Design optimization is conducted to enhance the obstacle detection performance and detailed avoidance strategies are devised.

The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was used to detect signal in the underwater. In underwater and a multipaths environment where numbers signal components arrive with arbitrary delays, we use the RDWT in detection. We adopt the RDWT instead of using DWT for two reasons. The first one is that the spectrum of the shifted signal is the same as the unshifted version when using the RDWT. The second one is that while the RDWT provides a solution to the translation invariance problem, it maintains the DWT's attractive attributes, such as efficiency and suited for transients. Since each subband should preserves its energy when using the RDWT in a multipaths environment, summary features of its robust wavelet decomposition are the same as the unshifted version. By an adaptive model of the background interference, using recursive density estimation of the joint distribution of certain summary features of its robust wavelet decomposition, we may detect the transient in a multipaths and a background underwater sound environment.	discrete wavelet transform;interference (communication);recursion;signal processing	Shun-Hsyung Chang;Fu-Tai Wang	2000	2000 10th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;second-generation wavelet transform;engineering;wavelet packet decomposition;stationary wavelet transform	ML	81.4266117117668	-36.626564191856865	95833

The time-varying trajectories of the DFT of speech and noise in each channel are modelled by low order autoregressive processes incorporated in the state equation of Kalman filters. The parameters of the Kalman filters are estimated recursively from the signal and noise in DFT channels. The issue of convergence of the Kalman filters to noise statistics during the noise-dominated periods is addressed and a method is incorporated for restarting of Kalman filters after long periods of noise-dominated activity in each DFT channel. The performance of the proposed method is compared with cases where the noise trajectories are not explicitly modelled. The sensitivity of the method to voice activity detector is evaluated. Evaluations show that the proposed method results in substantial improvement in perceived quality of speech.	autoregressive model;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;kalman filter;recursion;speech enhancement	Esfandiar Zavarehei;Saeed Vaseghi;Qin Yan	2006	2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;computer science	Robotics	81.91455690648786	-34.331653720938036	95889

This paper presents an active release technique that for the first time, achieves 100% repeatability and a release accuracy of 0.70±0.46µm, experimentally quantified through the manipulation of 10µm glass spheres under an optical microscope. Using a new MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) microgripper, this technique employs a controllable plunging mechanism for the micro object to gain sufficient momentum to overcome adhesion forces. Experimental results also confirmed that this technique is not substrate dependent. Theoretical analyses were conducted to understand the release principle. Based on this preliminary study, the technique may also prove to be an effective solution to active release of sub-micron objects in robotic pick-place.	experiment;image scaling;microelectromechanical systems;repeatability;robot	Brandon K.

Unfortunately, finding information on a particular topic can be difficult. Not only does path generation span several disciplines, but the material tends to vary both in content and focus. In this paper, the literature is partitioned into categories and papers related to path generation classified according to the topics they cover. This should be useful to those looking for references on specific topics as well as those seeking an introduction to the literature as a whole.

These new robotic applications can strongly benefit from compliant actuator technology. Instead of introducing compliance on the control level, this approach is based on the use of inherent adaptable compliance on a purely mechanical level. In this way intrinsic compliance is assured at all time, enhancing system safety. The added mechanical complexity is easily countered with the range of potential benefits, adding value to existing applications and also creating new applications in robotics. The use of adaptable compliant actuators in applications as prosthetics, rehabilitation and assistive robotics is discussed in view of control, efficiency and safety.	robot;robotics;system safety	Karen Junius;Pierre Cherelle;Branko Brackx;Joost Geeroms;Tim Schepers;Bram Vanderborght;Dirk Lefeber	2013	9th International Workshop on Robot Motion and Control	10.1109/RoMoCo.2013.6614575	control engineering;simulation;engineering;biological engineering	Robotics	71.53847426976748	-25.02520769336504	96180

The Hierarchical CoSaMP is inspired by the CoSaMP algorithm, and it is based on a suitable hierarchical extension of the support over which the compressively sampled signal is reconstructed. We analytically demonstrate the convergence of the Hierarchical CoSaMP and show by numerical simulations that the Hierarchical CoSaMP outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy for a given number of measurements at a restrained computational complexity.

As a result of our research, last year we have introduced the Wa̲seda S̲axophonist Robot No. 1̲ (WAS-1), composed of 15-DOFs that reproduced the lips (1-DOF), tonguing (1-DOF), oral cavity, lungs (2-DOF) and fingers (11-DOFs). However, even that the mouth mechanism of WAS-1 was useful in order to adjust the pitch of the saxophone sound, the range of sound pressure was too narrow. Thus, no dynamic effects of the sound can be reproduced (i.e. crescendo and decrescendo). Moreover, the finger mechanism was designed only to play from C3–C#5. On the other hand, a cascade feedback control system has been implemented in the WAS-1; however, a considerable delay in the attack time to reach the desired air pressure was detected. Therefore, in this paper, the Wa̲seda S̲axophone Robot No. 2̲ (WAS-2) which is composed by 22-DOFs is detailed. The lip mechanism of WAS-2 has been designed with 3-DOFs to control the motion of the lower, upper and sideway lips. In addition, a human-like hand (16 DOF-s) has been designed to enable to play all the keys of the instrument. Regarding the improvement of the control system, a feed-forward control system with dead-time compensation has been implemented to assure the accurate control of the air pressure. A set of experiments were carried out to verify the mechanical design improvements and the dynamic response of the air pressure. As a result, the range of sound pressure has been increased and the proposed control system improved the dynamic response of the air pressure control.	control system;embedded system;experiment;feed forward (control);feedback;human–robot interaction;robot;sensor	Jorge Solis;Klaus Petersen;Tetsuro Yamamoto;Masaki Takeuchi;Shimpei Ishikawa;Atsuo Takanishi;Kunimatsu Hashimoto	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509815	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control system;control theory;feed forward	Robotics	69.42150336433117	-25.938963903907908	96269
e68eff4c1b2d2670bc3876885c1ef26bfba1c111	one-degree-of-freedom spherical model for the passive motion of the human ankle joint	ankle joint modelling;passive motion;one degree of freedom spherical motion;pivot point;equivalent mechanisms	Mathematical modelling of mobility at the human ankle joint is essential for prosthetics and orthotic design. The scope of this study is to show that the ankle joint passive motion can be represented by a one-degree-of-freedom spherical motion. Moreover, this motion is modelled by a one-degree-of-freedom spherical parallel mechanism model, and the optimal pivot-point position is determined. Passive motion and anatomical data were taken from in vitro experiments in nine lower limb specimens. For each of these, a spherical mechanism, including the tibiofibular and talocalcaneal segments connected by a spherical pair and by the calcaneofibular and tibiocalcaneal ligament links, was defined from the corresponding experimental kinematics and geometry. An iterative procedure was used to optimize the geometry of the model, able to predict original experimental motion. The results of the simulations showed a good replication of the original natural motion, despite the numerous model assumptions and simplifications, with mean differences between experiments and predictions smaller than 1.3 mm (average 0.33 mm) for the three joint position components and smaller than 0.7° (average 0.32°) for the two out-of-sagittal plane rotations, once plotted versus the full flexion arc. The relevant pivot-point position after model optimization was found within the tibial mortise, but not exactly in a central location. The present combined experimental and modelling analysis of passive motion at the human ankle joint shows that a one degree-of-freedom spherical mechanism predicts well what is observed in real joints, although its computational complexity is comparable to the standard hinge joint model.	ankle joint structure;articular system;bone structure of tibia;computational complexity theory;experiment;hinge device component;in vitro [publication type];iterative method;ligaments;lower extremity;mathematical optimization;orthotic medical specialty;passive-aggressive personality disorder;pivot;simulation;small;specimen;spherical model	Nicola Sancisi;Benedetta Baldisserri;Vincenzo Parenti-Castelli;Claudio Belvedere;Alberto Leardini	2014	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-014-1137-y	simulation;engineering;geometry;engineering drawing	Vision	69.92107239822062	-28.547424617700308	96657

We have developed a kinematically redundant manipulator that uses high fidelity force control for safe interaction with human patients. The manipulator is outfitted with a dual imaging and sonication end-effector for hemorrhage detection and treatment. Unlike most available force controlled manipulators, the design presented in this paper has all the actuation embedded inside its body eliminating the need for a base which greatly improves portability. We review the main design features, advantages, and trade-offs of this approach and present experimental data of hemorrhage detection and controlled sonication of biological tissue samples.	care-of address;embedded system;robot end effector;software portability	Pablo Valdivia y Alvarado;Chu-Yin Chang;Kullervo Hynynen	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354215	medical imaging;control engineering;computer vision;robot end effector;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence	Robotics	73.97230970324159	-29.119267055128923	96711

In this research, we distinguish the basic differences between the serial-link mechanism and the parallel one for grasping operation and discuss the grasping control method based on the information of tactile sensors. This method consists of the parallel feedback control not using the visual information but using the information of contact force.

Moreover, a wearable device was designed and fabricated, which was actuated by TSA. Joints were actuated by two antagonistic actuators. To simulate the motion of the elbow of the robot and validate the performance of the controller, a control test bed was designed which could capture the angle of the joint as well as the conflicting error due to antagonistic actuation. A master-slave architecture was adopted to control the joint, while an activity of daily living (ADL), adopted from previous work, was set as the desired trajectory.

However, they are typically only in the form of visual or analytical data from a motion analyzer. Users are unable to feel these types of analysis directly on their bodies. In some fields, such as sports and rehabilitation, it is more efficient to feel a motion than to see the image or numerical data in order to acquire skills. Therefore we propose a device to teach users a desired motion directly using force produced by a Control Moment Gyroscope (CMG). In particular, we focus on a swing motion in golf, baseball, or tennis. This paper introduces the developed CMG prototype and its validation in the control of pendulum movement.	gyroscope;image;level of measurement;prototype	Takahiro Mori;Guillermo Enriquez;Huei Ee Yap;Shuji Hashimoto	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2015.7418842	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	70.36578261992697	-29.37839788856619	97471

The sagittal hip, knee, and ankle degrees-of-freedom are actuated using a set of eight Hill-type musculotendon models in each leg, with biologically-motivated control laws. The parameters of these control laws are set by an optimization procedure that satisfies a number of locomotion task terms while minimizing a biological model of metabolic energy expenditure. We show that the use of biologically-based actuators and objectives measurably increases the realism of gaits generated by locomotion controllers that operate without the use of motion capture data, and that metabolic energy expenditure provides a simple and unifying measurement of effort that can be used for both walking and running control optimization.	controllers;energy metabolism;hip structure;mathematical optimization;metabolic process, cellular;motion capture;optimal control;optimizing compiler;personality character;waist–hip ratio	Jack M.

However, the forces produced by our muscles depend unpredictably on the commands sent to them. This uncertainty has two sources: irreducible noise in the motor system's processes (i.e., motor noise) and variability in the relationship between muscle commands and muscle outputs (i.e., model uncertainty). Any controller, neural or artificial, benefits from estimating these uncertainties when choosing commands. Methods: To examine these benefits, we used an experimental preparation of the rat hindlimb to electrically stimulate muscles and measure the resulting isometric forces. We compare a functional electric stimulation (FES) controller that represents and compensates for uncertainty in muscle forces with a standard FES controller that neglects uncertainty. Results: Accounting for uncertainty substantially increased the precision of force control. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the theoretical and practical benefits of representing muscle uncertainty when computing muscle commands. Significance: The findings are relevant beyond FES as they highlight the benefits of estimating statistical properties of muscles for both artificial controllers and the nervous system.	cdisc adas-cog - commands summary score;cns disorder;computation (action);controllers;electric stimulation technique;electricity;estimated;functional electrical stimulation;heart rate variability;irreducibility;isometric projection;limb structure;lower extremity;movement;muscle;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;shin megami tensei: persona 3;benefit	Max Berniker;Anthony M.

This paper describes the design and development of a 4 DOF force-reflective master robot (RoboMaster1) for haptic telesurgery applications. A two-double parallelogram robot is introduced including a novel mechanism at the base for producing and control of the end effector's linear motion. This eliminates the deficiencies caused due to suspending massive actuators at the end effector or cabling from the base. The kinematics and work space of the system were analyzed and a prototype was developed for primary practical evaluations. The results showed that the system can effectively simulate the surgeon's hand maneuvers inside the abdominal cavity with a Remote Center of Motion (RCM) located at the backside.

This method contains frequency-domain ICA (FDICA-PB), single-talk detection, direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, head related transfer function (HRTF) matrix bank, and SIMO-ICA. This paper describes robustness of SIMO-ICA-SG against the mismatch of HRTF matrix bank. To evaluate it, the sound decomposition experiments are carried out under the real acoustic conditions. The experimental results reveal that the decomposition performance of the proposed method with mismatched HRTF matrix bank is superior to those of the conventional methods, and almost the same as those of the proposed method with matched one	acoustic cryptanalysis;binaural beats;blind signal separation;direction of arrival;experiment;head-related transfer function;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;suicidegirls	Tomoya Takatani;Satoshi Ukai;Tsuyoki Nishikawa;Hiroshi Saruwatari;Kiyohiro Shikano	2005	IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics, 2005.	10.1093/ietfec/e88-a.7.1673	independent component analysis;speech recognition;binaural recording;computer science;machine learning;blind signal separation	Vision	82.78731176614485	-35.563910167400586	99818

This paper presents and analyzes computational methods for geometrically determining and managing these interferences for any trajectory constrained with variable loads. The algorithms considered determine which cable can be released from an active actuation state while allowing control in a minimal tension state, thereby ensuring that both platforms stay in a controllable workspace. The process of managing cable interferences constitutes a challenge as one must take into account the inherent limitations of the workspace, which not only include the possibility of interference itself, but also the geometry of the cable-driven locomotion interface (CDLI), its dynamics, the nonideal behavior of real cables, and the requirement that both platforms must be completely constrained at any time. As releasing a cable from an active actuation state might generate tension discontinuities in the other cables, this paper also proposes collision prediction schemes that are only applied to redundant actuators in order to reduce or completely eliminate such discontinuities. Finally, a simulation of a CDLI embedded as a peripheral in a virtual environment, in which the load applied on each platform comes from the wrench measured under the foot for a natural gait walking, is thoroughly analyzed.	algorithm;cuneiform digital library initiative;embedded system;interference (communication);peripheral;robot;simulation;virtual reality;workspace	Martin J.-D.

This paper describes the construction of a suitable triangulated mesh of a reverse engineered car from which body surface reconstruction can take place. RS and CS are used independently to create two distinct models which are then compared with a suggested hybrid CAD model that takes advantages of both techniques. Results show that the hybrid method reaches a balance between the two methods: it enables the construction of a suitable model with quality surfaces in a satisfactory time.

52bd69605b266506cc6e260c3c8dc99bdee8a2f1	a master-slave control system with workspaces isomerism for teleoperation of a snake robot		Snake robots can be used to assist experts during surgical operations on internal organs via natural orifices. However, real-time control of such robot in Mater Slave (MS) teleoperation is a major challenge. Inverse kinematics solution of snake robots has being a key challenge towards real time control especially if the robot is hyper-redundant. This paper proposes a method that can achieve fast and precise inverse kinematics solution for real time control MS teleoperation. Monte Carlo method is applied to determine possible positions needed to reach a given target point, while best position is chosen based on the optimization algorithm. For workspace isomerism, the proposed method automatically determines appropriate kinematics mapping for the robots. Experimental results show that the method can achieve accurate position tracking in MS teleoperation.	algorithm;anatomical orifice;control system;dura mater;experiment;forward kinematics;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;hyperactive behavior;inverse kinematics;isomerism;master/slave (technology);mathematical optimization;microsoft windows;monte carlo method;organ;real-time transcription;robot (device);singular;workspace	Lingxue Ren;Olatunji Mumini Omisore;Shipeng Han;Lei Wang	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037817	master/slave;inverse kinematics;teleoperation;monte carlo method;robot control;real-time control system;computer science;kinematics;control engineering;control theory;control system	Robotics	70.91459667830202	-28.137227886190676	100513

Home Oxygen Therapy (H.O.T.) is a medical treatment for severe lung diseases in which the patients are supplied concentrated oxygen through a cannula. The need to carry a portable oxygen supply device limits the quality of life of the patients, and so we have designed a robot follower using Hyper-Tether. The robot, which can carry an oxygen tank and follow behind the patient, was tested by H.O.T. users and evaluated using questionnaires.

Stepping over the hurdle is a specific exercise practised throughout the year. In this exercise, three key points were analysed in take-off, flight and landing phases. The aim of the study was to use the IMU-based (inertial measurement unit) motion capture system to evaluate the movement of the hurdlers’ upper limbs while stepping over the hurdle using both the better leg, and the worse leg. The sequences were obtained using 18 sensors working at a frequency of 120 Hz. The analysis was made using two high-achieving athletes. This paper presents the linear velocities and the trajectory of selected segments of the upper limbs. In most cases the velocities of the segments were higher for the better leg. The analysis shows that during the specific exercise of stepping over the hurdle attention should be paid to the movement of the trail arm in the landing phase.	motion capture;sensor;stepping level	Janusz Iskra;Krzysztof Przednowek;Tomasz Krzeszowski;Krzysztof Wiktorowicz;Michal Pietrzak	2017		10.5220/0006503101020106	computer vision;simulation;inertial measurement unit;motion capture;artificial intelligence;kinematics;computer science	HCI	70.50076145819243	-29.74241534720857	101155

It is inexpensive and small but emulates features of large and very expensive systems currently used in monkey and human research. Our device consists of a small programmable torque-motor system that is attached to a manipulandum. Rats are trained to grasp this manipulandum and move it to one or more targets against programmed force field perturbations. Here we report several paradigms that may be used with this device and results from rat's making reaching movements in a variety of force fields. These and other available experimental manipulations allow one to experimentally separate several key variables that are critical for understanding and ultimately emulating the feedforward and feedback mechanisms of motor control.	brain neoplasms;brain–computer interface;emulator;experiment;feedforward neural network;force field (chemistry);movement;perturbation theory	Joseph T.

The robot's special configuration will enable it to reorient a surgical tool about a pivot point conveniently; achieve and control small-scale movement for precision manipulation in two independent degrees of freedom, and allow for miniaturization so it can overcome problems associated with the limited surgical workspaces. The manipulator can be used in manual, autonomous or remote-control modes. Performance analysis showed that the robot can operate with an average angular accuracy of 1.4 and 1.1 degrees for the joints. The features of the proposed mechanism make it well suited for use in a broad range of medical interventions.	angularjs;autonomous robot;remote control;workspace	Basem Fayez Yousef;Farah M. T.

To perform medical tasks well in the deep of a human body, it is required that a needle is easier and more accurate to be controlled and steered. In this paper, the thrusting performances of a one-direction bendable needle are investigated in detail. Such a needle consists of a bevel-tip head, several articulations, and several sections. Articulations are designed that they can only be bent in the direction that is opposite to the bevel-tip, and they are more flexible than the other parts of the needle. The maximum bending angles of articulations are fixed. By changing the lengths of head and sections, and the maximum bending angles of articulations, the possible needle thrusting routes are analyzed. Also, the thrusting forces and moments are calculated based on the structure of the needle. The study results demonstrate that it is easier and more accurate to control and steer a one-direction bendable compared with previous needles. The developments of articulated needle provide the opportunities to design different articulated needle to suit different clinical cases.	performance;rollable display;tip (unix utility)	Yizhong Wang;Qi Zhao;Ke Sun;Yonghua Chen;Huafang Huang;Da Li	2011	2011 4th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics (BMEI)	10.1109/BMEI.2011.6098413	planning;robot;human body;systems modeling;steering;head;management;force;surgery	Robotics	74.79317040976719	-28.995421244419454	102748

The proposed model decomposes each sparse signal into two sparse components. The first component has a common support across all sensed signals. The second component is an innovation part that is specific to each sensor and might have a support that is different from the support of the other innovation signals. We use the fact that the common component generates a common subspace that can be found using the principal component analysis and the minimum description length. We show that with this general model, we can reconstruct the signal with smaller samples that are needed by the direct application of the compressive sensing on each sensor.	algorithm;compressed sensing;mdl (programming language);minimum description length;principal component analysis;sampling (signal processing);sensor;simulation;sparse matrix	Alireza Makhzani;Shahrokh Valaee	2011	2011 4th IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)	10.1109/CAMSAP.2011.6136001	sparse pca;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	74.71704413327747	-36.540566763041966	102756

To provide appropriate power assistance for the sit-to-stand movement, a novel intention-based Active Impedance Control (AIC) strategy applied on a lower limb exoskeleton is proposed in this paper. The AIC is able to adapt the mechanical impedance of the human-exoskeleton system towards a desired one using the exoskeleton's power assistance. In the AIC structure, a human joint torque observer is designed to estimate the human joint torques using joint angles information instead of electromyography (EMG) or force/torque sensors; a time-varying desired impedance model is proposed according the wearer's lower limb motion ability. Simulations were implemented to illustrate the characteristics and performances of the proposed approach. Experiments with a healthy subject were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experiments show satisfactory results in terms of appropriate power assist based on the wearer's motion intention.	characteristic impedance;computer simulation;control flow;control theory;electromyography;experiment;human–computer interaction;nominal impedance;performance;sensor;times ascent	Weiguang Huo;Kyoungchul Kong	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487534	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	70.32520136214114	-26.820484698155077	102790

It will enable high-throughput manufacturing of novel products and open up new application fields. Current research work includes, amongst others, the development of new nanohandling robots; the investigation of novel automated nanohandling strategies; the development of advanced control methods, and the investigation of suitable real-time sensing technologies on the nanoscale.

In certain parts of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the stomach, the capsule should be self-propelled. This study examines the swimming mechanism for a miniature gastric pill endoscope. Our method is based on a constant external magnetic field, such as the B0 field of an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), that drives a pair of coils in order to create an undulating swimming motion. We present a dynamic model of the two coil swimmer and compare it to the results obtained using PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry). We demonstrate that our swimmer is able to create an average propulsive force of 0.03 mN and 0.07 mN for the flow regimes tested, which is in a reasonable agreement with the results of the proposed dynamic model.	airport time capsule;kill pill;mathematical model;resonance;self-propelled particles;tract (literature)	Avi Friedman;Alexander Liberzon;Gábor Kósa	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139857	dynamics;magnetic field;engineering;magnetic resonance imaging;mathematical model;nuclear magnetic resonance;force;quantum mechanics	Robotics	78.99418393052268	-24.593544139908577	102885
27a040d097fb2f82b974059da56b6e31f94a4bab	a spectral-temporal method for pitch tracking	pitch tracking	In this paper, a new spectral/temporal method is described for robust pitch tracking for both high quality and telephone speech. A previous version of this algorithm was presented as YAAPT (Kasi and Zahorian, 2002) [10]. In the current paper, a novel method is presented for spectral pitch tracking, using nonlinear processing to partially restore the potentially missing fundamental frequency. A frequency domain modified autocorrelation is used to determine the spacing between harmonic peaks in the spectrum. The frequency domain spectral track is then used to refine time-domain pitch candidates obtained using the “NCCF or Normalized Cross Correlation” reported by Talkin [1].

To automate such tasks, the assembly system must be responsive to contact forces. Issues in addressing forceresponsive automated assembly include contact stability, the degree of force responsiveness required for success, the speed of a successful implementation, and the means to program a force-responsive system to perform a given assembly task. We examine these issues for robotic assembly in the context of automotive transmission components. We report on an impedance-based low-level algorithm and its interface to higher-level strategies that exhibits gentle, fast and reliable assembly of our example components.	algorithm;characteristic impedance;gentle;high- and low-level;position-independent code;responsiveness;robot	Wyatt S.

In order to achieve this, we investigated the causal relationship between ground contact information from the feet and leg muscle activity n human walking and calculated filter functions which transform sensory signals to motor actions. A minimal, nonlinear, and robust control system was created and subsequently analysed by applying it to our bipedal robot RunBot III without any central pattern generators or precise trajectory control. The results demonstrate that our controller can generate stable robotic walking. This indicates that complex locomotion patterns can result from a simple model based on reflexes and supports the premise that human-derived control strategies have potential applications in robotics or assistive devices.	assistive technology;black box;causality;central pattern generators;control system;controllers;foot;intrauterine devices;nonlinear system;reflex action;robot;robust control	Lin Meng;Catherine A.

648c7c909d837c0d1b1935fae4d754680781d491	formal analysis of robotic cell injection systems using theorem proving		Cell injection is an approach used for the delivery of small sample substances into a biological cell and is widely used in drug development, gene injection, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and in-virto fertilization (IVF). Robotic cell injection systems provide the automation of the process as opposed to the manual and semi-automated cell injection systems, which require expert operators and involve time consuming processes and also have lower success rates. The automation of the cell injection process is achieved by controlling the injection force and planning the motion of the injection pipette. Traditionally, these systems are analyzed using paper-and-pencil proof and computer simulation methods. However, the former is human-error prone and the later is based on the numerical algorithms, where the approximation of the mathematical expressions introduces inaccuracies in the analysis. Formal methods can overcome these limitations and thus provide an accurate analysis of the cell injection systems. Model checking, i.e., a state-based formal method, has been recently proposed for the analysis of these systems. However, it involves the discretization of the differential equations that are used for modeling the dynamics of the system and thus compromises on the completeness of the analysis of these safety-critical systems. In this paper, we propose to use higher-order-logic theorem proving, a deductive-reasoning based formal method, for the modeling and analysis of the dynamical behaviour of the robotic cell injection systems. The proposed analysis, based on the HOL Light theorem prover, enabled us to identify some discrepancies in the simulation and model checking based analysis of the same robotic cell injection system.	algorithm;approximation;automated theorem proving;cell (microprocessor);characteristic impedance;cognitive dimensions of notations;computer simulation;discretization;formal methods;formal verification;hol (proof assistant);hol light;model checking;numerical analysis;robot;semiconductor industry	Adnan Rashid;Osman Hasan	2018	CoRR		algorithm;automation;completeness (statistics);model checking;mathematics;control engineering;formal methods;automated theorem proving;hol;higher-order logic;discretization	Robotics	76.69231596690975	-29.629785847671194	103607

Using a composite laminate batch fabrication process with biocompatible constituent materials, we have fabricated a fully-integrated, 10×10 mm three-axis force sensor with up to 5 V/N sensitivity and RMS noise on the order of ~1.6 mN, operational over a range of -500 to 500 mN in the x- and y-axes, and -2.5 to 2.5 N in the z-axis. Custom foil-based strain sensors were fabricated in parallel with the mechanical structure, obviating the need for post-manufacturing alignment and assembly. The sensor and its custom-fabricated signal conditioning circuitry fit within a 1×1×2 cm volume to realize a fully-integrated force transduction platform with potential haptics and control applications in minimally-invasive surgical tools. The form factor, biocompatibility, and cost of the sensor and signal conditioning makes this method ideal for rapid-prototyping low-cost, mm-scale distal force sensors. Sensor performance is validated in a simulated tissue palpation task using a robotic master-slave platform.	apache axis;downscaling;electronic circuit;experiment;haptic technology;mathematical optimization;microelectromechanical systems;nominal type system;numerical analysis;optic axis of a crystal;printed circuit board;printing;rapid prototyping;refresh rate;robot;semiconductor device fabrication;sensor;transduction (machine learning)	Joshua B.

Their operation is subject to the accuracy of the underlying noise reduction algorithm, that aims to reduce noise present in the signals that are captured by the employed microphones. Under adverse conditions a noise reduction scheme, failing to perform adequately, will produce results characterised by speech distortions (metallic or clipping voice) and/or fluctuating residual background noises, the result of inaccuracy in estimating the noise spectrum, known as musical noise. In this paper, performance enhancement when employing a statistical model based Voice Activity Detector (VAD) in combination with noise reduction, is presented in terms of residual noise suppression within silence intervals and short pauses during speech production. To this end, an efficient noise reduction architecture has been developed relying on cascading a previously presented presented denoising scheme. This way, we initially subtract primary noise and then consequently use the same technique, with specific parameter adjustments, to remove spectral subtraction artefacts such as musical noise or noise leftovers that were generated by the first stage. Simulations under various noise types and intensities indicate significant performance enhancement when employing the proposed system.	algorithm;colors of noise;computer simulation;distortion;failure;microphone;noise reduction;quantum decoherence;spectral density;speech processing;statistical model;voice activity detection;zero suppression	Theodore Petsatodis;Christos Boukis;Fotios Talantzis;Lazaros Polymenakos	2013	2013 18th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)	10.1109/ICDSP.2013.6622696	gradient noise;gaussian noise;median filter;image noise;electronic engineering;speech recognition;colors of noise;acoustics;value noise;engineering;noise measurement;noise;noise;background noise;noise figure;noise floor;noise;salt-and-pepper noise	HPC	82.24181344620916	-33.90199667464678	103954

This paper presents an alternative criteria for the well known steered response power with phase transform (SRP-PHAT) algorithm, in which the steered response relates to peaks in the fourth order cross cumulant, rather than peaks in the second order cross cumulant, i.e. the cross power spectrum. Since speech sources have a probability density function (PDF) close to the Laplacian distribution and noise are generally closer to the Gaussian distribution, the fourth order cumulant becomes a good alternative for the steered response search for speech sources. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to the original SRP-PHAT algorithm and shows significant improvements in localization performance for speech sources.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;direction of arrival;estimation theory;mobile phone;portable document format;spectral density;test case;whole earth 'lectronic link	Mikael Swarding;Benny Sällberg;Nedelko Grbic	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2008.4541763	normal distribution;speaker recognition;probability density function;order statistic;speech recognition;signal processing;pattern recognition;laplace distribution;mathematics;computational complexity theory;spectral density;second-order logic;laplace transform;statistics;cumulant	Embedded	82.39626963726249	-34.385230476370396	104239
fe8ce0adfdd8b00ea9b9b37201f7a79abcc5f1f2	design of a haptic master device for teleoperation applications		A haptic device with both force and torque outputs is essential in teleoperation applications. However, researchers do not have sufficient access to such a haptic device due to the facts that the commercially available ones are usually expensive and the state-of-the-art research prototypes are not readily reproducible outside the original laboratories. This paper presents the design and preliminary experimentation of the CombOmni, a haptic device with both force and torque outputs. The CombOmni is constructed from two Sensible Omni haptic devices for teleoperation tasks. The Omni device only provides force outputs and its original structure doesn't allow effective connection between two such units. With minimal modifications and a carefully designed stylus, the CombOmni could be easily built. Kinematics-based design optimizations and the system construction are presented. With the effectiveness of the proposed idea demonstrated via calibration and experimental characterizations in the near future, the CombOmni could become a viable option for a haptic device with both force and torque outputs in a cost-effective way.	haptic technology;stylus (computing);virtuix omni	Kai Xu;Bin Zhao;Shu'an Zhang;Zhaoyu Zhang;Nianzeng Xing	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2017.8324619	control theory;control engineering;calibration;haptic technology;torque;stylus;kinematics;robot kinematics;engineering;teleoperation	Robotics	73.63600741459089	-27.594314986172318	104253

To realize this objective, the various information from a remote site must be presented to the operator. ,Even though tactile information is very important to execute a task efficiently, it is not yet suflciently provided for the operator. In this paper, we propose the new mechanism that can provide the more dexterous tactile information to the operator. This device utilizing the electromagnetic force is designed to be compact and light enough to attach on the fingerpad, and designed to be controlled continuously. The magnetic circuit is derived by the probable j lux paths method in order to take forces at any given dimension. An optimization technique is also proposed to maximize the tactile force that humans can perceive under same conditions. It is demonstrated that, by optimization, the tactile force increase by 24%, compared with that obtained from the initial design.	mathematical optimization	Junghoon Lee;Ihn-Seok Ahn;Jong-Oh Park	1999		10.1109/IROS.1999.811699	control engineering;electronic engineering;electromagnetism;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	70.30139958512252	-25.3206214722039	104340
3342fc43849120f40abb67fef2caa2169d3d7976	acoustic echo cancellation during doubletalk using convolutive blind source separation of signals having temporal dependence		This paper describes a new algorithm for acoustic echo cancellation during doubletalk or, more precisely, acoustic echo separation, based on blind source separation (BSS) of convolutively mixed signals. The signal model assumes independence between sources, but temporal dependence between time samples, specifically that the vector signals have first-order Markov dependence. The source separation is done using a maximum likelihood approach. The source separation does not always provide separation, because of too many degrees of freedom on the separation. However, when applied to the acoustic echo cancellation problem, the constraints of the echo system neatly solve this problem. An example shows that acoustic echoes can be cleanly separated during doubletalk.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;first-order predicate;markov chain;source separation	Todd K. Moon;Jacob H.

Therefore, many cerebellar models were proposed to be applied in the field of robotic arm control. However, some problems exist in the current cerebellar modeling approach, such as lack of the expression of bio-characteristics, limited learning ability et al. Therefore, a distributed cerebellar-inspired learning model was proposed to mimic the physiology and anatomy features of the cerebellum. Meanwhile, this model could learn to adjust the motor command according to the error information provided by the inferior olive to achieve control goal. To test the performance of the cerebellar model, a robotic arm control system was implemented. The results showed that our model was able to complete the robotic arm control tasks successfully.	anatomic structures;british informatics olympiad;cerebellar cortex structure;control system;cortical cell layer of the cerebellum;experiment;imaging phantom;inspiration function;interconnection;limb structure;phantoms, imaging;robot;robotic arm;simulation;physiological aspects	Xiangqian Lin;Rong Liu	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036977	robotic arm;computer science;motor control;cerebellum;motor coordination;control engineering;control system	Robotics	68.35457419007517	-26.76465947360258	104757

Opposite to bilateral force-reflecting teleoperation control approach, which uses a position/velocity command combined with force feedback from the robot side, Tele-Impedance enriches the command sent to the slave robot by combining the position reference with a stiffness (or full impedance) reference. The desired stiffness profile is directly estimated from the arm of the human operating the remote robotic arm. We preliminarily investigate the effectiveness of this method while teleoperating a slave robotic arm to execute simple tasks. The KUKA light weight robotic arm is used as the slave manipulator. The endpoint (wrist) position of the human arm is monitored by an optical tracking system while the stiffness of the human arm is estimated from the electromyography (EMGs) signal measurements of four flexor-extensor muscle pairs, in realtime. The performance of Tele-Impedance control method is assessed by comparing the results obtained while executing a peg-in-hole task, with the slave arm under i) constant low stiffness, ii) constant high stiffness or iii) under Tele-Impedance control. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tele-Impedance control method and highlight its potential use to safely execute tasks with uncertain environment constraints which may result in large deviations from the commanded position trajectories.	bilateral filter;characteristic impedance;communication endpoint;electromyography;haptic technology;input impedance;nominal impedance;output impedance;robot;robotic arm;television;tracking system;velocity (software development)	Arash Ajoudani;Nikolaos G.

Although the model is improved, the realistic animation of the shoulder is hardly achieved. This is due to the fact that it is difficult to coordinate the simultaneous motion of the shoulder components in a consistent way. Also, the common use of independent 1-DOF (degree of freedom) joint hierarchies does not properly render the 3-D accessibility space of real joints. On the basis of former biomechanical investigations, we propose here an extended shoulder model including scapulo-thoracic constraint and joint sinus cones. As a demonstration, the model is applied, using inverse kinematics, to the animation of a 3-D anatomic muscled skeleton model. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Measurements on our prototype, consisting of an aluminum tile covered with low-friction polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), demonstrate that it can effectively simulate a low coefficient of static friction. As part of the design, we also investigated the role that induced vibration plays in modifying the coefficient of friction. Measurements of sliding on a PTFE-covered tile in a tilted configuration showed a significant influence of normal low-frequency vibration, particularly for frequencies around 20 Hz, regardless of the user's weight.	coefficient;prototype;simulation	Guillaume Y Millet;Martin J.-D.

A theoretical framework is presented for unwrapped phase estimation from harmonic spectra through smoothing real and imaginary spectral components. The short—time harmonic model leads to pitch adaptive duration and alignment requirements on time—domain windowing. The underlying phase envelope is consequently preserved so that cepstral windowing can be applied. In addition, two alternative vocoders with mixed-phase are considered: the first is based on linear interpolation of complex harmonic peaks, and the second on Lim's spectral root deconvolution scheme.	cepstrum;deconvolution;expanded memory;harmonic spectrum;imaginary time;instantaneous phase;linear interpolation;minimum phase;quantum phase estimation algorithm;requirement;smoothing;vocoder	Thomas F.

f66643bfdc15efb12f63de423d3e42b45166543a	towards a better representation of the envelope modulation of aspiration noise		The control over aspects of the glottal source signal is fundamental to correctly modify relevant voice characteristics, such as breathiness. This voice quality is strongly related to the characteristics of the glottal source signal produced at the glottis, mainly the shape of the glottal pulse and the aspiration noise. This type of noise results from the turbulence of air passing through the glottis and it can be represented by an amplitude modulated Gaussian noise, which depends on the glottal volume velocity and glottal area. However, the dependency between the glottal signal and the noise component is usually not taken into account for transforming breathiness. In this paper, we propose a method for modelling the aspiration noise which permits to adapt the aspiration noise to take into account its dependency with the glottal pulse shape, while producing high-quality speech. The envelope of the amplitude modulated noise is estimated from the speech signal pitch-synchronously and then it is parameterized by using a non-linear polynomial fitting algorithm. Finally, an asymmetric triangular window is obtained from the non-linear polynomial representation for obtaining a shape of the energy envelope of the noise closer to that of the glottal source. In the experiments for voice transformation, both the proposed aspiration noise model and an acoustic glottal source model are used to transform a modal voice into breathy. Results show that the aspiration noise model improves the voice quality transformation compared with an excitation using only the glottal model and an excitation that combines the glottal source model and a spectral representation of the noise component.	modulation	João P.

In contrast to remote handling of hard environments, the level of the friction forces is thereby within the same order of magnitude as the interaction forces. Therefore, these friction forces may alter performance and haptic transparency considerably. Control schemes showing nice results within simulations using linear models, with frictionless virtual manipulators in a virtual environment, or where friction forces are negligible compared to the interaction forces, show totally different results when implemented on a real telemanipulator setup with a realistic friction level and in contact with a soft environment. In this paper, friction is added to the linear models of the master and slave actuators as an input force disturbance. The influence of these disturbances on haptic transparency then is investigated analytically for the most widely used teleoperator schemes. Thereby, effectiveness of using force sensors on master and/or slave side is evaluated, and validated through experiments on a one-dimensional test setup.	bilateral filter;experiment;haptic technology;linear model;remote manipulator;sensor;simulation;telerobotics;virtual reality	Gudrun De Gersem;Hendrik Van Brussel	2004	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2004.

51820f0634fe7896f4293fe88bbbd0d2ce0584dc	workspace analysis for haptic feedback manipulator in virtual cockpit system		To obtain natural space experience of haptic interaction for users in virtual cockpit systems (VCS), a haptic feedback system and a workspace analysis framework for haptic feedback manipulator (HFM) are presented in this paper. Firstly, improving the classical three-dimensional workspace obtained by the Monte Carlo method, a novel workspace representation method, oriented workspace, is presented, which can indicate both the position and the orientation of the end-effector. Then, aimed at the characters of HFMs, the oriented workspace is divided into the effective workspace and the prohibited area by extracting the control panel area. At last, the effective workspace volume and the control panel area are calculated by the double-directed extremum method, with the accuracy improved by repeatedly adding and extracting boundary points. By simulation, the area in which interactions between the manipulator and users hand performed is determined and accordingly the effective workspace along with its boundary and volume are obtained in a relative high precision, which lay a basis for haptic interaction in VCS.	approximation;feedback;graphical user interface;haptic technology;interaction;maxima and minima;monte carlo method;newton's method;norm (social);numerical analysis;plugboard;point cloud;requirement;robot end effector;serial manipulator;simulation;thickness (graph theory);veritas cluster server;workspace	Shiyu Zhang;Shuling Dai	2017	Virtual Reality	10.1007/s10055-017-0327-y	workspace;cockpit;simulation;monte carlo method;haptic technology;manipulator;computer science;control engineering	Robotics	77.24827661057901	-27.824825227175165	106401

An omni-directional mobile robot with three omni-directional wheels was used as the base. An aluminum stick was fixed on the mobile base of cane robot. We proposed a Concept called “intentional direction (ITD)” for estimating the user's walking intention by analyzing the signal of a 6-axis force/torque sensor which is fixed to the handle of stick. As a care-nursing device, the cane robot was designed to assist the elderly in both indoor and outdoor environments. Therefore the size and weight of cane robot should be minimized. But in that case, there is high risk that the cane robot would be pushed over by the user. Therefore, A universal joint driven by two DC motors was designed to improve the stability of cane robot by controlling the posture of the stick. In this paper a constrained nonlinear multivariable algorithm was designed to optimize the stable posture of cane robot. By controlling the posture of stick, the maximums sufferable torque moment which lead to cane robot falling over can be increased. The experimental results show that the stability of cane robot can be enhanced effectively.	algorithm;mobile robot;nonlinear system;poor posture;wheels	Pei Di;Kousuke Sekiyama;Jian Huang;Shotaro Nakagawa;Fei Chen;Toshio Fukuda	2012	2012 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science (MHS)	10.1109/MHS.2012.6492436	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;engineering;control theory;robot control	Robotics	70.38318254140982	-26.356998936607813	106465

A dynamic magnetic field produced by a set of external magnetic coils is used to manage the locomotion of the capsule. A permanent magnet is embedded into the capsule in order to manipulate the capsule by changing the external magnetic field strength for each specific position. The dynamic magnetic field is externally controlled to reach and maintain the equilibrium state for holding the capsule in a specific location. This is achieved by keeping the net force of magnetic fields zero. To start the mobility, the magnetic field from one of the external field sources will be reduced for a certain amount of time by sending an OFF-pulse (a current source). The required forces and the pulses are controlled by a specific algorithm to control the step size of the movement in order to achieve precise motion at any chosen velocity. The proposed method is designed to provide a precise motion control with a system extremely low in complexity.	arabic numeral 0;capsule endoscopy;current source device component;electromagnetic fields;embedded system;embedding;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;magnet <device>;magnetic fields;magnetic resonance imaging;robot;tom clancy's net force explorers;velocity (software development);algorithm	Fahad N.

It is widely accepted in the HPSS research that the harmonic and percussive components have anisotropic characteristics: The spectrum of the harmonic components and the time activation of the percussive components are sparse, whereas the spectrum of the percussive components and the time activation of the harmonic components are smooth. However, conventional methods fail to fully utilize the characteristics leading to suboptimal performance. Based on the observations that not the degree of sparseness but the degree of fluctuation is an accurate measure for distinguishing the harmonic and percussive components, we propose a novel HPSS algorithm by incorporating the continuity control in the iterative update formula of the matrix decomposition algorithm. In doing so, we first utilize probabilistic latent component analysis with Dirichlet prior, and later reformulate the algorithm in the nonnegative matrix factorization framework to reduce the computational cost. The comparative evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods in terms of both objective and subjective evaluation.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;computer performance;high performance storage system;iterative method;neural coding;non-negative matrix factorization;quantum fluctuation;reflections of signals on conducting lines;scott continuity;sparse matrix;spectrogram;the matrix	Jeongsoo Park;Jaeyoung Shin;Kyogu Lee	2017	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASLP.2017.2681742	entropy;mathematical optimization;speech recognition;spectrogram;harmonic analysis;pattern recognition;music;mathematics;probabilistic logic;matrix decomposition	AI	79.25592871228953	-37.13044497888161	107044

Traditional Gaussian modeling of noise signals fails when the signals exhibit impulsive behavior. A new model is used, namely the Symmetric -Stable ( S S), which can better account for the outliers that exist in real-world signals. Real data is used to compare the performance of both the Gaussian and the -stable models. We demonstrate that the stable model gives a much better approximation to the noise signal than the Gaussian model. Furthermore, we study the problem of Time Delay Estimation (TDE) and we demonstrate the shortcomings of TDE techniques based on second-order statistics when the noise is of S S nature. We propose an alternative to second-order based methods, based on Fractional Lower-Order Statistics, and demonstrate the achieved improvement via simulation experiments.	approximation;covox speech thing;experiment;simulation;stable model semantics;transparent data encryption	Panayiotis G.

However, a method of teaching motion with physical interaction to a robot without the robot's model remains unavailable. Thus, we propose a bilateral teleoperation system for control of a musculoskeletal robot in this paper. This system enables an operator to operate the robot without the robot's model. The system includes a pneumatic musculoskeletal robot and pneumatic musculoskeletal exoskeleton with same joint and muscle composition. The operator wears the exoskeleton, feels the force that is exerted on the robot via the exoskeleton, and controls the robot by giving force to the exoskeleton. In the experiments, we found that the delay of this system is approximately 200 ms. Our system was able to give feedback force to the operator and change the magnitude of this force according to that of the external force. We showed that the operator can make the musculoskeletal robot perform a task with physical interaction with an environment using our systems. Thus, our system allows the operator to teach motion to a musculoskeletal robot with this interaction.	bilateral filter;experiment;feedback;fundamental interaction;haptic technology;human–computer interaction;lopes (exoskeleton);robot;robotic arm	Xi Chen;Satoshi Nishikawa;Kazutoshi Tanaka;Ryuma Niiyama;Yasuo Kuniyoshi	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2017.8324833	control theory;control engineering;robot;operator (computer programming);robotic arm;engineering;robot kinematics;teleoperation	Robotics	69.84384070999882	-26.095126962375456	107429

34a468a9d19f80adeda25890328daf3699348556	comfort noise detection and gsm-fr-codec detection for speech-quality evaluations in telephone networks		This paper proposes two algorithms to measure special quality-relevant characteristics of telephone links. The first algorithm presented here allows to detect the GSM-FR codec in transmission systems. For this purpose, the spectral region of the decoded signal around 2700 Hz is evaluated. The GSM-FR coding principle inserts a spectral attenuation in this frequency region that can be detected. The error rate is below 5%. The purpose of the second algorithm is to detect comfort noise in telephone connections. Therefore, frequency points of the background-noise spectrum throughout the duration of speech utterances are sampled, by making use of minimum statistics in frequency-tracks of speech segments. These frequency points are compared to the noise in speech pauses in a statistical manner to evaluate differences and decide about the occurrence of comfort noise. The error rate for the used data base is below 5%, but further investigations are necessary to verify this algorithm.	algorithm;codec;colors of noise;comfort noise;database;full rate	Thorsten Ludwig	2002			comfort noise;gsm;speech recognition;computer network;computer science;codec;telephone network	ML	82.76943986603862	-31.23434611455171	107593

The measured end-point error is decomposed into generalized geometric and elastic error parameters that are used in an analytical model to calibrate the system as a function of its configuration and the task loads, including any payload weight. The method exploits the fundamental mechanics of serial manipulators to yield a non-iterative compensation process that only requires the identification of parameters that are function only of one variable. The resulting method is computationally simple and requires far less measured data that might be expected. The method is applied to a six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) medical robot that positions patients for cancer proton therapy to enable it to achieve very high accuracy.

b24cb12a6ac658c7364f2ea06b6953cd12ab5099	a 7-dof wire-driven lightweight arm with wide wrist motion range		Till date, various seven-degrees-of-freedom (7-DOF)robot arms have been developed globally. In general, the robot arms utilized in factories are required to possess speed, power, and accuracy. They are isolated from humans using a fence to ensure human safety. However, a home robot should work near humans at an appropriate speed without a fence. One approach to meeting this requirement involves the installation of various sensors on the robot to control and stop the robot safely even if a collision has occurred. However, a robot system is complicated and expensive. In order to give inherent safety to the robot, we should lighten the robot arm. In this study, a 7-DOF lightweight arm with a wide wrist-motion range is introduced. The weight of movable parts is approximately 2.87 kg. To achieve such properties, we propose the use of three mechanisms: a shoulder mechanism with hollow cylinders, a wrist mechanism with a wide workspace, and an integrated wrist and elbow mechanisms of high power. To verify its feasibility, a prototype of the robot is designed and developed. The experimental results demonstrate its powerful performance and wide workspace of the wrist.

In this paper, we attempt to extract information about epochs from phase spectra of speech signals. The phase spectrum of speech is modelled as the response of an allpass (AP) filter, and the resulting error signal is used for epoch extraction. The parameters of AP model are estimated by imposing sparsity constraints on the error signal. The error signal, thus obtained, exhibits prominent peaks at epoch locations. The epochal candidates obtained from the error signal are refined using a dynamic programming algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is consistent across genders and is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods.		Karthika Vijayan;K.

A new method for evaluating the usability of virtual teleoperated surgical instruments based on virtual sensors is presented. This method uses virtual prototyping of the surgical instrument with a dual physical interaction, which allows testing of different sensor configurations in a real environment. Moreover, the proposed approach has been applied to the evaluation of prototypes of a two-finger grasper for lump detection by remote pinching. In this example, the usability of a set of five different sensor configurations, with a different number of force sensors, is evaluated in terms of quantitative and qualitative measures in clinical experiments with 23 volunteers. As a result, the smallest number of force sensors needed in the surgical instrument that ensures the usability of the device can be determined. The details of the experimental setup are also included.	binding (molecular function);dual;experiment;human–computer interaction;instrument - device;lumped element model;preparation;robot;smallest;sterilization for infection control;surgical instruments;usability;sensor (device)	Jesús M.

However, the robot may have poor performance or the instruments can not reach all the surgical sites if the requirements of the robot are not considered. A setup optimization process that not only considers the surgery requirements but also considers the robot performance is proposed in the paper. In this process, incisions are chosen carefully by surgeons based on surgical requirements before surgery. The position of the robot relative to the incision is predetermined by maximizing the Global Conditioning Index (GCI) within the moving ranges of the joints. The posture of the robot is optimized also by maximizing the GCI and meets a set of performance constraints. This optimization process is repeated until the robot can reach all the surgical sites. The calculation results verify the effectiveness of this technique in robot-assisted MIS.	google code-in;loss function;mathematical optimization;minimally invasive education;optimization problem;poor posture;requirement;robot	Jianmin Li;Shuxin Wang;Xiaofei Wang;Lin'an Zhang	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979931	kinematics;simulation;computer science;engineering;sensor;artificial intelligence;biological engineering;robot kinematics	Robotics	72.15089706403839	-29.472044990399507	109077
ce6df2acd6eb3a97dc7fdd8ec9fee9507bae7c22	identification of human dynamics in user-led physical human robot environment interaction		Human dynamic models are useful in design of physical human-robot and human-robot-environment interaction: informing choice of robot impedance, motivating relaxations to passivity-based safety constraints, and allowing online inference to user intent. Designing for performance objectives such as stable well-damped contact transitions also requires nominal models, but the use of human models in controller design is limited. Established approaches to identify human dynamics apply position or force perturbation and measure the corresponding response, mostly to validate neuromuscular hypotheses on motor control, which raises questions about their transferability to human-led collaboration. Here, human dynamics are identified in a task which closely resembles the final application, where the human leads the robot into contact with a (virtual) wall. This paper investigates the impact of human dynamics on coupled system behavior, and establishes a general framework for identification in human-led scenarios, making consideration of unmeasured human input. Experiments with different stiffness environments allow inference to human dynamics, and characterize the range of human dynamics which can be modulated by the user.	characteristic impedance;experiment;human dynamics;initial condition;mathematical model;modulation;robot	Kevin Haninger;Dragoljub Surdilovic	2018	2018 27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)	10.1109/ROMAN.2018.8525821	simulation;task analysis;user intent;control theory;human dynamics;motor control;inference;control engineering;transferability;computer science;human–robot interaction	Robotics	69.87109165299582	-26.217574836962807	109305

An educational environment requires factors such as easy installation, low cost, and reasonable performance, which the SPIDAR-mouse can provide. However, it limits the representation of force to 2D, even though the molecular interaction includes 3D phenomena. Our approach to the solution is to map the surface of 3D molecules to the 2D plane. The haptic rendering is done by calculating forces with the 2D map, which largely reduces the computational cost. The molecular interaction based on the electro-static potential and conformational properties is displayed with the 2D lateral force feedback using the SPIDAR-mouse.	computational complexity theory;docking (molecular);haptic technology;interactome;lateral thinking;map;usability	Kikuo Asai;Norio Takase;Makoto Sato	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/SMC.2013.100	computer vision;simulation;docking;computer science;data visualization;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	76.73932347515978	-27.899593751221555	109417
2cf809344ed56d1b52ea93b211fbce87c930a614	3-dof trilateral teleoperation using a pair of 1-dof and 2-dof haptic devices: stability analysis	absolute stability;multi-master/single-slave teleoperation	Humans are usually better than autonomous robots in operating in complex environments. In bilateral teleoperation, to take full advantage of the human’s intelligence, experience, and sensory inputs for performing a dexterous task, a possibility is to use the two hands of the user to manipulate two master haptic devices in order to control a slave robot with multiple degrees-of-freedom (DOF); the total DOFs of the two masters are equal to the DOFs of the slave. In this paper, two 1-DOF and 2-DOF haptic robots are considered as the two masters while a 3-DOF robot acts as the slave in a trilateral teleoperation system. It is discussed how such a system can result in better task performance by splitting the various DOFs of a dexterous task between two hands or two users, e.g., during peg-in-the-hole insertion. The stability analysis of such a system is not trivial due to dynamic coupling across the different DOFs of the robots, the human operators, and the physical/virtual environments. Also, the unknown dynamics of the users and the environments exacerbate the problem. We present a novel, straightforward and convenient method for stability analysis of this teleoperation system. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the approach.	autonomous robot;bilateral filter;bilateral sound;haptic technology;humans;routh–hurwitz stability criterion;simulation;virtual reality	Mahdi Tavakoli;Qi Huang	2013		10.3182/20130902-3-CN-3020.00069	simulation	Robotics	69.75792601440108	-25.953068801356242	109504

Dorsal vessel cells (DVCs) were used as a bioactuator because of their robustness. We adopted flagella movement as motion of the micromachine. In order to confirm the motion of the micromachine by DVCs, we assumed a physical model and estimated the maximum displacement of the micromachine. DVCs adhesion to the structure was also investigated. As a result, we confirmed DVCs adhesion and compared the behavior with control. DVCs on a structure contracted at a speed of 86% of DVCs on a dish. This result will lead the micromachine driven by a single muscle cell bioactuator.	displacement mapping;parabolic antenna	Kohta Ogawa;Kaoru Uesugi;Keisuke Morishima	2015	2015 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science (MHS)	10.1109/MHS.2015.7438344	materials science;nanotechnology;engineering drawing;anatomy	Robotics	78.91168639324535	-24.56563265503729	109566

The signals acquired by using surface EMG sensors are processed with choosing the maximum in a short period, taking the absolute value, and filtering noises out with a low-pass filter. The processed signals are directly used for the motion generation of virtual arm in real time simulator. The virtual arm of simulator has two degrees of freedom and complies with the desired flexion/extension motions of both the elbow and shoulder of human. Also, we show the validity of the suggested algorithms through the experimental results.	arm architecture;algorithm;computation;electromyography;emoticon;experiment;image scaling;low-pass filter;sensor;signal processing;simulation;time complexity;wavelet	Hyeon-Jae Yu;Youngjin Choi	2007	2007 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2007.4399238	computer vision;simulation;low-pass filter;computer science;engineering;control theory	Robotics	69.85721268317141	-30.148827058101368	109770

This demonstration presents a tactile display with both controllable rigidity and geometric properties. A Technologynique called particle jamming provides adjustable mechanical properties: different levels of vacuum applied to a hollow silicone membrane filled with coffee grounds causes the granules to lock together with varying levels of stiffness. Geometric properties are controlled by clamping the membrane over a sealed chamber and increasing the pressure beneath it, which regulates the deformation of the surface as it balloons outward. Our corresponding conference paper evaluates the human perception of rigidity and geometry created by a single-cell device, which we will demonstrate to support our description of the user study with a hands-on experience. We will also show new multi-cell array devices, which combine multiple cells together with mechanisms to pin the nodes between cells. These devices allow the display of more complicated geometries.	cell (microprocessor);cell signaling;clamping (graphics);consistency model;curve fitting;displacement mapping;downscaling;finite element method;http public key pinning;hands-on computing;haptic technology;head-mounted display;human–computer interaction;immersion (virtual reality);input/output;iteration;mathematical model;maxwell (microarchitecture);radio jamming;robot end effector;sensor;simulation;thickness (graph theory);usability testing;virtual reality;workspace	Andrew A.

Based on a biomedical engineering analysis, we developed a new walking assist device with a concept to reduce the floor reaction force of the user of the device. The device comprises an axis layout in which expansion and contraction mechanisms disposed on the right and left are connected to a seat at a single point, a device layout in which the device is disposed along the inner side of the user's legs, and a mechanism that utilizes a circular arc-shaped rail. With these original layouts and mechanisms, we achieved a walking assist device that can be put on and taken off easily without the need to fasten the device to a user's body, and that can always maintain the assist force vector in the direction from the center of pressure of floor reaction force to the center of gravity of the user's body by using only two actuators. The device can reduce the load on leg muscles and joints in various movements and postures. It was confirmed that the device has an assist effect of reducing the user's leg muscle activities as well as the user's total body energy consumption when the user climbs stairs or performs a squat exercise.	apache axis;c object processor;cog (project);frequency response;squatting attack;usability;video-in video-out	Yasushi Ikeuchi;Jun Ashihara;Yutaka Hiki;Hiroshi Kudoh;Tatsuya Noda	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354543	structural engineering;layout;simulation;computer science;engineering;center of pressure;center of gravity;user interface;force;foot;mechanical engineering	Robotics	72.78676484484551	-26.476803132198913	110003

The reconstruction technique is based on the sinusoidal speech representation. A set of sine-wave frequencies is derived using the pitch frequency and voicing decisions, and synthetic phases are then assigned to each respective sine wave. The sine-wave amplitudes are generated by sampling a linear combination of frequency domain basis functions. The basis function gains are determined such that the mel-frequency binned spectrum of the reconstructed speech is similar to the mel-frequency binned spectrum, obtained from the original MFCC vector by IDCT and antilog operations. Natural sounding, good quality intelligible speech is obtained by this procedure.	algorithm;automatic sounding;basis function;coefficient;discrete cosine transform;mel-frequency cepstrum;sampling (signal processing);speech recognition;synthetic intelligence	Dan Chazan;Ron Hoory;Gilad Cohen;Meir Tzur	2000		10.1109/ICASSP.2000.861816	speech recognition;computer science;pitch detection algorithm;mathematics;mel-frequency cepstrum;speech synthesis;frequency domain	ML	79.90024598216193	-33.33799705582808	110724

The retractor enables simultaneous utilization of three functions: suction, retraction, and retraction-force sensing. The retractor also reduces the number of tool changes and ensures safe retraction through visualization of the magnitude of the retraction force. The proposed force-sensing system is based on a force visualization mechanism through which the force is displayed in the form of motion of a colored pole. This enables surgeons to estimate the retraction force. When a fiberscope or camera is present, the retractor enables measurement of the retraction force with a resolution of 0.05 N. The retractor has advantages of being disposable, inexpensive, and easy to sterilize or disinfect.

The above dependencies are incorporated in the statistical model using concepts from the theory of Markov Random Fields. In particular, the speech short-time Fourier transform (STFT) amplitude samples are modeled with a novel Chi Markov Random Field prior, which is then used for the development of an estimator based on the Iterated Conditional Modes method. The novel prior is also coupled with a dasiaharmonicpsila neighborhood, which apart from the immediately adjacent samples on the time frequency plane, also considers samples which are one pitch frequency apart, so as to take advantage of the rich structure of the voiced speech time frames. Additionally, central to the development of the algorithm is the adaptive estimation of the weights that determine the interaction between neighboring samples, which allows the restoration of weak speech spectral components, while maintaining a low level of uniform residual noise. Results that illustrate the improvements achieved with the proposed algorithm, and a comparison with other established speech enhancement schemes are also given.	algorithm;chi;circuit restoration;iterated conditional modes;iterated function;markov chain;markov random field;short-time fourier transform;speech enhancement;statistical model	Ioannis Andrianakis;Paul R.

Two specific issues arise in the MR environment: (i) the reduced space in which to place the robot; and (ii) the MR compatibility. The main mechanical body is located above the head of surgeon, with two rigid, hanging arms that reach into the workspace. This novel configuration contributes to a small occupancy in the workspace and to the MR compatibility. The robot is also carefully designed for safety and sterilization issues. Details of the kinematics and the design of the robot are given, and the MR compatibility is examined. This shows that the robot has no adverse effect on the imaging, even when it is in motion.	coat of arms;pointer (computer programming);resonance;robot;workspace	Kiyoyuki Chinzei;Nobuhiko Hata;Ferenc A.

We drive a person's hand with a robot along smooth reaching trajectories while measuring the motion of the shoulder and elbow joints and the force required to move the hand. We fit a model that predicts the shoulder and elbow joint torques required to achieve a desired arm motion. This torque can be supplied by functional electrical stimulation of muscles to control the arm of a person paralyzed by spinal cord injury. Errors in predictions of the joint torques for a subject without spinal cord injury were less than 20% of the maximum torques observed in the identification experiments. In most cases a semiparametric Gaussian process model predicted joint torques with equal or less error than a nonparametric Gaussian process model or a parametric model.	experiment;functional electrical stimulation;gaussian process;inverse dynamics;parametric model;process modeling;robot;semiparametric model;testbed	Eric M.

This 3 link model performs an acrobatic motion called the kip. A kip pattern of a gymnast’s center of mass is  optimized by using a variable length pendulum. We input the results of this model into the 3 link system and by using kinematic  redundancy considering system dynamics, we can find the optimal joint trajectories. The gymnast uses primarily torques generated  in the hip and shoulder joints to perform the kip. We show that we can reduce the torque in the wrist joint such that it is  less than the torques generated in the hip and shoulder joints of the 3 link robot and successfully perform the kip. Additionally,  analyzing the trajectory of the center of mass may provide useful coaching information to the beginner.  	optimal control	Darrell Nakawaki;Sangwan Joo;Fumio Miyazaki	1997		10.1007/BFb0112954	control engineering;center of mass;simulation;optimal control;engineering;control theory;system dynamics	Robotics	68.89253837313493	-24.1530777354621	112321

There have been proposed a high-level control system and algorithms used for training patients. Emphasis was made especially on the gravitation compensation algorithm, because of the low velocity and acceleration of movement parameters during rehabilitation. The direction of movements was estimated based on the model of surface electromyographic (sEMG) signal, which renders muscle activity very well. The model of manipulator is stable, behaves in a predictable way and, according to the EMG interpretation block, satisfyingly deduces the intention of motion and controls the model.	arm architecture;algorithm;characteristic impedance;control system;electromyography;experiment;high- and low-level;naive bayes classifier;rehabilitation robotics;rendering (computer graphics);robot;statistical classification;velocity (software development)	Artur Gmerek	2011	2011 16th International Conference on Methods & Models in Automation & Robotics	10.1109/MMAR.2011.6031341	acceleration;simulation;computer science;trajectory;mathematical model;robot kinematics	Robotics	69.27957730940074	-25.809024267703442	113648

As an extension to an earlier developed fabric flaw detection system, the proposed framework consists of a combination of basic and custom-made image-processing techniques that allow to precisely track single wefts and warps within fabric images - in real-time. Several adaptations facilitate the measurement of density changes for plain, satin, and twill weaves. In this paper, the algorithmic framework has been evaluated in several comprehensive on-line experiments on a real-world air-jet loom and is additionally compared with three alternative methods for fabric density measurement. It proved to be precise, robust, and applicable for industrial use as it overcomes many of the existing shortcomings of current methods.	experiment;flaw hypothesis methodology;fourier analysis;image processing;loom;online and offline;real-time clock;reliability engineering;robustness (computer science);system of measurement;x-ray (amazon kindle)	Dorian Schneider;Yves-Simon Gloy;Dorit Merhof	2015	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2014.2363580	structural engineering;public records;engineering;trajectory;engineering drawing;weaving;physics;quantum mechanics	Embedded	77.18524861935303	-25.562568341103017	114771

A new approach regarding robotic extra-fingers is presented here. In particular, an object-based mapping algorithm is proposed to control the robotic extra-fingers by interpreting the whole or a part of the hand motion in grasping and manipulation tasks. As a case study, the model and control of an additional robotic finger is presented. The robotic finger has been placed on the wrist opposite to the hand palm. This solution enlarges the hand workspace, increasing the grasp capability of the user. The proposed mapping algorithm do not require the human operator to activate explicit commands. Rather, the motion of the extra-fingers is connected to the human hand so that the user can perceive the robotic fingers as an extension of his body.	algorithm;experiment;lift;numerical analysis;object-based language;powered exoskeleton;programming paradigm;robot;usability;wearable computer;workspace	Domenico Prattichizzo;Gionata Salvietti;Francesco Chinello;Monica Malvezzi	2014	2014 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics	10.1109/AIM.2014.6878306	computer vision;simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;robot control	Robotics	71.28451999543124	-25.113418316230973	114795
1b32bc88ddc0dab0d6421794ce967994ce892479	a neuro-musculo-skeletal model of human standing combining muscle-reflex control and virtual model control		While neuro-musculo-skeletal models are a common tool in theoretical studies on human gait, they are rarely used for studying human motor control of standing balance. As a result, it is difficult to assess whether proposed control strategies of standing balance can be realized by the human neuromuscular structure. Nor is it clear how the human control of standing balance interacts with that of walking. Motivated by these two shortcomings, we here develop a neuro-musculo-skeletal model of human bipedal standing whose control combines spinal muscle reflexes suggested to be important in walking with a virtual model control mimicking the supraspinal regulation of balance. We show in computer simulations that the model can reproduce several aspects of human standing balance observed in experiments on postural sway. Although control improvements are necessary to capture more aspects, the model may serve as a starting for studying the combined control of standing and walking.	3d modeling;computer simulation;experiment;neuro-fuzzy;reflex action;skeletal muscle structure	Yasuyuki Suzuki;Hartmut Geyer	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513543	reflex;computer vision;physical medicine and rehabilitation;balance (ability);artificial intelligence;standing balance;motor control;computer science;gait (human)	Robotics	68.68415110371966	-27.23211165825119	115040

With current training equipment, neither the exercise trajectory can be optimized nor the loadings on structures of the musculoskeletal system can be controlled. To overcome these limitations an experimental research platform for the development of new training scenarios is developed using an industrial robot for maximum flexibility together with kinetic and kinematic data and musculoskeletal models for estimating loadings on target structures. The focus of this paper lies on the implementation of isokinematic exercise, i.e. leg extension and flexion with constant velocity. A force triggered trajectory with smooth transitions between two points needs to be planned for the robot. An algorithm which uses continuous polynomials is proposed. It consists of three parts. First, the trajectory is planned in Cartesian space by intuitive definitions of e.g. start and end point or desired velocity and minimum resistive force. The trajectory can be visualized and optimized using OpenSim together with a model of the research platform, which makes the system usable for non experts in the field of robotics. Second, a smooth trajectory in joint space is generated from the planning points, using a third order polynomial for joint velocities between two adjacent points. Third, the trajectory is adapted to the measured force at the end effector, as the robot should only move along the trajectory, if the applied force by the user is high enough. The proposed algorithm is furthermore easily expandable to arbitrary force triggered motions with definable position and velocity profiles.	algorithm;cartesian closed category;experiment;industrial robot;motion capture;opensimulator;polynomial;robot end effector;robotics;smoothing;velocity (software development)	Melanie Kolditz;Thivaharan Albin;Kirsten Albracht;Gert-Peter Brüggemann;Dirk Abel	2016	2016 6th IEEE International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics (BioRob)	10.1109/BIOROB.2016.7523750	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	70.81229357638792	-25.980385416254226	115046

In this case, they require high load operations such as gripping and conveyance of heavy load, and holding people at the care spot. However, these operations are difficult for existing humanoids because of their low joint output. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop the highoutput life-size humanoid robot. We first designed a motor driver for humanoid with featuring small, water-cooled, and high output, and it performed higher joint output than existing humanoids utilizing. In this paper, we describe designed humanoid arm and leg with this motor driver. The arm is featuring the designed 2-axis unit and the leg is featuring the water-cooled double motor system. We demonstrated the arm's high torque and high velocity experiment and the leg's high performance experiment based on water-cooled double motor compared with air-cooled and single motor. Then we designed and developed a life-size humanoid with these arms and legs. We demonstrated some humanoid's experiment operating high load to find out the arm and leg's validity.	coat of arms;humanoid robot;lambda lifting;reachability;spec#;velocity (software development);water cooling	Yoshito Ito;Shunichi Nozawa;Junichi Urata;Takuya Nakaoka;Kazuya Kobayashi;Yuto Nakanishi;Kei Okada;Masayuki Inaba	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907353	control engineering;simulation;humanoid robot;control theory	Robotics	71.51820879709169	-25.31928091560526	115629

Because the individual muscle forces acting on a bone are directly related to its behavior, bone stress analyses depend on the accurate estimation of muscle forces. The development of an integrated modeling method to determine such muscle forces and to apply them to the stress analysis of a system of bones is described. Firstly, a numerical optimization method was used in the development and validation of a model to predict the individual muscle forces generated in a leg that produce a known net resultant load. Next, this model was integrated into a finite element simulation of a system of leg bones so that the calculated isometric muscle forces could automatically be applied and the bone stresses calculated. The geometric, material, and joint contact conditions needed to appropriately depict the systemâs behavior were established. Finally, the developed modeling technique was implemented in parametric studies to reveal significant changes in muscle activity and bone stress magnitudes and distributions due to variations in the direction of the net resultant load. The smallest muscle forces occurred in loading directions most typical of daily activities and resulted in bone stresses that were an order of magnitude smaller than those resulting from more uncommon loading directions. The developed modeling technique was shown to provide a controlled means of investigating the relationships between muscle forces and bone stresses.	isometric projection	Catherine S.

Three subsystems are combined: a primary phase estimator based on adaptive oscillators, a desired gait event detector and a phase error compensator. The estimated gait phase is expected to linearly increase from 0 to 2π rad in one stride and remain continuous also when transiting to the next stride. We designed two experimental scenarios to validate this gait phase estimator, namely treadmill walking at different speeds and free walking. In the case of treadmill walking, the maximum phase error at the desired gait events was found to be 0.155 rad, and the maximum phase difference between the end of the previous stride and beginning of the current stride was 0.020 rad. In the free walking trials, phase error at the desired gait event was never larger than 0.278 rad. Our algorithm outperformed against two other benchmarked methods. The good performance of our gait phase estimator could provide consistent and finely tuned assistance for an exoskeleton designed to augment the mobility of patients.	benchmark (computing);computer programming;dynamical system;expect;minimum phase;quantum phase estimation algorithm;real-time clock;robotics;wearable computer	Tingfang Yan;Andrea Parri;Virginia Ruiz Garate;Marco Cempini;Renaud Ronsse;Nicola Vitiello	2017	Auton.

Simultaneous motion and force data were acquired from seven subjects during steady-speed trials (3.0-6.0 m·s<sup>-1</sup>) on a custom, force-instrumented treadmill under three loading conditions: unloaded (1.0 W<sub>b</sub>), 15% added weight (1.15 W<sub>b</sub>) and 30% added weight (1.30 W<sub>b</sub>). Model-predicted impact and peak forces corresponded with measured values, on average, to within 14.9±1.3% and 13.8±0.6%, respectively (R<sup>2</sup> best-fits=0.82 and 0.88, n=71). Ankle jerk and velocity data derived from optical position-time data suggest wearable sensor acquisition of the model-needed inputs is fully feasible. We conclude that the two-mass model offers a promising approach to quantifying running ground reaction forces using wearable technologies.	aerial photography;human body weight;velocity (software development);wearable computer	Andrew B.

The Chirplet transform is used to obtain a first order approximation of the phase, improving the zero order approximation given by other methods, such as the short time Fourier transform (STFT). This gain in accuracy allows us to use criteria for a more accurate chirp tracking, specially at crossing points in the time-frequency plane, and in the determination of harmonics. We explore the efficiency of the method by applying it to synthetic signals as well as to wolves chorus recordings. Results show good performance for chirp tracking even under strong noise corruption.	chirplet transform	Benjamín Dugnol Álvarez;Carlos Fernández García;Gonzalo Galiano Casas;Julián Velasco Valdés	2008	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2008.01.018	electronic engineering;speech recognition;signal processing;mathematics;accuracy and precision;chirplet transform;statistics	Robotics	80.74541682738518	-32.37522661100194	117012

61571e66bf35c0a2618674f0bfe886354ff987b2	calibration of magnetic platform prototype for vision-based drugs delivery inside human cochlea		The magnetic particles actuated by an external magnetic field present a promising solution as drug carrier at the inner ear (cochlea). This technique allows non-invasive drug delivery with minimal hydraulic force and very high precision. In this work, magnetic prototyping platform for intra cochlear drug delivery procedure is proposed. This platform is composed by magnetic actuator mounted on a robot end-effector and an hybrid vision system. The latter consists of a camera to control the position of magnetic actuator, two microscopes to recover the position of the magnetic particles and the 3D structure of the cochlea. The hybrid vision system allows real-time tracking of magnetic particles inside the artificial cochlea. The accuracy of the drug delivery strategy depends strongly on the calibration of the vision system. In this paper a method to calibrate the hybrid vision system is proposed and validated with experimental results.	cochlear implant;prototype;real-time clock;robot end effector	Azaddien Zarrouk;Karim Belharet;Omar Tahri	2017	2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2017.8202184	computer science;calibration;computer vision;artificial intelligence;drug delivery;control engineering;drug carrier;magnetic field;magnetic nanoparticles;actuator;cochlea;machine vision	Robotics	74.72697135105443	-26.99453441178268	117051

As a consequence, automatically detecting the speech polarity is a necessary preliminary step to guarantee a correct behaviour of such methods. The goal of this paper is two-fold. First a new approach for polarity determination based on the calculation of higher-order statistical moments is introduced. These moments oscillate at the local fundamental frequency with a phase shift which is dependent on the speech polarity. Secondly, a thorough comparative evaluation between the proposed method and three other state-of-the-art techniques is carried out. Experiments are led on a large amount of data with 10 speech corpora. In addition to an analysis in clean conditions, the robustness of these methods to both an additive noise and to reverberation is also investigated.	additive white gaussian noise;bit error rate;database;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;speech processing;text corpus;utility functions on indivisible goods	Thomas Drugman;Thierry Dutoit	2014	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2012.06.063	speech recognition;computer science;speech processing	NLP	81.045066879783	-34.167134054593234	117977

In this domain, a major difficulty is raised by significant variations of human dynamics, which depend not only on the arm posture, but also on the muscular activity (muscular co-contraction) and more generally on the type of task being performed: fine positioning, gross and rapid movements, repeated movements, etc. An ideal comanipulation system should be able of adapting its behavior to the operator's functional intention, resulting in an intuitive assisting device. Toward this goal, we present in this paper first results of our research aimed at developing an instrumented handle mounted on a robot end-effector and held by an operator, that can be used for estimating the grasping force and for adapting the robot controller accordingly. We show first experimental evidences that changes in the grasping force drastically affect the robot controller performances. We thus propose a handle design and a gain scheduling strategy that result in a robot behavior adequate for any kind of grasps. This solution is successfully experimented with a 1 degree of freedom robot under largely variable comanipulation conditions, exhibiting a stable and efficiently adaptive behavior.	adaptive behavior;characteristic impedance;experiment;human dynamics;performance;poor posture;robot control;robot end effector;scheduling (computing)	Xavier Lamy;Frédéric Colledani;Franck Geffard;Yvan Measson;Guillaume Morel	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152294	control engineering;robot end effector;simulation;adaptive control;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	69.11974079653307	-25.39711837231206	118180

Time-domain methods for HNR estimation are problematic because of the difficulty of estimating the period markers for (pathological) voiced speech. Frequency-domain methods encounter the problem of estimating the noise level at harmonic locations. Cepstral techniques have been introduced to supply noise estimates at all frequency locations in the spectrum. A detailed description of cepstral processing is provided in order to motivate its use as a HNR estimator. The action of cepstral low-pass liftering and subsequent Fourier transformation is shown to be analogous to the action of a moving average filter. Based on this description, short-comings of two existing cepstral-based HNRs are illustrated and a new approach is introduced and shown to provide accurate HNR measurements for synthesised glottal and voiced speech waveforms.	cepstrum;level of measurement;low-pass filter;noise (electronics)	Peter J.

Next, the angular velocities and angular accelerations of joints are estimated in real time by the designed Kalman filter. Finally, a control algorithm based on Kalman filter is proposed to enhance the backdrivability of RCM mechanisms by compensating for the internally generated gravitational, frictional and inertial resistances experienced during the positioning and orientating.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnThe parameter identification for RCM mechanisms can be experimentally evaluated from comparison between the measured torques and the reconstructed torques. The accuracy and convergence of the real-time estimation of angular velocity and acceleration of the joint by the designed Kalman filter can be verified from corresponding simulation experiments.

Our method exploits the sparsity of the source expansion coefficients on a time-frequency basis, chosen here to be a MDCT. Conditionally upon an indicator variable which is 0 or 1, one source coefficient is either set to zero or given a Student t prior. Structured priors can be considered for the indicator variables, such as horizontal structures in the time-frequency plane, in order to model temporal persistency. A Gibbs sampler (a standard Markov chain Monte Carlo technique) is used to sample from the posterior distribution of the indicator variables, the source coefficients (corresponding to nonzero indicator variables), the hyperparameters of the Student t priors, the mixing matrix and the variance of the noise. We give results for separation of a musical stereo mixture of 3 sources.	blind signal separation;coefficient;dummy variable (statistics);gibbs sampling;markov chain monte carlo;modified discrete cosine transform;monte carlo method;sampling (signal processing);sparse matrix	Cédric Févotte	2006	2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference		econometrics;pattern recognition;mathematics;blind signal separation;statistics	ML	75.18456039839229	-36.79182563397253	118418

Thus, we have been developed an automatic depressurization motion assistance system for a seated patient on a wheelchair. In our previous work, we developed a sitting surface coordination system which can lift or incline and assists a depressurization motion of a patient. However, in some cases, it is difficult to change his posture suitably for patients who do not have enough physical strength in their upper body using our proposed device. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel posture coordination assistance system for a wheelchair user. Our system consists of the adjustable sitting surface and novel proposed adjustable backrest. These two devices coordinate the sitting posture of the patient automatically. Our key ideas are two topics. One topic is mechanical design of the adjustable backrest for practical use. We realize small mechanism which enables easy implementation to a general wheelchair without special reconstruction. The other topic is a natural posture coordination scheme using the sitting surface and the backrest. We analyze buttocks depressurization operation by a nursing specialist and drive our proposed devices for realizing it. The performance of our system is verified by experiments using our prototype.	experiment;poor posture;prototype	Daisuke Chugo;Kenji Shiotani;Yuki Sakaida;Sho Yokota;Hiroshi Hashimoto	2013	2013 6th International Conference on Human System Interactions (HSI)	10.1109/HSI.2013.6577808	control engineering;simulation;engineering;surgery	Robotics	71.31340721591454	-25.815793931007043	118435

The structure, motion mechanism, and characteristic evaluation of a driving fin used for propulsion have been discussed. The fishlike fin movement can be controlled via frequency adjustments to the alternate magnetic field. Vertical movement of the microrobot can be stopped at a specified location. Experimental results indicate that the microrobot can be controlled upward, downward, and also be suspended in water using frequency adjustments.

We first note that using a Gaussian mixture assumption a compensation algorithm in the log-spectral domain is completely defined by three parameters for each Gaussian component: the noisy speech mean, the noisy speech variance, and the covariance of clean and noisy speech. Starting from a well known mismatch function we propose two new approximations which allow deriving analytical expressions for the above mentioned parameters, and hence develop a new noise compensation algorithm in the log-spectral domain. In addition to theoretical derivations we discuss implementation issues of the proposed method and analyze its computational complexity. Experimental results for digit recognition in the car reveal that the proposed technique significantly outperform the baseline, and first order VTS. For example at 10 db signal to noise ratio the baseline, first order VTS, and the proposed method lead to recognition accuracies 82.6%, 85.5%, and 90.1%. The superiority of the proposed method to VTS can be attributed to the accuracy of the employed approximations. The compensation algorithm is also found to be more accurate and faster than an approximate numerical integration technique.	approximation algorithm;baseline (configuration management);computational complexity theory;noise shaping;numerical analysis;numerical integration;signal-to-noise ratio;speech recognition;vehicle tracking system	Mohamed Afify	2005	IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing	10.1109/TSA.2005.845811	speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;speech processing;mathematics;accuracy and precision;statistics	Vision	81.33649457902618	-32.275166603283736	118618

The mismatch has similar characteristics as robot calibration in industrial settings. Nevertheless, any methods for correcting the mismatch need to meet certain computation and accuracy requirements, which are derived from the constraints of a robot-assisted surgical system. On a virtual reality simulator, we use a haptic device (PHANToM Premium 1.5/6DOF) as the hand controller to actuate a robot-assisted surgical tool via neuroArm - a robotic system in microscopic neurosurgery. Within the workspace of the tool, we have defined the computation and accuracy requirements of correction as 1.0 ms and 30.0 μm, respectively. Towards the correction of the pose mismatch, this current work first assesses the suitability of the Newton-Raphson (NR) method for addressing the position mismatch between the haptic interface point (HIP) of the haptic device and the tooltip of the surgical tool. For fast computation, we have modified the NR method to take advantage of its quadratic rate of convergence. This modification adds a feedback loop for selecting appropriate initial values. As well, we have verified the non-singularities of the workspace where the position mismatch needs to be corrected. Assessed in the workspace of 90 targets, the modified NR method achieves an accuracy between the HIP and the tooltip at about 1.0 μm in less than 64 μs - meeting both requirements of correction. Thus, this work confirms the suitability of the modified NR method to efficiently correct the position mismatch between the HIP and the tooltip on neuroArm.	computation;feedback;haptic technology;newton's method;noise reduction;rate of convergence;requirement;robot calibration;robot end effector;simulation;stylus (computing);tooltip;virtual reality simulator;workspace	Fernando Trejo;Yaoping Hu	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2014.6974193	computer vision;simulation	Robotics	73.03469133522688	-28.401601121236347	120031

Assuming convexity and similarity of mating features, an analytical solution for C-space interior is developed and used to construct the goal region from 2-D features. This method provides a well-defined goal region which allows the computation of the corresponding success probability. Due to the uncertainties in object representation, goal regions are also subject to uncertainties. An approach that shrinks the nominal boundary of a goal region is proposed for computing the expectation of success probabilities. The effects of interference and fine-motion planning on success probabilities are also taken into consideration in order to define theoretical goal regions		Shun-Feng Su;C. S.

First, we analyzed the relationship between the stereotyp- ical trajectory of the human finger and joint torques generated by the muscles, and hypothesized that the motion of the human finger can be divided into two categories: one following a predetermined trajectory and the other changing the trajectory, which is mainly caused by the action of intrinsic muscles. We applied this control method to an anthropomorphic tendon-driven robotic finger and observed the change in motion caused by adjustments in the actuator's pattern, which corresponds to human intrinsic muscles.

Joint stiffness is composed of two components: intrinsic and reflex stiffness. Separating the two stiffness components is difficult because they appear and change together. A number of approaches have been used to distinguish the components, but all these are inherently off-line. We have developed a novel algorithm that estimates the two components of ankle stiffness in real time. Cross-correlations between torque and position, velocity, and acceleration are used to estimate intrinsic stiffness. The reflex torque is then estimated by subtracting the estimated intrinsic components and the reflex stiffness estimated by computing the impulse response function (IRF) between the estimated reflex torque and the half-wave rectified velocity. A novel position perturbation, consisting of pseudo-random pulses of different lengths, is used to eliminate covariance between intrinsic and reflex stiffness estimates. Simulation results showed that the algorithm estimates intrinsic and reflex stiffness very accurately and responds to changes in stiffness in less than 15 s. Validation with experimental data showed that the real-time estimates were in close agreement with the estimates generated by an established off-line intrinsic and reflex stiffness identification algorithm.	algorithm;ankle stiff;computation (action);electronic component;estimated;frequency response;information retrieval facility;muscular stiffness;online and offline;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;pseudorandomness;real-time clock;real-time transcription;reflex action;reflex motion descriptor;simulation;velocity (software development)	Daniel Ludvig;Robert E.

Among the state-of-art tracking technology, passive magnetic tracking using permanent magnets or passive magnetic sources for localization is an effective technology to provide untethered medical instrument tracking without cumbersome wires needed for signal or power transmission. Motivated by practical needs in two medical insertion procedures: Nasogastric intubation and Ventriculostomy, we propose a unified method based on passive magnetic-field localization, for enhanced efficacy and safety.   METHODS Traditional approaches to passive magnetic tracking involve solving the inverse localization problem. Limited by the idealistic magnetic field dipole model and computationally intense nonlinear optimization algorithm, the overall accuracy and computational cost are greatly compromised. The method introduced here features direct localization with artificial neural network (ANN) models that bypasses the need to resolve the inverse problem and is adaptable for a variety of real-time localization and tracking applications.   RESULTS The efficiency of the two methods, the inverse optimization method and the direct ANN method are experimentally evaluated by comparing the estimated position of reference trajectories for typical nasogastric and ventriculostomy insertion paths performed by a dexterous robotic arm which provides ground truth measurement. It was found that within the region of interest (ROI), the direct ANN technique could significantly improve the localization accuracy, with an average experimental localization error of less than 2 mm, while that of the traditional inverse optimization method using a dipole-based mathematical model at greater than 5 mm. Ex-vivo experiments were performed to validate the localization methods in clinical settings.   CONCLUSIONS While the proposed method for passive magnetic tracking requires a procedure-specific pre-procedural calibration, it is able to provide real-time tracking with high accuracy, robustness and diversity. It could be the missing piece to the puzzle to bring passive magnetic tracking technology into practice, therefore leading to untethered medical instrument tracking.

d97ef3649ea66469f2a35acac36e5144d331e20e	controlling exoskeletons with emg signals and a biomechanical body model		This work presents a control system for exoskeletons that ut ilizes electrical signals from the muscles as the main means of information transporta ti n between the human operator and the exoskeleton. Those signals are picked up from the skin on top of selected mu scles and reflect the activation of the observed muscle. They are evaluated by a so phi ticated but simplified biomechanical model of the human body to derive the desired a ction of the operator. A support action is computed in accordance to the desired act ion and is executed by the exoskeleton. The biomechanical model fuses results from different biome chanical and biomedical research groups and performs a sensible simplification considering the intended application. It contains parameters which reflect properti es of the human operator and his or her current body state. A calibration algorithm for th ose parameters is presented which relies exclusively on sensors mounted on the exoskele ton, and provides deep inside into the mechanisms of the model. An exoskeleton for the knee joint support was designed and co structed to verify the model and investigate the interaction between the human operator and the machine in experiments with force support during everyday movement s. Those results are also presented here.	algorithm;control system;electromyography;enea ose;experiment;sensor;text simplification;titanium nitride;xeon phi	Christian Fleischer	2007			engineering;physical therapy;biological engineering	AI	73.09435102798533	-27.72010731694908	121078

3a7e5160a7fabbbb8e363539d9635f403c99679e	enabling two finger virtual grasping on a single grasp 6-dof interface, by using just one force sensor		In this paper, the authors to demonstrate a novel and simple method to enable two finger grasping with one force sensor. 6-DOF haptic interface and a force sensor were used to implement this technique. The haptic device controls the position and orientation of two haptic avatars inside the virtual environment (VE), while the user can control the distance between the avatars by applying force on the attached sensor. In this way the user can locate the object to be manipulated between the pointers. Thus, by adjusting his own grasping pressure, the user can grab and manipulate objects. The two haptic avatars location, orientation and the distance between them is controlled by two 6-DOF virtual couplings. This system allows the user to precisely adjust his grasping to slide or rotate the object while grasping. Contrary to other proposals, instead of using extra actuators to enable grasping, just a force sensor was attached to a desktop 6-DOF interface. We are aware that this configuration is asymmetrical. But, the results of the user's performance manipulation evaluation indicates that the user's manipulation performance was not negatively impacted by the lack of grasping force.	desktop computer;emdebian grip;haptic technology;performance evaluation;pointer (computer programming);sensor;virtual reality	Alfonso Balandra;Virglio Gruppelaar;Hironori Mitake;Shoichi Hasegawa	2017	2017 IEEE World Haptics Conference (WHC)	10.1109/WHC.2017.7989932	computer science;pointer (computer programming);actuator;artificial intelligence;coupling;computer vision;haptic technology;rotation;virtual machine;grasp	Robotics	71.66658284616818	-25.200506430031496	121770

This feedback system is inexpensive, easy to setup and versatile in that it can provide the user with a diverse range of tactile sensations and is suitable for a variety of tasks. We demonstrate the potential of our electro-tactile feedback system by providing experimental results showing how electro-tactile feedback from a tele-operated robotic arm equipped with range sensors can help with avoiding obstacles in cluttered workspace. We also show how interactive tasks, like placing a peg in a hole, can be facilitated with electro-tactile feedback from force sensors.	feedback;haptic technology;remote control;robot;robot end effector;robotic arm;sensor;television;transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation;workspace	Daniel S.

Advancing recent work on rolling indenters [1], the sensor proposed here makes use of a rigid sphere which is held at the end of a tubular shaft and pressed against the tissue by a stream of air. Variations in tissue stiffness result in movements of the sphere within the shaft and are picked up by an optical system. The new approach allows virtually frictionless motion of the sphere across the tissuepsilas surface and rapid acquisition of tactile information over large areas of soft tissue. The structure and working principles of this new air-cushion tactile sensor are described. Laboratory experiments are conducted to show the feasibility and illustrate the behaviour of the proposed sensor system. The outcome of the conducted experiments shows the potential of the sensor system.	experiment;haptic technology;image resolution;modeling language;resonance;robot;rolling hash;tactile sensor;video-in video-out	Dinusha Zbyszewski;Arkapravo Bhaumik;Kaspar Althoefer;Lakmal D.

Joint stiffness arises from both intrinsic and reflex mechanisms, but the torques due to these mechanisms cannot be measured separately experimentally, since they appear and change together. Therefore, the direct estimation of the intrinsic and reflex stiffnesses is difficult. In this paper, we present a new, two-step procedure to estimate the intrinsic and reflex components of ankle stiffness. In the first step, a discrete-time, subspace-based method is used to estimate a state-space model for overall stiffness from the measured overall torque and then predict the intrinsic and reflex torques. In the second step, continuous-time models for the intrinsic and reflex stiffnesses are estimated from the predicted intrinsic and reflex torques. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm estimates the intrinsic and reflex stiffnesses accurately. The new subspace-based algorithm has three advantages over previous algorithms: 1) It does not require iteration, and therefore, will always converge to an optimal solution; 2) it provides better estimates for data with high noise or short sample lengths; and 3) it provides much more accurate results for data acquired under the closed-loop conditions, that prevail when subjects interact with compliant loads.	algorithm;angularjs;ankle stiff;articular system;body position;cns disorder;cascade device component;compliance behavior;computer simulation;converge;estimated;experiment;facet joint structure;failure;interaction;intrinsic function;iteration;joint stiffness;muscle;nervous system structure;nonlinear system;operating point;perturbation theory;physical activity;poor posture;reflex (building design software);reflex action;servo device component;state space;subgroup;temporomandibular joint disorders	Yong Zhao;David T.

We present and describe the concept of human navigational habituation which we define as the human habituation to repetitively riding a robotic wheelchair. The approach models habituation in terms of preferred linear velocity based on the experience of riding a wheelchair. We argue that preferred velocity changes as the human gets used to riding on the wheelchair. Inexperienced users initially prefer to ride at a slow moderate pace, however the longer they ride they prefer to speed up to a certain comfort level and find initial slower velocities to be tediously “too slow” for their experience level. The proposed habituation model provides passenger preferred velocity based on experience. Human biological measurements, galvanic skin conductance, and participant feedback demonstrate the preference for habituation velocity control over fixed velocity control. To our knowledge habituation modeling is new in the field of autonomous navigation and robotics.	angularjs;autonomous robot;conductance (graph);electroencephalography;electromyography;experience;galvanic isolation;nonlinear system;robotics;velocity (software development)	Luis Yoichi Morales Saiki;Jamilah A.

So many algorithms based on sparse in some signal representation domain, mostly in Time-Frequency (t-ƒ) domain, are proposed in recent years. However, constrained by window effects and t-ƒ resolution, these algorithms can not have good performances in many cases. Considering most of signals in real world are band-limited signals, a new method based on sub-band division are proposed in this paper. Sensing signals are divided into different sub-bands by Complementary filters first. Then, classical Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithms are applied in each sub-band. Next, the mixing matrix is estimated with cluster analysis algorithms based on each sub-band's estimation of mixing matrix. And last, the sub-band signals are recovered using the estimated mixing matrix and the resource signals are reconstructed by combining the related sub-band signals together. This method could recover the source signals if active sources at any sub-band does not exceed that of sensors. This is also a well mixing matrix estimating algorithm. Finally, computer simulation confirms the validity and good separating performance of this method.	blind signal separation;source separation	Tao Feng;Li-dong Zhu	2011		10.1109/ChinaCom.2011.6158188	speech recognition;computer science;pattern recognition;blind signal separation;statistics	Vision	82.102430125124	-37.83384308547449	123050

It will not only reduce the machining error range but also meet the following two constraints: (a) The ball end of the milling tool is tangential to the constraint surface; (b) There is no overcut and theminimum error is zero, which is called nonnegative-error constraint. The two constraints are very useful in some situations of engineering applications, such as flankmilling impeller blades. Based on the proposed method, two types of cutter will be used to generate tool paths for the same designed surface and constraint surface.

However, due to non-stationary noise, undesired physical vibration from the musical instruments, the robust estimation of F0 remains a main challenge. In this paper, a F0 estimation algorithm of music signals based on harmonic pattern match (HPM) is described to achieve more reliable estimation accuracy. The algorithm utilizes the autocorrelation both in the time domain and in the frequency domain, exploiting the spectrum subset to guide the search of F0 candidates (FCs), and an efficient mechanism to evaluate the match between each FC and the harmonic pattern of the input signal. The harmonic pattern of the measured spectrum is presented by sub-pitch in each segmented sub-band. Finally, the estimated is selected to best match the sub-pitches under a weighting strategy. Evaluation experiments were performed over a musical instruments database consisting of single pitched notes and the viability of the HPM algorithm was demonstrated to be competitive with several other F0 estimators.

The probe-patient contact force can be held constant to improve image stability, swept through a range, or cycled. The mechanical portion of the device consists of a ball screw linear actuator driven by a servo motor, along with a load cell, accelerometer, and limit switches. The performance of the system was assessed in terms of the frequency response to simulated sonographer hand motion and in hand-held image feature tracking during simulated patient motion. The system was found to attenuate contact force variation by 97% at 0.1 Hz, 83% at 1 Hz, and 33% 10 Hz, a range that spans the typical human hand tremor frequency spectrum. In studies with 15 human operators, the device applied the target contact force with ten times less variation than in conventional ultrasound imaging. An ergonomic, human-in-the-loop, imaging-workflow enhancing control scheme, which combines both force- and position-control, permits smooth making and breaking of probe-patient contact, and helps the operator keep the probe centered within its range of motion. By controlling ultrasound probe contact force and consequently the amount of tissue deformation, the system enhances the repeatability, usability, and diagnostic capabilities of ultrasound imaging.	adobe freehand;control system;feature (computer vision);frequency response;human factors and ergonomics;human interface device;medical imaging;medical ultrasound;mobile device;motion estimation;network switch;repeatability;servo;spectral density;usability	Matthew W.

The human voice may be a part of singing voice in a song or it may be a part of some news broadcasted by a channel and contains background music. The final outcome of this work would be a file containing only vocals. Stereo audio is considered for separation in this advance approach. The signal is processed in time frequency domain. In this method of blind source separation the input stereo audio file is processed in the form of frames, then windowed and in last Short time Fourier transform (STFT) is applied on signal. The signal is masked for de-mixing purpose using independent layers of time frequency filters (TFF). A mask is defined for each layer based upon filtering technique. One of the filtering techniques is Pan TFF and the other is inter-channel phase difference TFF. Filtering helps to select STFT coefficients that are estimated as a part of vocals and makes the rest of them zero. After coefficient selection the signal is reconstructed by overlap add (OLA) method to get the final output signal containing only vocals.	algorithm;beneath a steel sky;blind signal separation;coefficient;filter (signal processing);linear predictive coding;mel scale;mel-frequency cepstrum;overlap–add method;short-time fourier transform;sound card;source separation;spectrogram;time to first fix;unix signal;vii;websphere optimized local adapters;window function	Munaza Razzaq;Mehmoona Gul;Zunaib Ali;Qurat-ul Ain;Yasir Malik	2016	2016 International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology (FIT)	10.1109/FIT.2016.062	speech recognition;acoustics;computer science;communication	Robotics	82.19095652306885	-34.66706105851461	124209

The frame is 3D-printed in one piece including the joints. Apart from saving assembly time, this enables parametrization of the link sizes in order to adapt it to the patient's hand and reduce joint misalignment. The joint angles are determined using Hall effect sensors. They measure the change of the magnetic field of in the joints integrated magnets achieving an average accuracy of 1.25 °. Tendons attached to the finger tips transmit forces from motors. The armature current, which is proportional to the force transmitting tendons is measured using a shunt and controlled by a custom-made current-limiter circuit. Preliminary experiments with a force/torque-sensor showed high linearity and accuracy with a root mean square error of 0.5937 N in comparison to the corresponding forces derived from the motor torque constant.	3d printing;actuation dosing unit;armature (computer animation);articular system;assembly language;cerebrovascular accident;current limiting;displacement mapping;encoder device component;experiment;friction;hall effect sensor;lopes (exoskeleton);limiter device component;magnet <device>;magnetic resonance imaging;mean squared error;movement;patients;performance evaluation;psychologic displacement;root mean square;routing;stroke rehabilitation;tendon structure;transmitter;virtual reality therapy;exoskeleton	Patrick Weiss;Lars Heyer;Thomas F.

The authors analyze some specific properties of this GTFR and compare them to other TFRs. Asymptotically, the GTFR is shown to produce results identical to that of the spectrogram for stationary signals. Interference terms normally present in many GTFRs are shown to be attenuated drastically by the use of the ZAM-GTFR. The ability of the ZAM-GTFR to track frequency hopping is shown to be close to that of the Wigner distribution. When a signal is subjected to white noise, the ZAM-GTFR produces an unbiased estimate of the ZAM-GTFR of the signal without noise. In many other GTFRs, the power spectral density of the noise is superimposed on the GTFR of the signal. It is also shown that, in discrete form, the ZAM-GTFR is generally invertible. >	kernel (operating system)	Seho Oh;Robert J. Marks	1992	IEEE Trans.

b1697c90f379fe799a7aff041f60992b7a538bee	decentralised compliant control for hexapod robots : a stick insect based walking model		This thesis aims to transfer knowledge from insect biology i nto a hexapod walking robot. The similarity of the robot model to the biological ta rget allows the testing of hypotheses regarding control and behavioural strategies i n the insect. Therefore, this thesis supports biorobotic research by demonstrating that robotic implementations are improved by using biological strategies and these models ca n be used to understand biological systems. Specifically, this thesis addresses tw o central problems in hexapod walking control: the single leg control mechanism and its co ntr l variables; and the different roles of the front, middle and hind legs that allow a decentralised architecture to co-ordinate complex behavioural tasks. To investigate t hese problems, behavioural studies on insect curve walking were combined with quantita tive simulations. Behavioural experiments were designed to explore the contr ol of turns of freely walking stick insects,Carausius morosus , toward a visual target. A program for insect tracking and kinematic analysis of observed motion w as developed. The results demonstrate that the front legs are responsible for mo st of the body trajectory. Nonetheless, to replicate insect walking behaviour it is ne cessary for all legs to contribute with specific roles. Additionally, statistics on le g stepping show that middle and hind legs continuously influence each other. This cannot be explained by previous models that heavily depend on positive feedback controller s. After careful analysis, it was found that the hind legs could actively rotate the body wh ile t e middle legs move to the inside of the curve, tangentially to the body axis. The single leg controller is known to be independent from oth er legs but still capable of mechanical synchronisation. To explain this behavio ur positive feedback controllers have been proposed. This mechanism works for the cl osed kinematic chain problem, but has complications when implemented in a dynami c model. Furthermore, neurophysiological data indicate that legs always respond t disturbances as a negative feedback controller. Additional experimental data presen ted herein indicates that legs continuously oppose forces created by other legs. This thes is proposes a model that has a velocity positive feedback control modulated via a subord ination variable in cascade with a position negative feedback mechanism as the core cont roller. This allows legs to oppose external and internal forces without compromisin g inter-leg collaboration for walking. The single leg controller is implemented using a distributed artificial neural network. This network was trained with a wider range of mo vement to that so far found in the simulation model.

This paper examines how stability can be evaluated in human movements, and possible mechanisms by which humans ensure stability. First, a measure of stability is introduced, which is simple to apply to human movements and corresponds to Lyapunov exponents. Its application to real data shows that it is able to distinguish effectively between stable and unstable dynamics. A computational model is then used to investigate stability in human arm movements, which takes into account motor output variability and computes the force to perform a task according to an inverse dynamics model. Simulation results suggest that even a large time delay does not affect movement stability as long as the reflex feedback is small relative to muscle elasticity. Simulations are also used to demonstrate that existing learning schemes, using a monotonic antisymmetric update law, cannot compensate for unstable dynamics. An impedance compensation algorithm is introduced to learn unstable dynamics, which produces similar adaptation responses to those found in experiments.	acclimatization;algorithm;broadcast delay;characteristic impedance;computation;computational model;computer simulation;control theory;elasticity (data store);experiment;heart rate variability;inverse dynamics;lyapunov fractal;motion compensation;movement;numerical stability;reflex motion descriptor;unstable medical device problem;muscle elasticity	Etienne Burdet;Keng Peng Tee;Iven M.

In order to allow safe human-robot interaction, a methodology to evaluate the severity of an impact between a human worker and an industrial robot, based on related work on injury knowledge in human-robot contacts and relying on information coming from different exteroceptive sensors, has been developed in this paper. On the basis of this severity evaluation, the robot controller enforces a suitable safety-oriented strategy, ranging from on-path speed reduction to task-consistent evasive motion and protective stop. The safety evaluation methodology has been implemented in a dedicated software component, integrated with a video surveillance system and with the real time robot controller to obtain a complete HW/SW architecture named “Safety Controller”. The system has been validated on an ABB IRB140 robot.	closed-circuit television;component-based software engineering;experiment;human–robot interaction;industrial robot;real-time control system;real-time clock;sensor	Matteo Ragaglia;Luca Bascetta;Paolo Rocco;Andrea Maria Zanchettin	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907005	control engineering;mobile robot;embedded system;simulation;engineering;robot control;personal robot	Robotics	71.46159480804108	-25.406950124669606	124822

The current surgical setup of cochlear implant surgery is briefly reviewed and its limitations are highlighted. In an effort to reduce trauma to the structure of the cochlea, the kinematics and path planning for novel cochlear steerable electrodes are developed to minimize the interaction forces between the electrode and the cochlea. An experimental robotic system is used to compare the electrode insertion forces of steerable implants with those of nonsteerable electrodes. The results of these experiments show about 70% reduction in the insertion forces when steerable electrodes are used with our proposed path planning and control. A distance metric explaining this reduction in the insertion force is defined and experimentally validated. Although this is only a preliminary study, we believe that these results provide a strong indication to the potential of robot-assisted cochlear implant surgery to provide a significant reduction in trauma rates during cochlear implant surgery.	automated planning and scheduling;brain implant;clinical act of insertion;cochlear implant;decompression sickness;experiment;experimental system;gene distance metric;insertion mutation;mathematical model;mathematics;motion planning;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;preparation;procedure implants:finding:point in time:^patient:narrative;robot;television;wounds and injuries;algorithm;benefit;electrode	Jian Zhang;Kai Xu;Nabil Simaan;Spiros Manolidis	2006	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

Geometric dimensions of the patient's forearm are measured using a stereo camera and infrared reflecting markers. Surfaces are generated using Delaunay's Triangulation and converted into an STL -file for 3D printing in order to be a more compatible design and produce a swift development of custom-fit exoskeleton structures. This paper summarizes the design steps of individualized structures that could be implemented in future exoskeleton designs. The fitting accuracy was compared to that of non-individualized shells by applying an 8 kg weight onto the worn shells. Results showed a significantly larger pressure distribution and lower maximum pressure among individualized shells compared to non-individualized shells, which results in a 5% higher tolerance to applied pressure of the exoskeleton.	3d printing;3d scanner;delaunay triangulation;human factors and ergonomics;point cloud;printed circuit board;rapid prototyping;robot;spatial variability;stereo camera;swift (programming language);thickness (graph theory);wearable computer	Samuel M.

In this paper, a novel signal analysis method referred to as cyclic correntropy is proposed to deal with cyclostationary signals under impulsive noise environment based on kernel methods. Furthermore, the cyclic correntropy spectrum is also defined. The application in frequency estimation is presented to illustrate the advantages of the cyclic correntropy over the second-order and the fractional lower-order cyclic statistics based methods in the presence of α-stable impulsive noise.

Manipulation and assembly at the micro scale is a critical issue in a diverse of industries as the trend for miniaturization continues. We are also witnessing a proliferation of biomedical applications that require precise manipulation of delicate living material. However, there are many problems and uncertainties encountered when working at the micro scale. There is therefore a dependence on human interaction for reduction of this uncertainty. There is an urgent need to reduce this dependency or at lease enhance the performance of operators in tasks which are unsuitable for automation. Many promising businesses in the biomedical sector are struggling due to problems of yield and productivity, whereas in the MEMS industry devices never leave the research laboratories because the practicalities of manufacture remain unsolved.	servo	Rajagopalan Devanathan;Sun Wenting;Chin Teck Chai;Andrew P.

The system mainly includes two haptic devices (PHANTOM Omni), an advanced inertial sensor (MTx) and a computer. The inertial sensor is used to get the real-time orientation of one of the manipulator's hands, and the haptic devices are used to get the real-time positions of the manipulator's two hands and generate the appropriate forces that act on the two hands. We have built a virtual force model to get the accurate magnitude and orientation of the forces. With the change of the position and orientation of the manipulator's hands, the magnitude and orientation of the forces will change accordingly. The manipulator operates the styluses of the two haptic devices to control the position and orientation of the virtual object m, so that it can track the virtual object m′, which moves and rotates randomly in 4 degree-of-freedoms (DOF). It is expected to improve the agility and strength of manipulator's hands in this way. Furthermore, one hand can be used to assist the other one in the rehabilitation, so the self-assistance character is included in the system. The advantages of high safety, compaction and self-assistance will make the system suitable for home rehabilitation.	virtual reality	Gang Song;Shuxiang Guo	2006	I. J.

Improvement on physical performance of robots is a fundamental issue. Backdrivability is a key mechanical feature of actuators that enables robust and stable interaction of robots with environment. We developed a humanoid robot HYDRA with backdrivable hydraulic actuators. Parallel mechanism is used extensively in multi-DOF joints to efficiently use actuator force. In this paper, mechanical structure of Hydra with backdrivability and mechanical strength is treated. Also, realtime control of hydraulic actuators that utilize backdrivability, and realtime control of robot joint systems with parallel kinematic chains are explained.	humanoid robot	Hiroshi Kaminaga;Tianyi Ko;Ryo Masumura;Mitsuo Komagata;Shunsuke Sato;Satoshi Yorita;Yoshihiko Nakamura	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-50115-4_57	humanoid robot;robot control	Robotics	69.55882313456391	-24.6339999520752	127715
811946782c55419f998cc1b55e2bbee02e74c2b1	gramophone noise reconstruction - a comparative study of interpolation algorithms for noise reduction		Gramophone records have been the main recording medium for seven decades and regained widespread popularity over the past few years. Records are susceptible to noise caused by scratches and other mishandlings, often making the listening experience unpleasant. This paper analyses and compares twenty different interpolation algorithms for the reconstruction of noisy samples, categorized into duplication and trigonometric approaches, polynomials and time series models. A dataset of 800 songs divided amongst eight different genres were used to benchmark the algorithms. It was found that the ARMA model performs best over all genres. Cosine interpolation has the lowest computational time, with the AR model achieving the most effective interpolation for a limited time span. It was also found that less volatile genres such as classical, country, rock and jazz music is easier to reconstruct than more unstable electronic, metal, pop and reggae audio signals.	algorithm;autoregressive model;benchmark (computing);categorization;computation;control theory;noise reduction;polynomial;time complexity;time series;whittaker–shannon interpolation formula	Christoph F.

However, the lack of haptic feedback in these robotic systems using long teleoperated instruments has negatively affected the surgeon's ability to palpate tissue and diagnose it as healthy or unhealthy. This paper describes our design of a modular, automated laparoscopic grasper with tri-directional force measurement capability. The grasper can measure normal grasping forces, as well as, sideways manipulation forces during grasping and palpation tasks. Additionally, a modular design allows for easy conversion between surgical modalities (e.g., grasping, cutting, and dissecting). Calibration of the force sensors and initial testing of the prototype has shown its ability to accurately measure tool-tissue interaction forces.	experiment;haptic technology;jaws scripting language;modular design;prototype;remote manipulator;resistive touchscreen;robot end effector;robotic arm;sensor;triangular function	Gregory Tholey;Jaydev P.

This model uses an iterative analysis-by-synthesis procedure to estimate the sinusoidal parameters {amplitudes, frequencies, and phases}. However, one drawback of this model is that the analysis frame length is generally fixed in analyzing the signal. As a result, since each sinusoidal parameter has different frequencies, an analysis frame with fixed length cannot an optimal spectral resolution to each sinusoidal parameter. In this paper, in order to overcome this drawback and to estimate sinusoidal parameter more accurately, an AbS/OLA sinusoidal model using an elliptic filter is presented and evaluated against the performance of conventional AbS/OLA sinusoidal model. Our proposed AbS/OLA sinusoidal model is found to achieve better performance, in terms of spectral characteristics, phase characteristics, and the synthetic speech quality, than conventional model.	elliptic filter;websphere optimized local adapters	Kihong Kim;Jinkeun Hong;Jongin Lim	2005		10.1007/11508069_19	natural frequency;speech recognition;systems modeling;uncertainty;telecommunications;audio signal processing;filter;computer science;audio signal;speech coding;signal processing;iterative method;fundamental frequency;spectral resolution	Robotics	81.05640435793393	-32.134333914219326	128168

Passive air flow fields, previously introduced by the authors generate force fields through the linear superposition of logarithmically varying radial potential fields. The main advantage of these fields is that they are realizable through very simple actuation. However, they do not lend themselves to analytical prediction of net forces or equilibria. This paper presents an efRcient means of numerically computing the net force and moment exerted by such fields on objects composed of multiple simple shapes, as well as efficient means of finding equilibrium points on these fields.	force field (chemistry);numerical analysis;radial (radio);superposition principle;tom clancy's net force	Hyungpil Moon;Jonathan E.

As a consequence, recovering the underlying spectral envelope (SE) becomes particularly difficult in high-pitched voices, where estimates using several conventional approaches are known to be contaminated by harmonics. To overcome such issues, this letter proposes to reconstruct inter-harmonics by a simple weigthed time-domain multiplication. Usual SE estimation methods can then be applied on the resulting signal. Both our objective and subjective experiments show that the proposed method provides similar or slightly better results when compared to more sophisticated approaches like true envelope or cubic spline interpolation between the harmonics. However, contrary to these latter techniques, its computational load is very low thanks to its simplicity.	chroma subsampling;computation;cubic hermite spline;cubic function;experiment;matlab;preprocessor;spline interpolation;stellar classification;transfer function	Thomas Drugman;Yannis Stylianou	2014	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2014.2338399	linear predictive coding;speech recognition;mathematics	Vision	80.47055451292574	-34.264504071996434	129525

Safety of a robot arm can be achieved by either active or passive compliance system. Since active compliance systems with actuators are usually slow and expensive, several passive compliance systems with purely mechanical elements are proposed. Passive systems can provide faster response to collision and higher reliability than active systems. Since both positioning accuracy and collision safety are equally important, a robot arm should have very low stiffness when subjected to a collision force greater than the one causing human injury, but maintain very high stiffness otherwise. In order to implement these requirements, a safe joint mechanism composed of a linear spring, slider-crank mechanism, and 4-bar linkage is proposed in this research. Various experiments on static and dynamic collisions show high stiffness of the SJM against an external force of less than the pre-determined threshold force, but an abrupt drop in the stiffness when the external force exceeds this threshold, which guarantees positioning accuracy and collision safety.	crank (person);experiment;humanoid robot;linkage (software);requirement;robotic arm	Hwi-Su Kim;Jung-Jun Park;Jae-Bok Song	2008	Humanoids 2008 - 8th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots	10.1109/ICHR.2008.4755934	simulation;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	70.66550949161878	-24.660465871306734	129745

In this paper, a new method of Double-Talk Detection (DTD) for Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC), based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), is proposed. Usually, the performances of the AEC, which is based on adaptive filtering, degrade seriously in the presence of speech issued from the near-end speaker (double-talk). Then, Double Talk Detection system must be added to AEC, for controlling the adaptation of the adaptive filter coefficients. For this purpose, we introduce the SVD of the far-end signal for detecting the double-talk periods. The obtained results, using TIMIT database, show that the proposed method outperforms the classical Geigel algorithm and Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) algorithm.	acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive filter;algorithm;coefficient;cross-correlation;echo suppression and cancellation;loudspeaker;microphone;neural correlates of consciousness;performance;sensor;singular value decomposition;timit	Mahfoud Hamidia;Abderrahmane Amrouche	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6655323	loudspeaker;adaptive filter;speech recognition;computer science;singular value decomposition	Robotics	82.79777631611839	-34.68399555903851	129985

These applications involving Doppler signals require the accurate estimation of the IWMF over short durations of the signal due to its nonstationarity. The traditional short-time Fourier transform (STFT) method requires stationarity of the signal during a finite window, making it inaccurate to analyze signals having relatively wide bandwidths that change rapidly with time. In order to accurately estimate the Doppler IWMF waveform, even when the temporal flow velocity is rapid (high nonstationarity), we extract the Doppler IWMF waveform from the time–frequency distribution estimated using the matching pursuit (MP) with stochastic time–frequency dictionaries in the present study. Because of its local adaptivity to transient structures, the MP algorithm provides a remarkably compact time–frequency description and high time–frequency resolution of a signal. A comparative evaluation has been made between the classic (STFT-based) and the MP-based algorithms. Experimental results indicate that the Doppler IWMF waveform estimated using the MP with stochastic dictionaries is more accurate than that based on the STFT. & 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This allows us to construct a novel algorithm for accurate frictional contact resolution based on a simple staggered sequence of projections. The algorithm accelerates performance using warm starts to leverage the potentially high temporal coherence between contact states and provides users with direct control over frictional accuracy. Applying this algorithm to rigid and deformable systems, we obtain robust and accurate simulations of frictional contact behavior not previously possible, at rates suitable for interactive haptic simulations, as well as large-scale animations. By construction, the proposed algorithm guarantees exact, velocity-level contact constraint enforcement and obtains long-term stable and robust integration. Examples are given to illustrate the performance, plausibility and accuracy of the obtained solutions.	algorithm;coherence (physics);collision detection;computer performance;fixed-point arithmetic;fixed-point property;haptic technology;long-term support;pin grid array;plausibility structure;simulation;velocity (software development)	Danny M.

193b11e5b0fd24afb17a1f43443a16af4e82d769	monaural speaker segregation using group delay spectral matrix factorization	delays training speech matrix decomposition vectors speech recognition equations	Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) methods have been widely used in single channel speaker separation. NMF methods use the magnitude of the Fourier transform for training the basis vectors. In this paper, a method that factorizes the spectral magnitude matrix obtained from the group delay function (GDF) is described. During training, pre-learning is applied on a training set of original sources. The bases are trained iteratively to minimize the approximation error. Separation of the mixed speech signal involves the factorization of the non negative group delay spectral matrix along with the use of fixed stacked bases computed during training. This matrix is then decomposed into a linear combination of trained bases for each individual speaker contained in the mixed speech signal. The estimated spectral magnitude for each speaker signal is modulated by the phase of mixed signal to reconstruct signal for each speaker signal. The separated speaker signals are further refined using a min-max masking method. Experiments on subjective evaluation, objective evaluation and multi speaker speech recognition on the TIMIT and the GRID corpus indicate reasonable improvements over other conventional methods.	approximation error;basis (linear algebra);experiment;geographic data files;group delay and phase delay;maxima and minima;mixed-signal integrated circuit;modulation;non-negative matrix factorization;quasiperiodicity;speech recognition;timit;test set;word error rate	Karan Nathwani;Anurag Kumar;Rajesh Mahanand Hegde	2014	2014 Twentieth National Conference on Communications (NCC)	10.1109/NCC.2014.6811319	speech recognition;pattern recognition;mathematics;communication	ML	82.22791981833733	-35.924832507006975	132109

This paper presents a planning algorithm designed to improve cooperative robot behaviour concerning human comfort during forceful human-robot physical interaction. Particularly, we are interested in planning for object grasping and positioning ensuring not only stability against the exerted human force but also empowering the robot with capabilities to address and improve human experience and comfort. Herein, comfort is addressed as both the muscular activation level required to exert the cooperative task, and the human spatial perception during the interaction, namely, the peripersonal space. By maximizing both comfort criteria, the robotic system can plan for the task (ensuring grasp stability) and for the human (improving human comfort). We believe this to be a key element to achieve intuitive and fluid human-robot interaction in real applications. Real HRI drilling and cutting experiments illustrated the efficiency of the proposed planner in improving overall comfort and HRI experience without compromising grasp stability.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;computer multitasking;experiment;fundamental interaction;human–robot interaction;mathematical optimization;robot;simulation;while	Lipeng Chen;Luis F.

This approach stands in contrast to many adaptive time-frequency representations in the existing literature, which, while more flexible than standard fixed-resolution approaches, typically fail to provide for efficient reconstruction and often lack the regular structure necessary for precise frame-theoretic analysis. Our main technical contributions come through the development of properties which ensure that our superposition construction provides for a numerically stable, invertible signal representation. Our primary algorithmic contributions come via the introduction and discussion of two signal adaptation schemes based on greedy selection and dynamic programming, respectively. We conclude with two short enhancement examples that serve to highlight potential applications of our approach.	dynamic programming;frequency analysis;greedy algorithm;numerical stability;overlap–add method;short-time fourier transform;superposition principle;theory;time complexity	Daniel Rudoy;Prabahan Basu;Patrick J.

The “patient-cooperative” approaches are able to detect patient's voluntary efforts and allow patients to actively influence a gait pattern during rehabilitation processes. The impedance control method is a key technique of “patient-cooperative” strategies that allows deviating desired trajectories by sensing interaction torque. This paper introduces an indirect drive gait training rehabilitation robot system which composed of timing belt and harmonic drive transmissions. We present compensation methods and investigate reaction torque observer (ROB) for estimating patient/robot interaction torque and its application in force/torque sensorless impedance control of patient-cooperative strategy in gait rehabilitation.	characteristic impedance;experiment;motion compensation;optimal control;prototype;robot	Quoc Van Tran;Sehun Kim;Kyunghwan Lee;Sungchul Kang;Jeha Ryu	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2015.7222611	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory;torque motor	Robotics	70.44004117036859	-26.500342301923066	132216

These operations require a delicate and dexterous control e.g. in handling radioactive isotopes irradiated in tray rod facilities of high flux research reactors. To achieve a dexterous man-in-the-loop control, the interaction forces of slave arm with the environment must be sensed and reflected back to the master arm. Due to very high radiation levels, normal Force-Torque sensors cannot be used at the end effector of the slave manipulator to sense these interaction forces. Hence a sensor less force reflection scheme is required. Sensor-less force reflection utilizing the joint motor current enhances the effect of friction and results in a non-linear force reflection to the master arm causing more fatigue and poor dexterity. This paper discusses a scheme for dexterous control using friction compensated sensor-less force feedback in systems with friction and backlash. The proposed scheme has been implemented on a 1-dof master slave setup and the results, showing the efficacy of the scheme, have been presented. A novel method for sensorless estimation and control of joint motor current (and hence torque) is also presented.	haptic technology;master/slave (technology);nonlinear system;robot end effector;sensor;servo;torque	Surendra Singh Saini;Ushnish Sarkar;Debashish Datta Ray	2013		10.1145/2506095.2506138	simulation	Robotics	74.85871406013483	-25.719075267908103	132399

Osteolysis typically occurs due to wear of the polyethylene liner of the acetabular implant after total hip replacement surgery. In less invasive treatment of osteolysis, surgeons conventionally use rigid tools to debride the lesion, however with these inflexible instruments, complex lesion shapes are not completely treatable (about 50%). To address this issue, we have developed a debriding tool that passes through the lumen of a continuum dexterous manipulator (CDM). Integration of the CDM with a robotic arm assists the surgeon to reach the desired region behind the implant. Performance of the debriding tool integrated with this system was quantitatively evaluated during a simulated robot-assisted lesion debriding scenario. Rotational speed, aspiration pressure and irrigation flow of the debriding tool, as well as the sweeping velocity of the robotic system were identified as effective parameters in this procedure. Results indicate that maximum efficiency of the tool is achievable in a particular combination of these parameters.	apache continuum;elegant degradation;robot;robotic arm;trionic;velocity (software development)	Farshid Alambeigi;Shahriar Sefati;Ryan J.

When controlling humanoid robotic hand has data glove, the movement of robot hand appeared to be rigid because of the lack of touch telepresence. The movement of humanoid robot hand would be more flexible if tactile equipment was installed on data glove. There are two important requirements in tactile equipment of data glove, that is to say the structure of equipment must be compact. Too much complexity would lower the reliability of data glove, on the other hand, and the equipment must simulate the touch telepresence as actual as possible, which would influence the realness of the operation directly. In order to balance the structure of the data glove and the realness of tactile simulation, a new system that could build tactile telepresence between robot hand and human hand has been designed and manufactured, including a data glove and a humanoid robot hand. The data glove has 12 attitude transducers on the back and 14 groups of silica gel electrodes to irritate human hand by electrical pulses and simulate the touch telepresence. The humanoid robot hand use cord to transmit the motion which has 13 servo to control the movement of each joint accurately and 14 accurate pressure sensor to assess the grab situation.	humanoid robot;real-time transcription;requirement;sensor;servo;simulation;transducer;wired glove	Yixin Wang;Wenzeng Zhang	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2015.7418786	control engineering;computer vision;simulation;engineering;humanoid robot;force;quantum mechanics	Robotics	75.98184144844663	-24.556079553016378	132951

Today, industry demands on flexible production sometimes require significant changes in location, orientation and configuration of industrial robots and other moving devices, when new products are introduced. All these changes pose a threat to the devices to collide while sharing workspace. Although the use of simulation software to facilitate these changes is gaining popularity, the coordination of collision-free flexible manufacturing systems is still at best a semi-manual trial-and-error procedure. To avoid this, a formal model of the operations in a manufacturing system is generated, and for each operation state a corresponding 3D simulation shape is created. A collision-free system is then achieved by considering pairs of colliding shapes as forbidden states. The automatic generation also includes a synthesis procedure, where a non-blocking and controllable supervisor is generated based on guard generation. The guards are computed by binary decision diagrams, which means that complex systems can be handled, still generating comprehensible restrictions that are easily included in PLC-code.	binary decision diagram;blocking (computing);complex systems;decision problem;industrial robot;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;non-blocking algorithm;semiconductor industry;simulation software;usability;workspace	Mohammad Reza Shoaei;Bengt Lennartson;Sajed Miremadi	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/COASE.2010.5584539	control engineering;simulation;engineering;engineering drawing	Robotics	69.09636918821042	-32.92468573488742	133935

Robotic assistants can help to push beyond the current state of practice by integrating imaging and robot-assisted tools. This paper demonstrates control of a handheld tremor reduction micromanipulator with visual servo techniques, aiding the operator by providing three behaviors: snap-to, motion-scaling, and standoff-regulation. A stereo camera setup viewing the workspace under high magnification tracks the tip of the micromanipulator and the desired target object being manipulated. Individual behaviors activate in task-specific situations when the micromanipulator tip is in the vicinity of the target. We show that the snap-to behavior can reach and maintain a position at a target with an accuracy of 17.5 ± 0.4µm Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) distance between the tip and target. Scaling the operator's motions and preventing unwanted contact with non-target objects also provides a larger margin of safety.	anatomic structures;behavior;handheld game console;image scaling;large;mean squared error;microsurgery;motion;physical object;plant roots;preparation;robot;servo device component;stereo camera;test scaling;track (course);tremor;visual servoing;workspace;micromanipulator	Brian C.

0f9791bcbb86e96f2d9c097fac75c2791b5dc27b	a reference augmentation design for the adaptive control of a wearable assist robot powered by the mckibben actuator		This paper focuses on the control system design for a wearable power assist device which provides force/torque support for people who are doing physically demanding tasks. The device is actuated by the McKibben artificial muscle. The McKibben actuator is know to exhibit high nonlinearity between the supply pressure and the contractile length, and it is basically difficult to design a high performance controller. The present study proposes the use of the Minimal Controller Synthesis algorithm to design a high performance controller for the actuator. The user's joint angular velocity, angular acceleration and the contact force exerted by the user to the frame are fed to the proposed controller to improve the response of the device to the human motion input while providing adequate assist force.

Motor information is calculated by mapping motioncapture data on to a musculoskeletal human model. Neural information represents the set of motor information on the muscles innervated by the arbitrary spinal cord segment.

Existence of inertia for example makes it impossible for the actuators to react immediately. A throwing mechanism (with electric motors) is composed of two inertias (object and motor) that decreases the performance of the system and can not be overcome with software control. But, we can use other elements (like a spring) to make the motor inertia a benefit to improve the performance of the system. Moreover, when the object is directly connected to the motor, the maximum velocity that the object can achieve is limited to the maximum velocity that can be provided by the motor. Previous research shows that passive dynamics is not always harmful, and can increase the performance of a mechanism. Here, we will extract mathematical formula that gives us the required optimum value for stiffness and/or damping of the system to give us the optimal performance given physical limitations.	brent's method;computer performance;elasticity (data store);human–computer interaction;inverted pendulum;jesse sullivan;mathematical model;nonlinear system;simulation;stiffness;velocity (software development)	Hamid Reza Vejdani;Jonathan W.

This paper is focused on the study of grasp forces of these patients with different pathologies and presents a new methodology to calculate grasp forces applied by virtual human hand when grasping any object with power. The Denavit-Hartenberg method is implemented to analyze the 25-degree-of-freedom (DOF) hand model of the virtual humans. Human performance measures (joint torques and joint displacements) are criteria for the design of joysticks in the material handling machines.

The microrobot is essentially a body, consisting of a piezoelectric layered beam divided into several segments. Its actuation for propulsion relies on the creation of a non-reciprocal motion along the body. This requires that a voltage with the same frequency but different phases and amplitudes be applied to each segment. The motion pattern is analyzed theoretically and a control strategy in open loop is implemented to emulate a non-reciprocal motion. Simulations are given to demonstrate that a non-reciprocal motion is developed. Likewise, its propulsion can be verified from the drag force observed. Despite extreme size limitations using piezoelectric materials, the design proposed in this work may be able to swim in blood flow.	microbotics;simulation	Enrique Mancha;José Emilio Traver;Inés Tejado;Javier Prieto;Blas M.

We propose an approach based on a nonlinear optimization formulation that may encounter physiological and technological constraints. The study considers a biomechanical knee model and the associated agonist/antagonist muscles. The goal of this method is to synthesize optimal patterns which minimize the muscular activities and/or tracking trajectory errors in order to reduce the muscular fatigue while achieving a desired movement. Different tests have been performed and the results compared with regard to the energetic balance. The approach is illustrated in simulation with: 1) sinusoidal desired knee joint trajectory, 2) optimal reference knee joint trajectory and 3) without explicit reference knee joint trajectory. The simulations have been performed with model parameters estimated from real subject data. We show that the trajectory tracking presents high energy consumption which demonstrates the inappropriateness of classical robotics methods for musculoskeletal system. Instead, minimization of muscle activation only gives better results with regard to energy consumption, still with a reasonnable trajectory tracking error.	authorization;functional electrical stimulation;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;robotics;simulation	Mourad Benoussaad;Philippe Poignet;David Guiraud	2008	2008 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2008.4651112	motion control;nonlinear programming;engineering;trajectory;biological pest control;solid modeling;estimation theory	Robotics	69.76422005124994	-28.36303728351895	136527

The device is energetically passive, meaning that it can only remove energy from the system. All motive force must be generated by the user, which guarantees stability of the system and safety of the human operator. A first order system approach is presented as a tool for modeling MR fluid behavior in a low-speed braking device. A simulation was developed that uses the brake model and the equations of motion to predict robot motion based on force input and actuator commands. The accuracy of these models was demonstrated with comparisons to experimental data. Two forms of path following velocity control were successfully implemented and shown to significantly reduce path error in preliminary experiments with human operators.	experiment;haptic technology;simulation;velocity (software development)	Matthew R.

The procedure is based on the optimization where the cost function is the minimization of the difference between the knee joint torques of healthy walking and the walking with the transfemural prosthesis. We present a simulation environment that allows the user to interactively vary the foot geometry and track the changes in the knee torque that arise from these adjustments.

We show that altering model attributes such as the length of the elastic foot segment or its elasticity leads to significant changes in the estimated knee torque required for a given trajectory.	elasticity (data store);interactivity;knee joint;loss function;mathematical optimization;program optimization;prosthesis implantation;simulation;stiffness	Matija Strbac;Dejan B.

The conventional treatment is to surgically insert a ventilation tube into the tympanic membrane (TM) to suction out the fluid. An office-based robotic device allowing fast tube insertion has been designed in an earlier work of the authors. However, as the malleus bone attaches to the inner surface of the TM, and this part of the membrane is thus to be avoided during the insertion process. The previous device requires manual manipulation to avoid hitting the malleus bone before tube insertion. To accomplish the procedure automatically, a switching control scheme using intelligent vision-servo and tactile sensing is proposed in this paper. The new device is able to guide the insertion channel to move effectively and intelligently in the ear canal. Pre-clinical tests on the pig ears verify the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed approach.	motion planning;robot;servo;tree accumulation	Wenchao Gao;Wenyu Liang;Kok Kiong Tan	2014	IECON 2014 - 40th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2014.7048889	engineering;biological engineering;audiology;surgery	Robotics	74.523719734216	-29.008409675150407	137501

This study used a body-worn, sensorized basketball sleeve to identify arm motion timing characteristics during basketball free throw and jump shot shooting for trained and novice shooters. Current basketball shooting research has typically focused on arm kinematic angles, while shot timing has received comparatively less attention. An experiment was conducted to compare arm motion timing between trained and novice shooters while shooting free throws, and a second experiment compared arm motion timing between free throws and jump shots by trained shooters. Trained shooters shot free throws significantly faster than novice shooters, and trained shooters shot jump shots significantly faster than free throws at the same distance from the basket. Knowledge of arm motion timing characteristics from this study could enable future training for improved shooter accuracy.		Jonathan C. Maglott;Junkai Xu;Peter B.

For realizing it, the assistance system needs to estimate the load of a patient and in many cases, the previous researchers use a joint traction which can be derived by a human linkages model kinematically for evaluating it. However, human body motions are generated by many muscles and a joint traction, which muscles can generate, changes according to the relative position between the muscles and links. This means there is not always mutual relation between a muscle activity and a joint traction, and it is difficult to evaluate the muscular power of a patient during a standing motion simply using a joint traction. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a load estimation scheme which consider the muscle functionality of the patient. Our key idea is a load estimation using the human musculo-skeletal model of a lower limb, which expresses a biarticular muscle function. In general, the human generates a natural standing motion using the biarticular muscle function. This model enables the standing assistance system to estimate a load of the subject without biosensors such as an electromyograph and to assist the standing motion using a remaining physical strength of the subject maximally.	electromyography;estimation theory;traction teampage	Daisuke Chugo;Takahiro Yamada;Satoshi Muramatsu;Yuki Sakaida;Sho Yokota;Hiroshi Hashimoto	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO 2014)	10.1109/ROBIO.2014.7090549	estimation;simulation;engineering;coupling;force;statistics;actuator	Robotics	71.68869325027329	-26.437497059116936	138294

Similar to traditional electric motors, the MR scanner acts as the stator and generates propulsive torques on an actuator rotor containing one or more ferrous particles. To generate maximum motor torque while avoiding instabilities and slippage, closed-loop control of the electromagnetic field gradients, i.e., commutation, is required. This paper proposes and demonstrates a method for commutation based on interleaving pulse sequences for rotor tracking and rotor propulsion. Fast rotor tracking is achieved by a new technique utilizing radio-frequency (RF) selective excitation of a properly located fiducial marker by the ferrous particle of the rotor. Optimal marker location is derived and demonstrated to provide accurate estimates of rotor angle. In addition, closed-loop commutation control is shown to increase motor torque and also to enable regulation of rotor angle.	control theory;emoticon;fiducial marker;forward error correction;gradient;r.o.t.o.r.;radio frequency;resonance;robot;robotics;schmidt decomposition;torque;type signature	Christos Bergeles;Panagiotis Vartholomeos;Lei Qin;Pierre E.

0774311b463fd3951d6bf4a317dd3b25a750ab9c	tensor factorisation for narrowband single channel source decomposition		In many subspace signal decomposition methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) or its extension, singular spectrum analysis (SSA), particularly meant for processing of single channel signals, there is need for a robust determination and validation of the number of sources. Here, we attempt to find a relation between the number of sources within single channel mixtures and the rank of a symmetric tensor constructed from such mixtures by adjusting the embedding dimension. This leads to a new approach for decomposition of single channel mixtures using tensor factorisation. Consequently, the effect of model order is analysed for simulated narrowband data. The inherent frequency diversity of the time series has also been effectively exploited in selection of the desired subspace. The proposed method has been applied to both simulated and real data. The results have been discussed and compared with those of a number of benchmark algorithms.	monoid factorisation	Samaneh Kouchaki;Saeid Sanei	2017	J.

In particular and contrary to the state-of-art methods, our proposed approach uses a weak joint-sparsity sources assumption: we look for tiny temporal zones where only one source is active. This method is well suited to non-stationary signals such as speech. We extend our previous work to a more general class of nonlinear mixtures, proposing several nonlinear single-source confidence measures and several functional clustering techniques. Such approaches may be seen as extensions of linear instantaneous sparse component analysis to nonlinear mixtures. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and relevancy of this approach.	cluster analysis;experiment;line source;memory effect;nl (complexity);nl-complete;nonlinear dimensionality reduction;nonlinear system;relevance;simulation;source separation;sparse matrix;stationary process	Matthieu Puigt;Anthony Griffin;Athanasios Mouchtaris	2012	2012 IEEE 7th Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop (SAM)	10.1109/SAM.2012.6250544	independent component analysis;econometrics;estimation;time–frequency analysis;computer science;pattern recognition;mathematics;blind signal separation;correlation;statistics	Vision	81.712214865247	-37.63873397812853	139845

To avoid the near-end interference, a new double-talk detection (DTD) method is proposed by tracking the squared coefficients errors of the AEC filter. This DTD method has well-separated detection margins among single-talk (ST), double-talk (DT), and echo path changes.

The objective of the wheel-motor dynamic model is to generate a suitable time reference to be used in an estimation algorithm. The ultimate goal of the estimation algorithm is to retrieve the thrust, i.e. torque and force, that the older adult user of the robotic walker applies to the platform. These quantities are of paramount importance in order to adopt intelligent and comfortable walker guidance algorithms. The novelty of this approach is the avoidance of additional costly sensors that are usually used to solve such a problem.

In human support robotics or medical robotics, the detail comprehension of physical human body is important to develop safe and high performed robots to work cooperatively with a human and to replace human dexterous tasks. It is known that a human arm generates variable stiffness depending on tasks by coactivation of agonist and antagonist muscles. Previous related researches have been presented impedance characteristics of a human upper limb in static posture and dynamic motion. These characteristics are represented by ellipsoids. However, the above analyses are based on a simple muscle model and conventional kinematic and dynamics of an articulated body system. In this paper, perturbation-excited method is carried out for estimating the stiffness of a human hand. The experimental results demonstrate nonlinear property of the stiffness of a human hand. To illustrate the observed stiffness characteristic, this paper proposes nonlinear stiffness model of the human hand.	3d modeling;biological system;characteristic impedance;electromyography;nonlinear system;poor posture;robot;robotics;stiffness	Satoko Abiko;Atsushi Konno;Masaru Uchiyama	2010	2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2010.5650546	robot;control engineering;estimation;human body;simulation;computer science;engineering;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;viscoelasticity;electrical impedance;control theory;elasticity;force	Robotics	69.27513775238054	-24.654934069699877	141178

Robust visual tracking of deformable biomembrane contour using physics-based models is described. A multi-axis MEMS-based force sensor is used to determine applied forces on biomembranes and develop a novel biomembrane mechanical model. By visually extracting geometry changes on a biomembrane during loading, geometry changes can be used to estimate applied forces using the biomembrane mechanical model and the determined elastic modulus. Forces on a biomembrane can be visually observed and controlled, thus creating a framework for vision and force assimilated cell manipulation. The experimental results quantitatively describe mouse zona pellucida (ZP) stiffness increase during ZP hardening and provide an understanding of ZP protein structure development, i.e., an increase in the number of cross links of protein ZP1 between ZP2-ZP3 units that is conjectured to be responsible for ZP stiffness increase. Furthermore, the system, technique, and model presented in this paper can be applied to investigating mechanical properties of other biomembranes and other cell types, which has the potential to facilitate many biological studies, such as cell injury and recovery where biomembrane mechanical property changes need to be monitored.	apache axis;microelectromechanical systems;modulus robot;video tracking	Yu Sun;Michael A.

In addition to that, various sensors have also been developed and used to give intelligent functions to the prosthetics. However, there may be cases where the number of sensors attached to the prosthetics should be limited due to cost, limited space, or power issues as the number of sensors increase. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a design guideline that could be used to determine the ideal sensor locations, particularly when the number of sensors is limited by finding out the locations of the high contact areas where the prosthetic hand touches the object. To this end, we experiment with a popular prosthetic hand made using a 3D printer. The prosthetic hand with gloves is used to touch two different objects that are covered with black ink, and the area of ink transferred onto the gloves is measured by image processing. Experiments are conducted ten times on the same object to obtain statistical results, and as a result, we show the most contact areas with the objects and present the guidelines.	3d printing;3d scanner;control knob;cylinder seal;experiment;high- and low-level;image processing;printer (computing);sensor	Hyun Hwang;Jun Han Bae;Byung-Cheol Min	2017	2017 First IEEE International Conference on Robotic Computing (IRC)	10.1109/IRC.2017.81	simulation;engineering;biological engineering;engineering drawing	Robotics	74.87809580712461	-29.9755793690044	141517

For this purpose, extensive research effort has been focused on the manual control of inverted pendulum, from which cognitive and motor behavior can be obtained. However, much less attention has been paid to the effect on this experimental platform with different input, e.g. force, velocity, and position input. With the intention to provide more interactive form between human operators and electromechanical systems, this manuscript gives a comparative study on a virtual pendulum system which is built based on OpenGL when different commands are provided with a joystick. All forms of dynamical models have been obtained though mathematical manipulation. In order to obtain more realistic effect, dynamical models are solved with Runge-kutta method. A joystick interface enables operators to control the pendulum manually, providing a fun experience. This study establishes the foundation for further research on cognitive behavior of human operators in human-machine interaction systems and neural control systems.	555 timer ic;control system;control theory;dynamical system;human–computer interaction;human–machine system;inverted pendulum;joystick;opengl;runge–kutta methods;velocity (software development)	Jianning Hua;Yujie Cui;Pu Shi;Fangping Yang;Xuezhu Wang	2013	2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606406	control engineering;simulation;computer science;control theory	Robotics	70.30530156704017	-29.22926601073847	141656

4bac43373d84a8992ec09695d167d94cd14be87c	model-based external force/moment estimation for humanoid robots with no torque measurement		The dynamics of a humanoid robot cannot be correctly described independently from the external forces acting on it. These forces have to be reconstructed to enable the robot to control them or to compensate for them. Force sensors are usually used to measure these forces, but because of their cost, they are often put only on the ankle/feet and possibly the wrists. This paper addresses the issue of the estimation of external forces and moments that apply at any part of a robot without direct force measurements and without torque measurements. The sensors used are the regular force sensors and the IMUs of the robot. The method relies on a model-based estimator able to make the fusion between these sensors and the whole body dynamics. The estimator reconstructs a single state vector containing the floating-base kinematics, a filtered measurement of contact force and an additional estimation external force that we evaluate in this paper. Validation is performed on HRP-2 in a multi-contact motion.	control theory;humanoid robotics project;humanoid robot;performance;principle of good enough;sensor;torque	Mehdi Benallegue;Pierre Gergondet;Herve Audrerr;Alexis Mifsud;Mitsuharu Morisawa;Florent Lamiraux;Abderrahmane Kheddar;Fumio Kanehiro	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2018.8460809	estimator;control theory;humanoid robot;control engineering;kinematics;torque;robot;engineering;contact force;state vector	Robotics	69.57688322882596	-27.3588740665989	142562

An often used strategy for multi-microphone noise reduction is to apply the multi-channel Wiener filter, which is often claimed to be mean-squared error optimal. However, this is only true if the estimator is constrained to be linear, or, if the speech and noise process are assumed to be Gaussian. Based on histograms of speech DFT coefficients it can be argued that optimal multi-channel minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimators should be derived under super-Gaussian speech priors instead. In this paper we investigate the robustness of these estimators when the steering vector is affected by estimation errors. Further, we discuss the sensitivity of the estimators when the true underlying distribution of speech DFT coefficients deviates from the assumed distribution.	algorithm;coefficient;mean squared error;microphone;noise reduction;speech enhancement;wiener filter	Richard Christian Hendriks;Richard Heusdens;Jesper Jensen	2009	2009 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics	10.1109/ASPAA.2009.5346488	minimum mean square error;electronic engineering;speech recognition;noise;speech;noise reduction;gaussian process;mathematics;mean squared error;wiener filter;statistics	ML	82.90482031530196	-33.810099568970415	142636

It is the new concept of biomimetics, and its appearance likes a natural flower. The design is based on a novel “tendon and spring” mechanisms. The robotic flower is steered by tendons combining structure of spring. Its development is novel with respect to previous robotic flower's designs in that flexibility, and extension, in addition to bending, are actively controlled in each direction of the robot and cheap. This requires a proposed kinematic model, and poses challenges for real-time control of the robot. In the paper, the design and its development are presented, along with a real-time control issues and experimental results. Robotic flower has three main parts are several leaves, a stem and a flower which can move respectively together or seperately. The mechanical structure is designed specifically to help the flowers have softness and flexible movement. The spring and tendon mechanism are combined to build a robotic flower. Beside like as natural flower, the robot can move toward light, sway to the music or recognize the strange people into the house.	apache continuum;biomimetics;displacement mapping;experiment;flower robot;optical fiber;performance;real-time clock;real-time computing;robot;television;triune continuum paradigm	Nguyen Truong-Thinh;Nguyen Ngoc-Phuong	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2011.6181272	structural engineering;control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;dc motor	Robotics	72.12061437145127	-23.973802499660422	143019
0580b0176ce3fd57df65c2c8ef61ca70c14a4df9	a cable-based series elastic actuator with conduit sensor for wearable exoskeletons		There is currently a scarcity of wearable robotic devices that can practically provide physical assistance in a range of real world activities. Soft wearable exoskeletons, or exosuits, have the potential to be more portable and less restrictive than their rigid counterparts. In this paper, we present the design of an actuation system that has been optimized for use in a soft exosuit for the human arm. The selected design comprises a DC motor and gearbox, a flexible cable conduit transmission, and a custom series elastic force sensor. Placed in series with the transmission conduit, the custom compliant force sensor consists of a translational steel compression spring with a pair of Hall effect sensors for measuring deflection. The custom sensor is validated as an accurate means of measuring cable tension, and it is shown that it can be used in feedback to control the cable tension with high bandwidth. The dynamic effect of the cable-conduit transmission on the force felt at the user interface is characterized by backdriving the system as it renders a range of virtual impedances to the user. We conclude with recommendations for the integration of such an actuation system into a full wearable exosuit.	characteristic impedance;dspace;feedback;hall effect sensor;haptic technology;nonlinear system;powered exoskeleton;rendering (computer graphics);requirement;robot;series and parallel circuits;testbed;user interface;wearable computer	Laura H.

Analytical methods for calculation of contact forces require too much time to maintain fast update rates for haptic controls. In addition, they prohibit direct connection of haptic interfaces. Penalty methods, which employ spring-damper models for calculation of contact forces, offer a very rapid rate of iterations. In addition, they permit direct connection of haptic interfaces. Penalty methods are good for haptic interactions. However, previous penalty methods do not regard distribution of contact forces over the contact area. For that reason, they can’t calculate normal and friction forces on face-face contacts correctly. We propose a distributed spring-damper model on a contact area to solve these problems. We analyze threedimensional geometries of the intersecting portion on the polyhedral objects. Then, we integrate forces and torques of distributed spring-damper models. We implement a proposed simulator and compare it with a point-based penalty method and constraint method. The comparison shows that the proposed simulator improves accuracy of the simulation of face-face contact and friction forces and the simulation speed. In addition, we attach a six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) haptic interface to the simulator. Users can feel 6-DOF force feedback and input 6-DOF motions.	haptic technology;interaction;iteration;penalty method;polyhedron;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;simulation	Shoichi Hasegawa;Makoto Sato	2004	Comput.

Active catheters, in which the tip moves actively using sh ape memory alloy (SMA) actuators, constitute a promising approach. In this article, w e review existing SMA-based active catheters present in the literature. We analyze the ir performances regarding the requirements imparted to neuroradiology.

These results are finally applied to the design of single -us small-diameter active catheters especially devoted to neuroradiology.

Through a haptic device, the surgeon teleoperates the medical instrument in free space, fixed on a remote robot or in contact. In free space, the surgeon feels the motion of the robot. In the present paper, we evaluated the performance of the controller on viscoelastic tissue, modeled by a fractional derivative equation. In addition, we propose a novel controller using an integer formalization process that is suitable for these tissue properties. The simulation results suggested that performance, in terms of force control and telepresence, became poorer when the conventional controller, which was designed for elastic target object, was applied to the viscoelastic tissues. In contrast, the results suggested that our proposed controller maintained its performance on the viscoelastic tissues.	body tissue;control system;controllers;emotions;experiment;feedback;haptic device component;haptic technology;integer (number);medical robot;minimally invasive surgical procedures;physical object;robot (device);simulation;video-in video-out	Yo Kobayashi;Pedro Moreira;Chao Liu;Philippe Poignet;Nabil Zemiti;Masakatsu G.

Speaker Transformation Algorithm Using Segmental Codebooks (STASC) is modified to process source and target speech spectra in different subbands. The new method ensures better conversion at sampling rates above 16KHz. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is employed for subband decomposition to estimate the speech spectrum better with higher resolution. Faster voice conversion is achieved since the computational complexity decreases at a lower sampling rate. A Voice Conversion System (VCS) is implemented using the proposed algorithm with necessary tools. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by both subjective listening tests and applications to film dubbing and looping. In ABX listening tests, the listeners preferred the subband based output by 92.1% as compared to the full-band based output.	algorithm;codebook;computational complexity theory;discrete wavelet transform;qr decomposition;sampling (signal processing);veritas cluster server	Oytun Türk;Levent M.

This model is an adaptation of a previously reported model of sensory feedback that included manual sensory re-weighting. The new model achieves sensory re-weighting that is physiologically plausible and readily implemented. Model simulations are compared to previously reported experimental results to demonstrate the automated sensory re-weighting strategy of the modified model. On the whole, the postural sway time series generated by the model with automatic sensory re-weighting show good agreement with experimental data, and are capable of producing patterns similar to those observed experimentally.	acclimatization;experiment;sensory feedback;simulation;time series	Arash Mahboobin;Patrick J.

As for ordinary procedures, sometimes the nails are distorted, so it is difficult to lock the screw in the bone. And in such a situation, surgeons have to operate under X-ray directly. Consequently the harm to the surgeon is very serious, and the operation effect is disillusionary. A novel robot-assisted bonesetting system is being developed to solve these problems. The system can assist surgeon to reposition fracted long bone and lock the interlocking intramedullary nail. It can be executed in three modes: telesurgery, semi-autonomous surgery and autonomous surgery. The destination is autonomous surgery., i.e. once configured by surgeons, the system can fulfill the part of bone repositioning and interlocking intramedullary nail locking. In order to accomplish interlocking intramedullary nail procedure, the system consists of automatic operating table, exact fluoroscopy unit, fracture reposition robot, guiding robot, computer control system and surgeon console, as well as some function units, which are image acquisition & processing and calibration system, tele-operation system, virtual operation simulation system and human-machine interface.

While there are many types of “intent” that could be inferred for a given user action, the experiments conducted here focused on the determining user’s navigational intent, i.e. their desired heading. Our experiments used two 6-DOF force/moment sensors on the walker’s handles and a digital motion capture system to correlate applied force with actual motion. Results revealed that the intent to turn, represented by changes in the heading angle, highly correlates with the overall turning moment around the vertical axis as well as the side forces applied by the user. Other force/moment components reveal additional information, such as support needs. The inferred user intent will be incorporated into a passive shared steering control system for the walker.	amiga walker;apache axis;control system;course (navigation);experiment;motion capture;sensor	Glenn S.

That is why there is a strong need for new tribologically-optimised materials at their gripping devices that may lead to the enhancement of the attachment force while reducing energy expenditure. Since insects are equipped with a set of very efficient attachment systems, enabling them to grip a variety of substrates, they may provide approaches for the innovation of climbing robots' grippers. The goal of our study was a broad screening of polymeric materials to find out those with similar structure and functional principles to biological examples known from insect smooth attachment systems. Friction, adhesion and stiffness measurements were carried out. Rubber foamy materials covered with thin polymeric films and sandwich-like materials provided excellent compliant properties and the best performance in experiments (friction coefficients up to 3.2).	polymer;robot	Dagmar Voigt;Andreas Karguth;Stanislav N.

The derivation of the optimal estimator is based on modeling speech as a quasi-periodic signal, and on applying spectral decomposition. The optimal spectral amplitude estimator and a recently developed vector spectral subtraction amplitude estimator, are round to be nearly equivalent. The optimal spectral amplitude estimator coincides with a Wiener spectral amplitude estimator at high signal to noise ratio (SNR) values, and is found to be superior to it at low SNR values. The enhanced speech obtained by using the proposed system, is less spectrally distorted, although contains some more residual noise, than the enhanced speech obtained by using the Wiener spectral amplitude estimator, in the same system. In addition, it is free of the """"musical noise"""" characteristic to the spectral subtraction algorithm.

An optimization procedure is embedded into the algorithm to carry out the loudspeaker compensation on a frame-by-frame basis. In order to minimize the perceptible distortion incurred in the loudspeaker, a perceptually meaningful optimization criterion is constructed by using a psychoacoustic model. The resulting per-frame optimization problems are solved efficiently using a gradient optimization method. Objective evaluation experiments show that the proposed loudspeaker compensation algorithm provides a significant audio quality improvement, and this for all considered amplitude levels.	algorithm;distortion;embedded system;experiment;finite impulse response;gradient descent;loudspeaker;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;psychoacoustics	Bruno Defraene;Toon van Waterschoot;Moritz Diehl;Marc Moonen	2013	21st European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2013)		control engineering;electronic engineering;acoustics;engineering;audio crossover	EDA	78.5365506229137	-35.69129166222101	145342

This paper proposes a mechanism and control method of a mobile exoskeleton robot for 3DOF upper-limb motion assist (shoulder vertical and horizontal flexion/extension, and elbow flexion/extension motion assist). The exoskeleton robot is mainly controlled by the skin surface electromyogram (EMG) signals, since EMG signals of muscles directly reflect how the user intends to move. The force vector at the end-effector is taken into account to generate the natural and smooth hand trajectory of the user in the proposed control method. An obstacle avoidance algorithm is applied to prevent accidental collision between the user’s upper-limb and the robot frame. The experiment was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed exoskeleton robot. c © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

3da013dbb6e3081c03aabdf0e083916af4fc8598	a real-time cnc interpolator algorithm for trimming and filling planar offset curves	footpoint;real time interpolator;offset curve trimming and filling;tool radius compensation;point curve distance function;cnc machine	Tool paths for CNC machines must be offset from the desired part shape, in order to compensate for the tool radius. To avoid gouging the part geometry and to ensure continuous paths, the offset construction employs trimming and filling operations at tangent discontinuities and regions of high concave curvature on the part shape. Typically, offset paths are constructed offline in a CAM system — the resulting paths are inherently approximate, and must be re–generated when a different tool size is selected. To circumvent these shortcomings, an interpolator algorithm for real–time offset curve trimming and filling is developed and verified herein. Since the algorithm uses the exact part geometry, offset path approximation errors are completely eliminated. Circular fill arcs of the appropriate angular extent are automatically executed at convex tangent–discontinuous junctures of adjacent part boundary segments, and offset trimming operations are triggered by real–time point/curve distance computations, which determine footpoints of the instantaneous tool position on the part boundary. The algorithm also accommodates feedrates that correspond to a constant speed of either the tool/part contact point, or the tool center. The practical feasibility of the method is demonstrated by an implementation on a 3–axis CNC mill governed by an open–architecture software controller.		Rida T.

To visually fixate on an object while walking, compensatory horizontal and vertical eye movements must be made. The model for this gaze (head plus eye) control system includes three types of eye movements: smooth pursuit, saccadic, and vestibulo-ocular. The smooth pursuit system uses a target-selective adaptive controller that compensates for the large inherent time delay and produces zero-latency tracking of predictable targets. Target movements were selected to minimize the role of the saccadic control system. Typical tracking is shown while seated with the head restrained, standing with unrestrained head, performing voluntary head rotations, and walking. Each additional degree of freedom produced additional head movements that were compensated by additional eye movements. It is shown that while a human walks the effects of head rotations (yaw) cancel the effects of head translations, thus minimizing the resulting horizontal eye rotations necessary to maintain fixation.	broadcast delay;control system;yaws	Jack D.

The prototype built demonstrates successful implementation of using only friction and variable masses to generate the motion. The theoretical model was simulated using working model and validated experimentally. The computer simulation shows the dynamic and kinetic effects on inchworm mobility, providing a complete understanding of the design concept. The experimental results compare well with the theoretical model, although the exact coefficient of friction during the experiment was not measured. Theoretical and experimental results both indicate a slight backward motion of the robot during the contractile phase of the cycle of motion. Although the results are similar, the theoretical model fails to include such phenomena as the friction in the revolute joints and the vibration produced by the pump and servos. The theoretical model will be used in future work to optimize the design of the robot for dynamic performance.	biomimetics;robot;ver (command)	Diana M. Rincón;Jorge M. Sotelo	2003	IEEE Robot.

e36c4820604c889619a6d0bc305c4875663927b4	control of hand prosthesis using fusion of biosignals and information from prosthesis sensors		In this chapter we present an advanced method of recognition of patient’s intention to move the multi-articulated prosthetic hand during grasping and manipulation of objects in a skillful manner. The proposed method is based on a 2-level multiclassier system (MCS) with base classifiers dedicated to particular types of biosignals: electromyography (EMG) and mechanomyography (MMG) signals, and with combining mechanism using a dynamic ensemble selection scheme and probabilistic competence function. To improve the precision and reliability of prosthesis control, the feedback signal derived from the prosthesis sensors is used. We present two original concepts of using such a signal. In the 1st method, the feedback signal is treated as a source of information about a correct class of hand movement and competence functions of base classifiers are dynamically tuned according to this information. In the 2nd one, classification procedure is organized into multistage process based on a decision tree scheme and consequently, feedback signal indicating an interior node of a tree allows us to narrow down the set of classes. The performance of MCS with feedback signal were experimentally tested on real datasets. The obtained results show that developed methodology can be practically applied to design a control system for dexterous bioprosthetic hand.	sensor	Andrzej Wolczowski;Marek Kurzynski	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-15720-7_19	prosthesis;short-time fourier transform;computer vision;fusion;hand prosthesis;decision tree;probabilistic logic;artificial intelligence;computer science;control system	Robotics	70.36107079165808	-30.65095965133201	146370
2c69678a1db02e46de9eee4882c59564de60d09f	efficient, high-quality time-scaling of audio signals		Enhancements to the classical Waveform Similarity Overlap-Add (WSOLA) algorithm are proposed. As a time-domain approach, it works best for small speed changes and quasi-periodic, monophonic signals. Some of our enhancements are especially effective for small, others for large speed changes. As a consequence, significant improvements for all scaling factors are achieved extending the usability of the new scheme to larger speed changes and more complex signal characteristics. The reduction in computational complexity is analyzed by comparing the number of splice points needed to time-scale the input signal. As will be shown, these are the only points where real signal processing is performed. Therefore, a reduction in their number results in an equivalent decrease in computational demand. Additionally, they are also the only points where artifacts may arise so that, in many cases, a reduction in their number can serve as an indicator for improvements in the signal quality, too.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;image scaling;overlap–add method;point of view (computer hardware company);quasiperiodicity;signal processing;similarity measure;splice (system call);usability;waveform	Markus S.

In reported works a fixed probability, q, is assumed. Since speech is non-stationary and may not be present in every frequency bin when voiced, we propose a method for estimating distinct values of q for different bins which are tracked in time. The estimation is based on a decision-theoretic approach for setting a threshold in each bin followed by short-time averaging. The estimated q's are used to control both the gain and the update of the estimated noise spectrum during speech presence in a modified MMSE log-spectral amplitude estimator. Subjective tests resulted in higher scores than for the IS-127 standard enhancement algorithm, when pre-processing noisy speech for a coding application.	algorithm;colors of noise;enhanced variable rate codec;preprocessor;speech enhancement;stationary process;theory	David Malah;Richard V.

The strategy allows the human-robot system to track a desired interaction torque. To track the desired torque, the robot reference trajectory and actuator torque are designed properly based on the torque tracking impedance control. A constant torque tracking experiment performed on a healthy male subject has shown that the maximum normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD) of each joint is less than 32%. It indicates that the control strategy is feasible and the LLRR is capable of providing stroke patients with active rehabilitation training.

c398f2e455dbc59f6eac6d5c18af6c846a104ce1	safety evaluation method of robot arm considering energy of contact		In this paper, we propose a method for evaluating the safety of a robot arm mechanism. We summarize the trend of international standards with respect to the evaluation index of robot arms and their safety, and propose a method of evaluating mass characteristics based on human pain tolerance. This method is based on the mass characteristics of the arm: we calculate the virtual mass at the contact point, convert it to the reduced mass taking contact with a human body part into consideration, obtain the contact transfer energy and evaluate whether the permissible energy for each part is exceeded or not. We also evaluate the safety characteristics of two kinds of arm mechanism, and verify the distribution of transmitted energy and safe velocity during contact in the movable range. The proposed evaluation of mass characteristics related to safety is applicable to various arm mechanisms if only the mass distribution of the arm is known. It is a highly versatile method.	coat of arms;robotic arm;velocity (software development)	Hideichi Nakamoto;Nobuto Matsuhira	2017	2017 18th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)	10.1109/ICAR.2017.8023646	mass distribution;reduced mass;robotic arm;energy transfer;control engineering;engineering	Robotics	73.55045143141119	-25.350611011682528	148309

The impeller levitated with original hydrodynamic bearings without any complicated control and sensors. However, narrow bearing gap has the potential for causing hemolysis. The purpose of the study is to investigate the geometric configuration of the hydrodynamic step bearing to minimize hemolysis by expansion of the bearing gap. Firstly, we performed the numerical analysis of the step bearing based on Reynolds equation, and measured the actual hydrodynamic force of the step bearing. Secondly, the bearing gap measurement test and the hemolysis test were performed to the blood pumps, whose step length were 0 %, 33 % and 67 % of the vane length respectively. As a result, in the numerical analysis, the hydrodynamic force was the largest, when the step bearing was around 70 %. In the actual evaluation tests, the blood pump having step 67 % obtained the maximum bearing gap, and was able to improve the hemolysis, compared to those having step 0% and 33%. We confirmed that the numerical analysis of the step bearing worked effectively, and the blood pump having step 67 % was suitable configuration to minimize hemolysis, because it realized the largest bearing gap.	assisted circulation;bearing device component;cardiovascular system;centrifugal governor;hemolysis (disorder);hydrodynamics;largest;numerical analysis;semiconductor industry;sensor;evaluation/testing;pump (device)	Ryo Kosaka;Toru Yada;Masahiro Nishida;Osamu Maruyama;Takashi Yamane	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090313	control engineering;levitation;numerical analysis;centrifugal pump;engineering;hemodynamics;engineering drawing;force;physics;impeller;fluid dynamics;mechanical engineering	EDA	75.35408716536162	-25.383795767773226	148326

In addition, muscle models which are incorporated in neural-based prosthetic and orthotic devices may significantly improve their performance. The aim of the study was to compare the performances of two types of muscle models in terms of predicting the moments developed at the human elbow joint complex based on joint kinematics and neuromuscular activity. The performance evaluation of the muscle models was required to implement them in a powered myosignal-driven exoskeleton (orthotic device). The experimental setup included a passive exoskeleton capable of measuring the joint kinematics and dynamics in addition to the muscle myosignal activity (EMG). Two types of models were developed and analyzed: (i) a Hill-based model and (ii) a neural network. The task, which was selected for evaluating the muscle models performance, was the flexion-extension movement of the forearm with a hand-held weight. For this task the muscle model inputs were the normalized neural activation levels of the four main flexor-extensor muscles of the elbow joint, and the elbow joint angle and angular velocity. Using this inputs, the muscle model predicted the moment applied on the elbow joint during the movement. Results indicated a good performance of the Hill model, although the neural network predictions appeared to be superior. Relative advantages and shortcomings of both approaches were presented and discussed.	angularjs;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;elbow joint structure;electromyography;forearm;international joint conferences on artificial intelligence;mobile device;muscle;myalgia;neural network simulation;orthotic devices;orthotic medical specialty;performance evaluation;power (psychology);preparation;velocity (software development);exoskeleton	Jacob Rosen;Moshe B.

76fbfe7b7c30c2a9de00dd50160a7f1824407f71	quality improvement of psola analysis-synthesis using partial zero-phase conversion	quality improvement	This paper discusses two issues of the quality improvement of F0 modified speech based upon PSOLA analysissynthesis. Previous studies[1][2] pointed out that the location of a window of PSOLA influences the quality of synthesized speech and one of them claimed that the center of a window should be located at a pitch pulse in source waveforms. However, pitch pulse detection sometimes fails due to undesired acoustic events. In this paper, several methods are experimentally examined to reduce pitch pulse detection errors. Even when the detection is done correctly, F0 modified re-synthesized speech sometimes causes “echoes” in the re-arranged waveforms. This is mainly caused by a pitch pulse with small sharpness or by that with two relatively high pulses, not pitch pulses, before and after it. To suppress the echoes with little loss of naturalness, partial zero/π-phase conversion is proposed here. Experiments show the high validity of the proposed methods in improving the quality of re-synthesized speech.	acoustic cryptanalysis;categorization;effective method;experiment;psola;speech synthesis	Seiichi Nakagawa	2000			artificial intelligence;quality management;pattern recognition;psola;waveform;naturalness;computer science;pulse (signal processing)	NLP	81.89600481269095	-33.66789716549217	149043

Specifically, we derive minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimators of speech DFT coefficient magnitudes as well as of complex-valued DFT coefficients based on two classes of generalized gamma distributions, under an additive Gaussian noise assumption. The resulting generalized DFT magnitude estimator has as a special case the existing scheme based on a Rayleigh speech prior, while the complex DFT estimators generalize existing schemes based on Gaussian, Laplacian, and Gamma speech priors. Extensive simulation experiments with speech signals degraded by various additive noise sources verify that significant improvements are possible with the more recent estimators based on super-Gaussian priors. The increase in perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) over the noisy signals is about 0.5 points for street noise and about 1 point for white noise, nearly independent of input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The assumptions made for deriving the complex DFT estimators are less accurate than those for the magnitude estimators, leading to a higher maximum achievable speech quality with the magnitude estimators.	additive white gaussian noise;coefficient;discrete fourier transform;experiment;gaussian blur;pesq;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;speech enhancement;utility functions on indivisible goods;white noise	Jan S.

To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a new extension of MUSIC using a nonlinear high-dimensional map, which corresponds to the joint analysis of moments of multiple orders and helps to realize the both advantages of robustness and high resolution of low-ordered and high-ordered statistics. Experimental results show that the proposed method can estimate DOAs more accurately than the conventional MUSIC extensions exploiting moments of a single high order.	algorithm;direction of arrival;image resolution;music (algorithm);nonlinear system;resolution (logic);robustness (computer science)	Yuya Sugimoto;Shigeki Miyabe;Takeshi Yamada;Shoji Makino;Biing-Hwang Juang	2013	2013 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics	10.1109/WASPAA.2013.6701866	electronic engineering;speech recognition;mathematics;statistics	ML	81.98315748487279	-37.48729797667078	149483
e96c49d256b8f62690c627c86845c695a13ab1df	3d printing of improved needle grasping instrument for flexible robotic surgery		Suturing is an essential requirement for surgical robots. Current designs of needle drivers require significant forces to be applied so that the needle will not flip or slip between the jaws when inserted into the tissue. The required force implies that most designs are based on rigid instruments with a straight shaft that induces less dexterity. Flexible robotics provides great dexterity to achieve the task, although often it lacks the capability to apply large forces and therefore hold the surgical needle firmly. Solutions can be found in how the needle driver's jaws are designed. This paper presents improved designs for needle grasping tools for flexible robotic instruments, to be produced directly with selective laser melting. Features on the gripping surface were embedded to increase the gripping effectiveness even in the presence of limited grasping force. A detailed characterisation has been performed for each design showing improvements with respect to the state of the art.	3d printing;dexterity programming language;embedded system;experiment;itil;jaws scripting language;robot;usability testing;video-in video-out	Carlo Seneci;Gauthier Gras;Piyamate Wisanuvej;Jianzhong Shang;Guang-Zhong Yang	2017	2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2017.8206072	artificial intelligence;control engineering;computer science;computer vision;robot;3d printing;selective laser melting;slip (materials science);robotic surgery;robotics	Robotics	74.64497727041253	-27.72425180023674	149958

Robot actions are specified by declaring software servo processes which control the robot's various degrees of freedom. These servo processes can involve position, orientation, force, and torque information from the robot itself, or data from external sensors. Robot tasks are programmed by dynamically modifying the servo processes or by changing set points to these processes.

6d8ebc68aff974570ec734e7bbdcb66498e10e3d	design and evaluation of an active/semiactive ankle-foot orthosis for gait training		Neuromusclar disorders such as stroke often cause walking impairments. During walking, the ankle joint contributes the largest propulsive moment and plays a vital role in shaping a normal gait pattern. The goal of this paper is to introduce a novel powered ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) for gait rehabilitation named Stevens Ankle-_Foot Electromechanical (SAFE) orthosis. Unlike other powered AFOs, the SAFE orthosis features two alternative actuation modes: fully-active and semi-active. The former employs two BLDC motors to provide plantar and dorsiflexion torques; the latter replaces the dorsiflexion side motor with a set of linear springs. This design provides a direct way to investigate how the introduction of a passive antagonistic element may affect the performance of a powered AFO. Initial results from bench testing indicate that the performance of the two actuation modes are comparable in terms of device transparency and torque tracking. Possible implications for the design of future powered AFOs are discussed in the paper.	assistive technology;bilateral filter;characteristic impedance;experiment;noise shaping;safe-biopharma association;semiconductor industry;stevens award;unobtrusive javascript	Yufeng Zhang;Tue Kjærgaard Nielsen;Karen J.

Conventional navigation during catheterization is done by direct manipulation of a handle at a guide wire's proximal end. With the aid of x-ray imaging the corresponding movement of the distal tip within the patient can be monitored. Depending on the practical experience of the medical expert and on the varying complexity of the treatment, the procedure differs in duration and x-ray exposure dose of up to 300 %. The aim of the HapCath-System is to reduce duration and exposure dose by simplifying the procedure. The implemented method is to measure the contact forces at the distal tip of the guide wire and feed these measured forces back onto the proximal end of the guide wire to enable tactile feedback and allow for haptic control of the guide wire. The system gives exact measures for the contact force of the guide wire's tip and vessel walls to the physician. The demonstration system of HapCath includes an artificial artery system, within these the user will be able to maneuver the haptic guide wire and will be able to recognize different types of plaques by touching the calcifications with the guide wire tip. The system is set up to experience different levels of haptic assistance. The discrete tasks of catheterizations can be performed with visual or haptic feedback either, or with visual and haptic feedback simultaneously.	direct manipulation interface;haptic technology;intracoronary optical coherence tomography;radiography	Thorsten Meiss;Christoph Budelmann;Thorsten Alexander Kern;Stephanie Sindlinger;Carlos Minamisava;Roland Werthschützky	2009	World Haptics 2009 - Third Joint EuroHaptics conference and Symposium on Haptic Interfaces for Virtual Environment and Teleoperator Systems	10.1109/WHC.2009.4810904	navigation;artificial intelligence;circulatory system;remote patient monitoring;control theory;feedback;biological engineering;contact force;haptic technology;force;physics;quantum mechanics;actuator	Robotics	74.22823625583982	-28.831144107274973	151018
5357b4033491ee2c26fb910680034185dc38213b	non-filter waveform generation from cepstrum using spectral phase reconstruction		This paper discusses non-filter waveform generation from cepstral features using spectral phase reconstruction as an alternative method to replace the conventional source-filter model in text-to-speech (TTS) systems. As the primary purpose of the use of filters is considered as producing a waveform from the desired spectrum shape, one possible alternative of the sourcefilter framework is to directly convert the designed spectrum into a waveform by utilizing a recently developed“ phase reconstruction”from the power spectrogram. Given cepstral features and fundamental frequency (F0) as desired spectrum from a TTS system, the spectrum to be heard by the listener is calculated by converting the cepstral features into a linear-scale power spectrum and multiplying with the pitch structure of F0. The signal waveform is generated from the power spectrogram by spectral phase reconstruction. An advantageous property of the proposed method is that it is free from undesired amplitude and long time decay often caused by sharp resonances in recursive filters. In preliminary experiments, we compared temporal and gain characteristics of the synthesized speech using the proposed method and mel-log spectrum approximation (MLSA) filter. Results show the proposed method performed better than the MLSA filter in the both characteristics of the synthesized speech, and imply a desirable properties of the proposed method for speech synthesis.	approximation;cepstrum;experiment;recursion;recursive filter;spectral density;spectrogram;speech synthesis;waveform	Yasuhiro Hamada;Nobutaka Ono;Shigeki Sagayama	2016		10.21437/SSW.2016-5	cepstrum;mel-frequency cepstrum	Robotics	80.53180845363195	-34.28450898643924	151073

These signals are frequently encountered in various radar applications. Data interpolators play a unique role in TF signal representations under missing samples. When applied in the instantaneous autocorrelation domain over the time variable, the low-pass filter characteristic underlying linear interpolators lends itself to cross-terms reduction in the ambiguity domain. This is in contrast to interpolation performed over the lag variable or a direct interpolation of the raw data. We demonstrate the interpolator performance in both the time domain and the time-lag domain and compare it with sparse signal reconstruction, which exploits the local sparsity property assumed by most Doppler radar signals.	autocorrelation;bilinear filtering;data compression;data recovery;doppler effect;instantaneous phase;interpolation;linear interpolation;low-pass filter;microsoft windows;radar;randomness;signal reconstruction;simulation;sparse matrix;type signature	Branka Jokanovic;Moeness G.

8afda96a6b9ac1fa0a422b25d03810560ffcd862	a neural learning algorithm of blind separation of noisy mixed images based on independent component analysis	relaxation factor;blind source separation;independent component analysis;noise cancellation;neural network	Blind source separation problem has recently received a great deal of attention in signal processing and unsupervised neural learning. In the current approaches, the additive noise is negligible so that it can be omitted from the consideration. To be applicable in realistic scenarios, blind source separation approaches should deal evenly with the presence of noise. In this contribution, we proposed approaches to independent component analysis when the measured signals are contaminated by additive noise. A noisy multiple channels neural learning algorithm of blind separation is proposed based on independent component analysis. The data have no noise are used to whiten the noisy data, and the windage wipe off technique is used to correct the infection of noise, a neural network model having denoise capability is adopted to recover some original signals from their noisy mixtures observed by the same number of sensors. And a relaxation factor is introduced into the iteration algorithm, thus the new algorithm can implement convergence. Computer simulations and experiment results prove the feasibility and validity of the neural network modeling and control method based on independent component analysis, which can renew the original images effectively.	algorithm;blind signal separation;independent component analysis	Hongyan Li;Xueying Zhang	2014	JCP	10.4304/jcp.9.4.982-989	independent component analysis;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;active noise control;pattern recognition;blind signal separation;artificial neural network;statistics	ML	77.12134189422912	-36.88639850809181	151367

Dexterity of robotic manipulators can be achieved by equipping an anthropomorphic robot hand with multiple fingers. Additionally, in order to manipulate various tools that humans are using in daily life, the size and the exerting force of the robot hand should be similar to that humans are. In this paper, we proposed a human-sized multi-fingered robot hand with detachable mechanism at the wrist. The robot hand can be split at the wrist into the hand part and the actuator part. The fingers are driven by wires and are controlled by actuators embedded in the arm part. The driving force from the arm part is transmitted to the hand part by gear mechanism at the wrist. The developed robot hand has the size of 200[mm](length) × 78[mm](width) × 24.6[mm](thickness) and can exert 10[N] at the fingertip.

During the last decade, the handling of micrometer-sized objects has become a critical issue. Fields of application from material science to electronics demonstrate an urgent need for intuitive and flexible manipulation systems able to deal with small-scale industrial projects and assembly tasks. Two main approaches have been considered: fully automated tasks and manual operation. The first one require fully pre determined tasks, while the later necessitates highly trained operators. To overcome these issues the use of haptic feedback teleoperation where the user manipulates the tool through a joystick whilst feeling a force feedback, appears to be a promising solution as it allows high intuitiveness and flexibility. Major advances have been achieved during this last decade, starting with systems that enable the operator to feel the substrate topology, to the current state-of-the-art where 3D haptic feedback is provided to aid manipulation tasks. This paper details the major achievements and the solutions that have been developed to propose 3D haptic feedback for tools that often lack 3D force measurements. The use of virtual reality to enhance the immersion is also addressed. The strategies developed provide haptic feedback teleoperation systems with a high degree of assistance and for a wide range of micromanipulation tools. Based on this expertise on haptic for micromanipulation and virtual reality assistance it is now possible to propose microassembly systems for objects as small as 1 to 10 micrometers. This is a mature field and will benefit small-scale industrial projects where precision and flexibility in microassembly are required.	haptic technology;immersion (virtual reality);joystick;virtual reality;while	Aude Bolopion;Stéphane Régnier	2013	IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/TASE.2013.2245122	telerobotics;control engineering;computer vision;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;virtual reality;haptic technology	Robotics	74.02886847759726	-27.609558285687772	151989

Its main purpose is to develop suitable robotics devices and control strategies to assist patient's movements during training. To do that, advanced control strategies and implementation of suitable force feedback for these robotic devices have been developed for rehabilitation purposes. This paper describes a novel control strategy, focused in a nonlinear adaptive impedance controller based on position errors, whose aims are: to adapt the exercise to the type and level of injury of patients, to avoid the phenomenon of slack and to help to evaluate performance indices of training sections. Moreover, thanks to the simplicity of the control algorithm and the no additional sensors it can be easily applied in low-cost devices. Several tests are presented using a five-bar linkage robotic device used for upper limbs rehabilitation therapies. The related results help to evaluate performances of this adaptive controller and show its “assist-as-needed” feature.	adaptive filter;advanced process control;algorithm;arabic numeral 0;assistive technology;change control;characteristic impedance;control system;control theory;controllers;electromyography;feedforward neural network;haptic technology;limb structure;linkage (software);movement;muscle;nonlinear system;patients;performance;population parameter;quantitative impedance;rehabilitation robotics;robot;slack variable;electric impedance;sensor (device)	Roberto Oboe;Davide Pilastro	2014	2014 IEEE 13th International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control (AMC)	10.1109/AMC.2014.6823294	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	70.84548187653587	-27.338231843026172	152127

The proposed algorithm is tested with different type of input sources (such as random sequence and speech) using different kind of channels. It was shown that, the proposed algorithm sounds to be more effective for random sequences and can also be used in different application such as loudspeaker or telephone channel equalization.	algorithm;channel (communications);committed information rate;filter design;finite impulse response;loudspeaker;low-pass filter;preprocessor;quasiperiodicity;system identification	Saeed Mosayyebpour;Abolghasem Sayyadiyan;Farhad Tehranipour;Ali Shahbazi	2010	2010 International Conference on Signal Acquisition and Processing	10.1109/ICSAP.2010.69	computer vision;speech recognition;low-pass filter;telecommunications;computer science;finite impulse response;blind equalization;root-raised-cosine filter;band-pass filter;filter design;frequency domain;statistics	Robotics	82.63776661040548	-33.48897617743779	152205

To improve the efficiency of a task involving human-robot cooperation, we designed a novel robot control system, in which a multiple-load state can be provided for a human operator. This system also can provide a multiple-dynamics state during a task involving human-robot dynamical cooperation. The multiple-load state including its transition is effective and efficient in such a task. A single load state can be easily provided by the impedance control of the robot motion thus far; however, the multiple-load state and its transition are difficult to realize using a conventional control scheme. The proposed control scheme differs widely from a conventional impedance control scheme in that the multiple- load state as well as both active and passive states cannot be induced in the single robotic system. Under the proposed control scheme, the load state can be adjusted with the various dynamics in the active or passive state. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control system, human-robot cooperative experiments were carried out. Results showed that the proposed control scheme can provide the multiple-load state for use in a human-robot cooperative task system.	characteristic impedance;computer multitasking;control system;dynamical system;experiment;motion controller;robot control	Toru Tsumugiwa;Ryuichi Yokogawa;Yuki Watanabe	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354554	control engineering;motion control;dynamics;simulation;computer science;engineering;control system;artificial intelligence;electrical impedance;control theory;robot control;robot kinematics	Robotics	69.69602996469894	-25.327077173394066	152271

As in this field different researcher from different disciplines, not only from technical areas like informatics, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering, but also from medical and biological research do have to work together, there is a strong need for an integrative development procedure. In this paper a systematic and methodical approach for the development of active systems in the field of Prosthetics and Orthotics is presented. Two examples of active powered devices in this field are shown. One is an active powered knee prosthesis. The other one is an active powered arm orthosis. The presented procedure starts with the definition of the boundary conditions, which are derived from the application, and ends with a graphical description of the important parameters for the power train in powered P&O devices.	biomechatronics;boundary case;electrical engineering;graphical user interface;informatics;systems engineering	Bernhard Budaker	2014	5th IEEE RAS/EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics	10.1109/BIOROB.2014.6913871	orthotics;prosthesis;biomechatronics;informatics;mechanical engineering;engineering	Robotics	74.1088773503094	-26.94955174972686	152393

We introduce a stretchable smart skin sensor that provides this function. Stretchability allows it to conform to arbitrary robotic link surfaces. It senses contact over nearly the entire surface, localizes contact position of a typical finger touch continuously over its entire surface (RMSE = 7.02mm for a 14.7cm×14.7cm area), and provides an estimate of the contact force. Our approach exclusively employs stretchable, flexible materials resulting in skin strains of up to 150%. We exploit novel carbon nanotube elastomers to create a two-dimensional potentiometer surface. Finite element simulations validate a simplified polynomial surface model to enable real-time processing on a basic microcontroller with no supporting electronics. Using only five electrodes, the skin can be scaled up to arbitrary sizes without needing additional electrodes. We designed, implemented, calibrated, and tested a prototype smart skin as a tactile sensor on a custom medical robot for sensing unexpected physical interactions. We experimentally demonstrate its utility in collaborative robotic applications by showing its potential to enable safer, more intuitive human-robot interaction.	experiment;fundamental interaction;human–robot interaction;medical robot;microcontroller;polynomial;potentiometer;prototype;real-time clock;simulation;tactile sensor;touchscreen	John J.

In this paper, we present an automatic cell injection system, which is capable of visually monitoring the injecting process and controlling the microactuators. Traditionally, cell injection was manually operated, and it was laborious, time consuming, of low accuracy, and prone to contamination due to the handling requirements. An automatic and efficient strategy is required to eliminate these drawbacks. In this paper, a system is developed where the injection process is monitored and controlled automatically via integration of a vision system to an injector manipulation system. The cell is located, and the pipette is positioned and driven by the algorithm to achieve effective penetration. The precision achieved is physically proven to be within a good tolerance range.	algorithm;cell (microprocessor);experiment;feature detection (computer vision);feature detection (web development);requirement;sensor;servo	Zhang Yi;Kok Kiong Tan;Sunan Huang	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2008.925771	control engineering;computer vision;entropy;simulation;machine vision;eye tracking;computer science;engineering;servomechanism;control theory	Robotics	75.82766496309583	-28.826568117724605	152975

However, electrical stimulation that is suitable in terms of current or voltage level for tactile sensations experienced from an individual cannot be guaranteed for every user; the dynamic range is largely dependent on the user. An identification method is then necessary for characterizing the parameters of the skin-electrode interface circuit model as to improve rendering consistency and comfort for every user regardless of skin condition. In this paper, we focus on developing a custom-built electro-tactile display terminal for data collection and an identification method to determine the individual bio-impedance parameters based on the well-known skin-electrode interface circuit model: the Cole-Cole circuit model. The goal of this work is to develop an online identification and stimulation current control approach for enhancement of electro-tactile-based rendering in applications such as rehabilitation, sensory substitution, telepresence, etc.	algorithm;british informatics olympiad;characteristic impedance;computer monitor;dynamic range;experiment;functional electrical stimulation;impedance parameters;online and offline;sensory substitution;whole earth 'lectronic link	John Gregory;Ning Xi;Yantao Shen	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354057	identification;computer vision;dynamic range;sensory substitution;computer science;engineering;electrode;electrical impedance;skin;biological engineering;tactile sensor;statistics;data collection	Robotics	78.72354773047742	-28.038608802433806	153178

General purpose CAM systems are an important tool allowing the experienced machinist to experiment with machining strategies and assess quality of the resulting tool paths. However, in the case of machine elements, such as gears, shape definition by parametric equations is most inviting for development of fit-for-purpose machining strategies and corresponding parametric tool paths without the use of CAM software. Such an approach is materialised in this paper for spur gears, drawing on discretisation of involute and trochoidal curves constituting the tooth profile, so as to satisfy scallop height constraints. The roughing stage is performed with a flat end mill, implementing slot milling along a meander type tool path. The finishing stage is performed with a bull-nose end mill, implementing peripheral milling circumferentially around the full gear profile.

The thumb is designed as one part of the palm and provides the mobility of the palm. The fingertip tactile sensor, based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and pressure variable resistor ink, is physically flexible enough to be deformed into any three-dimensional geometry. In order to detect incipient slip, a PVDF strip is arranged along the direction normal to the surface of the finger of the robot hand. Also, a thin flexible sensor to sense the static force as well as the contact location is fabricated into an arrayed type using pressure variable resistor ink. The driving circuits for the SKKU Hand II are embedded in the hand, and each driving circuit communicates with others using CAN protocol. In addition, a tactile sensing system is developed with miniaturized electronic hardwares such as charge amplifier, signal processing unit etc., and it is integrated into the robot hand.

In some cases, 80% or more of the total information can be described with only two scalar component values. Robotic hands, however, commonly only couple intra-finger joints, and rarely take advantage of this inter-finger coordination. In this paper, real-world data on a variety of human hand postures was collected using a data glove, and principal components analysis was used to calculate these synergies, resulting in what we call eigenpostures. A novel mechanism design is presented to combine the eigenpostures and drive a 17-degree-of-freedom 5-fingered robot hand. The hand uses only 2 DC motors to accurately recreate a wide range of hand shapes. We also present a design improvement that allows us to distinguish between high-precision and low-precision tasks, as well as greatly reduce overall error.	algorithm;brain–computer interface;cluster analysis;humanoid robot;principal component analysis;requirement;robot;robotics;skin (computing);synergy;wired glove	Christopher Y.

The autocorrelation function of the pre-processed noisy speech signal is weighted by an inverse of its variant, circular average magnitude difference function (CAMDF). The inversed CAMDF-weighted autocorrelation function (ICWAF) alone cannot guarantee the de-emphasization of the `non-pitch-peaks'. However, as the dominant pitch-harmonic (DH) of the sinusoidal clean-speech model is expected to be an integer multiple of the pitch, this method concentrates in the effective estimation of the DH using a proposed cosine model of autocorrelation function. Hence, a variable period impulse train with its period being a function of the DH is optimally fitted with the rectified ICWAF to estimate the pitch. The simulation results using the Keele database show that the proposed method claims better accuracy even at a signal to noise ratio (SNR) as low as -10 dB.	autocorrelation;dirac comb;pitch detection algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;time–frequency analysis	Celia Shahnaz;Md.

Predicated upon the understanding that collision detection will be improved by removing the effects of torque sensor error and friction compensation error, we propose an approach to measure these undesired effects in external torque residual signals without resorting to remodeling of the robot. Compensation of these effects leads to the proposed velocity-based variable thresholds which are shown to detect collisions with better efficacy than uncompensated methods. Implementation of the proposed velocity-based variable thresholds on a torque sensor equipped robot validates our methodology.	collision detection;motion compensation;robot;sensor;serial communication;velocity (software development)	Vahid Sotoudehnejad;Mehrdad R.

Tensor-based subspace approaches to R-D HR such as R-D unitary ESPRIT and R-D MUSIC provide super-resolution performance. However, they require the prior knowledge of the number of signals. The matrix based (1-D) ESTimation ERror (ESTER) is subspace based detection method that is robust against colored noise. To estimate the number of signals from R-D measurements corrupted by colored noise, we propose two R-D extensions of the 1-D ESTER by means of the higher-order singular value decomposition. The first R-D ESTER combines R shift invariance equations each applied in one dimension. It inherits and enhances the robustness of the 1-D ESTER against colored noise, and outperforms the state-of-the-art R-D order selection rules particularly in strongly correlated colored noise environment. The second R-D scheme is developed based on the tensor shift invariance equation. It performs best over a wide range of low-to-moderate noise correlation levels, but poorly for high noise correlation levels showing a weakened robustness to colored noise. Compared with the existing R-D ESTER scheme, both proposals are able to identify much more signals when the spatial dimension lengths are distinct. & 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The stop criterion, envelope technique, and mode-mixing problem are the most important topics that need to be addressed in order to improve the EMD algorithm. In this paper, we study the envelope technique and the mode-mixing problem caused by separating multicomponent AM-FM signals with the EMD algorithm. We present a new necessary condition on the envelope that questions the current assumption that the envelope passes through the extreme points of an intrinsic mode function (IMF). Then, we present a solution to the mode-mixing problem that occurs when multicomponent AM-FM signals are separated. We experiment on several signals, including simulated signals and real-life signals, to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in resolving the mode-mixing problem.	algorithm;fm broadcasting;hilbert–huang transform;nonlinear system;real life;simulation	Xiyuan Hu;Silong Peng;Wen-Liang Hwang	2012	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2011.2179650	algorithm design;mathematical optimization;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;statistics	ML	81.44226480159742	-37.95082108078792	155394

However, these robotic hands often suffer from a lack of comprehensive understanding of the musculoskeletal behavior of the human thumb with integrated foldable palm. This paper proposes a novel kinematic model to analyze the importance of thumb-palm embodiment in grasping objects. The model is validated using human demonstrations for five precision grasp types across five human subjects. The model is used to find whether there are any co-activations among the thumb joint angles and muskuloskeletal parameters of the palm. In this paper we show that there are certain pairs of joints that show stronger linear relationships in the torque space than in joint angle space. These observations provide useful design guidelines to reduce control complexity in anthropomorphic robotic thumbs.		Visakha Nanayakkara;Ahmad Ataka;Demetrios Venetsanos;Olga Duran;Nikolaos I.

Since the speech energy is sparsely distributed on the TF plane, the speech harmonic structures occupied in the higher speech energy TF segment are tending to dominate over noise. Thus, we attempt to derive F0 from such high (signal to noise ratio) SNR TF segments rather than full band signal. Our algorithm comprises of two stages: i) F0 candidate estimation for a series of TF segments; ii) F0 tracking based on the acoustic features of each TF segment as well as the F0 temporal continuity constraints. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the compared methods in terms of F0 estimation accuracy.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;scott continuity;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral density	Dongmei Wang;John H.

We are developing a set of robotic microinstruments designed to augment the performance of the surgeon during MIS. These microtools are intended to restore (or even enhance) the finger palpation capabilities that the surgeon exploits to characterize tissue hardness and to measure pulsating vessels in traditional surgery, but that are substantially reduced in MIS. This paper describes the main features and the performance of a prototype miniature robotic instrument consisting of a microfabricated microgripper, instrumented with semiconductor strain-gauges as force sensors. For the (in vitro) experiments reported in this paper, the migrogripper is mounted on a workstation and teleoperated. An haptic interface provides force-feedback to the operator. We have demonstrated that the system can discriminate tiny skin samples based on their different elastic properties, and feel microvessels based on pulsating fluid flowing through them.	experiment;haptic technology;minimally invasive education;prototype;robot;semiconductor;sensor;workstation	Arianna Menciassi;Anna Eisinberg;Giacomo Scalari;Claud Anticoli	2001		10.1109/ROBOT.2001.932620	control engineering;strain gauge;computer science;artificial intelligence;biomechanics;biological engineering;haptic technology	Robotics	74.63453322397388	-27.743342592368595	155980

Algorithms have previously been developed to change the curvature of the needle trajectory via duty-cycled spinning. However, these algorithms require continuous rotation of the steerable needle, preventing the use of instrumentation such as force-torque sensors and electromagnetic trackers, due cable wind-up issues. In this paper, we present two novel control methods for duty-cycling a steerable needle without the need for continuous rotation: bidirectional duty-cycled spinning and duty-cycled flipping. These algorithms can be implemented on existing robotic needle steering systems without hardware changes. We evaluate our algorithms using a custom hollow steerable needle, with an embedded EM tracker and a force-torque sensor. We compare the path tracking error, needle insertion forces, and needle axial rotation torques of our algorithms and found no significant differences between the two algorithms in terms of tracking error. Duty-cycled flipping has significantly lower mean insertion forces and torques than bidirectional duty-cycled spinning, and differences in insertion force and rotation torque variability were also found. These results may have interesting implications for tissue health.	algorithm;duty cycle;embedded system;robot;sensor;spatial variability;steerable filter	Ann Majewicz;Joshua J. Siegel;Andrew A.

The SFC topology is capable of covering the whole surface with only one path. In this paper, we present a new way of planning the SFC type tool path by formulating the planning task as a traveling salesman problem (TSP). The optimal path is generated in two steps. Firstly, a set of regular cutter contact (CC) points is generated on the input surface. A cutting simulation method is developed to evaluate the scallop error and determine the position of the next CC point in cross-feed direction. This method is free of local surface curvature assumptions and is therefore accurate for big cutters. Secondly, the obtained CC points are input into an efficient TSP solver LHK for the optimal CC point linking sequences. To stop the CC points from diagonal linking or penetrating linking, the Euclidean distance evaluation function for two CC points is redefined in LHK. The proposed tool path generation method is verified with several freeform surface examples; the results show that the method can automatically find the optimal feed direction and it can generate shorter tool path than the traditional SFC method. The feasibility of the proposed method is also verified by a cutting experiment. A new way of planning SFC type tool path is proposed.Cutting simulation method is proposed to evaluate the scallop error.Tool path planning task is formulated as a TSP and LKH is applied for solution.In LKH, the distance function is redefined to avoid incorrect linking problem.	apache axis;freeform surface modelling;solver	Zhiwei Lin;Jianzhong Fu;Hongyao Shen;Wenfeng Gan;Shuhua Yue	2015	Computer-Aided Design	10.1016/j.cad.2015.07.002	mathematical optimization;computer science;mathematics;travelling salesman problem;engineering drawing	EDA	69.56099214899076	-37.80585821072104	156513

In particular, a nonnegative least squares DSRF (NNLSQ-DSRF) estimation method has been shown to be robust and free from parameter tuning. In this letter, we propose an adaptive prefiltering process to complement the NNLSQ-DSRF where we attempt to linearly combine measurements and produce a filtered signal that is very likely to have a nonnegative DSRF, as well as an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. Using synthetic and field data, we demonstrate that the proposed adaptive prefilter can effectively produce signals with nonnegative DSRFs.	linear programming relaxation;non-negative least squares;signal-to-noise ratio;synthetic intelligence	Mu-Hsin Wei;Waymond R.

Given a desired final assembly, determining an appropriate assembly sequence which satisfies not only the blocking constraints but also the force constraints needs a proper model to directly provide the information needed to reason about assembly. We introduce a representation, the directional force graph, which explicitly describes how parts interact in the assembly. This representation is used to determine disassemblable parts that are naturally broken apart from an assembly by a decomposition force. A decomposition force is an external force applied to a held part(s) against a fixture part(s). The proposed approach provides a mechanism to explicitly incorporate the real-world constraints of assembly directions, fixturing, and tooling requirements into planning. We describe a complete planning algorithm and report the results.	disassembler	Sukhan Lee;Hadi Moradi	1999		10.1109/ROBOT.1999.774015	assembly modelling;engineering;graph theory;engineering drawing;manufacturing engineering;satisfiability	Robotics	69.2223680483132	-33.56042250969727	157636
f44d1e696d28d4b25b176ed75e6d03e01569c782	analysis of acoustic events in speech signals using bessel series expansion		In this paper, we propose an approach for the analysis and detection of acoustic events in speech signals using the Bessel series expansion. The acoustic events analyzed are the voice onset time (VOT) and the glottal closure instants (GCIs). The hypothesis is that the Bessel functions with their damped sinusoid-like basis functions are better suited for representing the speech signals than the sinusoidal basis functions used in the conventional Fourier representation. The speech signal is band-pass filtered by choosing the appropriate range of Bessel coefficients to obtain a narrow-band signal, which is decomposed further into amplitude modulated (AM) and frequency modulated (FM) components. The discrete energy separation algorithm (DESA) is used to compute the amplitude envelope (AE) of the narrow-band AM-FM signal. Events such as the consonant and vowel beginnings in an unvoiced stop consonant vowel (SCV) and the GCIs are derived by processing the AE of the signal. The proposed approach for the detection of the VOT using the Bessel expansion is shown to perform better than the conventional Fourier representation. The performance of the proposed GCI detection method using the Bessel series expansion is compared against some of the existing methods for various noise environments and signal-to-noise ratios.	acoustic cryptanalysis;bessel filter	Chetana Prakash;Dhananjaya N.

When the contact of the arm with an object occurs, local impedance algorithm provides active compliance of corresponding robot arm joint. Thus, the whole structure of the manipulator can safely interact with unstructured environment. A novel variable control strategy was elaborated to increase the robot functionality and to achieve human-like dynamics of interaction. In the paper, we detail the design procedure of 4-DOF robot arm and optical torque sensors. The experimental results of variable joint impedance control show that proposed approach not only provides safe interaction of entire structure of robot arm with a person, but also improves the effectiveness of contact task performance, enables thus to contact with environment in a delicate manner.	algorithm;characteristic impedance;control theory;experiment;human–computer interaction;human–robot interaction;nominal impedance;robot;robotic arm;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio	Dzmitry Tsetserukou;Riichiro Tadakuma;Hiroyuki Kajimoto;Naoki Kawakami;Susumu Tachi	2007	2007 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation	10.1109/CIRA.2007.382885	bang-bang robot;robot end effector;simulation;robotic arm;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;arm solution;manipulator;electrical impedance;control theory;anthropometry;robot control;intelligent control	Robotics	69.90736629659563	-25.2305597475261	158087

This work is a novel robotic application. In vivo microscopy is very in demand due to its potential impact on biological research [1]. However, it has turned out that in vivo microscopy is significantly disturbed by the motion of the imaged tissue of a living animal. The proposed system virtually removes the unwanted motion by synchronizing the motion of the objective lens with it. In order to realize this idea, we have developed a simple contact-type sensor for estimating the motion of organs, and also made a motion compensator for moving the objective lens. Sensing and compensating have been accomplished for 3-D translational motion. Not only laboratory tests with artificial motion, but also in vivo experiments show the successful motion canceling effect of the proposed system.	experiment;motion compensation;robot;video-in video-out	Sungon Lee;Takeshi Ozaki;Yoshihiko Nakamura	2008	2008 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2008.4651123	control engineering;computer vision;computer science;microscopy;motion estimation;lens;strain;in vivo;optics;motion compensation;image stabilization	Robotics	75.33655530084353	-29.750279944499844	158098

Just noticeable difference (JND) characteristics of human auditory system can be used to efficiently remove spatial perceptual redundancy in the quantization of spatial parameters. However, the quantization step sizes of spatial parameters in current SAC methods are not well correlated with the JND characteristics. It results in either spatial perceptual distortion or inefficient compression. A JND-based spatial parameter quantization (JSPQ) method is proposed in this paper. The quantization step sizes of spatial parameters are assigned according to JND values of azimuths in a full circle. The quantization codebook size of JSPQ was 56.7 % lower than one of the quantization codebooks of MPEG surround.

30aa2dac47b412987e584dcf714614abfdf6be3a	a soft multi-axial force sensor to assess tissue properties in realtime		Objective: This work presents a method for the use of a soft multi-axis force sensor to determine tissue trauma in Minimally Invasive Surgery. Despite recent developments, there is a lack of effective haptic sensing technology employed in instruments for Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS). There is thus a clear clinical need to increase the provision of haptic feedback and to perform real-time analysis of haptic data to inform the surgical operator. This paper establishes a methodology for the capture of real-time data through use of an inexpensive prototype grasper. Fabricated using soft silicone and 3D printing, the sensor is able to precisely detect compressive and shear forces applied to the grasper face. The sensor is based upon a magnetic soft tactile sensor, using variations in the local magnetic field to determine force. The performance of the sensing element is assessed and a linear response was observed, with a max hysteresis error of 4.1% of the maximum range of the sensor. To assess the potential of the sensor for surgical sensing, a simulated grasping study was conducted using ex vivo porcine tissue. Two previously established metrics for prediction of tissue trauma were obtained and compared from recorded data. The normalized stress rate (kPa.mm−1) of compression and the normalized stress relaxation (ΔσR) were analyzed across repeated grasps. The sensor was able to obtain measures in agreement with previous research, demonstrating future potential for this approach. In summary this work demonstrates that inexpensive soft sensing systems can be used to instrument surgical tools and thus assess properties such as tissue health. This could help reduce surgical error and thus benefit patients.	3d printing;apache axis;haptic technology;hysteresis;linear programming relaxation;minimally invasive education;prototype;real-time data;real-time transcription;tactile sensor;video-in video-out	Dominic Jones;Hongbo Wang;Ali Alazmani;Peter R.

For any (non-empty) subset of S pc , the strategy tests if the PCs in the set form a possible CF by analyzing the geometrical contact constraints. The obtained set of geometrically valid CFs can serve as input to a veriier based on force sensingg3, 5] which will identify the actual CF occurred. Our analyses of contact constraints are complete and general. The results demonstrate that despite uncertainties in object locations, if two or more PCs are formed between two objects, their relative location in many cases is xed or can take up to only 4 solutions. In such cases, we can accurately identify a valid CF. From a diierent perspective, these results could also be useful in grasp planning. Our future work includes taking into account modeling uncertainties of objects and extending this method to three-dimensional objects.	compactflash	Jing Xiao;Lixin Zhang	1995		10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525669	robot;control engineering;simulation;computational geometry;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence	Robotics	69.00400804325099	-33.79909637945161	158793

Test results show that the system is working sufficiently for adapting the energy storage capacity of the WalkMECHadapt thanks to the simple nature of the controller architecture.	source-to-source compiler;test set	Ramazan Unal;F.

Using the example of manufacturing carbon-fibre-reinforced polymers (CFRP) which represents a complex, currently hardly automated process, we present a backward-oriented approach for offline programming of complex manufacturing tasks. We focus on an automatic process definition which is supported by expert knowledge where required. Due to domain specific software modules, user interaction is intuitive and tailored to CFRP experts. This leads to significant time-savings compared to currently used teach-in approaches. Moreover, we introduce an extensible offline programming platform which is able to meet the high requirements of CFRP manufacturing.	algorithm;computation;curve fitting;heart rate variability;industrial robot;online and offline;requirement;robot end effector;text simplification	Ludwig Nägele;Miroslav Macho;Andreas Angerer;Alwin Hoffmann;Michael Vistein;Manfred Schönheits;Wolfgang Reif	2015	2015 6th International Conference on Automation, Robotics and Applications (ICARA)	10.1109/ICARA.2015.7081135	programming;computer science;artificial intelligence;automation;manufacturing;robot kinematics	Robotics	69.87486895480305	-32.943651969320634	159652

Thus, the need for the robot to replace the person in numerous instances has emerged. Recently the mission demands of the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) competition showed that robots need many control methods to replace humans in disaster environments. Thus, in this paper, a versatile admittance control method for various missions such as opening doors, drilling, and removing obstacles is introduced. It acts as a virtual admittance in a properly selected dimension according to the given task in Cartesian space. The door opening task was performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, where the three-dimensional admittance control and a trajectory generation algorithm were applied. The result showed that the performance and adaptation were comparable to human motion.	algorithm;darpa robotics challenge;humans;kinesiology;robot	Deok-Won Lee;Hyun-Min Kwon;Hyeong-Seok Jeon;Yong-Jun Jeong;Chang-Hyun Oh;Lo-Un Lee;Ki-Won Oh;Yong-Jae Kim	2015	2015 12th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)	10.1109/URAI.2015.7358830	simulation;reactive oxygen species;artificial intelligence	Robotics	70.6764177722481	-24.543207698097056	159715

With our present day spectral obstruction, the methods of traditional temporal filtering appeared ineffective. The signals measurement by array sensors and space filtering is an effective alternative to overcome the preceding problems. Several strategies are necessary to carry out a reliable spatial filtering in a constrained environment.

To improve the effect of rehabilitation, robots should promote patient participation and provide compliant assistance. This paper proposes an adaptive admittance control scheme (AACS) consisting of an admittance filter, inner position controller, and electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal model (EDMM). The admittance filter generates the subject's intended motion according to the joint torque estimated by the EDMM. The inner position controller tracks the intended motion, and its parameters are adjusted according to the estimated joint stiffness. Eight healthy subjects were instructed to wear the ankle exoskeleton robot, and they completed a series of sinusoidal tracking tasks involving ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. The robot was controlled by the AACS and a non-adaptive admittance control scheme (NAACS) at four fixed parameter levels. The tracking performance was evaluated using the jerk value, position error, interaction torque, and EMG levels of the tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius (GAS). For the NAACS, the jerk value and position error increased with the parameter levels, and the interaction torque and EMG levels of the TA tended to decrease. In contrast, the AACS could maintain a moderate jerk value, position error, interaction torque, and TA EMG level. These results demonstrate that the AACS achieves a good tradeoff between accurate tracking and compliant assistance because it can produce a real-time response to stiffness changes in the ankle joint. The AACS can alleviate the conflict between accurate tracking and compliant assistance and has potential for application in robot-assisted rehabilitation.	aacs encryption key controversy;ankle joint structure;basal ganglia diseases;cerebrovascular accident;compliance behavior;congenital musculoskeletal anomalies;controllers;data management plan;electromyography;experiment;gastrocnemius muscle structure;joint stiffness;lopes (exoskeleton);lumbar anterior root stimulator;manuscripts;neurorobotics;o-ethyl s-(2-dimethylaminoethyl) methylphosphonothioate;patients;population parameter;real-time transcription;reed–solomon error correction;rehabilitation robotics;robot (device);sy telecom;sy term type;spinal cord injuries;spinal cord neoplasms;tibialis anterior muscle structure;exoskeleton;non-t, non-b, calla positive childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia	Shaowei Yao;Yu Zhuang;Zhijun Li;Rong Song	2018		10.3389/fnbot.2018.00016	control theory;machine learning;artificial intelligence;admittance;computer science;joint stiffness;torque;jerk;ankle;robot control;exoskeleton;control theory	Robotics	70.56845988489205	-27.225526488288914	160235

The recently proposed perception-based clipping algorithm has been shown to significantly outperform other clipping techniques in terms of objective sound quality scores. However, the real-time solution of the optimization problems that form the core of this algorithm, poses a challenge. In this paper, a fast gradient projection optimization method is proposed and incorporated into the perception-based clipping algorithm. The optimization method will be shown to have an extremely low computational complexity per iteration, allowing the perception-based clipping algorithm to be applied in real-time for a broad range of clipping factors.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;gradient;iteration;mathematical optimization;real-time clock;real-time locating system;signal processing;sound quality	Bruno Defraene;Toon van Waterschoot;Moritz Diehl;Marc Moonen	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5946408	optimization problem;computer vision;mathematical optimization;nonlinear distortion;audio signal processing;computer science;clipping;gradient method;theoretical computer science;psychoacoustics;signal processing;clipping;accuracy and precision;computational complexity theory	Robotics	78.70092461411382	-35.98693790392147	162163
9618503a15fc30c3311190f02ed00832b4e4800b	adaptive filtering of evoked potentials using higher-order adaptive signal enhancer with genetic-type variable step-size prefilter	variable step size algorithm;evoked potentials;higher order statistics;adaptive signal enhancer;genetic type	An adaptive signal enhancer based on third-order statistics with a genetictype, variable step-size prefilter is introduced to recover evoked potentials (EPs). EPs are usually embedded in the ongoing electroencephalogram with a very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As a higher-order statistics technique has a natural tolerance to Gaussian noise, it is applicable for filtering EPs. An adaptive signal enhancer based on third-order statistics was used as the major filter in this study. Howver, the efficiency of the adaptive signal enhancer was reduced when the total power of uncorrelated noises was large. To improve the performance for EPs under poor SNR, a low-noise signal is required. Therefore a prefilter with a genetic-type, variable step-size algorithm was employed to enhance the SNR of the signal in this study. The fundamental idea of a genetic-type, variable step-size algorithm is that its step-sizes are regularly readjusted to optimum. Therefore this algorithm can be used as a prefilter with different noise levels. Experimental results showed that, for filtering EPs, the proposed scheme is superior to the adaptive signal enhancer with a normalised least mean square algorithm.	acoustic evoked brain stem potentials;action potential;adaptive filter;algorithm;electroencephalography;embedded system;embedding;enhancer of transcription;mean squared error;noise-induced hearing loss;normal statistical distribution;signal-to-noise ratio;type variable	Bor-Shyh Lin;Bor-Shing Lin;Fok-Ching Chong;Feipei Lai	2005	Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing	10.1007/BF02351038	control engineering;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics	ML	81.19145416973168	-30.637307124792432	162512

Then the smoothed estimates are evaluated by means of backward-time filtering of the results of tracking. Finally, the estimate of the instantaneous fundamental frequency is computed as a weighted sum of partial estimates. It is shown that the smoothing and weighting steps significantly increase both accuracy and robustness of frequency estimation.	algorithm;robustness (computer science);smoothing;spectral density estimation;weight function	Maciej Niedzwiecki;Michal Stanislaw Meller	2012	2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)	10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310649	econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics;smoothing	Robotics	81.74792960617542	-34.50196458662913	162725

The device is designed to support him by holding his upper body weight and reducing his inner force. It turns to the reduction of a compression force of his lower back discs, which is a major factor of a lower back injury. In a lifting-up motion, he twists and bends his body, which means three-dimensional motion analysis is necessary for the compression force analysis. However, most of related works on the compression force analysis have been carried out in a vertical plane. For understanding the characteristics of a lifting-up motion better, this paper presents three-dimensional analysis of it. Using a motion capture system, we measured a sequence of body positions with and without the power assist device in different object location and mass, as well as surface EMG (electro-myogram) signals. The compression force of the lower back discs is estimated by a three-dimensional biomechanical human body model utilizing the position data. The results show that the range of the twist angle of his body is about 30 degree in maximum and the compression force increases about 10% due to the twist angle. With respect to the effect of the power assist device, the magnitude of the surface EMG signals of spine muscles is decreased when wearing the power assist device. It means the proposed power assist device gives a good support to him.	electromyography;human body weight;lambda lifting;motion capture;motion planning;wearable computer	Keitaro Naruse;Satoshi Kawai;Takuji Kukichi	2005	2005 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2005.1545503	control engineering;motion control;three-dimensional space;computer vision;motion capture;simulation;computer science;engineering;body weight	Robotics	72.71320313727746	-26.257315063434106	163299

The MARSE-4 has 4DoFs and is able to assist elbow (flexion/extension), forearm (pronation/supination) and wrist joint movements (radial/ulnar deviation, and flexion/extension). Modified Denavit-Hartenberg conventions were used in the kinematic modeling of the exoskeleton. In control, a nonlinear computed torque control and a linear PID control techniques were employed to maneuver the MARSE-4 to follow the desired trajectory. Experimental results show that the MARSE-4 can efficiently track the desired trajectories as generated by mExoArm and therefore guarantee to tele-operate the MARSE to deliver passive therapy for wrist, elbow, and forearm movements.	control theory;nonlinear system;pid;prototype;radial (radio);robot;television	Mohammad Habibur Rahman;Thierry Kittel-Ouimet;Maarouf Saad;Jean-Pierre Kenné;Philippe S.

To follow human motion, the unit patterns of the trunk, the waist and the lower limbs are generated and synthesized. During the follow motion, the biped robots are balanced by the stabilization control that calculates the combined motion of the trunk and the waist that compensates for the moments produced by the motion of the lower limbs. For confirmation of the follow-walking motion, we have developed a life-sized humanoid robot, WABIAN-RII (WAseda BIped humANoid robot-Revised II).

Despite knowledge of contact sensation in air, little is known about contact sensing underwater and the impact of fluid on both the robotic probe and the target object. The objective of this work is to understand the effects of fluidic loading, fin webbing, and target object geometry on strain sensation within compliant robotic fins and beams during obstacle contact. General descriptions of obstacle contact were sought for strain measurements in fins and beams. Multiple phases of contact were characterized where the robot, fluid, and object interact to affect sensory signals. Unlike in air, the underwater structure-fluid-structure interaction (SFSI) caused changes to strain in each phase of contact. The addition of webbing to beams created a mechanical coupling between adjacent beams, which changed contact strains. Complex obstacle geometries tended to make contact less apparent and caused stretch in fins. This work demonstrates several effects of fluidic loading on strain sensing with compliant robotic beams and fins as they contact obstacles in air and underwater, and provides guidance for future work in underwater active sensing with compliant manipulators.	blackfin;compliance behavior;description;drug vehicle;eels;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;haptic device component;haptic technology;interaction;linear programming relaxation;perturbation theory;physical phenomena;robot (device);tissue membrane;velocity (software development);velocity obstacle;webbing;sensor (device)	Jeff C.

We have extended the virtual coupling by updating the spring stiffness, sometimes used to simulate compliance of a material, depending on the direction between the proxy and the probe. This anisotropic variation of the stiffness is used in exploring inhomogeneities beneath the surface allowing detection of rigid structures even when they are obscured by another structure beneath the surface. In addition, we also compensate for the energy variation of the spring to maintain passivity and increase realism. User studies were performed to survey the success rate in the detection of obscured rigid bodies beneath the surface with the modified virtual coupling algorithm and the improvement of shape perception for sub-surface objects with the additional energy compensation term providing gradient information. We also discuss potential benefits of the proposed methods as basic extensions to well-known haptic rendering algorithms which are both simpler and yield improved performance over traditional deformation simulation techniques.	algorithm;gradient descent;haptic technology;simulation;usability testing	Umut Koçak;Karljohan E.

The IC model is a rudimentary and noise-free description of balance behavior in the frequency domain, where a stable model representation is not guaranteed. In this study, we conducted firstly time-domain simulations with added noise, and secondly robot experiments by implementing the IC model in a real-world robot (PostuRob II) to test the validity and stability of the model in the time domain and for real world situations. Balance behavior of seven healthy participants was measured during upright stance by applying pseudorandom continuous support surface rotations. System identification and parameter estimation were used to describe the balance behavior with the IC model in the frequency domain. The IC model with the estimated parameters from human experiments was implemented in Simulink for computer simulations including noise in the time domain and robot experiments using the humanoid robot PostuRob II. Again, system identification and parameter estimation were used to describe the simulated balance behavior. Time series, Frequency Response Functions, and estimated parameters from human experiments, computer simulations, and robot experiments were compared with each other. The computer simulations showed similar balance behavior and estimated control parameters compared to the human experiments, in the time and frequency domain. Also, the IC model was able to control the humanoid robot by keeping it upright, but showed small differences compared to the human experiments in the time and frequency domain, especially at high frequencies. We conclude that the IC model, a descriptive model in the frequency domain, can imitate human balance behavior also in the time domain, both in computer simulations with added noise and real world situations with a humanoid robot. This provides further evidence that the IC model is a valid description of human balance control.	channel (communications);computer simulation;description;entity handling - upright;estimation theory;experiment;frequency response;humanoid robot;population parameter;pseudorandomness;rem sleep behavior disorder;simulink;stable model semantics;system identification;time series;negative regulation of voltage-gated calcium channel activity	Jantsje H.

74d1f919c4f66fc8e51b00bd1cc5c4d330ef25f0	design and performance evaluation of a master controller for endovascular catheterization		It is difficult to manipulate a flexible catheter to target a position within a patient’s complicated and delicate vessels. However, few researchers focused on the controller designs with much consideration of the natural catheter manipulation skills obtained from manual catheterization. Also, the existing catheter motion measurement methods probably lead to the difficulties in designing the force feedback device. Additionally, the commercially available systems are too expensive which makes them cost prohibitive to most hospitals. This paper presents a simple and cost-effective master controller for endovascular catheterization that can allow the interventionalists to apply the conventional pull, push and twist of the catheter used in current practice. A catheter-sensing unit (used to measure the motion of the catheter) and a force feedback unit (used to provide a sense of resistance force) are both presented. A camera was used to allow a contactless measurement avoiding additional friction, and the force feedback in the axial direction was provided by the magnetic force generated between the permanent magnets and the powered coil. Performance evaluation of the controller was evaluated by first conducting comparison experiments to quantify the accuracy of the catheter-sensing unit, and then conducting several experiments to evaluate the force feedback unit. From the experimental results, the minimum and the maximum errors of translational displacement were 0.003 mm (0.01 %) and 0.425 mm (1.06 %), respectively. The average error was 0.113 mm (0.28 %). In terms of rotational angles, the minimum and the maximum errors were $$0.39^{\circ }$$ 0 . 39 ∘ (0.33 %) and $$7.2^{\circ }$$ 7 . 2 ∘ (6 %), respectively. The average error was $$3.61^{\circ }$$ 3 . 61 ∘ (3.01 %). The force resolution was approximately 25 mN and a maximum current of 3A generated an approximately 1.5 N force. Based on analysis of requirements and state-of-the-art computer-assisted and robot-assisted training systems for endovascular catheterization, a new master controller with force feedback interface was proposed to maintain the natural endovascular catheterization skills of the interventionalists.	behavior;blood vessel;coil device component;contactless smart card;controllers;displacement mapping;experiment;friction;genetic translation process;haptic technology;interface device component;magnet device component;maxillary right first molar abutment;patients;performance evaluation;power (psychology);radial (radio);requirement;robot	Jin Guo;Shuxiang Guo;Takashi Tamiya;Hideyuki Hirata;Hidenori Ishihara	2015	International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery	10.1007/s11548-015-1211-4	simulation;surgery	Robotics	73.53605603668177	-28.886103825668556	166012

Gripper design is an important and often overlooked aspect of the design of a complete assembly system. Here we present guidelines which can be applied to a wide variety of grippers and are divided into two major categories: Those that improve system throughput and those that increase system reliability. Designs of several grippers, currently being used in a modular manufacturing workcell, are presented as examples of the application of the guidelines to real world problems.	throughput	Greg C.

These factors become particularly important when deploying the surgical system through a flexible path to areas with a tight workspace such as the stomach or oesophagus where high dexterity, flexibility, accuracy and stability are required. This paper presents a flexible access robot combining articulated joints and continuum flexible section for both transluminal and endoluminal surgeries. Kinematic model and control strategy for the flexible robot are described in the paper. The experiment simulating a transoral gastric procedure demonstrates great flexibility and dexterity of the device. The results show that good accuracy and repetitive control of the device are achieved, which demonstrate the potential application of the device for transluminal or endoluminal surgery.	algorithm;apache continuum;control theory;repeatability;robot;simulation;software deployment;system integration;workspace	Carlo Seneci;Jianzhong Shang;Konrad Leibrandt;Valentina Vitiello;Nisha Patel;Ara Darzi;Julian Teare;Guang-Zhong Yang	2014	2014 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2014.6942727	engineering	Robotics	72.78667655670327	-28.053937798228205	167076

For these reasons, they were proposed as nanoplasters for localized drug release or as a new solution for closing endoluminal surgical wounds. This paper presents the fabrication and characterization of free-standing nanosheets loaded with iron oxide nanoparticles, which can be manipulated in liquid environment by means of magnetic fields. A theoretical model of magnetic manipulation of the nanosheet is proposed and validated by dragging the film with a permanent magnet mounted on an industrial robotic arm. Controlling the magnetic sheet in liquid environment represents a first step towards the application of these nanostructures as free-standing carriers to be released and magnetically controlled in endoluminal surgery or as plasters with nanometric thickness to be delivered in situ on surgical incisions. Furthermore, these magnetic nanofilms can be adapted and used as micro and nanocomponents for the design of a novel generation of magnetic actuated polymeric microrobots.	closing (morphology);computer simulation;drag and drop;hall effect sensor;industrial robot;microbotics;robotic arm;test bench;theory;thickness (graph theory)	Virgilio Mattoli;Edoardo Sinibaldi;Virginia Pensabene;Silvia Taccola;Arianna Menciassi;Paolo Dario	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509933	magnetic field;nanotechnology;biological engineering;quantum mechanics	Robotics	75.99697142170484	-25.210739199732757	167204

This method is based on minima-controlled recursive averaging (MCRA) whereby an accurate, robust and efficient noise power spectrum estimation is demonstrated. We propose a two-stage technique to prevent the appearance of musical noise after enhancement. This algorithm filters the noisy speech to achieve a robust signal with minimum distortion in the first stage. Subsequently, it estimates the residual noise using MCRA and removes it with spectral subtraction. The proposed Filtered MCRA (FMCRA) performance is evaluated using objective tests on the Aurora database under various noisy environments. These measures indicate the higher output SNR and lower output residual noise and distortion.	algorithm;aurora;distortion;filtered-popping recursive transition network;maxima and minima;noise power;recursion (computer science);signal-to-noise ratio;spectral density estimation;speech enhancement;stationary process	Negar Ghourchian;Sid-Ahmed Selouani;Douglas D.

The watermark is embedded in the time domain of an audio signal by the normally used spread spectrum technique. The scheme of detection is an improvement of the conventional correlation detector. A high-pass filter is applied along with the linear prediction error filter for whitening the audio signal and an adaptive threshold is chosen for decision comparing. Experimental results show that our detection algorithm outperforms the conventional one not only because it improves the robustness to normal attacks but also because it can provide the robustness to time-invariant pitch-scale modification.	algorithm	Lili Li;Xiangzhong Fang	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e91-a.11.3389	computer vision;speech recognition;telecommunications;time domain;computer science;electrical engineering;thresholding;high-pass filter;spread spectrum	Vision	79.12068108214227	-32.41214420845527	167801

The approach is used to explore an anthropomorphic model, and to then reason by analogy to discover a robust control model for robotic arm motion. This approach uses human-like joint motion profiles and sensory information of all joints, evaluates the weighted work done by each joint in cooperative motion, and then synthesizes a minimal effort motion trajectory to precisely and efficiently position the robotic arm end effector. This sensor-based approach significantly reduces the computational requirements for such cooperative motion. The result is a less complex, faster, and adaptive control process. A pressure-servoed hydraulic motion system has been developed to implement the movement strategy. This is a major step toward a long-term research goal of conceptualizing in an intelligent way to implement a manufacturing task. >	intelligent control;robot;robotic arm	Michael C.

It is supported by the similarities it shares with Gaussian unintelligible signals in terms of the Probability Density Function and the entropy. It is feasible for an audio signal to imitate the behavior of a Gaussian noise signal, and then the residual intelligibility is zero. Our proposed scheme, termed ASGI (Audio Scrambling by Gaussian signal Imitation), is tested with four different music genres, and the experimental tests reveal that the scrambled audio signals look like Gaussian noise signals and have high scrambling degrees. Additionally, our scheme preserves the advantages of imitation-based scrambling schemes.	audio signal processing	L. M.

A CCD camera is used to track the deformation of the mechanism as it is used to manipulate objects in a micro/meso-scale robotic manipulation test-bed. By observing the displacements of select points in the mechanism, the manipulation forces can be estimated.

The harmonic and transient components are described by separate models which are built from a common sinusoidal basis modified by a joint action of single and linear piecewise time polynomials respectively. A single polynomial accounts for slow and continuous signal time variations, while various piecewise polynomials can capture fast signal changes on smaller subintervals within the analysis window. The resulting model is linear-in-parameters and the solution to the corresponding linear system of equations provides correct model parameter estimates according to the signal content in the analysis window. The model is extended to deal with mixtures of sounds, where harmonics clustered in a small bandwidth are jointly modeled as a single harmonic. The comparative results suggest that the proposed model outperforms two reference modeling methods in terms of modeling errors and number of parameters.	bandwidth (signal processing);continuous signal;decibel;linear least squares (mathematics);linear system;onset (audio);polynomial;simpl;signal-to-noise ratio;situated;stationary process;system of linear equations	Miroslav Zivanovic;Johan Schoukens	2012	IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASL.2011.2174228	system of linear equations;mathematical optimization;reference model;time–frequency analysis;piecewise linear function;audio signal processing;harmonic analysis;errors-in-variables models;control theory;mathematics;estimation theory;statistics;polynomial	Vision	81.49725439628423	-35.30825369892218	169048
fcea9f527420825531221dcb771d8de15c825348	initial investigation of a self-adjusting wrist control system to maintain prosthesis terminal device orientation relative to the ground reference frame		Lack of adequate wrist control in prostheses forces people with upper limb amputations to use compensatory movements that eventually result in overuse injuries. This is partly because conventional control of myoelectric wrists involves switching between directly controlling the wrist and fixing the wrist relative to the forearm. We propose that by implementing a wrist that is able to maintain the hand's orientation relative to the ground reference frame, here termed a self-adjusting wrist, users may see benefits in terms of both compensatory movements and ease of control. In this design study, we describe a simple initial implementation of a self-adjusting wrist. We then introduce and compare five control methods for the system. These methods were tested with six able-bodied participants who used a desk-mounted robotic arm to perform an object transfer and manipulation task. Quantitative and qualitative analyses coupled with user feedback suggest that a self-adjusting wrist may reduce task completion time and number of control interactions, and increase user satisfaction compared to conventional switching-based control. Our results indicate that use of a momentary switch to toggle a robotic hand's orientation between being fixed to the ground reference frame and being either fixed to the forearm reference frame or employing direct wrist control may be the best choice for a self-adjusting wrist. More broadly, by considering a wrist that automatically and continually orients itself to the user and their environment, this work contributes insight about how prostheses and other assistive robotic technology may intelligently adapt in real time to support the daily-life tasks faced by their users.	control system;control theory;feature toggle;frame grabber;interaction;reference frame (video);repetitive strain;robot;robotic arm;spatial reference system;switch	Jintao Shen;Michael Rory Dawson;Glyn Murgatroyd;Jason P.

4c36be7d431aa66c4ad90454d81f384701264ad5	automated tether management system for extravehicular activities	management system	Abstract#R##N##R##N#Safe extravehicular activity (EVA) requires astronauts to employ tethers to ensure proximity to their spacecraft. This research strives to improve EVA efficiency by allowing crew members to remotely release and retract their safety tether from extended distances using a tether management system consisting of a remotely releasable robotic gripper and a retractor that controls the length of tether. This circumvents the current need to travel back to the tether anchor and manually release the tether, which requires the crew member to travel three times further than necessary. The automated tether management system is essentially a multifunctional teleoperated robotic system that has the potential to improve EVA efficiency, reduce crew-member fatigue, and improve efficiency of existing robots such as Robonaut. Design and performance requirements are specified to comply with current safety standards. The multifunctional gripper is designed to provide fail-safe self-locking positive engagement on a variety of spacecraft anchors. The retractor employs motorized and passive retraction to minimize power consumption, allow the retractor to mimic existing retractable safety tethers functionality, and facilitate control over gripper flight. A nonconductive fiber-optic core structural tether is designed to transmit commands to the gripper while reducing the risk of developing electrical charges at orbital velocities. Experiments in a simulated microgravity environment evaluate behavior during gripper release and retraction and provide guidelines for improved system operation. Based on these guidelines, the system is then further optimized via simulation for improved retraction considering orbital dynamics. These results provide a recommended operating envelope to allow safe automated gripper retraction. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.		Mark A. Minor;Christopher R. Hirschi	2007	J.

This mechanism enables a humanoid robot to contact with the floor at points of a multilink, namely the toe pad and toe tips, similar to human motion. Using this toe mechanism, a major part of the reaction force acts on the non-movable portion of a link rather than on the toe tip. Because of this, it is possible to decrease the constraint force acting on the joint. At the same time, the following multiple roles of the toe are expected: one is to generate a large kicking force at the toe pad, and another is to maintain multipoint contact with the floor by the toe joint control. The authors have also designed and developed the proposed toe mechanism for an actual miniature humanoid robot.	humanoid robot;kinesiology;linkage (software);multipoint ground;point-to-point protocol;radial (radio);simulation	Koji Yamamoto;Tomoyuki Sugihara;Yoshihiko Nakamura	2007	2007 7th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots	10.1109/ICHR.2007.4813902	simulation;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence	Robotics	68.54040300019824	-24.15619681254639	169453

In our separation method, a mixture of speeches is approximated with periodic signals with time-varying amplitude. The decomposition with the periodic signal model is performed under a sparsity penalty. Due to the sparsity penalty, a segment of the speech mixture is decomposed into periodic signals, each of them is a component of the individual speaker. For speech separation, we introduce the clustering using a K-means algorithm for the set of the periodic signals. After the clustering, each cluster is assigned to its corresponding speaker using codebooks that contain spectral features of the speakers.

The experimental results in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) show that our method outperforms MaxVQ with less computational cost for assignment of speech components.	akaike information criterion;algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;cluster analysis;codebook;consistency model;distortion;etsi satellite digital radio;experiment;google map maker;k-means clustering;mixture model;powered speakers;scott continuity;sparse matrix;spectral density	Makoto Nakashizuka;Hiroyuki Okumura;Youji Iiguni	2009	2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference			ML	82.33297032335511	-36.157343035502805	170084
8cf12140c9b1eb7b6ba34896f370f081b0385142	nonlinear object-oriented modeling based optimal control of the heart: performing precise preload manipulation maneuvers using a ventricular assist device		This paper presents a simulation study of an optimal control approach being applied to control the volume trajectory of a heart's ventricle using a ventricular assist device (VAD). Usually VADs are used for heart failure therapy. However, in this study a novel VAD application within the context of animal trials will be investigated. Preload (the volume of blood within the ventricle just before the contraction) is an important determinant of heart function and therefore an interesting quantity to be manipulated in trials. To overcome limitations of classical preload manipulation techniques we propose to use a VAD to manipulate preload. The aim of this study will be to find the input trajectories for the VAD which are required to precisely hit specific preload values. Two different test scenarios were defined: the first scenario aims at resembling a traditional preload reduction technique. The second scenario defines a preload progression which is not possible to realize with traditional preload manipulation techniques. Besides the test scenarios, a comparison to experimentally obtained data is drawn. Object-oriented Modélica models of a simplified cardiovascular system and the VAD were developed to formulate a nonlinear optimal control problem. A fully open-source software tool-chain was used to automatically discretize the problem into a collocation scheme and to generate the necessary inputs for the nonlinear optimization solver. This tool-chain includes the software packages JModelica, CasADi and Ipopt. Object-oriented modeling in combination with the automated tool-chain allow for easy and fast modifications of the underlying models as well as the introduction of new objectives. Hence, the presented approach can easily be modified to be applied to other scopes of VAD and cardiovascular research.	casadi;collocation;color gradient;discretization;experiment;ipopt;jmodelica.org;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;open-source software;optimal control;preload (software);programming tool;simulation;solver;toolchain;voice activity detection	Jonas Gesenhues;Marc Hein;Moriz Habigt;Mare Mechelinck;Thivaharan Albin;Dirk Abel	2016	2016 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2016.7810603	control engineering;engineering;control theory;biological engineering	SE	70.46236098962514	-29.25440156380145	170093

Instead, it describes an exploratory process and the lessons learned while designing a compliant mechanism for a dynamic hand orthosis. Tools from engineering optimization and rapid prototyping techniques were used, with the goal to design a mechanism to compensate for hypertonic or contracted finger muscles. Results show that the mechanism did not reach its design constraints, mostly because it could not provide for the necessary stiffness and compliance at the same time. Hence, the presented approach is more suited for design problems with either lower forces or less displacement. It was concluded that physiological stiffness models are an important part when modeling hand orthoses. Moreover, further research on compliant mechanisms in dynamic hand orthoses should focus on the feasibility of implementing more complex three-dimensional shapes, i.e., compliant shell mechanisms.	3d printing;compliance behavior;displacement mapping;exploratory testing;joint stiffness;mathematical optimization;muscle;orthotic devices;performance tuning;prototype;psychologic displacement;rapid prototyping;vii;disease transmission;ribosome-associated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process	Ronald A.

In executing microassembly processes useful forces to sense are the grasping force, i.e. the force with which the object is gripped, and the interaction force, i.e. the force resulting from the interaction of the gripped object with the environment. Based on a general assembly process analysis, the requirements for force sensing are defined. Next, devices are shown which allow the identification of the contact forces and object positions.	dimes;haptic technology;lina;process group;requirement;robot end effector;sensor	Marcello Porta;Marcel Tichem	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-11598-1_23	control engineering;computer vision;simulation;engineering	Robotics	74.07992121388168	-26.368951717156627	171372

This kind of actuation is desired in surgical robots. The cables in these robots must remain under tension at all times in order to have optimum performance. Thus, the knowledge of initial value of cable tension is significant. Moreover, in surgery, haptic feedback is vital for diagnosis of healthy tissue and to prevent damaging tissue with excessive force. In this paper, cable pretension was estimated indirectly by estimating stiffness parameter of cables. Then, external forces acting on the robot were estimated in all four quadrants by using cable stretch and dynamic-based methods utilizing system dynamics and unscented Kalman filter (UKF). We assessed the effectiveness of these methods on the third link of Raven-II surgical robot platform. From experiments with the tension estimation technique, it can be determined if the cable pretension is in the safe range. Also, both the cable stretch and UKF-based methods can be used to estimate external forces on all quadrants.	category 5 cable;elasticity (data store);experiment;haptic technology;kalman filter;robot;system dynamics	Mohammad Haghighipanah;Muneaki Miyasaka;Blake Hannaford	2017	IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters	10.1109/LRA.2017.2676347	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	73.63673076919481	-28.200860852975303	171397

In spite of its pleasant properties, it has been rarely used thus far, probably because of its lack of formalism. This paper provides an attempt of formalisation by means of the Wold-Cramér decomposition of nonstationary processes. This leads to a simple definition, and enables the deduction of numerous properties. An estimator of the spectral kurtosis is also proposed, based on the short-time Fourier transform. Its scope of validity and statistical performance are investigated in detail. Finally, the value of the spectral kurtosis is illustrated on an industrial application.	detection theory;formal system;heuristic;matched filter;natural deduction;programming paradigm;ski combinator calculus;semantics (computer science);short-time fourier transform;stationary process;wiener filter	Jérôme Antoni	2004	2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference		speech recognition;calculus;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	80.5838460670447	-35.368624912634644	171490

Since the conventional robot control command generation for the spray-painting is manually performed by skilled workers using a teaching-playback function of a robot controller, it is a time consuming and experience required process. The study aims at generating the robot control commands without any special knowledge on spray-painting, in the case of bumpers of a car as an example of sculptured surfaces. The system can automatically generate a spraying path for the air spray gun on the basis of CAD date of the workpiece, and change the spraying path into robot control commands. From experimental results, the system was found to be effective in painting bumpers of a car with uniform paint thickness.	industrial robot	Naoki Asakawa;Yoshimi Takeuchi	1997		10.1109/ROBOT.1997.619061	control engineering;robot end effector;simulation;electronic design automation;painting;shape;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;robot control;manufacturing engineering	Robotics	68.82573579105345	-32.58337851582014	171756
59378a305ca68d404f162bd93739d88c8afbe7f8	improvement in stiffness performance of force feedback devices with ultrasonic motors		In the design of a haptic device, it is difficult to achieve simultaneously high stiffness and low friction and inertia. In our previous research, we proposed a co-actuation method to overcome this difficulty. The method uses a physical constraint to simulate hard contact and allows the device move freely in free motion space by keeping a clearance between the physical constraint and the link of the device. A stiffness of 40N/mm and back-driving friction of less than 0.3N have been achieved in a co-actuation module of one degree-of-freedom (DOF) using an electromagnetic motor and gear reducer. However, the stiffness is not high sufficient (10N/mm) at the initial contact due to the backlash in the transmission. In this paper, we explore the possibility to use an ultrasonic motor (USM) for solving this problem. Compared with the electromagnetic motor used in the early design, the USM is able to generate a larger resistant torque without gearbox, at a fast rate. We develop a model to determine the maximum clearance between the physical constraint and the link. We verify the clearance model and the force feedback performance using a one DOF haptic device. The experimental results show that the device achieves a stiffness of 61.5N/mm and back-driving friction less than 0.4N, which implies that the USM is promising for achieving both high stiffness and low friction and inertia required by the haptic application.	haptic technology;simulation;stiffness	Jian Song;Yuru Zhang;Hongdong Zhang;Dangxiao Wang;Weiliang Xu	2018	2018 IEEE Haptics Symposium (HAPTICS)	10.1109/HAPTICS.2018.8357156	torque;reducer;haptic technology;backlash;control engineering;stiffness;electric motor;transmission (mechanics);physics;ultrasonic motor	Robotics	74.28509098891902	-24.285335982767783	171827
463a2cf9de1fe8211eefd13c456d4088fa33e20b	polychaete-like undulatory robotic locomotion		Polychaete annelid worms provide a biological paradigm of versatile locomotion and effective motion control, adaptable to a large variety of unstructured environmental conditions (water, sand, mud, sediment, etc.). The undulatory locomotion of their segmented body is characterized by the combination of a unique form of tail-to-head body undulations, with the rowing-like action of numerous lateral appendages distributed along their body. Computational models of polychaete-like crawling and swimming have been developed, based on the Lagrangian dynamics of the system and on resistive models of its interaction with the environment, and used for simulation studies demonstrating the generation of undulatory gaits. Several lightweight robotic prototypes have been developed, whose undulatory actuation achieves propulsion on sand. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the propulsion of these robots is characterized by essential features of polychaete locomotion, in agreement with the corresponding simulations.	biomimetics;computation;computational model;experiment;lateral thinking;mud;mathematical morphology;programming paradigm;robot;simulation;wheels	Dimitris P.

The first one, primarily aimed at nonstationary spectrum estimation, is based on sums of estimates with different tapers, whereas the second one makes use of differences between the same estimates for the sake of chirp enhancement.

Then, the interactive interface is designed and the control strategy is made to realize the manipulator is controlled by smooth pursuit eye movement and blink. Finally, the experiments of the manipulator end motion path control are carried out to verify the control scheme. The simulation and experimental results showed a good fit with the ideal path and demonstrated the effectiveness of control human manipulator.

We estimated joint stiffness in a female Japanese monkey (Macaca fuscata) during arm reaching movements and carried out a numerical simulation. The estimated stiffness was high at movement onset and movement end, and decreased at the mid-point of the movement. These characteristic patterns were reproduced by the numerical simulation using a 2-link 6-muscle arm model and an approximately optimal feedback control. Although the arm model was a redundant system with multiple dimensions of freedom, the optimal control was able to solve the redundancy problem by optimizing a task-relevant cost function. We suggest that the brain may control the body according to a similar optimal control law.	computer simulation;control theory;dimensions;feedback;humanoid robot;movement;numerical analysis;onset (audio);optimal control;reaching;stiffness	Yuki Ueyama;Eizo Miyashita	2012	2012 12th IEEE International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control (AMC)	10.1109/AMC.2012.6197109	computer simulation;simulation;humanoid robot;control theory;feedback	Robotics	68.88874582750678	-24.917016874360716	172799

The method of location and spectral estimation of weak signals on a noise background is being considered. The method is based on the optimized on order and noise dispersion autoregressive model of a sought signal. A new approach of model order determination is being offered. Available estimation of the noise dispersion is close to the real one. The optimized model allows to define function of empirical data spectral and dynamic features changes. The analysis of the signal as dynamic invariant in respect of the linear shift transformation yields the function of model consistency. Use of these both functions enables to detect short-time and nonstationary wave packets at signal to noise ratio as from -20 dB and above.	autoregressive model;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral density estimation;wave packet	Yu.

During the task, using proximity servoing, the sensors are aligned parallel to the surface and kept at a target distance. In addition, due to the spatial resolution, it's possible to estimate the surface's curvature in two dimensions along the rows and columns of the array. We show how a compound movement can be derived from both curvatures that pre-aligns the end-effector in each step, yielding a predictive component for the control scheme. We evaluate our approach with different geometries and show that the curvature information produces smooth contour following paths.

During synthesis, the low energy components of the modified complex spectrum cancel out more than the high energy components, thus reducing background noise. Using objective speech quality measures, informal subjective listening tests and spectrogram analysis, we show that the proposed method results in improved speech quality.	algorithm;crossover (genetic algorithm);fourier analysis;image noise;spectral density;spectrogram;speech enhancement	Kamil K.

However, current understanding of the effect of robotic manipulation on the motor coordination of surgeons is limited. Recent studies in human motor control suggest that we optimize hand movement stability and task performance while minimizing control effort and improving robustness to unpredicted disturbances. To achieve this, the variability of joint angles and muscle activations is structured to reduce task-relevant variability and increase task-irrelevant variability. In this study, we determine whether teleoperation of a da Vinci Si surgical system in a nonclinical task of simple planar movements changes this structure of variability in experienced surgeons and novices. To answer this question, we employ the UnControlled manifold analysis that partitions users' joint angle variability into task-irrelevant and task-relevant manifolds. We show that experienced surgeons coordinate their joint angles to stabilize hand movements more than novices, and that the effect of teleoperation depends on experience-experts increase teleoperated stabilization relative to freehand whereas novices decrease it. We suggest that examining users' exploitation of the task-irrelevant manifold for stabilization of hand movements may be applied to: (1) evaluation and optimization of teleoperator design and control parameters, and (2) skill assessment and optimization of training in RAS.	adobe freehand;alignment;approximation;armrest;control system;elbow joint structure;extraction;forearm;forty nine;forward kinematics;genetic algorithm;heart rate variability;hyperacusis;interference (communication);jacobian matrix and determinant;mathematical optimization;mental orientation;movement;muscle;point-to-point (telecommunications);relevance;robot;sample variance;small;spatial variability;systems design;telerobotics;test fixture;tooltip;transmitter device component;triple modular redundancy;uncontrolled format string;upper arm;benefit;manifold;sensor (device);tera units	Ilana Nisky;Michael H.

This paper presents a gait training device that guides the leg movements during gait, and a gait rehabilitation system using compliant force coordinate transformation control (CFCT) is proposed. The CFCT controller uses the direction of force applied by the patient to the device, and through coordinate transformation, divides the force into tangential and normal components based on the reference trajectory. Then, the force is applied to a compliance controller to smoothly guide the subjects' legs in the intended direction. Switching conditions, which ensures the correct movement of the gait guidance, are designed to be used in pair with the CFCT controller. The controller is evaluated through experiments.	compliance behavior;controllers;experiment;movement;patients;robot;smoothing;velocity (software development);video game rehabilitation	Misako Sasayama;Toshiyuki Murakami	2014	2014 IEEE 13th International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control (AMC)	10.1109/AMC.2014.6823291	control engineering;simulation;engineering;physical therapy	Robotics	70.55693305487371	-26.948808427325464	175346

However, root cause of reduced heaviness and factors affecting the heaviness are still unclear though the knowledge on the root cause/factors could be used to modulate human's feelings and the interactions between human and robot. This paper investigated the causes/factors behind the reduced heaviness. We adopted two strategies for this. Firstly, we included weight perception in robot dynamics (and control) in such a way that the mass parameter of the inertial force was considered different from that of the gravitational force because the perceived weight is different from the actual weight. Secondly, we compared weight perception, load forces and motions for power-assisted manipulation to that for manual manipulation and identified some clues regarding the causes/factors of reduced heaviness. We found that perceived weight, load force and its rate, velocity and acceleration for power-assisted objects were lower than that for manually lifted objects. We observed time delays in position sensing, force sensing, servomotor etc. for the power-assisted objects, however, the delays were almost absent for the manually lifted objects. We argued that the delays were the root cause of reduced heaviness and the elements of the system contributing to the delays were the factors affecting the perceived heaviness. To cross-check it, we increased time constant of the servomotor and found that the increased time constant reduced perceived weight. The findings may be used to develop power assist robots for manipulating heavy objects in industries that may help improve/modulate interactions between robots and users.	broadcast delay;interaction;lambda lifting;robot;sensor;velocity (software development)	S.

Muscle synergies hypothesis is a prominent suggestion for this problem. In this paper, we investigated the muscle synergies extracted from human subjects in a producing-force task to explore the mechanism of the human's skillful hand-movement at producing force while manipulating objects. We observed a high correlation estimation of the muscle synergies with the hand force, and derived a role division of muscle synergies in generating the hand force as well. These results give an optimal but simple way to control robots so as to make the robots' movement as skillful as human's. To verify this idea, we proposed “synergy based control” method using the characteristics of human's muscle synergies observed, and tested it on a pneumatic-driven arm-robot whose structure assumes the human arm's. The program is in its first stage to control the robot.	arm architecture;block cipher mode of operation;electromyography;nonlinear system;robot control;robotics;synergy	Hang T. T.

Targeted and coordinated hand and wrist therapy, often overlooked in rehabilitation robotics, is required to regain the ability to perform activities of daily living. To this end, a new coupled hand-wrist exoskeleton has been designed. This paper details the design of the wrist module and several human-related considerations made to maximize its potential as a coordinated hand-wrist device. The serial wrist mechanism has been engineered to facilitate donning and doffing for impaired subjects and to insure compatibility with the hand module in virtual and assisted grasping tasks. Several other practical requirements have also been addressed, including device ergonomics, clinician-friendliness, and ambidextrous reconfigurability. The wrist module's capabilities as a rehabilitation device are quantified experimentally in terms of functional workspace and dynamic properties. Specifically, the device possesses favorable performance in terms of range of motion, torque output, friction, and closed-loop position bandwidth when compared with existing devices. The presented wrist module's performance and operational considerations support its use in a wide range of future clinical investigations.	experiment;friction;human factors and ergonomics;mro gene;medical device incompatibility problem;motion;quantifier (logic);reconfigurability;rehabilitation robotics;requirement;robot;token reconfiguration;trauma, nervous system;workspace;exoskeleton;science of ergonomics	Evan Pezent;Chad G.

Assuming that all the sources can be represented using a low-rank model, we derive an objective function to minimize the rank of the source spectrogram, and the error between the target and the estimated coefficients. Especially, we apply the nuclear norm and l1-norm, which allow a relaxation of the model, and represent them in the convex formulation. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better and more robust separation performance than the state-of-the-art under the incomplete and inexact annotation condition.	algorithm;coefficient;linear programming relaxation;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;source separation;spectrogram;t-norm;taxicab geometry	Il-Young Jeong;Kyogu Lee	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178017	speech recognition;computer science;manganese;machine learning;mathematics;robustness	Robotics	78.91430533224766	-36.22421758632599	175721

These lags originate from delays in measuring the position of the head and the time required to generate the image of the target. This paper presents two laboratory studies on the use of phase lead filters to improve head tracking performance in the presence of display lags. In the preliminary study, the benefits of lag compensation by a phase lead filter were impeded by associated changes in filter gain. The frequency responses of two phase lead filters were then optimized to have near unity gain at frequencies below 0.7 Hz where there was most head motion. The main study showed that these optimized filters significantly improved head tracking performance with a system having a total lag of 140 ms. At frequencies above about 0.7 Hz, a greater than unity filter gain caused jittery image movement. Although this jittering degraded head tracking performance it was removed by an alternative lag compensation technique involving 'image deflection'. This deflection shifted the displayed image to its correct horizontal and vertical position relative to the head. Image deflection, combined with the phase lead filters, produced a tracking performance unaffected by lag.	ansi escape code;composite image filter;filter bank;frequency response;gabor filter;helmet-mounted display;motion capture	Richard H.

This suggests that the next advancement in lower extremity assistive devices is to extend their design and control to the frontal plane. In this paper, the concept of a multi-axis powered ankle-foot prosthesis is introduced and its feasibility is shown by a proof of concept prototype of a cable-driven, multi-axis ankle-foot prosthesis. The design kinematics and its ankle joint's mechanical impedance in non-load bearing conditions are evaluated and discussed. It is shown that the developed prototype is capable of closely mimicking the ankle movements in both sagittal and frontal planes during turning and walking on straight path with passive mechanical impedance in sagittal and frontal planes comparable to the ones of the human ankle.	apache axis;assistive technology;characteristic impedance;experiment;inverse kinematics;prototype	Evandro M.

The conventional lump detection methods are based on a pressure map obtained from contact pressure distributions, but they requires an adequate regulation of the contact condition during measurements. An alternative approach is to use a stiffness map, for which displacement measurement is necessary using additional devices or precise motion control. The proposed indicator relies on only the difference between the normal force and the surface normal obtained from contact pressure distributions. Thus, contact condition or probe motion does not affect the performance of the proposed method. The feasibility of the proposed method was evaluated by simulations and experiments, both of which showed promising results.	displacement mapping;experiment;lumped element model;normal (geometry);robot;simulation	Hyoungkyun Kim;Seungmoon Choi;Wan Kyun Chung	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7353658	control engineering;simulation;pressure measurement;engineering;forensic engineering;elasticity;force;quantum mechanics	Robotics	74.3463170371389	-25.483418305202843	176141
e0f7289bddf238e5d34618dc4ee7aa0f347ddc09	非負矩陣分解法於語音調變頻譜強化之研究(a study of enhancing the modulation spectrum of speech signals via nonnegative matrix factorization)[in chinese]		In this paper, we propose to enhance the modulation spectrum of the spectrograms for speech signals via the technique of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). In the training phase, the clean speech and noise in the training set are separately transformed to spectrograms and modulation spectra in turn, and then the magnitude modulation spectra are used to train the NMF-based basis matrices for clean speech and noise, respectively. In the test phase, the test signal is converted to its modulation spectrum, which is then enhanced via NMF with the basis matrices obtained in the training phase. The updated modulation spectrum is finally transformed back to the time domain as the enhanced signal. In addition, we propose two variants for the newly method in order to possess relatively high computation complexity One is to consider the several adjacent acoustic frequencies as a whole for the subsequent processing, and the other is to process the low modulation frequency components. These new methods are validated via a subset of the Aurora-2 noisy connected-digit database. Preliminary experiments have indicated that these methods can achieve better signal quality relative to the baseline results in terms of the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) index, and they outperform some well-known speech enhancement methods including spectral subtraction (SS), Wiener filtering (WF) and minimum mean squared error short-time spectral amplitude estimation (MMSE-STSA).

The instants of significant excitation correspond to the instants of glottal closure (epochs) in the case of voiced speech, and to some random excitations like onset of burst in the case of nonvoiced speech. The proposed method consists of two phases: the first phase determines the approximate epoch locations using the Hilbert envelope of the linear prediction residual of the speech signal. The second phase determines the accurate locations of the instants of significant excitation by computing the group delay around the approximate epoch locations derived from the first phase. The accuracy in determining the instants of significant excitation and the time complexity of the proposed method is compared with the group delay based approach.	approximation algorithm;burst transmission;effective method;excited state;group delay and phase delay;onset (audio);real-time clock;semantic prosody;speech synthesis;time complexity	K.

Such an application requires a greater data payload than music copyright management systems. Also, it is difficult to extract the embedded data from sounds played through a loudspeaker and detected by a microphone because of additive background noise, reflections and reverberations and the band-limited characteristics of loudspeakers and microphones. In this study, a watermarking technique using subband amplitude modulation was evaluated by computer simulation in terms of robustness against background noises and reverberations. The effects of amplitude modulation on the articulation scores of 125 vowel-consonant-vowel (VCV) syllables were also investigated. The results showed that reverberant speech signals with various background noises having a SNR of 10 dB can transmit more than 90% of embedded data at 48 bps, with only a small deterioration in the syllable identification scores.	bandlimiting;biconnected component;computer simulation;digital watermarking;embedded system;loudspeaker;microphone;modulation;reflection (computer graphics);signal-to-noise ratio;syllable;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods;vowel–consonant synthesis	Akira Nishimura	2006	2006 International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia	10.1109/IIH-MSP.2006.77	computer simulation;loudspeaker;payload;speech recognition;reverberation;amplitude modulation;computer science;management system;background noise;information hiding	Robotics	82.8842929412439	-33.28335167294022	177672

Time-frequency distributions (TFDs) covariant to time and frequency shifts and scale changes re ect these variations in a predictable manner. Based on such TFDs, representations invariant to these signal distortions are possible. Presented here are two approaches for discriminating between signal classes where within class translation and scale variation occur. The rst method uses an auto-correlation followed by a scale transform to achieve the invariances. The second method treats the TFD as a twodimensional probability density function and applies a transformation that removes the mean and variance to provide the shift and scale invariance. Each method employs discrimination mechanisms to yield powerful results.	autocorrelation;distortion	Eugene J. Zalubas;Jeffrey C. O'Neill;William J. Williams;Alfred O.

Conditionally upon an indicator variable that is 0 or 1, one expansion coefficient of the signal corresponding to one atom of the dictionary is either set to zero or given a Student t prior. A Gibbs sampler (a standard Markov chain Monte Carlo technique) is used to sample from the posterior distribution of the indicator variables, the expansion coefficients (corresponding to nonzero indicator variables), the hyperparameters of the Student t priors, and the variance of the residual signal. The structure of the dictionary, assumed to be a union of bases, allows for alternate sampling of the indicator variables and the expansion coefficients from each basis and avoids any large matrix inversion.

This is achieved inherently in the way the robot adheres to and crawls over the surface of the heart. This mode of operation does not require physiological motion compensation to provide this stable environment; however, modeling of physiological motion is advantageous in providing more accurate position estimation as well as synchronization of motion to the physiological cycles. The work presented uses an Extended Kalman Filter framework to estimate parameters of non-stationary Fourier series models of the motion of the heart due to the respiratory and cardiac cycles as well as the position of the robot as it moves over the surface of the heart. The proposed method is demonstrated in the laboratory with HeartLander operating on a physiological motion simulator. Improved performance is demonstrated in comparison to the filtering methods previously used with HeartLander. The use of detected physiological cycle phases to synchronize locomotion of HeartLander is also described.	block cipher mode of operation;extended kalman filter;mobile robot;motion compensation;motion simulator;simulation;simulators;sinoatrial node;stationary process	Nathan A.

One such example is the dance performance of an Entertainment Robot. In most cases, the challenge to program dance motions for a robot and synchronize them has been too heavy. In addition, pre-programmed dance moves and synchronization information are useful only for a specific music track and are useless for any other. To solve these problems, we developed a new system that can make a robot learn dance moves according to the input music track. The system comprises of two main parts: the first is a beat extraction system for music track; and the second one is a system that learns dance motion for Baxter. In the first part, music track is analyzed using STFT and peak-to-peak time duration is computed. This gives the beats per minute (BPM) of the given music track. The second part takes the BPM and duration of track and feeds it to the developed Q-learning algorithm to make Baxter learn dance moves and synchronize dance motion to beat rate.	algorithm;apple sos;baxter (robot);beam propagation method;dance dance revolution extreme;entertainment robot;q-learning;short-time fourier transform;system of systems	Sulabh Kumra;Ferat Sahin	2015	2015 10th System of Systems Engineering Conference (SoSE)	10.1109/SYSOSE.2015.7151920	robot;synchronization;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;tracking	Robotics	69.12275404914033	-30.817190584095318	178628

A curvature-based NURBS surface interpolator with look-ahead acceleration/deceleration (ACC/DEC) control has been developed. The cutter contact (CC) paths are planned through iso-parametric line method. The CC feedrate profile is optimized using global flexible control strategy and local adaptive ACC/DEC optimization strategy according to the look-ahead algorithm. The real-time surface interpolation algorithm was programmed on Windows XP platform.

To make noise estimation adapt quickly to non-stationary noise environments, a robust entropy-based voice activity detection (VAD) is thus required. It is well-known that the entropy-based measure defined in spectral domain is very insensitive to the changing level of nose. To exploit the specific nature of straight lines existing on speech-only spectrogram, the proposed spectrum entropy measurement improved from spectrum entropy proposed by Shen et al. is further presented and is named band-splitting spectrum entropy (BSE). Consequently, the proposed recursive noise estimator including BSE-based VAD can update noise power spectrum accurately even if the noise-level quickly changes.	spectral density estimation;stationary process;voice activity detection	Bing-Fei Wu;Kun-Ching Wang	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e89-a.2.479	voice activity detection;spectrum;speech recognition;telecommunications;noise measurement;maximum entropy spectral estimation	Visualization	81.35072308563466	-34.59818310070231	178979

Nevertheless, it is often difficult to increase the number of degrees of actuation of heavily under-actuated hands without compromising their intrinsic simplicity. In this paper we analyze the Pisa/IIT SoftHand and its underlying logic of adaptive synergies, and propose a method to double its number of degree of actuation, with a very reduced impact on its mechanical complexity. This new design paradigm is based on constructive exploitation of friction phenomena. Based on this method, a novel prototype of under-actuated robot hand with two degrees of actuation is proposed, named Pisa/IIT SoftHand+. A preliminary validation of the prototype follows, based on grasping and manipulation examples of some objects.	dexterity programming language;integrated information theory;mathematical model;programming paradigm;prototype;robot;robotic arm;simulation;soft robotics;synergy	Cosimo Della Santina;Giorgio Grioli;Manuel Giuseppe Catalano;Alberto Brando;Antonio Bicchi	2015	2015 IEEE-RAS 15th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids)	10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2015.7363595	robot;simulation;artificial intelligence;friction;prototype;pulley;force	Robotics	71.2130110310371	-24.63117253658166	178993

In previous studies, conventional assistive robots did not require patients to use their own physical strength to stand, which leads to decreased strength in the elderly. Therefore, an assistive robot that allows patients to maximally use the physical strength they possess is desired. To realize this objective, we propose a standing assistance scheme that performs two functions, namely, motion assistance using a patient's own physical strength and posture adjustment. In general, human movements consist of voluntary movement, which mainly generates body motion, and posture adjustment, which keeps the body stable during motion. Our proposed scheme provides the minimum force that enables voluntary movement by patients with their remaining physical strength while keeping their body stable by performing posture adjustment. To perform these two functions simultaneously, we propose a body movement vector for dividing human motion into a voluntary movement and a posture adjustment action. A prototype assistive robot fabricated based on the proposed idea helped elderly patients stand using their remaining physical strength maximally by performing the two assistive functions simultaneously.	assistive technology;bundle adjustment;kinesiology;poor posture;prototype;robot	Daisuke Chugo;Satoshi Muramatsu;Sho Yokota;Hiroshi Hashimoto	2016	2016 IEEE 25th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	10.1109/ISIE.2016.7744908	simulation;physical medicine and rehabilitation;engineering;physical therapy	Robotics	71.7580765103861	-26.39594586812584	179076

The only prior knowledge employed by the BAF is that human speech is nonstationary whereas the noise is assumed to be quasistationary, i.e., stationary over a longer interval than that of any speech phoneme. The RAF has a four subsystem structure. The system consists of an identifying subsystem that is followed by a speech/noise parameter-separator. The noise is identified based on the stationary features of speech and noise. A feedforward subsystem sets optimization neighborhood to the virtual feedback subsystem where a cost-functional is minimized to jointly minimize the stationary part of the output while maximizing its nonstationary part. The system has been tested for performance for different signal to noise ratios (SNR) and for different types of noise parameters. Improvements for various noises range from 14-36 dB for -20 dB SNR inputs.	adaptive filter	Daniel Graupe;Dusan Veselinovic	2000	IEEE Trans.

Finally an output/control signal is produced and sent to the actuators, which will then perform the proper movement. The research goal is to predict the movement of the lower arm through the analysis of EMG signals, so that the movement can be reproduced by an arm orthosis, powered by two linear actuators.	arm architecture;electromyography	Aaron Suberbiola;Ekaitz Zulueta;José Manuel López-Guede;Ismael Etxeberria;Bren Van Caesbroeck	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40846-5_51	actuator;artificial intelligence;machine learning;prosthesis;control engineering;biceps;linear actuator;computer science;control system	EDA	71.61979299993016	-26.5994746885367	180174

This method was developed to overcome limitations in an otherwise promising technique called residual-excited linear prediction (RELP). In the new method, the stored speech unit is processed with a suitably shaped time-varying filter. The filtered signal is modified according to the required change in the fundamental frequency. The modified filtered signal is applied to the inverse of the above-mentioned prefilter. Based on observations of spectra of multiple recordings of the same speech unit at different pitch frequencies, the magnitude response of the inverse filter was chosen to have a significantly less peaky structure than that which is typically obtained in LPC. Speech modifications using this method were found to be superior in quality to those obtained by RELP, while at the same time being less sensitive than RELP to changes in pitch marking.	concatenative synthesis;inverse filter	Rashid Ansari	1997		10.1109/ICASSP.1997.598811	frequency response;linear predictive coding;speech recognition;mobile telephony;linear prediction;computer science;inverse problem;frequency;signal processing;sound quality;speech processing;fundamental frequency;speech synthesis;intelligibility;encoding;statistics	ML	81.45443400168477	-33.033189450689996	180310

The stiffness of a joint or limb arises from a number of physiological mechanisms and is thought to play a fundamental role in the control of posture and movement. Estimates of endpoint stiffness can therefore be used to characterize its modulation during physiological tasks and may provide insight into how the nervous system normally controls motor behavior. Previous MIMO stiffness estimates have focused upon the static stiffness components only or assumed simple parametric models with elastic, viscous, and inertial components. The method presented here captures the full stiffness dynamics during a relatively short experimental trial while assuming only that the system is linear for small perturbations. Simulation studies were performed to investigate the performance of this approach under typical experimental conditions. It was found that a linear MIMO description of endpoint stiffness dynamics was sufficient to describe the displacement responses to small stochastic force perturbations. Distortion of these linear estimates by nonlinear centripetal and Coriolis forces was virtually undetectable for these perturbations. The system identification techniques were also found to be robust in the presence of significant output measurement noise and input coupling. These results indicate that the approach described here will allow the estimation of endpoint stiffness dynamics in an experimentally efficient manner with minimal assumptions about the specific form of these properties.	arid1a wt allele;arabic numeral 0;assumed;autocorrelation;body position;cns disorder;cations;communication endpoint;congenital disorder of glycosylation type 1j;derivation procedure;displacement mapping;distortion;epoprostenol;estimated;experiment;greater than;least squares;linear system;mimo;miso;modulation;multiple personality disorder;nonlinear system;ppp1r1a gene;perturbation theory;poor posture;psychologic displacement;randomness;sample variance;simulation;system analysis;system identification;undetectable;united states national institutes of health;algorithm;cell transformation	Eric J.

The proposed factorization decomposes an information-bearing matrix into two-dimensional convolution of factor matrices that represent the spectral dictionary and temporal codes. We derive a variational Bayesian approach to compute the sparsity parameters for optimizing the matrix factorization. The method is demonstrated on separating audio mixtures recorded from a single channel. In addition, we have proven that the extraction of the spectral dictionary and temporal codes is significantly more efficient with adaptive sparsity which subsequently leads to better source separation performance. Experimental tests and comparisons with other sparse factorization methods have been conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed method.	calculus of variations;code;convolution;data dictionary;neural coding;non-negative matrix factorization;simulation;source separation;sparse matrix;the matrix;variational principle	Bin Gao;Wai Lok Woo;Satnam Singh Dlay	2011	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing	10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2160840	incomplete cholesky factorization;sparse matrix;incomplete lu factorization;audio signal processing;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;convolution;matrix decomposition;code;non-negative matrix factorization	ML	79.4364890303332	-36.81857334172049	180482
690b4760d179797d6b06b666a313fdfabc9a1a84	noise reduction based on soft masks by incorporating snr uncertainty in frequency domain		The binary mask approach has been studied recently to reduce the background noise and improve the speech intelligibility and quality in the noisy surroundings. This mask is usually applied at the time–frequency illustration of a noisy speech and discards portions of a speech below a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) threshold, whereas allowing others to pass over intact. The threshold, however, is normally very low, and considerable residual noise would exist. Moreover, the precise estimate of local instantaneous SNR in practical applications is a difficult task. By modeling the local instantaneous SNR as Fisher–Snedecor distributed random variable, the soft masks for noise reduction are derived by incorporating SNR uncertainty in the frequency domain. Instead of finding a different method to estimate the local instantaneous SNR, the probability of local instantaneous SNR is computed higher than the threshold. The results indicated that soft masks yielded significantly better speech quality in terms of speech distortion and residual noise.	noise reduction;signal-to-noise ratio	Nasir Saleem;Muhammad Irfan	2018	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-017-0684-5	mathematics;residual;frequency domain;background noise;speech distortion;noise reduction;speech recognition;random variable;binary number;intelligibility (communication)	NLP	82.65518003439959	-33.919646400003465	180695

In our proposed formulation, the log-likelihood function (LLF) of the magnitude spectral components, based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) for both the speech and background noise signals, is included as a regularization term in the NMF cost function. By using this spectral type of regularization, we can incorporate the statistical properties of the signals during the estimation of both the basis and excitation martices in NMF model. Furthermore, borrowing from the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and to reduce the computational complexity of the NMF update, the LLF is replaced by its expected value. Experimental results of perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) and source-to-interference ratio (SIR) show that the proposed speech enhancement algorithm provides better performance than the compared benchmark algorithms.	benchmark (computing);computational complexity theory;distortion;etsi satellite digital radio;expectation–maximization algorithm;google map maker;interference (communication);loss function;matrix regularization;mixture model;non-negative matrix factorization;pesq;speech enhancement;stellar classification	Hanwook Chung;Eric Plourde;Benoît Champagne	2014	2014 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)	10.1109/MLSP.2014.6958870	speech recognition;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics	ML	82.7024088860962	-36.47346654574963	180883

Usually, one control signal is juxtaposed to one musclotendon unit. The question is how is this signal connected to the activation of the motor units (MUs) that compose the muscle and fire differently. The aim of the paper is to compare a Hill-type muscle model to a model composed of MUs. A fast elbow flexion performed by only one muscle is considered. The activation necessary for performing the motion and the corresponding frequencies are calculated for cases of fast and slow muscles using Hill-type model. Then the muscle is modelled as a mixture of [774 MUs] with uniformly distributed twitch parameters. Using MotCo software the moments of impulsation of all MUs and their mechanical responses are predicted. The activation characteristics obtained by the two muscle models are compared. It is concluded that there are two essential parameters for proper muscle modelling: the lead-time and the MUs composition.	appendix;c11 (c standard revision);elbow method (clustering);electromyography;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;farmville;muscle;population parameter;sensorimotor cortex;simulation;unit;velocity (software development)	Rositsa Raikova;Hristo T.

More explicitly, the efforts of this paper are to bring some of the more complex leg designs seen in large scale bipedal robot into the realm of smaller bipeds while still allowing for it to be easily reproducible or modified. In order to accomplish this 3D printing technology was utilized, as well as an iterative design process. An ankle and knee powered by linear actuators were first constructed to test the conceptual design of the leg. This was followed by a complete leg design with improved ankle and knee. The results and challenges during the design process for actuation of the leg are discussed, and the electrical design is also explained.

Current tactile displays are at and rigid, and require precise machining and assembly of many parts. This paper describes the fabrication and performance of a one-piece pneumaticallyactuated tactile display molded from silicone rubber. Tactor spacing is 2.5 mm with 1 mm diameter tactor elements. Tactile display compliance ensures contact between the nger and tactile display at all times. Unlike previous pneumatic tactile displays, there is no chamber leakage and no seal friction. A psychophysics experiment showed that a a synthetic grating on the tactile display was perceived as well as a low-passltered real contact.	spectral leakage;synthetic intelligence	Gabriel Moy;Christopher R.

88fecb2d92d83c2287309aea7fe2719e61a7ac5e	a bioinspired 10 dof wearable powered arm exoskeleton for rehabilitation		The developed exoskeleton device (Exorn) has ten degrees of freedom to control joints starting from shoulder griddle to wrist to provide better redundancy, portability, and flexibility to the human arm motion. A 3D conceptual model is being designed to make the system wearable by human arm. All the joints are simple revolute joints with desired motion limit. A Simulink model of the human arm is being developed with proper mass and length to determine proper torque required for actuating those joints. Forward kinematics of the whole system has been formulated for getting desired dexterous workspace. A proper and simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the required embedded system have been designed for providing physiotherapy lessons to the patients. In the literature review it has been found that researchers have generally ignored the motion of shoulder griddle. Here we have implemented those motions in our design. It has also been found that people have taken elbow pronation and supination motion as a part of shoulder internal and external rotation though both motions are quite different. A predefined resolved motion rate control structure with independent joint control is used so that all movements can be controlled in a predefined way.	wearable computer	Soumya Kanti Manna;Subhasis Bhaumik	2013	J.

cf71e14695501383236c5830fe42bc0daf6718a2	interactive haptic display based on soft actuator and soft sensor		This paper demonstrates a new haptic display based on soft actuator and soft sensor. The device consists of an array rigid coupling actuator and an array tactile sensor which configured sensor located on the top of actuator. The actuator includes a frame with rigid coupling made by silicone and a dielectric elastomer actuator(DEA). The movement of the DEA is transferred to touch pad via rigid coupling. Thus, it provides a soft, comport touch feeling and eliminates the danger of applying high voltage to the human skin. The actuator can work at a wide range frequency of 0–150 Hz and produce sufficient force of 50 mN over the human hand threshold. The tactile sensor can measure the pressure, locate the objects and send the feedback signals to control the actuator. In this work, a 8×12 haptic tactile display is made with high resolution. In addition, the high voltage signal processing also developed to generate variable 0–3.5 kV, and can control individual cell by using the dynamic scanning actuation algorithm. Then, it can display any shape such as a circle, a smile/sad face, a star, etc. In the future, we will build the “emotion touch pad” system which can transfer a person's emotion to another one via internet.	a* search algorithm;display device;experiment;haptic technology;high-κ dielectric;image resolution;image sensor;signal processing;tactile sensor;touchpad	Hoa Phung;Phi Tien Hoang;Nguyen Canh Toan;Tien Dat Nguyen;Hosang Jung;Uikyum Kim;Hyoukryeol Choi	2017	2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2017.8202250	touchpad;control engineering;computer science;actuator;high voltage;coupling;signal processing;haptic technology;tactile sensor;soft sensor	Robotics	76.32232991725319	-26.57214171731689	182499

The corresponding somatic sensory area in a brain is very large, and considered to be a specialized part for palpation. A lot of haptic display system then have been developed with the investigation of human haptic perception. However, the researches about the human perception for pulling force at grasping, namely static frictional force are limited. This paper investigated it, aiming at a future development of pulling and grasping force feedback system for neurosurgical robotic systems. For the purpose, this paper explored the possibility of displaying pulling force to an index finger during grasping. The absolute and difference thresholds for pulling sense were the targets. The results showed that grasping disturbs the pulling sense, and the sides of index fingertip can be used to display pulling sense, relatively large force, namely scaled force feedback is required for the perception. The results provide an important insight at a hardware and controller design of force feedback systems.	computer hardware;haptic technology;machine perception;robot	Hiroyuki Chinbe;Takeshi Yoneyama;Tetsuyou Watanabe;Mitsutoshi Nakada	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7792958	control engineering;computer vision;simulation;engineering	Robotics	74.76529001813496	-26.08694912877808	182530

A similar requirement exists for transient data. Hereto, an approach based on Autoregressive Vector (ARV) modelling was developed and applied. An ARV model is calculated from a set of time data of limited duration. The autoand crosspower functions are then directly calculated from the ARV model. From these spectra, a principal component and ordinary as well as virtual coherence calculation can be performed, describing the causal relationship between reference and target signals. One of the features of the ARVapproach is that this description takes the form of a time/frequency plot, allowing to assess which component contributes the most at which moment. The method has been validated by a series of industrial tests.	autoregressive model;causality;industrial pc;principal component analysis;stationary process;test data;xm1219 armed robotic vehicle	Herman Van der Auweraer;Luc Hermans	2000		10.1109/ICASSP.2000.860256	econometrics;speech recognition;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;statistics;principal component analysis	AI	81.57201959572365	-36.00782199104471	182822

A brain-inspired controller has been developed, embedding a cerebellum-like adaptive module based on neurophysiological plasticity mechanisms. It has been tested as controller of an ad-hoc developed neurorobot, integrating a 3 degrees of freedom serial robotic arm with a motion tracking system. The learning skills have been tried out, designing a vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) protocol. One robot joint was used to get the desired head turn, while another joint displacement corresponded to the eye motion, which was controlled by the cerebellar model output, used as joint torque. Along task repetitions, the cerebellum was able to produce an anticipatory eye displacement, which accurately compensated the head turn in order to keep on fixing the environmental object. Multiple tests have been implemented, pairing different head turn with object motion. The gaze error and the cerebellum output were quantified. The VOR was accurately tuned thanks to the cerebellum plasticity. The next steps will include the activation of multiple plasticity sites evaluating the real platform behaviour in different sensorimotor tasks.	adaptive grammar;cns;control system;digital single-lens reflex camera;displacement mapping;hoc (programming language);proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions;robot;robotic arm;testbed;tracking system	Claudia Casellato;Jesús Alberto Garrido;Cristina Franchin;Giancarlo Ferrigno;Egidio D'Angelo;Alessandra L.

1c2d23d4f209d9079fa2854e14e2811ff1eba9cc	virtual destruction of a 3d object with a stick	real time;force feedback;network model	This paper is concerned with a real-time method for realizing virtual destruction of a 3D object with external force. A target object is a soft tofu (bean curd) cube which is easily destructable or breakable with a stick. A spring-mass network model is used to represent such an object. Destruction is realized by cutting a spring when its length exceeds its maximum length due to excess stretch force. A system was implemented on a PC with 2 CPU’s and a PHANToM, a force feedback device. A set of optimal parameters are experimentally identified. It is concluded that real-time destruction realized with the presented method can provide destruction close to real one.	central processing unit;experiment;haptic technology;network model;offset binary;operability;personal computer;phantom reference;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;real-time transcription	Tohru Miyazaki;Toyohisa Kaneko;Shigeru Kuriyama	2005			real-time computing;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;network model;haptic technology	Robotics	78.81827616291598	-26.639299493295876	183368

But designing control strategies for such wheelchairs is a challenging task due to the fact that they are highly nonlinear and unstable systems. The subtle design of the system mimics a double inverted pendulum with three actuators, one for each wheel, and one for chair position. The system starts to work with lifting the front wheels (casters) to the upright position and further with stabilizing in the upright position. The challenge resides in the design and implementation of suitable control strategies for the two-wheeled wheelchair so as to perform comparably similar to a normal four-wheeled wheelchair. A two-level modular fuzzy logic controller is proposed in this paper. A model of the standard wheelchair is also developed as a test and verification platform using Visual Nastran software integrated with Matlab.	fuzzy control system	Salmiah Ahmad;Nazmul H. Siddique;M.

Robot-assisted rehabilitation is an active area of research. Cheap robotic leg rehabilitation devices should be developed to meet the demands and assist most patients. A low cost hip-knee exoskeleton prototype powered by pneumatic muscles was developed. On this basis, Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) induced paralyzed muscles to realize ankle joint rehabilitation training. As both of pneumatic muscle and FES induced muscle possess highly nonlinear characteristics, a sliding control algorithm called Chattering mitigation Robust Variable Control (CRVC) was applied to leg hybrid rehabilitation. The combination of exoskeleton and FES is a promising way to reduce the cost and the complexity of designing hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton. The proposed hybrid method is verified by treadmill-based gait training experiments.	algorithm;experiment;functional electrical stimulation;human–computer interaction;nonlinear system;pneumatic artificial muscles;prototype;robot leg;robotics;shin megami tensei: persona 3;waist–hip ratio;wearable computer	Xikai Tu;Jian Huang;Jiping He	2016	2016 International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM)	10.1109/ICARM.2016.7606925	physical medicine and rehabilitation;engineering;physical therapy;anatomy	Robotics	71.10739196962766	-27.241452996489876	184342

Based on some assumptions, the resulting spectral gain function turns out to be a slight modification of the Wiener filter while requiring very low computational complexity.

Here we describe the use of a novel strain gauge printing method to apply low profile, low cost sensors directly to the surface of da Vinci surgical robot end effectors (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.) to sense deflection and provide force feedback. This additive, vapor-deposition-based sensor fabrication method is used to deposit strain gauges directly onto the surfaces of the end effectors with minimal disruption to the device and without the need for adhesives or machining operations. Initial experiments characterize sensor performance and indicate the applicability of the proposed approach for force feedback during minimally invasive procedures.		Rut Pena;Michael J.

This interactive control of a robotics system leads to a cooperation between the surgeon and the robotics system.

Although previous studies on NMF have focused on the sparsity of the two matrices, the sparsity of reconstruction errors between a data matrix and the two matrices is also important, since designing the sparsity is equivalent to assuming the nature of the errors. We propose a new NMF technique, which we called Lp-norm NMF, that minimizes the Lp norm of the reconstruction errors, and derive a computationally efficient algorithm for Lp-norm NMF according to an auxiliary function principle. This algorithm can be generalized for the factorization of a real-valued matrix into the product of two real-valued matrices. We apply the algorithm to singing voice enhancement and show that adequately selecting p improves the enhancement.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;audio signal processing;lp-type problem;non-negative matrix factorization;sparse matrix;speech enhancement;t-norm;whole earth 'lectronic link	Tomohiko Nakamura;Hirokazu Kameoka	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178344	speech recognition;computer science;speech;rhythm;machine learning;harmonic analysis;pattern recognition;mathematics;non-negative matrix factorization;robustness	ML	79.09475286207396	-36.32865822859874	185747

Its main focus is on the automatic generation and parameterization of the assembly sequence, which should provide maximal robustness with respect to positioning errors of the robot and residual position uncertainties of vision based object localization. The assembly utilizes active or passive compliance of the robot in order to align the parts automatically. Success of the automatic alignment, i.e., the convergence of the assembly process can be guaranteed using the means of regions of attraction (ROA). The planning optimizes the assembly trajectories and parameters in such a way that the ROA is maximized for a given part geometry. For the convergence analysis, passivity properties of the robot and the environment are used. The method is validated through extensive experiments and can be successfully applied also for the automated assembly planning with passive compliance devices, as widely used today in industrial automation.	align (company);automated planning and scheduling;automation;experiment;interconnection;local convergence;maximal set;online and offline;resource-oriented architecture;robot;stemming	Andreas Stemmer;Alin Albu-Schäffer;Gerd Hirzinger	2007	Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363806	control engineering;computer vision;simulation;computer science;engineering;automation;task analysis	Robotics	68.7766669380858	-32.912305409450525	186045

The effects of larger parameter variations are discussed with the help of figures. Results are presented for a number of sets of estimated glottal-pulse parameters that were taken from the literature. The main conclusion is that the LF model, which, given the fundamental period, is a three-parameter model, actually operates as a oneor a two-parameter model.	relevance	Raymond N. J.

A system of 5 algorithms is developed to determine the interference area. On the basis of these algorithms, the machining time of each available tool is estimated by considering tool size, scallop height, and accessible surface area. Finally, the combination of tools which possesses the minimum overall machining time is selected as the optimal tool sizes. Our case study has demonstrated the validity of the proposed methodology and algorithms.		Zhonglin Han;Daniel C. H.

In this study, we designed, developed and compared the torque-tracking performance of nine control methods, including variations on classical feedback control, model-based control, adaptive control and iterative learning. Each was tested with four high-level controllers that determined desired torque based on time, joint angle, a neuromuscular model, or electromyography. Controllers were implemented on a tethered ankle exoskeleton with series elastic actuation. Measurements were taken while one human subject walked on a treadmill at 1.25 m·s-1 for one hundred steady-state steps. The combination of proportional control with damping injection and iterative learning resulted in the lowest errors for all high-level controllers. With time-based desired torque, root-mean-squared errors were 0.6 N·m (1.3% of peak desired torque) step by step, and 0.1 N·m (0.2%) on average. These results indicate that model-free, integration-free feedback control is suited to the uncertain dynamics of the human-robot system, while iterative learning is effective in the cyclic task of walking.	control theory;electromyography;feedback;high- and low-level;interaction;iterative method;jackson;lopes (exoskeleton);robot locomotion;steady state	Juanjuan Zhang;Chien Chern Cheah;Steven H.

For years, a method to improve such operation has been sought by means of the robotization of techniques such as grit blasting and ultra high pressure water jetting. Despite this, it continues to be standard practice in shipyards that this process is carried out manually because the developed robotized systems are too expensive to be widely accepted by shipyards. We have chosen to apply a more conservative and realistic approach to this problem, which has resulted in the development of several solutions that have been designed with different automation and operation range degrees. These solutions are fitted with most of the elements already available in many shipyards, so the installation of additional machinery in the workplace would not be necessary. This paper describes the evolutionary development of sensor systems for the automation of the preparation process of ship hull surfaces before the painting process is performed. Such evolution has given rise to the development of new technologies for coating removal.	arhgap32 gene;automation;blast;cable jetting;calibration;coating excipient;computer vision;conflict (psychology);distortion;financial cost;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;hydrostatic pressure;mental suffering;metrorrhagia;movement;physical exertion;plasma cleaning;polyethylene terephthalate;purkinje cell cytoplasmic type tr ab:titr:pt:ser:qn;remote control;requirement;robot;seizures;sensorization;ships;software bug;solutions;specification;sputter cleaning;supervised learning;thresholding (image processing);wavelet;algorithm;sensor (device)	Pedro Javier Navarro Lorente;Juan Suardíaz Muro;Pedro María Alcover;Carlos Fernández-Isla	2013		10.3390/s130912345	embedded system;transducer;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;forensic engineering;robotics;physics;manufacturing engineering;mechanical engineering	Robotics	80.91285186972063	-25.13755648646672	186863
e3a7caf8f1b31bde3f639b5db067e5fc4cf625cf	beyond bandlimited sampling of speech spectral envelope imposed by the harmonic structure of voiced sounds		A new spectral envelope estimation procedure is proposed to recover details beyond band limitation imposed by the Shannon’s sampling theory when interpreting periodic excitation of voiced sounds as the sampling operation in the frequency domain. The proposed procedure is a hybrid of STRAIGHT, a F0-adaptive spectral envelope estimation and the auto regressive model parameter estimation. Wavelet analyses of these spectral models on the frequency domain enabled objective evaluation of this recovery procedure. The proposed procedure provides better speech quality especially when parameter manipulation is introduced.	bandlimiting;estimation theory;recovery procedure;sampling (signal processing);shannon (unit);wavelet	Hideki Kawahara;Masanori Morise;Tomoki Toda;Ryuichi Nisimura;Toshio Irino	2013			pattern recognition;wavelet;speech recognition;artificial intelligence;bandlimiting;frequency domain;sampling (statistics);autoregressive model;spectral envelope;transfer function;computer science;harmonic	Vision	80.2010333110238	-34.801255939804406	187072

High force accuracy is an important factor to grasp an object stably and not to damage the grasping object. In the previous research, our exoskeleton achieved high pinching force accuracy at the same level of human ability and extended range of the human pinching force to about twice by 46% reduction of affecting force to the finger part from the exoskeleton. However, 46% load reduction of the exoskeleton is not enough to exert more than twice human pinching force which is required by some workers because a user's sensitivity to recognize change of the force is getting worse by fingertip deformation. For extension of the pinching force range maintaining high force accuracy, the characteristics of fingertip sensitivity is considered so that the wearer could estimate the support force precisely. Then we developed a new exoskeleton which reduces affecting force to 67%. Through experiments, our exoskeleton can augment a user's force by about triple, maintaining its force accuracy at the same level of human ability.	experiment;maximal set	Yasuhisa Hasegawa;Junichi Muto	2014	2014 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science (MHS)	10.1109/MHS.2014.7006083	classical mechanics;control engineering;simulation;engineering	Robotics	74.20043166659667	-24.788943854284547	187538

We explore in this paper, the use of matrix quantization (MQ) to model spectral contours and impose time continuity in presence of noise. It is found that contours fitted over an optimum duration of 90-100 msec greatly improve speech quality. We show that Wiener filters derived from spectral contour matrices must operate in a time-varying manner and also propose a technique to achieve it through interpolation and STFT based reconstruction. In addition to conventional spectral distortion measures, we compare spectral transition measure profiles of clean and enhanced speech which indicate that MQ codebooks combined with time-varying Wiener filtering improve speech enhancement even at 0 dB SNR.	codebook;distortion;interpolation;scott continuity;short-time fourier transform;signal-to-noise ratio;speech enhancement;wiener filter	K.

Therefore, it is necessary for robots to have the same flexibility as people. Additionally, such robots need to incorporate high-level safety features so as not to incur injury on others. We present artificial muscle-type pneumatic actuators as the driving source of a robot hand that is both safe and flexible. Development of robot hands using pneumatic actuators has already taken place. However, when a pneumatic actuator is used, a large compressor is needed. Therefore, the driving system also needs to be large. This is a major problem. Therefore, we developed low-pressure, low-volume pneumatic actuators for driving a robot hand that works flexibly and safely among people and a five-fingered robot hand with these pneumatic actuators installed. To accurately control the five-fingered robot hand, an accurate model with a pneumatic actuator is needed. We constructed such a model by using a spring element, which expresses the generative force of pneumatic pressure, and a damper element, which expresses the hysteresis characteristics. We then made a 1-link arm that has one degree of freedom using the pneumatic actuators and constructed a 1-link armmodel. We also constructed a spring-damper element model of the pneumatic actuators and a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller system. The gains of the system were determined with a simulation that uses our 1-link arm model. The step response of the joint angle was examined with these determined gains.	biconnected component;high- and low-level;hysteresis;pid;pneumatic artificial muscles;robot;robotics;simulation;step response	Tomoyuki Mizuno;Nobutaka Tsujiuchi;Takayuki Koizumi;Yoichiro Nakamura;Mitsumasa Sugiura	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2011.6181462	pid controller;control engineering;simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	70.99630121013116	-24.252480578409035	188053

This paper documents our efforts to develop analytic deposition models for electrostatic rotating bell (ESRB) atomizers, which have recently become widely used in the automotive painting industry. Conventional deposition models, used in earlier automatic trajectory planning tools, fail to capture the complexity of deposition patterns generated by ESRB atomizers. The models presented here take into account both the surface curvature and the deposition pattern of ESRB atomizers, enabling planning tools to optimize trajectories to meet several measures of quality, such as coating uniformity. In addition to the development of our models, we present experimental results used to evaluate our models, and verify the interaction between the deposition pattern, trajectory, and surface curvature.	chemical vapor deposition;circuit complexity;embedded system;glossary of computer graphics;motion planning;physical vapor deposition;thickness (graph theory)	David C.

However, there is not a unique mapping of the motions of the surgeon's hand to the lower-dimensional motions of the instrument through the trocar, and it is not obvious what method would be best. In this letter, we study operator performance during a precision positioning task reminiscent of telemanipulated retinal surgery on a force-sensing phantom retina with three viable and previously considered options for the hapticinterface kinematics. The haptic-interface kinematics are implemented virtually, in software, on a PHANTOM Premium 6DOF haptic interface. Results from a study with 12 novice human subjects show that overall performance is best with the kinematics that represent a compact and inexpensive option, and that subjects' subjective preference agrees with the objective performance results.	haptic technology;imaging phantom;inverse kinematics;precise point positioning;retinal implant	Manikantan Nambi;Paul S.

A neuromusculoskeletal model was used to account for the non-linearity between muscle excitation and muscle force outputs. Following model tuning a close agreement between simulated and measured swing phase kinematics was obtained. Simulation results suggest that swing leg muscles play an important role in controlling the motion of the swing leg during walking, and that the effect of individual muscles is not necessarily restricted to the joints they span or their basic anatomical classifications. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

F0 adaptive spectral smoothing and cepstral liftering based on consistent sampling theory are employed for interference-free spectral estimation. A perturbation spectrum, calculated from temporally stable power and interference-free spectra, provides the basis for both F0 and aperiodicity estimation. The proposed approach eliminates ad-hoc parameter tuning and the heavy demand on computational power, from which STRAIGHT has suffered in the past.	cepstrum;computation;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);sampling (signal processing);smoothing;spectral density estimation;tandem computers	Hideki Kawahara;Masanori Morise;Toru Takahashi;Ryuichi Nisimura;Toshio Irino;Hideki Banno	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518514	adaptive filter;spectrum;periodic function;speech recognition;computer science;speech processing;mathematics;spectral density estimation;fundamental frequency;spectral density;speech synthesis;statistics	Visualization	82.16234886569238	-35.32256332720949	191172

We cast the problem to that of interpolating the instantaneous phase (IP), and hence finding the IF, from samples obtained at the level-crossing instants of the phase signal. These are inherently irregularly spaced and the problem essentially reduces to reconstructing a signal from the samples taken at irregularly sampled points for which we propose a ‘line plus sum of sines’ model. In the presence of noise, the temporal structure of the level-crossings can get distorted. To reduce the effects of noise, we use a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) based enhancement scheme. The performance of the proposed method is studied through Monte-Carlo simulations for a phase signal with composite IF for various SNRs. Different level-crossing based estimates are combined to obtain a new IFestimate. Simulation studies show that the estimates obtained using zero-crossing (ZC) and other very low level values perform better than those obtained with higher level values.	crossing-based interface;instantaneous phase;interpolation;monte carlo method;short-time fourier transform;simulation;spectral density estimation;zero crossing	Seelamantula Chandrasekhar;Thippur V.

The proposed robotic catheter navigation system can execute curved paths and maintain any number of three-dimensional turns using tension stiffening guide-wires composed of a set of disposable friction-locking beads. An external, reusable control system is used to automate the movement of the catheter. This control system uses a custom-designed graphical kinematic analysis program that predicts contact forces, changes in conformation due to external forces, tip deflection and failure modes of the catheter as it advances.	control system;lock (computer science);positioning system;robot;user interface	Yi Chen;Jean H.

By introducing a suitable prior, spectral tilt can be introduced into the source component estimation to better correspond to human voice production. However, the current expectationmaximisation based composite autoregressive model optimisation leaves room for improvement in terms of speed. Inspired by majorisation-minimisation techniques used for nonnegative matrix factorisation, this work derives new update rules for the model, resulting in faster convergence compared to the original approach.

In this design, an external force observer is developed based on measuring motor current and speed without using an expensive force/torque sensor. The mobile robot has a handrail to assist the elderly to walk safely and stably. In this application, adaptive motion compliance is required in accordance with the applied force of the user. Practical experimental results show that the compliance of the walking helper can be adjusted by setting dynamic coefficients of the overall dynamical system. It was demonstrated that the external force observer successfully detected the pushing as well as pulling force of a user on the handrail. The velocity of the omni-directional walking helper is adjusted according to the inferred motion intent.	coefficient;control flow;dynamical system;gravity pipe;mobile robot;motion controller;motion simulator;obstacle avoidance;velocity (software development)	Kai-Tai Song;Chen-Yang Lin	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354293	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;adaptive control;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	69.77481505056019	-26.519898674482707	193341
d12c942dc2293e6e94535e3550139022700f76e0	generalized envelope matching technique for time-scale modification of speech (gem-tsm).	time scale	A new time-domain, non-pitch-synchronous method for timescale modification targeted on broadband speech is proposed. The method is based on the SOLA (synchronous overlap-add) and EM-TSM (envelope-matching time-scale modification) methods, where the sign envelope of the EM-TSM method is replaced by a generalized envelope formed by the highest bits of the samples. (The actual number of bits will depend on word length constraints of the specific hardware.) In addition, a fixed length scheme for calculating cross-correlation is proposed, eliminating the need for normalization after computing each cross-correlation value. With these improvements, the proposed method outperforms EM-TSM both in terms of output quality and computational efficiency.	cross-correlation;ibm spectrum protect (tivoli storage manager);norma (software modeling tool);overlap–add method	Atsuhiro Sakurai	2005			speech recognition;computer science;pattern recognition	Vision	80.26157688869854	-33.677243074741035	193963

The innovative aspects of the proposed approach are expressed through several aspects. Firstly, feet are not considered as an unique solid. Toe joints (at metatarsophalangeal joint, noted MTP) are taken into account in the analysis and simulation of dynamic walking. Secondly, we identify three reference points within human body in order to generate walking motions: MTP joint center of the stance leg, MTP joint center of the swing leg and the geometric pelvis center. Thirdly, we show that position and orientation of reference points are correlated with unique parameter, namely the distance between stance foot and pelvis projected along the forward axis. The correlation is built through spatial coordination (without using “time parameter”), and this, during single and double stance phases. These results are validated by simulating an anthropomorphic humanoid at normal walking speed.	apache axis;data descriptor;reference architecture;security descriptor;simulation	Jean-Christophe Palyart Lamarche;Olivier Bruneau;Jean-Guy Fontaine	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2010.5723322	spatial relation;human body;simulation;gait analysis;engineering;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;foot	Robotics	69.23713194081407	-25.059154711687295	194227

Unexpected buckling can seriously affect the insertion performances, and it should be avoided because it causes unstable and undesirable motion of the needle, thereby damages surrounding vital tissue structures. Although needle insertion simulation methods using haptic interfaces have been reported, yet no extensive study of needle buckle modeling and its haptic simulation can be found. Therefore, in this paper modeling methods of needle buckling in air, buckling in homogeneous tissue, and buckling in multi-layered tissues are proposed. An energy-based method is used to model the feedback force in the insertion procedure through a haptic interface. An experimental simulation system based on a haptic interface is developed.	buckling;control theory;haptic technology;performance;simulation	Xuejian He;Yonghua Chen;Libo Tang	2008	2008 IEEE Conference on Virtual Environments, Human-Computer Interfaces and Measurement Systems	10.1109/VECIMS.2008.4592777	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;biomechanics;haptic technology	Robotics	72.88164570698075	-28.98091096317603	194317

We have previously observed that recovery of overlapping signal elements using NMF is improved through introduction of a sparse coding step, and propose here the incorporation of a sparse coding step using the Hellinger distance into a NMF algorithm.

27372ec2e3b6574d20fb747e0121346e7ad7b1b8	interface design and control strategies for a robot assisted ultrasonic examination system		This paper presents a new robotic system designed to assist sonographers in performing ultrasound examinations by addressing common limitations of sonography, namely the physical fatigue that can result from performing the examination, and the difficulty in interpreting ultrasound data. The proposed system comprises a robot manipulator that operates the transducer, and an integrated user interface that offers 3D visualization and a haptic device as the main user interaction tool. The sonographer controls the slave robot movements either haptically (collaborative tele-operation mode), or by prior programming of a desired path (semi-automatic mode). A force controller maintains a constant contact force between the transducer and the patient’s skin while the robot drives the transducer to the desired anatomical locations. The ultrasound imaging system is connected to a 3D visualization application which registers in real time the streaming 2D images generated by the transducer and displays the resulting data as 3D volumetric representation which can be further examined off-line.	haptic technology;medical ultrasound;online and offline;robot;semiconductor industry;television;transducer;user interface	François Conti;Jaeheung Park;Oussama Khatib	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-28572-1_7	control engineering;computer vision;simulation	Robotics	74.17184713461502	-28.811821773284475	195913
cd8cab4cdb2b304d8f21f5950aaee85af54b586f	directly printable flexible strain sensors for bending and contact feedback of soft actuators		This paper presents a fully printable sensorised bending actuator that can be calibrated to provide reliable bending feedback and simple contact detection. A soft bending actuator following a pleated morphology, as well as a flexible resistive strain sensor, were directly 3D printed using easily accessible FDM printer hardware with a dual-extrusion tool head. The flexible sensor was directly welded to the bending actuator’s body and systematically tested to characterise and evaluate its response under variable input pressure. A signal conditioning circuit was developed to enhance the quality of the sensory feedback and flexible conductive threads were used for wiring. The sensorised actuator’s response was then calibrated using a vision system to convert the sensory readings to real bending angle values. The empirical relationship was derived using linear regression and validated at untrained input conditions to evaluate its accuracy. Furthermore, the sensorised actuator was tested in a constrained setup that prevents bending, to evaluate the potential of using the same sensor for simple contact detection by comparing the constrained response to that of the free-bending state at the same input pressure. The results of this work demonstrated how a dual-extrusion FDM printing process can be tuned to directly print highly customisable flexible strain sensors that are able to provide reliable bending feedback and basic contact detection. The addition of such sensing capability to bending actuators enhances their functionality and reliability for applications such as; controlled soft grasping, flexible wearables, and haptic devices.	calibration (statistics);feedback;finite difference method;haptic technology;mathematical morphology;printer (computing);printing;sensor;wearable computer;wiring	Khaled Elgeneidy;Gerhard Neumann;Michael R.

Many of these physical interactions can be seen as a cooperative task conducted by both the robot and the human. Often, when two humans are interacting, one of them will act as the leader of some aspect of the task and the other will act as a follower. This cooperation may require the switching of roles between leader and follower. This can be further complicated by the fact that different participants may be the leaders of different aspects of the task. Previous research in human-robot cooperation focused on the switching of only a single role. In this paper, we investigate a novel method for the simultaneous switching of two roles between a robot and a human participant. This switching method was examined using both fixed and adaptive parameters that control role switching. Overall, human-robot cooperation was successful in the task 85% of the time when using a non-adaptive method and 95% when using an adaptive control method.	computer multitasking;fundamental interaction;humans;robot;robotics	Bryan Whitsell;Panagiotis K.

MIPS was reported recently to be less sensitive to the poor resolution of spectro- gram and the cross terms in the pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (PWVD). However, in this correspondence we will show that like PWVD, the MIPS possesses cross terms too. The only differences be- tween them are the location and the oscillating frequency of the cross terms. We deduce that the cross terms of the MIPS are located in about the same region of the autoterms, while the cross terms of the WVD are located midway between the autoterms. The undesirable cross terms and artifact between different spectral components are much less se- vere and interfere less with each other in MIPS than in PWVD cases. I. INTRODUCTION Page originally defined the instantaneous power specturm (IPS) as the derivative of the running energy spectrum (I), which satis- fied many of the properties of time-frequency distribution. How- ever, its ringing effect blocks its application. Hippenstiel and De Oliveira (2) advocated the use of the Fourier transform of an av- eraged correlation function estimate. This estimate is further mod- ified by applying a sliding window after forming the correlation estimate. The result, a smoothed version of the real part of the Rihaczek distribution (3), is a modified version of IPS. Hippenstiel shows that the MIPS can be less sensitive to the time-frequency resolution tradeoff problem occurring in the spectrogram 141 and the cross-term interference problem occurring in Wigner-Ville dis- tribution (WVD) (5)-(7). Moreover, the modified IPS (MIPS) can avoid the ringing effect which is a major problem in Page's IPS method. However, in this correspondence we will show that. like PWVD, the MIPS possesses cross terms too. Compared with WVD, the only differences between them are the location and the oscil- lating frequency of the cross terms. This correspondence will also show why the modified IPS reduces the ringing effect.	spectral density	Soo-Chang Pei;Er-Jung Tsai	1993	IEEE Trans.

As a result, positioning a robotic end-effector includes inherent error that will often lead to unsuccessful grasps. In previous work, we demonstrated that optimized configuration, compliance, viscosity, and adaptability in the mechanical structure of a robot hand facilitates reliable grasping in unstructured environments, even with purely feedforward control of the hand. In this paper we describe the addition of a simple contact sensor to the fingerpads of the SDM Hand (Shape Deposition Manufactured Hand), which, along with a basic control algorithm, significantly expands the grasp space of the hand and reduces contact forces during the acquisition phase of the grasp. The combination of the passive mechanics of the SDM Hand along with this basic sensor suite enables positioning errors of over 5cm in any direction. In the context of mobile manipulation, the performance demonstrated here may reduce the need for much of the complex array of sensing currently utilized on mobile platforms, greatly increase reliability, and speed task execution, which can often be prohibitively slow.	algorithm;chemical vapor deposition;data haven;email;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;mobile device;mobile manipulator;robot end effector;sensor;signal processing	Aaron M.

A key step in a traditional Kalman filter requires minimizing an estimation error variance between a clean signal and its estimation. Our new method is to minimize the estimation error variance under the constraint that the energy of the estimation error is smaller than a masking threshold, computed from both time-domain forward masking and frequency-domain simultaneous masking properties of human auditory systems. The new Kalman filter provides a theoretical base for the application of the masking properties in Kalman filtering for speech enhancement. Due to the high computation cost of the proposed perceptually constrained Kalman filter, a perceptual post-filter concatenated with a standard Kalman filter is also proposed as a heuristic alternative for real-time implementation. The post-filter is constructed to make the estimation error obtained from the Kalman filter lower than the masking threshold. A wavelet Kalman filter with post-filtering is introduced to further reduce the computational load. Experimental results with colored noise show that the new constrained Kalman filter method produces the best performance when compared with other recent methods, and that the proposed heuristics with post-filtering can also produce a significant performance gain over other recent methods.	auditory processing disorder;colors of noise;computation;concatenation;heuristic (computer science);kalman filter;masking threshold;pesq;real-time clock;simulation;speaker recognition;speech enhancement;speech recognition;wavelet	Ning Ma;Martin Bouchard;Rafik A.

They normally require the speaker to achieve complete glottal closure, which for many vocal fold pathologies cannot be accomplished. To address this, a nonlinear signal processing approach is proposed which employs a di erential Teager energy operator and the energy separation algorithm to obtain formant AM and FM modulations from bandpass ltered speech recordings. A new speech measure is proposed based on parameterization of the autocorrelation envelop of the AM response. Using a cubic model of the autocorrelation envelop, a three dimensional space is formed to assess changes in speech quality. This approach is shown to achieve exemplary detection performance for a set of muscular tension dysphonias. Unlike ow characterization using numerical solutions of Navier Stokes equations, this method is extremely computationally attractive, requiring only N logN+8N multiplications and N square roots for N samples, and is therefore suitable for real time applications due to its computational simplicity. The new non-invasive method shows conclusively that a fast, e ective digital speech processing technique can be developed for vocal fold pathology assessment, without the need for (i) direct glottal ow estimation or (ii) complete glottal closure by the speaker. The proposed method also con rms that alternative nonlinear methods can begin to address the limitations of previous linear approaches for speech pathology assessment.	algorithm;autocorrelation;computation;cubic function;energy operator;fm broadcasting;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;signal processing;speech processing;waveform	Liliana Gavidia-Ceballos;John H.

In this paper, we study the effect of the endeffector's contact area on the biological cell's manipulation. First, two endeffectors with different size are fabricated based on focused ion beam (FIB) etching. Then, they are used to detach the single cell from substrate. The maximum detaching force of each is calculated and the effect of the endeffector's size on cell manipulation is discussed. After that, different types of end effector are designed for different cell manipulation purpose. The result shows that the contact area at small scale has great affects on cell's manipulation. By changing the contact area, we are able to perform different manipulation tasks, which will benefit the research on accurate positioning as well as the biological analysis at small scale.	atomic-force microscopy;focused ion beam;nanorobotics	Yajing Shen	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO 2014)	10.1109/ROBIO.2014.7090416	robot end effector;adhesive;nanotechnology;etching;force	Robotics	77.11425445924883	-24.886069681962557	199069

Previous work in the area has not provided the eigenanalysis of STFD matrices, which is key to understanding their role in solving direction finding and blind source separation problems in multisensor array receivers. The aim of this paper is to examine the eigenstructure of the STFDs matrices. We develop the analysis and statistical properties of the subspace estimates based on STFDs for frequency modulated (FM) sources. It is shown that improved estimates are achieved by constructing the subspaces from the time–frequency signatures of the signal arrivals rather than from the data covariance matrices, which are commonly used in conventional subspace estimation methods. This improvement is evident in a low signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) environment and in the cases of closely spaced sources. The paper considers the MUSIC technique to demonstrate the advantages of STFDs and uses it as grounds for comparison between time–frequency and conventional subspace estimates.	blind signal separation;direction finding;electronic signature;fm broadcasting;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;source separation;time–frequency representation	Yimin Zhang;Weifeng Ma;Moeness G.

The proposed system integrates adaptive beamforming, ATF identification, soft signal detection, and multichannel postfiltering. The noise canceller branch of the beamformer and the ATF identification are adaptively updated online, based on hypothesis test results. The noise canceller is updated only during stationary noise frames, and the ATF identification is carried out only when desired source components have been detected. The hypothesis testing is based on the nonstationarity of the signals and the transient power ratio between the beamformer primary output and its reference noise signals. Following the beamforming and the hypothesis testing, estimates for the signal presence probability and for the noise power spectral density are derived. Subsequently, an optimal spectral gain function that minimizes the mean square error of the log-spectral amplitude (LSA) is applied. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system in nonstationary noise environments.	adobe photoshop;beamforming;computational complexity theory;detection theory;distortion;gsc bus;mean squared error;microphone;noise power;real-time clock;reference noise;software propagation;spectral density;speech enhancement;stationary process;transient noise	Israel Cohen;Sharon Gannot;Baruch Berdugo	2003	EURASIP J.

Distinguishing from the log-MMSE spectral amplitude noise suppressor proposed by Ephraim and Malah (E&M), our new algorithm is aimed to minimize the error expressed explicitly for the Mel-frequency cepstra instead of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spectra, and it operates on the Mel-frequency filter bank's output. As a consequence, the statistics used to estimate the suppression factor become vastly different from those used in the E&M log-MMSE suppressor. Our algorithm is significantly more efficient than the E&M's log-MMSE suppressor since the number of the channels in the Mel-frequency filter bank is much smaller (23 in our case) than the number of bins (256) in DFT. We have conducted extensive speech recognition experiments on the standard Aurora-3 task. The experimental results demonstrate a reduction of the recognition word error rate by 48% over the standard ICSLP02 baseline, 26% over the cepstral mean normalization baseline, and 13% over the popular E&M's log-MMSE noise suppressor. The experiments also show that our new algorithm performs slightly better than the ETSI advanced front end (AFE) on the well-matched and mid-mismatched settings, and has 8% and 10% fewer errors than our earlier SPLICE (stereo-based piecewise linear compensation for environments) system on these settings, respectively.	algorithm;analog front-end;baseline (configuration management);cepstrum;discrete fourier transform;experiment;filter bank;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;piecewise linear continuation;speech recognition;whole earth 'lectronic link;word error rate;zero suppression	Dong Yu;Li Deng;Jasha Droppo;Jian Wu;Yifan Gong;Alex Acero	2008	IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASL.2008.921761	speech recognition;word error rate;computer science;signal processing;speech processing;mathematics;statistics	ML	82.3632233462486	-32.16199646752287	199766

Experimental motor control research has tended to use the dominant arm, which could bias our understanding of control toward dominant-sided mechanisms. To determine if this is the case for our work on rapid motor responses, we here investigate the effect of laterality on long-latency reflexes, which are a rapid feedback response to perturbations of limb posture. Our results confirm previous work showing that environmental instabilities increase long-latency reflex gain, but we did not observe any difference between the dominant and non-dominant arm. Both arms displayed similar reflex responses during a stabilizing postural task, despite the proposed advantage of the non-dominant side for position feedback control. This suggests that the lateralized specialization of motor control is confined to different cortical pathways than those involved in this reflex response.	alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma;body position;coat of arms;control theory;digital single-lens reflex camera;feedback;handedness;modulation;partial template specialization;poor posture;reflex sympathetic dystrophy;reflex action;unstable medical device problem	Elise H.
