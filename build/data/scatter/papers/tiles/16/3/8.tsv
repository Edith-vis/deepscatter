368897b81ab164551595dd437314ec2df41683e7	executing architectural models for big data analytics		With recent big data analytics (BDA) proliferation, enterprises collect and transform data to perform predictive analyses in a scale that few years ago were not possible. BDA methodologies involve business, analytics and technology domains. Each domain deals with different concerns at different abstraction levels, but current BDA development does not consider the formal integration among these domains. Hence, deployment procedure usually implies rewriting code to be deployed on specific IT infrastructures to obtain software aligned to functional and non-functional requirements. Moreover, previous surveys have reported a high cost and error-prone transition between analytics development (data lab) and productive environments. This paper presents ACCORDANT, a domain specific model (DSM) approach to design and generate data analytics solutions bridging the gap between analytics and IT architecture domains. To validate the proposal’s feasibility and usability, a proof of concept is developed and evaluated.

However. such discussions are nothing but intellectual exercises unless the issue of how to evolve. in a planned and managed fashion, the current highway systems towards these mature AHS is also addressed. Since full functionality of a mature AHS cannot be realized suddenly. discrete functional steps must be identified and optimized. This paper defines an evolutionary stage towards a mature AHS as any discernible functional increment whose realization may encounter considerable difficulties requiring a significant amount of conscious effort to overcome. A good evolutionary scenario consists of stages each of which provides sufficient additional functionality that justifies the required effort to overcome the associated difficulties. Six dimensions of deployment difficulties are identified: technology. infrastructure. human factors. vehicle manufacturing and maintenance. insur­ ance and public will. An illustrative evolutionary scenario is also provided. Since issues reg • rding deploying AHS in the rea/11·or/d actually dictate AHS technological requirements. deployment research should be an integral part of AHS concept definition/evaluation and system design.	concept image and concept definition;floor and ceiling functions;hardware random number generator;human factors and ergonomics;platoon (automobile);requirement;software deployment;systems design	Jacob H.-S.

This paper considers whether such a suggestion targets any real business problem and whether such a system would work in practice. Results are reported of three studies conducted addressing different aspects of the feasibility of bar code EDI: its organisational feasibility, its technical feasibility and its practical feasibility.	automatic identification and data capture;barcode;code refactoring;design rationale;e-commerce;edi;electronic data interchange;human-readable medium;just-in-time compilation;kilobyte;operational view;primer;personal computer;production system (computer science);systems science;the australian;transmitter	Robert B.

This process, while often challenging and frustrating, offers numerous rewards for success. Organizations can change from slow, reactive, adversarial, separated software and systems engineering processes to unified, concurrent processes. These processes better suit rapid development of dynamically changing software-intensive systems involving COTS, agent, Web, mul-timedia, and Internet technology. Culture changes are never easy, however. For example, in the mid-1970s, I participated in a group at TRW that created a corporate software engineering culture around the sequential requirements driven waterfall model. The effort included corporate policies and standards , training courses administered by managers, and even stringent test on software policies. We did not realize how effective this culture change was until we tried to undo parts of it a few years later. By the early 1980s, we and other companies realized that the waterfall model was ineffective for developing user-interactive systems, in which prototypes rather than exhaustive processing specifications proved more effective in determining the most appropriate product characteristics. The """" A Large Sequential-Engineering Near-Disaster """" sidebar provides a good example of the mismatch we found between the sequential, deductive waterfall approach and the need for emergent, synthetic approaches for user-intensive systems. When we attempted to introduce pro-totyping into user-intensive projects at TRW, software engineers, resistant to this change, pounded the table and shouted, """" You can't do that! Prototyping is coding before you've passed your Critical Design Review, which corporate policies absolutely forbid! """" It took years to undo the many ways in which the waterfall model had percolated into various aspects of our corporate culture such as marketing, proposal preparation, cost estimating, contracting, accounting, and management. The recent initiatives to integrate the CMU-SEI Software Capability Maturity Model (CMM) with maturity models for systems engineering and other disciplines provide a similar cultural challenge and opportunity. In the United States, the first example was the FAA's Integrated Capability Maturity Model that integrated the software engineering, systems engineering , and acquisition CMMs. The second effort is the SEI and Department of Defense-led CMM Integration (CMMI) project, which currently integrates the software engineering, systems engineering , and integrated product and process development CMMs, and provides a framework for integrating other CMMs. Even the current software CMM (version 1.1), although a great improvement over previous undisciplined practices, reinforces the sequential waterfall process. …"""	adversary (cryptography);capability maturity model integration;design review (u.s. government);emergence;internet;percolation theory;reactive planning;request for proposal;requirement;software engineering institute;software engineer;synthetic intelligence;systems engineering;undo;waterfall model	Barry W.

In environments where funds are not available to constantly upgrade hardware inline with user demand, alternative approaches need to be considered. We introduce a 'data farming' model whereby dynamic data, which is 'grown' in operational applications, is 'harvested' and 'packaged' for various consumer markets. Like any well managed agricultural operation, crops are harvested according to historical and perceived demand as inferred by a self-optimising process. This approach aims to make enhanced use of available resources through better utilisation of system downtime - thereby improving application performance and increasing the availability of key business data.	data farming;downtime;dynamic data;web application	D.

This raises a challenge: How to ensure that the resulting process models are of sufficient quality? This paper contends that a prior structuring of domain knowledge, as found in informal specifications, will positively influence the act of process modeling in various measures of performance. This idea is tested and confirmed with a controlled experiment, which involved 83 master students in business administration and industrial engineering from Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and Eindhoven University of Technology. In line with the reported findings, our recommendation is to explore ways to bring more structure in the specifications that are used as input for process modeling endeavors.	breadth-first search;business process;industrial engineering;microsoft outlook for mac;process modeling	Jakob Pinggera;Stefan Zugal;Barbara Weber;Dirk Fahland;Matthias Weidlich;Jan Mendling;Hajo A.

IBM has been among the pioneers seeking to unlock the value dormant in these resources. We report on a project exploiting product returns as a source of spare parts. Key decisions include the choice of recovery opportunities to use, the channel design, and the coordination of alternative supply sources. We developed an analytic inventory control model and a simulation model to address these issues. Our results show that procurement cost savings largely outweigh reverse logistics costs and that information management is key to an efficient solution. Our recommendations provide a basis for significantly expanding the usage of the novel parts supply source, which allows for cutting procurement costs. 5001-6182 Business 5201-5982 Business Science Library of Congress Classification (LCC) HF 5415.135 Product management, decision making M Business Administration and Business Economics M 11 R 4 Production Management Transportation Systems Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) M 11 Production management 85 A Business General 260 K 240 B Logistics Information Systems Management European Business Schools Library Group (EBSLG) 260 K Logistiek Gemeenschappelijke Onderwerpsontsluiting (GOO) 85.00 Bedrijfskunde, Organisatiekunde: algemeen 85.34 85.20 Logistiek management Bestuurlijke informatie, informatieverzorging Classification GOO 85.35 Productiemanagement Bedrijfskunde / Bedrijfseconomie Bedrijfsprocessen, logistiek, management informatiesystemen	information systems;information management;inventory control;library of congress classification;logistics;procurement;sim lock;simulation;systems management	Moritz Fleischmann;Jo van Nunen;Ben Gräve	2003	Interfaces	10.1287/inte.33.6.44.25189	inventory control;supply chain management;inventory;economics;service management;systems engineering;marketing;operations management;simulation modeling;spare part;mathematical model;supply chain;information management;commerce	ECom	-67.76960864535019	4.5107366965985785	91913

The complex service landscapes of multi-sourcing settings, however, entail significant challenges for customers. They are struggling with managing the various providers and integrating interdependent services. One challenge is to motivate competing outsourcing providers to work together. In this paper, we present five organizational models to establish a service integration and management function in multi-sourcing. Our findings reveal that service integration and management is differentiated into strategic and operational activities. On the client side, the retained organization is the key organizational unit to perform strategic service integration and management. The organizational entity that performs the operational activities, however, varies with the respective organizational model. Our research is based on a literature review and a qualitative study. With our work, we lay the basis for a better understanding of service integration and management and, thus, more mature multi-sourcing implementations.	client-side;interdependence;organizational unit (computing);outsourcing	Marius Goldberg;Axel Kieninger;Hansjörg Fromm	2014	2014 IEEE 16th Conference on Business Informatics	10.1109/CBI.2014.43	service provider;service level requirement;service product management;knowledge management;business administration;operations management;service design;knowledge process outsourcing;business;outsourcing	DB	-74.18938808842806	9.654253486455604	92994

Today, coping with complexity is a problem not only for process plant operators but for everyone. And while computers in 1981 were looked upon as the solution, they are now seen as the source of the problem. This paper discusses why and how the meaning of ‘coping with complexity’ has changed over the years and speculate on what may lie ahead.	aqua;cognitive ergonomics;complete (complexity);complexity;computer;exception handling;heart rate variability;human factors and ergonomics;humans;requirements analysis;spatial variability;theory;threat (computer)	Erik Hollnagel	2011	Cognition, Technology & Work	10.1007/s10111-011-0202-7	complexity;simulation;medicine;environmental health;pathology;computer science;engineering;suicide prevention;human factors and ergonomics;injury prevention;automation;coping;forensic engineering;computer security;scientific control;mechanical engineering	Logic	-63.84947005532972	7.072423137246671	93794

By supporting specialization and modularization of service providers, cloud computing involves the trend towards distributed service generation. Hence, multi-vendor networks arise and IT departments have to handle heterogeneous IT Service Value Networks (ITSVN). This research paper analyzes the concept of heterogeneity in ITSVN. Based on a literature review, this paper introduces a model of heterogeneity in ITSVN. Elements of this model are applications, platforms, infrastructures, actors, technologies, interfaces, and tools. Heterogeneity is caused by the diversity and alterity of the attributes of these elements. This article offers a fundamental understanding of the effects of heterogeneity in ITSVN, a definition of heterogeneity in ITSVN, and a model of influencing factors on heterogeneity in ITSVN.	cloud computing;itil;partial template specialization;value network	Robert Heininger;Loina Prifti;Markus Böhm;Helmut Krcmar	2016			marketing;data mining;management science	DB	-71.34754189591395	9.034397368615759	94001

Despite its high popularity and the urgent demand from customers to implement ISO 9000, some major concerns for those organizations that are seeking registration to ISO 9000 include the expensive cost and the lengthy time to implement. The purpose of this paper is to describe an expert advisory system for ISO 9001 implementation by using an expert system shell called Visual Rules Studio. This expert advisory system integrated the ISO 9001 quality system guidelines and an evaluation approach based on the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) criteria into a knowledge-based expert system. By identifying the critical ISO elements and comparing the company’s current quality performance with ISO standards, this advisory system provides assessment results and implementation suggestions to the organization. The advisory system has been validated by a group of quality professionals. The following contains a description of the system and a discussion of the validation results. Limitations of the system and recommendations for future research are also discussed. q 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	expert system	Hsien-Tsung Liao;David Enke;Henry Wiebe	2004	Expert Syst.

6ee398641d409b2b5369e4b3c9a4a458b1feef89	certus: an organizational effort towards research-based innovation in software verification and validation		What is gratifying to a software engineering researcher? Three of many possible answers to this question are (a) the intellectual exercise in developing/disseminating approaches that address emerging and existing challenges, (b) recognition from impact in a community of researchers and (c) widespread use of novel ideas, including software, in the society at large leading to enhancement of human ability and job creation. A culmination of these sources requires an organizational effort. This article presents a detailed account of a research-based innovation centre, Certus, to facilitate such a culmination for software engineering researchers. Certus has established a body of knowledge, methods and tools for the validation and verification of software systems in the Norwegian private and public sector. Certus works in close cooperation with five founding user partners and is hosted by the Simula Research Laboratory. We present the organizational structure of Certus and describe how Certus’s life and health is planned and evaluated on a regular basis as a research-based innovation centre. We expound two successful collaborations, with (a) the private sector entity Cisco systems, Norway and (b) the public sector entity the Norwegian Customs and Excise. We hope that this document will serve as a basis to encourage national/international funding schemes to create call for proposals for long-term research-based innovation centres. This, we believe, is one way to justify use of tax payers resources in creating a win–win situation for the triple helix: government, researchers and industry.	software verification and validation	Sagar Sen;Dusica Marijan;Arnaud Gotlieb	2018	Int.

bf79d65483aeff9f9374aca709f55b57d17f70ef	the molson coors operational portfolio architecture: a case study		After decades of progress, IT projects are still too likely to fail. Managing projects for success has become a critical goal for many organizations. Project portfolio management started in the Coors Brewing Company (CBC) as a way to improve the success rates of IT projects. Before the creation of an IT program management office (PMO) about 65 percent of running projects were rated as healthy (essentially on-time and on-budget); after the creation of the IT PMO, as many as 95 percent of the ongoing projects became rated as healthy. While the IT PMO was dramatically improving the efficiency of the IT organization, the New Product Packages (NPP) organization was implementing its own product program management office. Ultimately, the combined buzz of these two success stories within Coors led the CEO to sanction the creation of a U.S.-divisional PMO – known as the CBC PMO. With the recent merger with Molson Canada another layer was created called the Global PMO. What started as a strategic IT initiative ended up changing the entire culture and framework of the company – Coors had entered the elite group of companies that could prove stellar technology investment success rates. Now, while its vision 1 Appendix A provides a list of acronyms. Communications of the Association for Information Systems (Volume 18, 2006), 710-745 711 The Molson Coors Operational Portfolio Architecture: A Case Study by S. Bonham, R. Scudder, B. Morrato and J. Pashak is to create PMOs in its other two subsidiaries, Coors Brewers Limited (CBL) and Molson Canada, as it did with the creation of its CBC PMO, the company is running into some new challenges. This case study is split into four main sections: Introduction, Background (Coors history, project portfolio management history), IT PMO, and Global PMO. In the introduction we present the two organizations that have driven the creation of the Molson-Coors operational portfolio architecture: the IT PMO and the Global PMO. This summary then allows us to frame the four core problems of this paper in both the context of these two PMOs and in the context of the recent merger with Molson, Inc. After clarifying the goals of the paper, we then step back and review the history of the Coors Brewing Company and the history of project portfolio management. With the goals outlined and the background established, we start the section on the evolution of the IT PMO. Finally, in the last section, we show how the four core problems derived from the Global PMO and how lessons learned from the IT PMO may be applied. We hope that by framing the four problems from different perspectives (corporate history, industry approaches, IT PMO evolution and the Global PMO architecture) the reader will be able to more easily develop solutions.

d44a0420912630078b04db6f675e0636dddf91b7	a team hiring solution based on graph-based modelling of human resource entities		As modern organizations become more agile and support more complex business processes, acquiring the right set of talent is becoming crucial for their operations. One of the key talent acquisition problems is staffing a team that has requirement for multiple job descriptions, from a pool of external candidates. This team hiring problem may arise for (i) a new organization, (ii) a new group in an existing organization, or (iii) an existing group that faces high attrition level. This paper presents a Talent Acquisition Decision Support System (TADSS) that provides decision support for team hiring. The system first builds a weighted graph based model for the three types of Human Resource (HR) entities in the problem setup (jobs, employees and candidates), and the inter-relationship among them. Next, an algorithm based on spectral embedding of the HR Graph is used to select teams. The system then provides an interactive team selection and comparison interface based on the HR Graph. Simulation-based evaluations show the effectiveness of the proposed system in team formation.	entity	Avinash Sharma;Jyotirmaya Mahapatra;Asmita Metrewar;Abhishek Tripathi;Partha Dutta	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20612-7_12	simulation;knowledge management;management science;business	Robotics	-67.55108918634535	13.842703851872212	96680

Based on the literature, business tests can be divided into three domains, i.e. performance, risk and compliance and separate domain-specific frameworks have been developed. These different domains and frameworks hint at some aspects that need to be taken into account when managing business tests in a company. In this paper we identify the most important concepts concerning business tests and their management and we provide a first conceptual business test model. We do this based on an archival research study in which we analyse business tests performed by an international consultancy company.	archival research;business process;domain-specific language	Marijke Swennen;Benoît Depaire;Koen Vanhoof;Mieke Jans	2014		10.5220/0004969204780483	business model;business analysis;business requirements;performance;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;business case;data mining;risk;management science;business analytics;process management;business process;business relationship management;management;business rule;new business development;business process modeling;line of business;business activity monitoring;business architecture	ML	-72.77183003959613	10.753102201235446	96913

The unprecedented growth in service-based business processes over a short period of time has underscored the need for understanding the mechanisms and theorising the business models and business process management adopted across many organisations today. This research presents a survey of the literature and argues that the inability of current Business Process Management (BPM) techniques to visualise and monitor web-enabled business processes prevents us from transforming information on network activity and infrastructures. This inhibits managers in anticipating change and adapting to more agile business practices in service science. Thus, this research-in-progress sets out to propose the need to develop a framework to enhance a manager’s ability to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) while improving business process restructuring practices through social network analysis (SNA).	agile software development;business process;social network analysis	Noel Carroll;Eoin Whelan;Ita Richardson	2010	2010 International Conference on Service Sciences	10.1109/ICSS.2010.85	business analysis;business service provider;business process reengineering;systems engineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;marketing;performance indicator;business case;process management;business;business process;business process discovery;new business development;business process modeling;business activity monitoring	DB	-73.82996158088763	11.578622200753111	97070

Internet technologies and related services are major driving forces for those changes. With the application of Internet technologies, business activities become more ef cient and new services are being rapidly developed. However, challenges are also emerging in this new business environment. For instance, take telecommunications services as an example of understanding the challenges in a new service development process. In the process of provisioning telecommunications services, ease of comparative shopping and low switching costs make it more dif cult to retain customers. Preferences for telecommunications services are ever changing and new services are needed. There is an increased need for being connected anytime anywhere with a wireless connection rather than a wired connection. There is a need for purchasing goods and services over the Internet easily and securely. There is also an increased demand for high-speed broadband services in order to take advantage of multimedia and interactive technologies. Moreover, users are looking for integrated and interoperable bundled services rather than standalone services. Uncertainties about customer demands and preferences make it dif cult to plan for new services. Other uncertainties, such as regulatory change, competitive landscapes, cost estimations and unexpected technological changes, also complicate the new service development process. However, uncertainty can create both critical challenges and opportunities for companies. The challenges are clear: uncertainty creates risks that plans will not work as conceived and those unpleasant surprises may prevent a company from realizing the potential value of its activities and resources (Teisberg, 1993). To be successful in this era of the new business environment characterized by rapid change and uncertainty, risks created by uncertainty must not only be avoided, but the opportunities that uncertainty creates must also be exploited. Despite the considerable uncertainty in business and the importance of understanding uncertainty in the new product and service development process (Urban and Hauser, 1993), industry efforts for managing uncertainty have hardly been satisfactory (Nichols, 1994). There are many tools and approaches proposed for managing new product and service development processes, for example quality function deployment, the stage–gate process, using cross-functional teams, making product champions and others. Even though they are useful and necessary in the new product and service development process, Mullins and Sutherland Journal of Information Technology (2002) 17, 103–118		Jae-Hyeon Ahn;Ann Skudlark	2002	JIT	10.1080/02683960210161258	telecommunications control software;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;electrical engineering;management information systems;management science;information technology;information system	HCI	-74.23966164611889	6.847378284653916	97300

The authors begin by presenting the core elements of EA compliance testing. Next, the authors discuss the testing process and four types of compliance checks (i.e., correctness check, justification check, consistency check, and completeness check). Finally, an empirical case is reported in which a real-life project has been tested on conformance, demonstrating and evaluating the authors’ approach. The results indicate that objective compliance testing cannot be taken for granted. Therefore, several suggestions are presented to decrease the subjectivity of assessments, such as operationalization of EA prescriptions.

This normative approach, focusing strongly on the to-be situation, should ensure that both enterprise-level and local initiatives within the organization are consistent with the overall strategy, and enable a coherent and integrated development of business, information and IT. This directive function of EA targets not only managers as its users, but also business analysts, system analysts, software architects and other roles in projects (re)designing the business and its IT support. In this article, we focus mainly on this latter function, a prescriptive EA providing constraints and high-level solutions to which business and IT systems – and in particular the projects implementing them – should conform. Prescriptive EAs prove to be common in practice. One example is the Enterprise Architecture of a manufacturing company, which uses principles, policies and models to ensure that business and IT initiatives are consistent with the business strategy (Bruls et al., 2010). Another example is a national statistical institute’s architecture, consisting of principles and models to which projects much adhere in order to save costs and increase the quality of statistical products (Foorthuis & Brinkkemper, 2008). An EA’s norms or prescriptions are often applied in projects. Although EA typically focuses on the entire enterprise and compliance is indeed demanded at this level, in practice it is unrealistic for an entire organization to become EA-compliant at short notice. It can therefore be expected that conformance will be achieved incrementally at the local level, step by step – or rather, project by project (cf. Ross et al., 2006). However, philosophers have acknowledged for hundreds of years that, although compliance with ‘contracts’ might be better for the group as a whole and it might also be in an individual actor’s best interest to agree to contracts, it may not be in his interest to actually comply with them. In contractarian ethics this is one of the issues of the so-called compliance problem (cf. Gauthier, 1991; Hartman, 1996). Because of this potential conflict of interest, it should be tested whether actors actually conform to the contract. If we consider a specific project to be the actor, then an EA could be seen as the contract that needs to be complied with. In other words, although conformance is required for obtaining EA benefits, it cannot be expected to occur automatically (Boh & Yellin, 2007). This is especially relevant here as compliance with EA norms may be in the best interest of the organization as a whole, but not optimal per se to the local projects and departments that actually have to comply. Assessments should therefore be carried out at the level at which EA is applied, i.e., the project level. Testing at this level also allows for correcting noncompliant aspects, at least if it is performed while EA is being applied. Assessing projects on conformance is crucial, as a large survey study (n=293) has shown not only that project compliance with EA is positively associated with various strategic benefits, but also that the most important determinant of conformance is in fact conducting compliance assessments of projects (Foorthuis et al., 2010). Emmerich et al. (1999) define compliance in the context of IT projects as “the extent to which software developers have acted in accordance with the ‘practices’ set down in the standard.” Kim (2007) defines compliance in this context as “an accordance of corporate IT systems with predefined policies, procedures, standards, guidelines, specifications, or legislation.” In the context of EA we define compliance as corporate business and IT systems being in accordance with predefined Enterprise Architecture prescriptions. We will use the terms “compliance” and “conformance” interchangeably. Likewise, “assessing compliance” and “testing on conformance” are considered equivalent. A “project” in this article refers to the regular projects that need to comply with Enterprise Architecture, which, by and large, have a localized scope (e.g., delivering a new business process and related IT applications for a department). In this article, we aim to answer the following research question: 46 Journal of Database Management, 23(2), 44-71, April-June 2012 Copyright © 2012, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited. How can projects, and the business and IT solutions they deliver, be assessed on compliance with a prescriptive EA? To answer the main research question, we will divide it into several sub-questions: 1. What concepts play a key role in assessing compliance with EA? 2. By what process can EA compliance testing be carried out? 3. What kind of compliance checks can be utilized in the EA compliance test process, and what are their respective evaluation criteria? The underlying goal of our research is to identify and explore core aspects of testing projects on EA compliance. It is our intention to stimulate additional research into the topic. A second, more practical goal is that the results should provide organizations with a working model that can be used to develop their approach for testing their change initiatives on EA conformance. This article will proceed as follows. In the next section, related topics and work are discussed. Following that, we position our study in the context of EA and describe the research approach. The subsequent sections aim to find answers to the respective sub-questions and present our empirical case. The final section is for discussion and conclusions. RELATED TOPICS AND WORK Although we did not find any academic work dedicated to assessing compliance with EA at the time of our research, the topic can nonetheless be linked to other work. In particular, EA conformance testing is related to the fields of compliance management, software testing and auditing. In terms of compliance management, several areas relevant to our discussion can be acknowledged. First, due to legislation, organizations are required to comply with regulations that have consequences for their business processes and information systems. Non-compliance here may even have penal consequences for an organization’s management (El Kharbili et al., 2008). In Europe, important drivers are Directive 95/46/EC, i.e., the Data Protection Directive, and Directive 2002/58/EC, i.e., the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive (Massacci et al., 2005; Nouwt, 2008). Examples of laws in the United States which demand compliance are the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (Kim, 2007; Lankhorst, 2005; zur Muehlen et al., 2007). The Basel Accords, featuring regulations for capital adequacy of the banking sector, form an example of a global regulatory framework (Barr & Miller, 2006). A second area in compliance management is consistency with international and industrywide standards for processes and products, such as ISO 9001 for quality management and IEC 61508 for safety. There are several reasons for conforming to such best practices, for example clients or strategic partners demanding certification for assurance reasons, and using best practices to improve the organization’s processes and products. Conformance to standards is especially important in large and critical systems engineering projects in, e.g., the defense, aerospace and telecommunications sectors. See Emmerich et al. (1999), Pfleeger et al. (1994), and Chung et al. (2008) for more about compliance with standards. We will employ some of the concepts in these publications in our own research. A third relevant area is security and risk management, which aims to protect the organization’s assets, such as valuable information. Compliance here has an important role to play in preventing both deliberate and unintentional harm to the organization, e.g., by imposing access restrictions. See for example von Solms (2005), Drew (2007), and Vroom and von Solms (2004) for more on this topic. All three areas are relevant to our discussion, as an EA can feature constraints and high-level solutions based on any of the above. Needless to say, they are not mutually exclusive.

0785242c2b6597fea7d0c3e13a4ddcc8b2272f86	towards a theory of economic value for modeling and simulation: incremental cost of parallel simulation (wip)		A useful perspective on the economic value of simulation in engineering comes from considering the role simulation plays in constructing a system. We propose a conceptual model that combines an embryonic concept of the value of an information bit with cost estimation tools used in software engineering. The model provides an economic justification for the common conception that models should be built to address specific questions rather than to comprehensively represent a referent system. Extending these ideas, we offer a model for the incremental value of parallel execution to explain why simulation applications that take advantage of sophisticated parallel discrete event simulation tools form a relatively narrow niche despite the ubiquity of parallel computing hardware. The proposed model enables us to bring value of information criteria into model development and to make predictions about the future of parallel simulation applications.		James J. Nutaro;Bernard P.

251aa0dd55b83814d99ee0cb1f4e5d2a5a8643a1	teaching supply chain simulation - from beginners to professionals		Both in academia and industry, supply chain simulation is a relatively mature subject. Academic researchers have produced supply chain modelling/simulation frameworks and have used simulation to teach supply chain dynamics. A review of industrial applications however points to the heavy use of consultants and/or simulation software vendors. The shortage of in-house supply chain simulation skills/practitioners appears to be hampering the wider use of simulation. Although many universities in the UK offer postgraduate programs in Supply Chain Management a very few provide opportunities to learn and experience hands-on simulation. This paper presents how a commercial simulation software that understands supply chain language was used in various settings to develop simulation skills and teach supply chain dynamics. This paper will also outline how an integrated environment involving simulation software and an industry standard supply chain management framework can be used to develop the simulation skills and competencies of supply chain professionals.	comparison of command shells;hands-on computing;simulation software;software engineering;technical standard	Terrence Perera;Thashika Rupasinghe	2015	2015 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)			AI	-67.6995758906911	18.185408928851796	98004

The current computer science curricula at most universities do not prepare students to develop industrial  strength software and little is available in the way of continuing professional development. Consequently, Motorola has begun  a major initiative to develop and deliver software engineering training. This paper discusses Motorola's effort to establish  the training needs of its software engineers and the results of that effort. It provides conclusions from the ongoing investigation  of other major companies' software engineering training. It contrasts industry-university relationships in the US, Japan,  and Europe. Finally, it discusses the establishment of Motorola-university training programs in the United States, Israel,  and Japan.  	software engineering	George Sanders;George Smith	1990		10.1007/BFb0040436	personal software process;verification and validation;software engineering process group;systems engineering;engineering;social software engineering;software development;software engineering;software construction;software walkthrough;software development process;software requirements;computer engineering;software peer review	SE	-69.45730757640531	18.21960408870265	98158

09a837da45650f38d4e75cc5534b60df02dec456	bpm@kmu – designing e-learning for the introduction of bpm in small- and medium-sized enterprises		Business Process Management (BPM) becomes more and more relevant also for small- and medium-sized companies (SME’s). Today’s strategies and approaches for the implementation of BPM rely on methods and tools mainly developed by and focused on large enterprises but less on the needs of small- and mid-sized organisations. With the BPM@KMU project the Institute of Information Systems of a Bavarian university conducts together with the Virtual University of Bavaria (VHB) and a set of SMEs a project which aims on an efficient implementation of BPM in such organisations. Considering e-Learning as an enabler or tool which matches existing barriers for the implementation of Business Process Management, this paper offers a case study report on the observations when designing and implementing the BPM@KMU e-Learning program guided by the Cybernetic e-Learning Management Model. The paper considers first project results and shows, that e-Learning can address the heterogeneous maturity and previous knowledge about BPM by an adequate set of instructional as well as technological strategies and concepts.

3c442c935170f1c536b4302ce22ebe08eb170f52	editorial note for the special issue on 'artificial intelligence techniques for supply chain management'	supply chain management	The global economy and the recent developments in IC technologies have significantly modified the business organization of enterprises and the way that they do business. New forms of organizations such as extended enterprises, virtual enterprises, long supply chains, etc., turn to appear and they are quickly adopted by most leading enterprises. It is noticed that ‘‘competition in the future will not be between individual organizations but between competing supply chains’’ (Christopher, 1992, 2004). Thus, business opportunities are captured by groups of enterprises in the same supply chain network. The main reason for this change is the global competition that forces enterprises to focus on their core competences (i.e. to do what you do the best and let others do the rest). According to a visionary report of Manufacturing Challenges 2020 conducted in USA, this trend will continue and one of the six grand challenges of this visionary report is the ability to reconfigure supply chains rapidly in response to changing needs and opportunities. Although the resulting supply chains are more competitive, the tasks for planning, managing and optimizing are much more difficult and complex. While alliances like supply chains represent tremendous business opportunities, they also make related enterprises face greater uncertainties and risks. Supply chains are subject to market volatility and will have to be modified or dissolved once the business opportunities evolve or disappear. Changes or major perturbations at one enterprise will propagate through the supply chains to other enterprises and hence adversely influence the overall performance of the supply chains/networks. These issues are particularly important for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). SMEs have to be part of some supply chains for business opportunities but they are not strong enough to face high uncertainties and risks, which are very common in today’s dynamic and volatile markets. The capabilities to evaluate agility, benefits, performances, risks, etc. of supply chains are crucial for the long-term efficiency and thus need serious research attentions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been put to use in multiple segments of the supply chains. AI techniques have taken a prominent role to integrate people, information and products across dynamic supply chain boundaries including management of various manufacturing, logistics and retailing operations, such as in manufacturing, warehousing and distribution of goods. Decisions involving customer profiling, new product development, retail marketing and sales patterns are immensely refined	artificial intelligence;customer relationship management;darknet market;grand challenges;logistics;markov chain;new product development;performance;supply chain network;volatility	Lyès Benyoucef;Vipul Jain	2009	Eng.

672790668517ed3ebd9669348bdc086d04546999	research on the implementation of rfid system in the management of traditional chinese opera costumes and props		The utilization of new IT technologies in the business processes has revolutionized the way management has been done traditionally. The modern management system has allowed businesses to approach Item Management in an efficient manner, increasing the information transparency and accuracy, making the access, review, categorize, package, and storage of items easier than before. The art of Chinese Opera is deeply rooted in tradition and history, an enigma to outsiders without the proper guidance of an expert or professional. The oral tradition of Chinese Opera also means that there is a lack of a complete real-time information system for the management of costumes and props. The implementation of RFID system in the management of Chinese Opera wardrobe can greatly aid in the teaching and continuation of the art. Traditional Chinese Opera has different characters, costumes and props, with rules outlining the costumes and props each character should be wearing and using. The scripts also have basic requirements for choreography, costumes, props and characters. By applying the six basic Chinese Opera elements of scriptwriting, composition, character, costume design, set and lighting combined with the three key aspects of script, actor, and costume design, this study seeks to create an object database for the management of scripts, characters costumes, and props. Furthermore, this study will integrate the object database with a RFID system to create a Traditional Chinese Opera Wardrobe Management System. The implementation of RFID system in the management of traditional Chinese Opera wardrobe can improve the problems involved with the manual management of the costume wardrobe. The integration of information such as scripts, showings, characters, costumes, and props into the system can also provide an information management platform to the costume wardrobe manager, aiding in the preparatory works involved before each play and the check and storage of the items during return.	business process;categorization;continuation;enigma machine;information management;information system;management system;opera (web browser);radio-frequency identification;real-time data;real-time transcription;requirement;screenwriting	Wuu-Yee Chen;Pi Lin	2006	IJEBM		engineering;multimedia;advertising;communication	DB	-62.94209740201606	5.379907412505848	98742
4d0f410212add39f40db8b38936209be0bcd3fb2	new process management for emergency management: case study about an accident of a vehicle transporting dangerous goods		Successful organisations are interested in achieving their business policy and goals, ideally with minimal financial expenses. Process Management approach is an effective way to meet the goal. There are two groups that are focused on the field of process standardization: Object Management Group and Workflow Management Coalition, each of them focuses on the process standardization from a different point of view. For solving complex issues it is effective to combine both approaches. That is the reason why this paper shows new Process Framework for Emergency Management which can describe precisely the process deployment in the area of emergency management taking into account its process oriented methodology and complex architecture. The correctness of the Process Framework is guaranteed by continuous verification, validation and optimization of emergency processes. Applicability of the solution is shown on a case study that simulates progress of an emergency situation in the real environment.	correctness (computer science);mathematical optimization;software deployment;verification and validation	Tomás Ludík;Jaroslav Rácek;Lucie Pekárková	2011		10.7148/2011-0323-0329	transport engineering;business;forensic engineering;computer security	AI	-63.89859594138563	10.485106024718101	98796

Based on an empirical investigation, the current state of information logistics is analyzed. The results reveal three common information logistics scenarios: (S1) Balanced, (S2) Standard biased and (S3) Quality and strategy biased. Each scenario is analyzed by taking into account different factors. The four predominant factors identified in this study are (F1) Centralization and process integration, (F2) Quality, (F3) Standardization, and (F4) Sophistication of strategy. It is important to understand which information logistics scenarios exist and how these are shaped. This knowledge is necessary to systematically adapt methods and conceptual models for information logistics design to specific situations.	centralisation;exploratory testing;information logistics;noise shaping	Gerrit Lahrmann;Florian Stroh	2009	2009 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2009.980		SE	-68.31537153660959	15.484651481650529	99313

Nowadays many countries have established environmental laws. Hence, companies are being asked to provide the eco-profiles of products. In order to assist electronic companies to execute the life cycle assessment (LCA) and construct the eco-profiles for applying the environmental product declarations (EPDs), this research applies the web service technology and the eco-spold XML data exchange standard to develop a LCA service platform (LCASP) to share the LCI (life cycle inventory) data among the members of the LCASP. For ensuring the consistency of the eco-profiles, the LCASP provides the electronic companies with the product category rules that explain which the information must be provided in the eco-profiles. In addition, the related domain experts review and verify the correctness of LCI data at the LCASP. In order to reduce the effort of LCI data gathering, the LCASP provides the LCI database and the search engine to let the electronic companies quickly find the LCI data of the specific common parts or components. Through the employing the LCASP, the cost and time of LCA for electronic products can be decreased significantly.	correctness (computer science);liquid contact indicator;web search engine;web service;world wide web;xml	Tzu-An Chiang;Hsing Hsu;Chia-Wei Hung	2012	IJEBM		engineering;operations management;data mining;database	DB	-63.23293023916479	9.615080520867403	99495

The legislation mandates that manufacturers bear the economic burden of collection and disposal of products at the end of their useful lives. Reuse or remanufacturing of some components might be more cost-effective than disposal and provide an opportunity for recovery of their economic value. However, manufacturers have not traditionally engaged in the long-range planning over several product lifecycles that cost-effective reuse or remanufacturing requires. This paper develops a model for incorporating long-range planning for component reuse in product design. The model employs a product portfolio approach based on market segmentation, rather than a single product. The model is embedded in a decision tool that aids in determining when a product should be taken back, and which components should be reused, recycled, or disposed. A case study of a line of personal computers (PCs) demonstrates an implementation of the model. It also shows that if product take-back is mandated, it is in the PC manufacturer’s best interest to shift from selling a product to essentially selling a service by controlling when the product is taken back and, thus, effectively creating a leasing program. The portfolio approach creates opportunities for the design engineer to distribute the cost, reliability, and environmental impacts of component reuse, remanufacture, and recycling in such a way that the end result is higher customer satisfaction than designing one product for all customer groups.	embedded system;personal computer;third-party software component	Donna Mangun;Deborah J.

4c4743f895655d85580839e421e4c35a38ea766f	some aspects of the use of contextual information in production processes	production process;graphic arts	The production process in graphic arts can be divided in several work- or dataflows, which fundamentally differ. One deals with the creation and modification of content, i.e. photographing a scene, modifying text, retouch of pictur data, etc. The other attempts to generate, organize, and manage contextual information which can e.g. be of design, technical (screening, color definition), administrative (customer, invoice info) or product specific information (desired paperstock, finishing) character. In the paper under view those workflows are closer examined. It is shown that the creation of genres (generic product prototypes like books, flyers, etc.) may in certain cases be used to simplify both workflows. It may also be used to generate information required for both content creation (like layout) and technical purposes. The approach presented discusses a method to create a publication dependent on the information which genre is to be addressed. The concept is based on the reuse of intermediate products or of output data. For the implementation of the concept we introduce the fundamental workflows involved and an architecture containing some of the important elements required. In a final part a first overview of the implementation of the concept is given. It turns out that the job ticket, the design of the page elements and the layout are the crucial factors in a genre based production.© (1998) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

However, implementation of an EIS is complex and laden with numerous risks.Objective: We apply the socio-technical model (STM) to propose a framework of risks for the development and implementation of an EIS. Such a framework may serve to guide risk management strategies and procedures beyond current practices.Method: To assess, and better understand, the risks associated with implementing an EIS, interviews were conducted with the employees of three principle stakeholders of a taxation EIS. The interviews centered on the detailed experiences of the participants applying and working with EIS projects at their respective organizations.Results: Content analysis of the interviews confirmed an ability to designate risks to both the project and the product of development through dimensions of task, actor, structure and technology as well as the fit between each combination. The result adds credence to the model for purposes of risk management in the development of an EIS.Conclusion: Executive information systems play an integral role in business decision making. The successful construction and implementation of an EIS are reliant upon a clear understanding of the appropriate technology to be used, the end-user accessing the system, and the tasks executed. The STM is a useful tool for the identification of risks in the creation of an EIS. Further work should consider the extendability to other systems and its compatibility with development approaches.	executive information system	Chia-Ping Yu;Houn-Gee Chen;Gary Klein;Randi Jiang	2015	Information & Software Technology	10.1016/j.infsof.2015.08.001	project management;engineering;knowledge management;software development;risk;management science;management	SE	-77.14835793628502	9.177460694899155	101185

In these three cases, we provide solutions for typical business analytical problems originating mainly form the process industry. Fuzzy ontology represented as a fuzzy relation provides the basis for every application. By looking at the similarities among the three cases, we discuss the main lessons learnt and provide some important factors to be considered in future applications of soft computing in industrial applications.	soft computing	József Mezei;Matteo Brunelli	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-26986-3_11	analytics;computer science;data science;data mining;management science	Robotics	-66.06668977086666	11.3415096132668	101235

Unfortunately, this technology still remains largely underutilized by industry today. This paper suggests benefits to industry resulting from the widespread, pervasive implementation of manufacturing simulation technology. Potential simulation impact areas are closely intertwined with strategic manufacturing. Yet, a number of factors currently inhibit the deployment of simulation technology in industry today. The development of new simulation interface standards could help increase the deployment of simulation technology. Interface standards could improve the accessibility of this technology by helping to reduce the expenses associated with acquisition and deployment, minimize model development time and costs, and provide new types of simulation functionality that are not available today.	accessibility;pervasive informatics;simulation;software deployment	Charles R.

e4e6d2e4d83a7053b590821bf6c9a0b89e450f86	adoption of human resource development management model for group planning		The human resources development management model that has been developed in previous stage of the research allows to create information systems with functionality to automatize the human resources development planning process. The author researched the model’s use cases and identified grope factors that influence development planning. The present article describes two approaches to extend the model in order to provide development planning in groups. Post-planning optimization approach is based on linear optimisation methods and allows to preserve the full individualisation of development plans by combining employees in groups with the same solutions in development plans. In this way, the group interests are not realized in full scale in order to maintain full individualisation. Pre-planning optimisation is based on competence gap analyses and provides better grouping with less individualisation. Both methods should be implemented in a real system for better suitability.	full scale;information system;linear programming;mathematical optimization	Maksims Kazakovs	2016		10.5220/0005912101990204	strategic human resource planning;knowledge management;resource management	Robotics	-77.1341186799904	9.765595931184508	101672
8a05fe7f8232522ffcd9b175b034934aaf23e525	problem drift: a risk model for complex socio-technical projects		Increased globalisation and market volatility put pressure on organisations to become more flexible and explore new technologies and operational domains, so that projects are becoming more complex, with increasing uncertainty and risk. Complex project management is challenging for both traditional and agile approaches: traditional techniques may be left behind by unrecognised environmental change in a volatile context, while in a stable environment, agile may require too expensive interaction with the client. One area of growing interest is how traditional and agile may combine to increase the chance of project success. Yet how to strike a balance between the two remains poorly understood. In this position paper, we propose a model for complex socio-technical projects related to risk arising from volatility, that tries to explain the balance of agile and traditional. The model introduces the concept of drift rate as a measure of volatility, with the impact of drift related to loss of development resource, risk accumulation as a function of resource expenditure and drift rate, and validation the means to manage that risk.

Here we address the problem of adjustment in line processes by using System Dynamics combined with a Multiple-Domain Matrix. Data from a case study of line processes of an industry partner is used as an empirical basis. The implications from the results of the model are used for adjusting the line processes of the industry partner. The paper contributes by demonstrating the utility of the developed method combination for line process adjustment.	computer simulation;epd;introspection;master data management;mathematical optimization;mock object;process optimization;system dynamics;systems engineering	Daniel Kasperek;Lukas Bermond;Sebastian Maisenbacher;Michael A.

Information security is thus becoming more and more important to companies' self-protection. In contrast to previous systems, this is also directly visible to the customer. The changing situation means, however, that the requirements for security cannot be solely filled by new policies and risk analysis. This article proposes an approach called ''holistic security requirement engineering'' meant to elicit security requirements according to system-theoretic considerations. It will show that security requirements can be defined with the help of investigations in the business environment, workshops with stakeholders and risk analysis. This multidimensional approach will lead to a holistic understanding of the requirements that fit into the system development life cycles.	e-commerce;holism;requirements engineering	Albin Zuccato	2004	Computers & Security	10.1016/S0167-4048(04)00065-3	software security assurance;computer security model;standard of good practice;cloud computing security;security through obscurity;risk analysis;security information and event management;security engineering;security convergence;business requirements;asset;computer science;information security;requirement;information security standards;security service;systems development life cycle;security testing;computer security;non-functional requirement;information system;information security management	DB	-66.33490748152104	14.247634478195492	102093
7d724223c6702b257ad476b3e6cbffa1effbbc31	applying a systems thinking framework to assess knowledge assets dynamics for business performance improvement	business studies;knowledge assets;knowledge assets dynamics map;information management;systems thinking;business performance improvements	Knowledge assets represent strategic resources and sources of organizational value creation. Their effective development and deployment is at the basis of organizational value creation capacity. However there is still a lack of applied approaches and tools explaining how knowledge assets dynamics take place in organizational value creation mechanisms. In particular, there is a managerial need to define decision-support frameworks that can enable managers to understand how knowledge assets interact each other and with organizational performance in order to support the achievement of company's strategic objectives. A better understanding of why and how knowledge assets management initiatives can be turned into value creation mechanisms with positive impacts on business performance is fundamental to avoid misallocation of resources and to support management decisions. This paper proposes a systems thinking-based framework, the Knowledge Assets Dynamics Value Map (KAVDM), to explicate the working mechanisms by means knowledge assets can evolve on the basis of knowledge management initiatives and affect business performance improvements. The KAVDM offers a holistic view of the mechanisms at the basis of how knowledge assets are translated into organizational value. It supports the explanation and monitoring of how knowledge assets are interpedently and dependently linked, and how the management of one knowledge asset activates flow dynamics, that influence both other knowledge assets and business performance. Using the KAVDM managers can reflect upon the knowledge components grounding a company's value creation and assess their mental models and views of the reality. Finally, an application of the KAVDM within a construction company is presented and its main managerial benefits addressed.		Giovanni Schiuma;Daniela Carlucci;Francesco Sole	2012	Expert Syst.

However, implementing ERP systems is a complex process. In addition to the technical issues, companies must address problems associated with business process re-engineering, time and budget control, and organisational change. Numerous industrial studies have shown that the failure rate of ERP implementation is high, even for well-designed systems. Thus, ERP projects typically require a clear methodology to support the project execution and effectiveness. In this study, we propose a theoretical model for ERP implementation. The value engineering (VE) method forms the basis of the proposed framework, which integrates Six Sigma tools. The proposed framework encompasses five phases: knowledge generation, analysis, creation, development and execution. In the VE method, potential ERP problems related to software, hardware, consultation and organisation are analysed in a group-decision manner and in relation to value, and Six Sigma tools are applied to avoid any project defects. We validate the feasibility of the proposed model by applying it to an international manufacturing enterprise in Taiwan. The results show improvements in customer response time and operational efficiency in terms of work-inprocess and turnover of materials. Based on the evidence from the case study, the theoretical framework is discussed together with the study’s limitations and suggestions for future research.

1e2b9ad5e2ffc560c395902cc05a46ed252db0ff	the case for server consolidation: or back to the glass house?		Over the past two decades, Information Technology has witnessed the morphing of computing environments from single large monolithic entities to widely distributed server configurations. The initial promise of less costly, more scalable and flexible platforms has not been realized. To the contrary, many organizations have found that a consolidation of distributed servers back to a more centralized approach offers greater control, standardization, performance and cost savings. This swing back of the pendulum should be considered by all organizations to determine if it is appropriate to redefine their computing environment. This paper addresses the issues involved in server consolidation opportunities and offers recommendations for initiating this effort.	semiconductor consolidation	Ellen M. Friedman;Jerry L.

This extended adoption is yet not avoiding failure rates in OSS projects to be as high as 50%. Inadequate risk management has been identified among the top mistakes to avoid when implementing OSS-based solutions. Understanding, managing and mitigating OSS adoption risks is therefore crucial to avoid potentially significant adverse impact on the business. In this position paper we portray a short report of work in progress on risk management in OSS adoption processes. We present a risk-aware technical decision-making management platform integrated in a business-oriented decision-making framework, which together support placing technical OSS adoption decisions into organizational, business strategy as well as the broader OSS community context. The platform will be validated against a collection of use cases coming from different types of organizations: big companies, SMEs, public administration, consolidated OSS communities and emergent small OSS products.	commercial software;ecosystem;emergence;holism;open sound system;open-source software;risk management;spatial variability;strategic management	Xavier Franch;Angelo Susi;Maria Carmela Annosi;Claudia P.

Agile supply chain strategies focus on responding quickly to market needs and changing market demands. Agile enablers are enabling technologies and methodologies which are significant to achieve agility. Despite the food sector's importance, food industry has received limited attention in literature in the context of agile strategies. This work proposes an analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-based framework to improve agility of food processing industries. Identification of agile enablers is based on the literature review and experts' opinion. The objective of this paper is to prioritise enablers for agile supply chain using AHP, in the context of Indian food processing industries. Understanding these priorities helps food processing industries develop strategies to improve supply chain agility.	agile software development;analytical hierarchy	A.

The instrument implies the replacement of technology that is conducted through investment projects concerning specific productive activities. The aim of the CDM is to simultaneously fulfill different purposes for different participants. These purposes are: green-house gas (GHG) reductions for environmental integrity, sustainability for host countries, and cost-effective mitigation for investors. However, since its first implementation, the CDM seems not being able to succeed the role for which it was created. This situation has been presented due to the significant effect on investors' decision-making process derived from issues belonging to technical, institutional authorities and emission trading dimensions. In this study, through a comprehensive review of literatures, we qualitatively analyze the contribution of CDM activities in recent years. The main findings in this study are, firstly, the weakness of the CDM to simultaneously provide benefits among participants and secondly, the key elements in which practitioners should pay attention to improve the role of the CDM in the upcoming future.	conceptual schema;pixel;trionic	I-Hsuan Hong;Guillermo Alfonso Napoles Rodriguez	2014	Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE 18th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD)	10.1109/CSCWD.2014.6846937	emissions trading	Visualization	-71.16383761956605	6.965265092312714	103345

An empirical study of project work in the computer games sector explored the role played by milestone schedules. We found that such objects played a central role in coordination in several related ways which could not be explained in terms of previous theorizing. First, such objects exhibited a capacity to act as a meta-object; i.e. representing and inter-relating other objects. Second, through their narrative quality, these objects were critical to collaborating groups' ability to respond to the emergent features of project work. Third, by representing the practices of different groups temporally, these objects made them more accountable to management control.	emergence;metaobject;pc game;schedule (computer science);temporal logic	Harry Scarbrough;Nikiforos S.

To this end, research has brought forward a notable number of customer integration methods. The selection of a particular method is governed by various organizational constraints; there is, however, a paucity of research providing decision support for practitioners in terms of when to use which customer integration method. Using the design science approach, our research addresses this research gap by implementing a decision support system to assist practitioners in the selection of appropriate customer integration methods. We elicit requirements from literature and expert interviews, and subsequently design, implement, and evaluate a prototype of the system. Based on identified requirements, the prototype is implemented as a webbased tool (HTML5). The DSS tool aims to acquaint practitioners with use cases and experiences with different customer integration methods.	decision support system;html5;prototype;requirement	Kathrin Füller;Ranjitha Ramanath;Markus Böhm;Helmut Krcmar	2015			voice of the customer;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;data mining;customer intelligence;management;world wide web	AI	-72.13852083784458	10.121184434756538	103398

This paper illustrates the key IT Management requirements and reviews the current state of the art. A case study highlights the contribution of reference models and management related tools for organizations and presents an integrated management architecture."""	agent-based model;align (company);best practice;cobit;itil;requirement	Martin Knahl	2005			environmental resource management;data management;integrated management;business	SE	-70.40088108644656	13.395454001084314	103975

Owing to the complexity of the subsystems involved in the automotive industry, a system dynamics approach was selected to develop the simulation model based on a case study. Nevertheless, because of the standard structure of the proposed model, it can be generalized to other automotive companies. The model provides a detailed causal analysis of how supply networks and local conditions interact. The results show the strong relationship existing between the local suppliers and the OEM at the core of the cluster, which can generate competitive advantages in the region. However, it can also create a gap in the local supply chains and in the labor capital when the demand of the OEM decreases due to factors such as the global economic crisis. The results reveal how clusters with a strong centralized structure in one industry make them highly specialized. However, the lack of effective public support policies makes them weaker in front of the variability imposed by globalization.	causality;centralized computing;heart rate variability;simulation;system dynamics	Cuauhtémoc Sánchez-Ramírez;Miguel Gastón Cedillo-Campos;Pedro Perez-Villanueva;José Luis Martínez Flores	2011	Simulation	10.1177/0037549710393259	supply chain management;automotive industry;system dynamics	AI	-77.19102292244364	6.327626068806498	104040

Consequently, firms develop new strategies, processes and technologies to utilise the Social Web for their needs. From the perspective of CRM, the Social Web creates an opportunity to directly include customer knowledge and shape a field called Social CRM (SCRM). Even though methods and tools for data extraction and media monitoring are already available, the analytical requirements of SCRM and necessary functionalities are open for research. This research explores the role of analytical SCRM and examines available tools with the required functional and technological components. The findings show that existing tools still have a limited functional scope which makes a ‘best-of-breed’ approach necessary. Finally, a concept for an integrated analytical SCRM system is proposed that comprises necessary SCRM components.	customer knowledge;customer relationship management;requirement	Olaf Reinhold;Rainer Alt	2011			knowledge management;direct market access;data extraction;social crm;social web;social media;media monitoring;customer relationship management;computer science;customer knowledge	HCI	-76.02925946966097	5.694049799088304	104455

It is widely recognized that the Locator/ID Split paradigm fits well the requirements for the new, more scalable, Future Internet architecture. Both the academy and the industry have already produced several technical proposals, with their own peculiarities and merits. However, despite such an effort, it is still unclear, how the Locator/ID Split will be deployed, what are the drivers of its adoption, who will adopt it, and how the adoption process will most likely evolve in time. In this paper, we answer to these questions by presenting an adoption model for the Locator/ID Split paradigm.	academy;analysis of algorithms;border gateway protocol;fits;future internet;interoperability;online locator service;programming paradigm;requirement;scalability;software deployment	Luigi Iannone;Tapio Levä	2010		10.3233/978-1-60750-539-6-11	engineering;data mining;world wide web;computer security	Networks	-76.84669542001143	15.270720105576013	104650

Generally speaking, crowdsourcing describes outsourcing of tasks to a large group of people instead of assigning such tasks to an in-house employee or contractor. Crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower have gained particular attention as active online market places for reaching and tapping into this glut of a still largely under-utilized workforce.  Crowdsourcing offers intriguing new opportunities for accomplishing different kinds of tasks or achieving broader participation than previously possible, as well as completing standard tasks more accurately in less time and at lower cost. Unlocking the potential of crowdsourcing in practice, however, requires a tri-partite understanding of principles, platforms, and best practices. This tutorial will introduce the opportunities and challenges of crowdsourcing while discussing the three issues above. This will provide attendees with a basic foundation to begin applying crowdsourcing in the context of their own particular tasks.	amazon mechanical turk;best practice;crowdsourcing;outsourcing;the turk;triangular function;web services distributed management	Omar Alonso;Matthew Lease	2011		10.1145/1935826.1935831	simulation;crowdsourcing software development;computer science;knowledge management;data science;data mining;world wide web;crowdsourcing;best practice	HCI	-75.10491378398238	16.719882497928072	104898
a5b1b04d634c82fd0998ae4f05a39d69a3dd53f0	towards cloud-centric service environments		Cloud computing has evolved and is expected to grow further into an enormously booming market segment especially for start-ups and SMEs as they can benefit from the concept of “Anything as a Service” (XaaS) without the need to invest significant financial resources in IT capabilities. Through the usage-based models, seemingly infinite resources based on rapid elasticity, multi-user systems, and the ability to access the network anytime and anywhere, organizations can achieve increased cost-effectiveness and efficiency in their business operations. This paper discusses, with a particular emphasis on start-ups and SMEs in the B2B and B2C markets, how e-business value creation drivers such as novelty, efficiency, complementarities and lock-in can leverage and enhance business value in practice. Using the example of the textile and apparel industry, this paper pinpoints how cloud computing can foster an environment in which new opportunities can blossom and added values are created for both businesses and consumers through modern marketing and networking technologies using an inclusive social and technological environment.	accessibility;anytime algorithm;cloud computing;complementarity theory;cooperative breeding;decision support system;elasticity (cloud computing);electronic business;fundamental fysiks group;interdependence;multi-user;platform as a service;vendor lock-in	Andreas Mladenow;Natalia Kryvinska;Christine Strauss	2012	JoSSR	10.1007/s12927-012-0009-y	marketing;operations management;business;commerce	HCI	-74.87877842364298	5.894241886293478	105252

Despite the increasing acceptance of cloud computing within the industry many important questions remain unanswered, or are answered only partially. Besides issues relating to the best architectures, legal issues and pricing models, suppliers of cloud-based solutions are faced with the question of appropriate requirements engineering. This means eliciting optimum understanding of the customer’s requirements and implementing this into appropriate requirements of the solution to be realised. This article examines selected, established requirements engineering methods in order to study the extent to which they can be applied to the specific requirements of cloud-based solutions. Furthermore, it develops a comparison framework containing the features of cloud computing. This comparison framework is applied to four established process models for requirements engineering. Recommendations for a requirements engineering system adapted to cloud computing are derived.	cloud computing;cost efficiency;information system;mit engineering systems division;recommender system;reference model;requirement;requirements engineering;v-model	Stefan Wind;Holger Schrödl	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-24396-7_32	requirements analysis;requirements management;cloud computing;computer science;requirement;requirements elicitation;management science;requirements engineering;non-functional requirement	SE	-70.81587890660622	12.173717017319415	105707

cb4522c365ac1b73f5faa8743acc1095454fab86	improving consulting processes in web analytics: a framework for multichannel analytics		To control and optimise their marketing activities, organisations analyse customer behaviour on their online and offline channels. This is referred to as multichannel analytics (MCA). As enterprises often do not have the necessary know-how to implement analytics processes, analytics consultants support them in such projects. The problem for the consultants is that a standardised approach, which provides orientation and guidance during such projects, is currently not available. The goal of this paper is to develop a framework, which guides consultants in order to avoid common project-related problems. It is developed employing Design Science Research Methodology. Empirical data collection and iterative validation of the framework are based on literature research, document analysis, expert interviews and a focus group. Results highlight that it is useful to combine a capability maturity model and an analytics procedure model. This allows taking into account the different degrees of organisational maturity during the consulting process.	capability maturity model;focus group;iteration;iterative method;online and offline;web analytics	Yves Studer;Uwe Leimstoll	2015			analytics;business analytics;software analytics;semantic analytics	SE	-68.09668912511256	13.412559411311463	105837
b21a3e46b484485651883b9f8660406a74779ee2	using a systemic perspective to support engineering change management		Engineering change management (ECM) is an important enabler for the overall success of engineering projects. Engineering changes (ECs) occur because engineering projects are exposed to internal and external dynamic influences. The implementation of ECM supports project managers involved in coordinating EC processes, which results in more efficient operations. There are, however, many challenges related to ECM because of the need for internal and external stakeholders to collaborate during the EC process. Many existing approaches that support ECM adopt a reductionistic perspective. This paper takes a novel approach by adopting a systemic perspective. The self-organizing nature of complex systems is of particular interest because efficient ECM is a learning process that requires constant adaptation on different organizational levels. This paper describes how self-organization can be incorporated in ECM processes. A case study at a large construction project illustrates how ECM can facilitate self-organization. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research.	change management (engineering)	Julian Wilberg;Fatos Elezi;Iris D.

SLA (Service level agreement) is defined by an organization to fulfil its client requirements, the time within which the deliverables should be turned over to the clients. Tracking of SLA can be done manually by checking the status, priority of any particular task. Manual SLA tracking takes time as one has to go over each and every task that needs to be completed. For instance, you ordered a product from a website and you are not happy with the quality of the product and want to replace the same on urgent basis, You send mail to the customer support department, the query/complaint will be submitted in a queue and will be processed basis of its priority and urgency (The SLA for responding back to customers concern are listed in the policy). This online SLA tracking system will ensure that no queries/complaints are missed and are processed in an organized manner as per their priority and the date by when it should be handled. The portal will provide the status of the complaints for that particular day and the ones which have been pending since last week. The information can be refreshed as per the client need (within what time frame the complaint should be addressed).

07ef292af6f829b9b3a2fd720dd8b9bd40711ea5	a survey on domain-specific languages for machine learning in big data		The amount of data generated in the modern society is increasing rapidly. New problems and novel approaches of data capture, storage, analysis and visualization are responsible for the emergence of the Big Data research field. Machine Learning algorithms can be used in Big Data to make better and more accurate inferences. However, because of the challenges Big Data imposes, these algorithms need to be adapted and optimized to specific applications. One important decision made by software engineers is the choice of the language that is used in the implementation of these algorithms. Therefore, this literature survey identifies and describes domain-specific languages and frameworks used for Machine Learning in Big Data. By doing this, software engineers can then make more informed choices and beginners have an overview of the main languages used in this domain.

cfffc2836988ed43d19ffcd9ccc91bc9e3489878	blockchain in logistics and supply chain: a lean approach for designing real-world use cases		The Blockchain technology can be defined as a distributed ledger database for recording transactions between parties verifiably and permanently. Blockchain emerged as a leading technology layer for financial applications. Nevertheless, in the past years, the attention of researchers and practitioners moved to the application of the Blockchain technologies to other domains. Recently, it represents the backbone of a new digital supply chain. Thanks to its capability of ensuring data immutability and public accessibility of data streams, Blockchain can increase the efficiency, reliability, and transparency of the overall supply chain, and optimize the inbound processes. The literature concerning Blockchain in non-financial applications mainly focused on the technological part and the Business Process Modeling, lacking in terms of standard methodology for designing a strategy to develop and validate the overall Blockchain solution and integrate it in the Business Strategy. Thus, this paper aims to overcome this lack. First, we integrate the current literature filling the lack concerning the digital strategy, creating a standard methodology to design Blockchain technology use cases, which are not related to finance applications. Second, we present the results of a use case in the fresh food delivery, showing the critical aspects of implementing a Blockchain solution. Moreover, the paper discusses how the Blockchain will help in reducing the logistics costs and in optimizing the operations and the research challenges.	accessibility;bitcoin;business process;digital strategy;immutable object;inbound marketing;internet backbone;logistics;process modeling	Guido Perboli;Stefano Musso;Mariangela Rosano	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2875782	distributed ledger;supply chain;data stream mining;business process modeling;systems engineering;use case;blockchain;distributed computing;digital strategy;computer science	DB	-70.50917967672122	8.016653554887233	106403

The trade-off between customer service levels and inventory reserves is addressed in practice by statistical inventory software solutions; given the tremendous number of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) that contemporary organisations deal with, such solutions are fully automated. However, empirical evidence suggests that managers habitually judgementally adjust the output of such solutions, such as replenishment orders or re-order levels. This research is concerned with the value being added, or not, when statistically derived inventory related decisions (Order-Up-To (OUT) levels in particular) are judgementally adjusted. We aim at developing our current understanding on the effects of incorporating human judgement into inventory decisions; to our knowledge such effects do not appear to have been studied empirically before and this is the first endeavour to do so. A number of research questions are examined and a simulation experiment is performed, using an extended database of approximately 1800 SKUs from the electronics industry, in order to evaluate human judgement effects. The linkage between adjustments and their justification is also evaluated; given the apparent lack of comprehensive empirical evidence in this area, including the field of demand forecasting, this is a contribution in its own right. Insights are offered to academics, to facilitate further research in this area, practitioners, to enable more constructive intervention into statistical inventory solutions, and software developers, to consider the interface with human decision makers.

9e76eaad37e61de959eb0c7095cfd592b80d2c1e	portals for business intelligence	business intelligence	Today, the business domain is confronted with a paramount avalanche of documents and business data. Continuous capturing of business data, be it success indicators or other performance metrics, have led to a tremendous amount of information sources. At the same time, the number of documents—each carrying valuable information once perceived in a proper context—is also booming at tremendous speed. Three issues arise: (1) how to derive data patterns that are perhaps critical for the mission of a company, (2) how to extract knowledge structures from unstructured data, and (3) how to identify relationships among structured and unstructured data. The latter is of particular importance for instance for the search of evidence in unstructured data for certain business tasks. A combination of all three issues will improve information intelligence services in particular for the case of business intelligence. In the context of business intelligence, companies strive to assess their competitive strategies by analyzing relevant information in structured as well as unstructured data. The first issue has been addressed by data mining algorithms, which are well established in research and industry. The second issue revolves around text mining while going beyond mere information retrieval, and it is currently well-recognized by major vendors of document management systems. Both issues are supported by portal concepts for the navigation in distributed information sources. The third issue is rather a combination of the former issues by orchestrating methods for the exploration of unstructured and structured data. Subsequent business scenarios illustrate the need for the identification of patterns and for the combination of knowledge that has to be derived from both structured and unstructured information sources:		Andreas Becks	2007			business analytics;reactive search optimization;business activity monitoring;data mining;data model;business intelligence;business domain;text mining;unstructured data;computer science	DB	-71.01531547148755	8.475729423486799	106545

There has been a lot of literatures to study the choosing basis, influencing factors, and forming processes of risk communication strategies. However, little of them focused on the automatically generating of the strategies. Aims at solving this problem, this paper proposes a mechanism of generating risk communication strategies which is based on the goals of risk communication. Firstly, proposing the innovate structure of risk communication strategies represented of framework and establishing the system of risk communication strategies. Then, based on the system, proposing the model of mechanism of generating risk communication strategies based on goals and stating the model in detail in the example of considering the lowest public opinion as the goal of risk communication. Finally, pointing the possible problems of the mechanism model and further research directions. This paper proposes an intellectualized procedure or method of generating risk communication strategies and provides aids to making the risk communication effective.	risk management	Xiangyang Li;Gen Li;Zhaoge Liu	2016	2016 12th IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation (ICCA)	10.1109/ICCA.2016.7505263	risk analysis;it risk management;risk management;engineering;knowledge management;it risk;management science;government;factor analysis of information risk	SE	-65.30817027751533	6.9957514460768175	106663

Examples can be found in heavy process industries, communication networks, electrical power services, and water resource systems. In all of these applications, the expansion of production capacity requires the commitment of substantial capital resources over long periods of time. Capacity expansion planning consists primarily of determining future expansion times, sizes, and locations, as well as the types of production facilities. Since the late 1950s, operations research methodology has been used to develop various models and solution approaches suitable for different applications. In this paper, we attempt to unify the existing literature on capacity expansion problems, emphasizing modeling approaches, algorithmic solutions, and relevant applications. The paper includes an extensive list of references covering a broad spectrum of capacity expansion problems.	operations research	Hanan Luss	1982	Operations Research	10.1287/opre.30.5.907	mathematical optimization;operations management;mathematics;management science;operations research	Theory	-64.52143273951576	4.999611034182841	106689

Many research projects are undertaken, especially in the domain of semantic interoperability. Many of these efforts seem to start from a technical solution rather than from an actual business problem. By taking a narrow view on the problem space, they only promise limited support for the many challenges in the domain of interoperability and innovation of e-government services.

Taken literally, however, it raises many issues, including practical difficulties of creating a service-oriented enterprise in the computer science sense and the huge leap from flexible IT infrastructure to an enterprise that is genuinely oriented toward providing services for customers and employees. This paper is a conceptual contribution showing how work system theory can help in seeing analysis and design issues beyond technical architectures that have dominated research to date. After summarizing background concepts related to service, service systems, and the vision of service-oriented enterprises, this paper explains how work system theory can help in recognizing many obstacles on the path toward that ideal. Recognition of those obstacles supports analysis and design by illuminating the amount of change required to move to a genuinely service-oriented enterprise and by helping analysts and designers decide where service-orientation in its various guises is really appropriate.	computer architecture;computer program;computer science;imperative programming;responsiveness;school of everything;service-level agreement;service-orientation;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;service-oriented infrastructure;software architecture;systems theory;work systems;workaround	Steven L.

e65b228ff856b3f7953c1a303d5439919544f37b	complex event processing for city officers: a filter and pipe visual approach		Administrators and operators of next generation cities will likely be required to exhibit a good understanding of technical features, data issues, and complex information that, up to few years ago, were quite far from day-to-day administration tasks. In the smart city era, the increased attention to data harvested from the city fosters a more informed approach to city administration, requiring involved operators to drive, direct, and orient technological processes in the city more effectively. Such an increasing need requires tools and platforms that can easily and effectively be controlled by nontechnical people. In this paper, an approach for enabling “easier” composition of real-time data processing pipelines in smart cities is presented, exploiting a visual and block-based design approach, similar to the one adopted in the Scratch programming language for elementary school students. The proposed approach encompasses both a graphical editor and a sound methodology and workflow, to allow city operators to effectively design, develop, test, and deploy their own data processing pipelines. The editor and the workflow are described in the context of a pilot of the ALMANAC European project.	algorithm;complex event processing;graphical user interface;next-generation network;pipeline (computing);programming language;real-time data;scratch (programming language);sensor;smart city;waste	Dario Bonino;Luigi De Russis	2018	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2017.2728089	computer science;scratch;operator (computer programming);distributed computing;smart city;systems engineering;visual approach;simulation;big data;visual programming language;complex event processing;workflow	HCI	-63.67519130934227	15.513133155563699	107218

Value Webs consist of networks of partners who collaborate within different stages of interlinked value chains enabled by ICT. They form a basis for establishing a new interdisciplinary research field. Diffusion of Internet, web services as well as deployment of mobile and pervasive technologies result in both industry wide and organizational transformations with far reaching micro- and macro economic effects. These transformations are triggered by pervasive ICT infrastructures, and new products and services that enable sustained product- and process-innovations. Examples of such innovations include Zero Latency Business, Mass Customisation, Enterprise Application Integration, Collaborative Supply Chain Management, Mobile Commerce, and Customer Integration in product development and distribution. Each one of them echoes deep changes that the Internet and Mobile Technologies are creating in that Internet and Mobile Technologies affect now all facets of production, distribution and usage of information goods and significantly transform development-, production- and distribution of physical goods.	enterprise application integration;internet;mobile commerce;new product development;personalization;pervasive informatics;software deployment;web service	Heide Bruecher;Kristin R.

This paper identifies and describes  an approach to help overcome some of these problems, particularly the mismatch or understanding gap between the customer and  the developer. The approach is intended to be used at the early stages of requirement determination and introduces techniques  from operational research into the process. In particular set theory and Venn diagrams are used as a way of graphically representing  the relationships and gaps in understanding that may exist. The benefit obtained from the use of the technique is partly in  the graphical representations themselves but mainly in the dialogue and negotiation that result from the construction of the  diagrams. The technique has been developed in a research study of retail organisations’ use of information technology in the  UK and an example case study from the sector is used to illustrate and discuss the technique.  	diagram;information system;requirement	Wafi Al-Karaghouli;Sarmad Alshawi;Guy Fitzgerald	2000	Requirements Engineering	10.1007/PL00010348	computer science;knowledge management;theoretical computer science;management information systems;data mining;information technology;information system;set theory	SE	-64.18710112781609	12.857005174825993	108096

In particular, Information Systems are inevitable when it comes to the transition from the """"current"""" to the """"smart"""" power grid. This enables an improved balancing of both electricity supply and demand, by shifting load --- based on the projected supply gap and electricity prices --- on the demand side smartly. As this requires a specific Information System, namely a Demand Response system, we address the challenge of designing such a system by utilizing the design science approach: determining general requirements, deducing the corresponding information requirements, analyzing the information flow, designing a suitable Information System, demonstrating its capability, and, finally, evaluating the design. The design process is reiterated fully until a viable solution, i.e. an IS artifact, has been developed. This paper describes both the design process as such and the final IS artifact.

This applies also to the management of Virtual Organizations (VO). A potential source for this information is Performance Measurement. But traditional Performance Measurement (PM) methodologies and indicators are designed to assess the performance of single companies or static networks. Specific challenges and requirements of VOs are not addressed in an appropriate way. An essential aspect is for instance the collaboration performance, which has in many VOs a vital impact on the success. The objective of this paper is to provide an approach for addressing collaboration performance in the performance measurement of a VO. Therefore the main perspectives of collaboration performance and examples for potential indicators are described.	requirement;virtual organization (grid computing)	Ingo Westphal;Klaus-Dieter Thoben;Marcus Seifert	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-73798-0_4	economics;computer science;knowledge management	Metrics	-70.33560679018241	10.809080162862372	108431

The goal of this paper is to provide a hybrid modeling approach that integrates the dynamic programming and the balanced scorecard models for strategy optimization of e-business values. Values from the market, supply chain, business organization, and customer perspectives are identified first based on a generic e-business model framework. In the subsequent value-based strategic planning stage, strategies with objectives and metrics for value creation in different perspectives are outlined. In the mean time, a multiperiod, multi-dimensional dynamic programming model is formulated for optimizing the expected total business value. In the value-based performance measurement stage, an adapted balanced scorecard model is developed to hold a balanced view for evaluating strategy performances regarding all value perspectives. The proposed modeling approach aims at providing e-business firms with clear and well-structured guidelines for efficiently and effectively handling complex decision and management activities including business model design, value identification, strategy formulation, as well as performance measurement.	dynamic programming;electronic business;expectation–maximization algorithm;mathematical optimization;performance;programming model;strategic management	Chien-Chih Yu	2006			multi-swarm optimization	AI	-77.03173871247711	7.518970960138559	110054

These working papers are expected to be published in due course, in revised form, and should not be quoted or cited without the author's written permission. ABSTRACT Based on a literature review of previous research and case studies, this paper develops a conceptual model that traces and categorises the different inter­ organisation information coordination and control mechanisms in the logistics domain. This model is referred to as the B2B e­business reference architecture (ERA). Studies in system architecture have largely focused on the technical perspective of e­business within an enterprise, with little research has been done on the inter­organisation perspective especially in the context of customised logistics. Via the synthesis of literature, four fundamental architectures, dealing with different logistics scenarios, are proposed and discussed in detail. The paper concludes by drawing implications for current research as well as highlighting future research opportunities. INTRODUCTION In the last two decades, the role of e­business as a fundamental element that links the organisations of the supply chain into a unified and coordinated system has been discussed in the literature. In fact it is argued that the supply chain structure is now governed by the flow of information and decisions, rather than the physical flow of goods [1].	collaborative software;control system;emergence;information architecture;logistics;reference architecture;requirement;systems architecture;tracing (software)	John Perkins;Sharon Dingley	2001			architecture;online transaction processing;computer science;transaction cost;collaboration;database;electronic business;distributed transaction;transaction processing system	AI	-68.53661177916379	10.026243791843326	110056

In service industries however, there is no inventory of finished goods that can be used to buffer production and yet maintain superior service levels in the face of uncertain demand patterns. Hence capacity planning for different resources takes on special importance in achieving high customer service levels. In this paper, we focus on the human resource element in a generic service firm. Using the system dynamics methodology, we develop a model of workforce acquisition and training that is driven by target levels of customer service and customer base. The model reveals the significant effects of natural process delays on maintaining service levels, and we demonstrate how it can serve as a decision support tool to achieve growth in the customer base while maintaining service levels. Such analysis can contribute to the collection of activities needed to conduct customer relationship management.	customer relationship management;decision support system;system dynamics	Amitava Dutta;Rahul Roy	2006	Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'06)	10.1109/HICSS.2006.263	tertiary sector of the economy;service level requirement;customer to customer;voice of the customer;service level objective;customer lifetime value;service level;decision support system;service product management;differentiated service;service management;knowledge management;service delivery framework;marketing;operations management;customer reference program;human resource management;service design;service guarantee;customer intelligence;industrial relations;system dynamics;service desk;customer service assurance;customer retention;management;service quality;customer advocacy	HPC	-77.1390312724596	12.621600823720554	110320

Cooperation between organizations is more easily established and adapted than reorganization of internal company structures. But how do we manage flexibility in such a network without sacrificing the minimum stability that is required for economic success? We suggest a method for coordinating interaction in a business network that provides three levels of flexibility: local ad-hoc change, global negotiated change and planned change. This method is based on the negotiation and enactment of process-based interorganizational contracts.	bilateral filter;business process;e-commerce;field research;hoc (programming language);iteration;simulation	Peter Rittgen	2007	Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society	10.1007/BF03192542	public relations;knowledge management;weed control;management;negotiation	Web+IR	-76.51233649032864	5.116589111335561	110384

ba9389d4cdb5d59fb59ab1a160f8b3aad531125d	business model design using business process modelling: case of slovenian transport logistics cluster creation		In the pursuit of enhanced competitiveness organisations are today searching for innovative business models in order to foster economic benefits. In Slovenia, several clusters are being formed, including the Slovenian Transport Logistics Cluster (STLC) as one of the most important. The STLC is currently in the stage of dynamic growth, demanding business model formation and adequate informatisation. The main goal of the paper is to present the STLC business model creation, bridging the gap between Supply Chain Management (SCM) and e-Logistics. The business model creation is presented in several phases. The first phase involves business modelling of the existing business processes of organisations (AS-IS model). The results of the first phase allow an in-depth view of the STLC that is used in the future in the business model setup. Next, TO-BE processes are created which are to be implemented and supported via informatisation. Business model should enable homogenous and transparent business activity between cluster members. The purposes of the business model creation is to standardize business processes, allow cost cutting and improve business performance, reduce operating times, support asset management, and trace shipments which are the basics of economic competitiveness.	bridging (networking);business process;code refactoring;enlightenment;holism;information science;logistics;programming paradigm;simply typed lambda calculus;simulation;strategic information system	Ales Groznik	2009		10.7148/2009-0011-0017	systems engineering;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;process modeling;business process model and notation;process management;business;business process modeling;business architecture	Web+IR	-71.69838807125875	10.283652642210255	110623

In this paper, we propose a model that decomposes requirements in a uniform fashion regardless of their functional or non-functional nature. This makes it possible to project any particular set of requirements on a range of other requirements, hence supporting a multi-dimensional separation. The projections are achieved through composition rules employing informal, often concernspecific, actions and operators. The approach supports establishment of early trade-offs among crosscutting and overlapping requirements. This, in turn, facilitates negotiation and decision-making among stakeholders.	decision support system;expectation propagation;functional requirement;fuzzy logic;international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;iterative and incremental development;non-functional requirement;requirements engineering;separation of concerns	Ana Moreira;João Araújo;Awais Rashid	2005		10.1007/11431855_21	software requirements specification;requirements management;requirement prioritization;systems modeling;decision support system;business requirements;computer science;requirement;software engineering;system requirements specification;requirements engineering;non-functional testing;management;operations research;functional requirement;non-functional requirement;negotiation;information system;vision document	SE	-62.87255533928074	12.633812387754821	110847

The goal of SCM is to meet the needs of the final consumer by supplying the right product at the right place, time and price. Companies use SCM as a way to meet the competitive challenges of today's business environment. The focus of SCM has shifted from engineering efficient functional processes to the co‐ordination of activities in a supply chain network. The aim of this paper is to examine the stages in the evolution of the supply chain to an electronic supply chain. To illustrate and support the types of evolutionary progress involved, best practices and case studies are provided and analysed.	best practice	Dimitris Folinas;Vicky Manthou;Marianna Sigala;Maro Vlachopoulou	2004	Internet Research	10.1108/10662240410555298	e-commerce;supply chain risk management;demand chain;supply chain management;value chain;service management;marketing;operations management;supply chain;best practice	ECom	-75.58619277423855	5.685599423986929	111199

The research approach taken is explorative: using real-world requirements from projects motivating the IDP development, we investigate causes of change and a possible classification of these causes. We analyse information demand of selected roles, develop an IDP and analyse causes for changes in information demands. The contributions of this paper are (1) to motivate the need for research on dynamics in IDP, (2) the analysis of dynamics in a selected IDP, and (3) a classification of causes for the changes.	requirement	Kurt Sandkuhl;Holger Lehmann	2018			demand patterns;microeconomics;business	AI	-75.64435169551687	11.686549438991975	111455
986c8d7afc2ccfe7eae986469418026149c8b97b	towards real-time data acquisition for simulation of logistics service systems		Driven by rising competition pressure companies began to outsource at least parts of their logistics functions to specialized logistics providers in order to concentrate on the core competences. Hence, new business models emerged like the fourth party logistics provider who acts like a coordinator of arising logistics networks. One of the main tasks of the provider is the planning of such logistics networks, which have a very collaborative and dynamic character. In this paper an efficient way to integrate process modeling and simulation as part of the planning phase is introduced. Furthermore, an integrated approach is introduced for supporting the planning by a better data acquisition in order to provide reliable results at an affordable effort using simulation techniques. Therefore, complex event processing is used to gather real-time data and provides the data as service profiles for simulation.	data acquisition;logistics;real-time data;simulation	Stefan Mutke;Martin Roth;André Ludwig;Bogdan Franczyk	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-41019-2_18	knowledge management;integrated logistics support	Embedded	-65.92534422796194	10.973940021183902	111510

In order to increase the efficiency and agility of global producing companies, this paper presents a method that shifts the often-present focus on locations towards a market and production process oriented design approach of production networks. By subdividing the product range into product families, the complexity of decision-making processes is reduced. Subsequently, target conflicts between product families are resolved systematically from an overall corporate view by deriving the smallest possible holistic decision scope. The method was applied to a machine tool manufacturer.

Increasingly, corporates find themselves, operating in business environments filled with unpredictable, complex and continuous change. Driven by these dynamic competitive conditions, they look for a dynamic management of their business processes to maintain their processes performance. To be competitive, companies have to respond quickly and nimbly to changing environment. One domain that has dominated the thinking of most managers from few years is organizational agility. It is considered as inescapable feature of today's forward-looking corporates. About 90% of executives surveyed by the Economist Intelligence Unit believe that organizational agility is critical for business success. Many researchers tried to define and characterize organizational agility according to their context and domain application. The first aim of this paper is to tighten and explicate a conceptualization of organizational agility that clarifies what it is and how it can be reached by proposing a framework that leads to improve organizational agility. The second aim of the current research is to suggest ideas on how to make business processes agile and what are the practices of organizational agility that can be transferred to BPM.	agile software development;beam propagation method;business process;conceptualization (information science);holism;holistic management (agriculture);race condition	Wafa Triaa;Lilia Gzara;Hervé Verjus	2016	2016 IEEE 18th Conference on Business Informatics (CBI)	10.1109/CBI.2016.16	organizational commitment;organizational performance;systems engineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;operations management;process management;business;business rule;business process modeling	DB	-74.61709256188502	9.491947133144217	112147

Product innovation and development capabilities, competition, increasing raw material costs, and the rising awareness of consumers pose even further challenges. This study used a project portfolio as the decision subject to identify customer clusters, with the research purposes: (1) to identify the optimal customer clusters by minimizing inter-cluster relationships and (2) to maximize the intra-cluster relationships. The findings help address the problem of a dispersed optimal intra-group structure caused by clustering in the inter-group relationships. Computerized management of that is conducive in accounting and information analysis. Thus, dynamic multi-objective service decisions can provide the related industries with development strategies when facing uncertainties.

In this context, the researcher as an individual as well as acting in a team, needs a support for better management of information and knowledge during the work process. An analysis shows problems concerning the exploitation of individual practices, which are based on the management and the structuring of shared information by a collective. This analysis led to the elaboration of a general knowledge management model for an industrial research centre. For the development of this model we used the CIMOSA framework model. With the creation of the general knowledge management model for industrial research centres we have a framework for the analysis of needs and existing tools. The analysis framework supported the proposition of a new prototype called ANITA (ANnotation tool for Industrial TeAms) for better management and sharing of written information content for research teams.	ontology (information science)	Christian Frank;Mickael Gardoni	2005	Int J.

Design/methodology/approach – A small-scale survey among Finnish enterprise resource planning system (ERP) software vendors and consultants on ERP implementation challenges is analysed (n 1⁄4 59). The results are connected to existing literature in the field of deploying ERP systems in the form of discussion. Findings – The consultants’ opinions show similar results with studies conducted with companies using ERP systems. The implementer’s point of view shows clearly the challenge of using standardized ERP packages for various requirements on different levels. Although the sales presentations tend to emphasize the general purpose and flexibility of software packages, the dilemma between customization and vanilla system remains. The implementer’s viewpoint emphasises challenges in operations: production planning, materials management, sales and marketing. Research limitations/implications – The complexities of large ERP systems represent a true challenge from the knowledge transfer point of view. Standardized ERP packages implement standardized approaches, which has been a key benefit. The results show that the challenges are related to production planning and materials management. Practical implications – Software vendors and consultants have a thorough knowledge of ERP implementation, but still the key challenges remain much the same. ERP project deployment requires careful planning with regard to the change management aspects, but also IT related technical aspects. The paper presents a checklist for matching the ERP system with the specific requirements of the company. Originality/value – The results of the survey triangulate and justify many aspects found in previous research. From the consultants’ point of view developments in production planning and complex products are especially needed. Initial solutions and further research are outlined.	erp;enterprise resource planning;point of view (computer hardware company);requirement;software deployment	Petri T.

Although the FSA has become an internationally recognized and recommended method, the definition, which is adopted there, to describe the risk, seems to be too narrow to reflect the actual content of the FSA. Therefore this article discusses methodological requirements for the risk perspective, which is appropriate for risk management in the maritime domain with special attention to maritime transportation systems. A perspective that is proposed here considers risk as a set encompassing the following: a set of plausible scenarios leading to an accident, the likelihoods of unwanted events within the scenarios, the consequences of the events and description of uncertainty. All these elements are conditional upon the available knowledge (K) about the analyzed system and understanding (N) of the system behavior. Therefore, the quality of K and the level of N of a risk model should be reflected in the uncertainty description. For this purpose we introduce a qualitative scoring system, and we show its applicability on an exemplary risk model for a RoPax ship. & 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The high-risk construction sector records the highest number of accidents among different industry sectors. In most cases, safety planning is purely based on checklists and manual description, which are not closely related to the actual and specific construction object. Modern technologies, such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), are offering an object-oriented planning approach toward a project's lifecycle. This paper presents a research-in-progress project, where the BIM technology has been used to identify object-oriented and process-oriented job safety hazards.

Riskiness being the main obstacle in supply chains, companies needs to pay attention to risk management. It is the nature of the business activity that determines the degree of required risk management. For example, risk management is one of the pillars of activities related to hazardous materials or nuclear energy. In keeping with that context, this paper presents a literature review on hazard material transportation and then a study case. Risks were analyzed using the Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) with data coming from a Tunisian company. The results show that the potential effects of the majority of these risks are catastrophic.	failure cause;failure mode and effects analysis;failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis;risk assessment;risk management;self-organized criticality;supply chain attack;unintended consequences	Mohamed Haykal Ammar;Mounir Benaissa;Habib Chabchoub	2014	2014 International Conference on Advanced Logistics and Transport (ICALT)	10.1109/ICAdLT.2014.6864072	obstacle;risk analysis (engineering);risk management;knowledge management;supply chain;failure mode and effects analysis;failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis;hazardous waste;computer science;risk assessment	Robotics	-64.7248836773569	8.382987167758511	113075

The Minister of health has been promising for over a decade that every citizen in the Netherlands can have an EHR. Until now this promise has not been met. One of the main requirements for this national EHR is an agreed definition of an open EHR by both vendors and users. This paper first studies the demand side using the results of thirty eight interviews with end users asking them their core processes and their expected value of an EHR. Next we have a look at the supply side with an overview of the Dutch market and a focus on open EHR's as possible overall solution. This solution is further elaborated by using the experience with enterprise application integration (EAT) in industry. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First from a combined analysis of our data our main conclusion is the supply of EHR in the Netherlands is not open yet. Only suppliers with a small market share really offer external process integration. Only if the main suppliers are stimulated (by the government) to open up, a national EHR can arise. Secondly from a detailed analysis the following results stand out: majority of the end users (demand side) do not get support in their relevant working processes. Communication is badly supported and direct patient contact (what they think most important in their work) is even endangered by new systems. Availability, a benefit where all stakeholders agree upon, does not seem to be enough to open the market and create a good diffusion of EHR in the Netherlands.

These characteristics are vital in order to face the global market environment, which raises the need for collaboration and interoperability in a more demanding and competitive industrial scenario. Interoperability and standardization are proven approaches to leverage collaboration and help establishing business networks, increasing competitiveness of organizations. However, some of these organizations have been experiencing some problems when trying to adopt one of the most important standards for the exchange of product data, the STEP (ISO10303). These problems are due to the poor software support and usage of complex technologies. This paper proposes as a solution, a framework for the harmonization of STEP conceptual models and knowledge with other standard technologies commonly adopted by today's organizations. The results presented in this paper has been supported and validated in the scope of the some European/International industrial research projects like the IMS SMART-fm (www.smart-fm.funstep.org), Athena-IP (www.athena-ip.org), and InterOp (www.interop-noe.org).

The use of ICT and changes in value creation reflect business needs, but commercial success requires modifications and extensions of the BMs. However, prevailing approaches do not take account of these requirements. In this paper, we present a BM design process that fosters the extension of BMs for ICT-enabled HCSSs to support service innovations. Using an action research project in the field of volunteering, we iterated and revised the BM design process in a project collaboration with three end-user companies having similar objectives. The process guides those responsible for service innovation in structuring, analyzing, and the decision-making of alternative BM extensions. Thus, the presented approach contributes to ICT-related service innovation projects by describing systematic and repeatable activities that are the first step for commercial success.	atm adaptation layer;assistive technology;business requirements;documentation;iteration;list of collaborative software;relevance;requirement;service innovation;switzerland;synergy	Stefan Kleinschmidt;Christoph Peters	2017			information and communications technology;computer science;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;action research;service design;information management;management;new business development;service innovation;business studies	SE	-71.47692666614358	9.902911700223955	114063

The supply chain management (SCM) assumes increasing significance for the world community, at the same time there is competition not between companies but global supply networks, which are increasingly replacing supply chains. As a result, competition between companies in global markets increasingly means competition between networks; however with globalization, corporate planning has turned out to be under the strong influence of distribution networks, in the focus of attention of which is not a product but customers’ value. This article considers the logistics systems from the point of view of conveying value by means of supply networks decentralized control systems and centralized adoption of global networks.

This is costly, both in terms of development and support resources. By achieving higher reuse of software components these costs can come down. This paper develops a methodology for identifying re-usable components; and using this methodology several re-usable components are listed. As a by-product of this research we develop a taxonomy of mobile applications. We suggest the new term field office applications to describe applications used by mobile workers.	code reuse;enterprise software	Patrick D. Brans;Rahul C.

Many new developments are carried out with external partners, including universities and research institutions aiming to generate novel solutions in order to improve business performance and sustainability. However, the balance between intellectual property protection and intellectual property sharing is hard to manage. In order to increase the sustainability of innovation networks it is important to provide mechanisms to easily define the profile of the collaboration and to assess the degree of alignment with the potential partners. This paper aims to discuss how these mechanisms can be provided through the implementation of a Core Value Management System in the scope of coinnovation.	complexity;concurrent versions system;management system;programming paradigm;relevance;systems management;value (ethics)	Patrícia Macedo;Luis M.

Paradigms underlying existing business process management (BPM) methods and solutions have been questioned for their ability to capture the complexity of business dynamics. The basic trust of this research is to search for an alternative approach to better understand underpinnings of business process management. In this paper we contend that Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) theory can be an alternative approach to better examine underpinnings of the very notion of business process. In this regard, we articulate the basic principles of CAS in the business process management context. It is this articulation that paves the way to estab- lish an appropriate account for BPM.

2abd64019aadb273f772ee573a6848a27b7cfcad	i2i trust in e-commerce	i2i trust	The Internet has brought about the New Economy and with it a host of research on e-commerce. Most people familiar with ecommerce think of it as, first, the ability of consumers to buy products and services online (an arrangement known as B2C). Alternatively, it’s also the ability of businesses to interact with one another electronically (B2B) in the interests of, say, supporting the supply chain, the next step beyond electronic data interchange. Another important change the Internet has meant for commerce is that individuals have the ability to communicate with one another, independent of location (or i2i, for individual-toindividual). i2i plays a big role in e-commerce in two main scenarios: global teams inside organizations and advisor/advisee interactions from one organization to another or from an agent to a customer. Global teams. For global teams, managers can choose members from around the world, extending their reach to find the most appropriate experts for the job at hand. Many companies have gone global, assigning people from different continents, time zones, areas of expertise, even from outside the organization, to work toward a common goal. Ford Motor Co. is an example of a global organization assigning global teams to design various automobile components and produce cars for all regions, rather than different cars for different regions, as it had previously; Ford calls it “virtual collocation.” Meanwhile, although a number of companies have been doing software development around the world and around the clock, such global work has become much easier in recent years thanks to the Internet. Where these companies used to work through ftp and version-control software to share the code itself, today’s Netbased communication makes it easier to discuss the work, clarify misunderstandings, coordinate changes, and monitor and maintain the schedule through email, attachments, and textchat capabilities, as well as through audio and videoconferencing. Advisor/advisee relations. The Internet was originally expected to be a great medium for “disintermediation,” or the elimination of people as intermediaries to sources and services. We would be able to explore enormous digital libraries without a reference librarian; access medical information before meeting a physician; view ongoing changes in the stock market, allowing us to make decisions without a broker; or secure travel arrangements without a travel agent. Although such access is widespread today, and many of us are able to work independently, people are beginning to reappear in our online interchanges. We now recognize the value these intermediaries might offer us, including counsel, guidance to the right sources of information, assessment of the quality of the sources, and customized advice, because they understand our overall goals and needs. Today, we are seeing “reintermediation,” or the reintroduction of people to online interaction to link sources and services. Services include live chat with human advisors—on-screen videoconferencing to hone the advice for the individual being served. Reintermediation via i2i affects both B2C and B2B. Trust is the principle challenge in both areas—connecting teammates across long distances and the interaction of advice seekers and advisors on the Internet. In order for teammates to work productively and efficiently, they have to trust one an-	advice (programming);attachments;collocation;content-control software;digital library;disintermediation;e-commerce payment system;electronic data interchange;email;interaction;internet;librarian;library (computing);new economy;software development	Judith S.

The source material of the review consists of 97 high quality journal articles published in 18 journals between 2001 and September 2008. Besides an analysis of related work, this review provides an overview of applied research methods and theories in the field of IT Outsourcing. The articles are then analyzed from a risk management point of view to highlight key risk factors and their specific impact on IT Outsourcing. Identified risk factors are further analyzed in order to assign each risk factor to the phases of a typical IT Outsourcing process (life-cycle). The results of the review show that empirical research is the most applied method and that action research and reference modelling have not been used at all so far. Furthermore, elements of a research agenda are discussed in order to determine further steps to the construction of a reference model for risk management in IT Outsourcing. This paper mainly aims at an audience of experienced researchers in the field of IT Outsourcing who are looking for research ideas and at junior scientists (e.g. PhD students) entering this emerging field of research.

93a0f41589349114e7c343018fba99cb655972cd	improving work allocation practices in business processes supported by bpms		BPMS (Business Process Management Systems) are responsible for the execution of business process models, by delivering work activities to suitable agents (human or automatisms) that execute them. During the design-time, modelers have to specify the potential performers of a work activity according to their organizational position or role. Once several workers may share the same role, during run-time all of them can be assigned by BPMS to execute a work activity. However, distinct persons have different personality traits and, in a specific piece of work (for instance, requiring special teamwork skills), some of them can perform better than others. Addressing a gap in theory and practice of BPMS, in this paper we present a new approach that enables BPMS to assign (in run-time) the most suitable workers to perform specific work activities, grounded on the concept of psychological profile and taking into account technical, human and social aspects.

However, existing service platforms, neither fully inscribes premises of the service dominant logic, nor the principles of open innovation. Seldom are they digital. We argue that there is a lack of consolidated normative theory of how to design digital service innovation platforms. This is problematic, because it hampers actors in service ecosystems to combine and advance their capabilities. To this end, researchers and practitioners have jointly designed and evaluated a digital service platform using Action Design Research methodology. Accordingly, the overall purpose of this paper is to present intermediate results from the evaluation of the digital service platform and to contribute nascent design principles enabling researchers and practitioners to leverage other instances of purposive digital service platforms.

7affb048183e6332ef485d8f4f6a4575763e7779	a survey of internet of things and big data integrated solutions for industrie 4.0		The industrial internet of things (IIoT) is growing at an exponential rate generating massive amounts of industrial data. This data must be leveraged to support business and operational goals. As a result, there is an urgent need for adopting big data technologies to enable data analytics in industrial automation. This paper explores interrelations between IIoT and big data technologies and how they work together to generate business insights from industrial data. Additionally, requirements for cloud-based solutions are derived from the Industrie 4.0 use case scenario value-based-services, focusing on condition monitoring and predictive maintenance services. A survey of selected cloud-based platforms is conducted to examine how these platforms meet the requirements derived from the use case. Results show that existing general cloud platforms should adopt more IIoT applications and platforms, while existing industrial cloud platforms should add big data frameworks to their portfolio. Finally, an architecture for integrating cloud-based IIoT and big data solutions is introduced and issues regarding the use of public cloud for IIoT applications are discussed.	automation;big data;cloud computing;documentation;high-level programming language;industry 4.0;internet of things;requirement;scalability;simulation;test case;time complexity;vii	MS XuemeiWang;Paula Martin de Moraes;Alessandra Conceição Faria-Campos;Sascha Heymann;Robert J Davidson;Florian Pethig;Sebastian Schriegel	2018	2018 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)	10.1109/ETFA.2018.8502484		SE	-63.208087555009776	16.43396089164937	117529

The key to increased intermodalism lies at the intermodal terminal. This paper puts forward four literature-based propositions that should be part of the future research agenda for intermodal terminals. In order to realise the intermodal terminal of the future, there is a need to: (P1) develop an effective operative terminal system, (P2) develop a holistic performance measurement system for the terminal, (P3) develop cooperation models for the network actors, and (P4) develop new value increasing services at the terminal.	develop;holism;logistics;system of measurement	Torbjørn H.

Organizations utilizing advanced analytics techniques to gain real value from Big Data will grow faster than their competitors and seize new opportunities. Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is an industry-proven way to build predictive analytics models across the enterprise. However, the manual process in CRISP-DM hinders faster decision making on real-time application for efficient data analysis. In this paper, we present an approach to automate the process using Automatic Service Composition (ASC). Focusing on the planning stage of ASC, we propose an ontology-based workflow generation method to automate the CRISP-DM process. Ontology and rules are designed to infer workflow for data analytics process according to the properties of the datasets as well as user needs. Empirical study of our prototyping system has proved the efficiency of our workflow generation method.	big data;cross industry standard process for data mining;dm-crypt;real-time clock;real-time computing;ti advanced scientific computer;the industry standard;web analytics	Banage T.

Articulating and representing procedural aspects of work in conceptual models is a prerequisite for informed information system (IS) design. Instruments supporting articulation need to establish common ground about the interaction of the collaborating actors. This article proposes a methodology for the articulation of work processes by inexperienced modelers. It consists of phases of articulation and consolidation of case-based models and interactive elaboration toward comprehensive representation of the process via virtual enactment. The resulting models can be directly interpreted by IS. A case study confirms that the methodology meets the identified requirements and identifies areas of improvement.	biconnected component;information system;systems design	Stefan Oppl	2016	Information & Management	10.1016/j.im.2016.01.004	simulation;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence	HCI	-64.40565295147144	14.513075021016512	118262

Particularly, DAPA adopts ITA to support its mission, strategic goals, and the rational management of IT resources. We also present the architectural framework of DAPA IT with ITA procedures and As-Is/To-Be models. Moreover, we deal with the transition issue from the As-Is model to the To-Be model, ITA management system, and lessons learned. As a result, we believe that ITA is useful for building and maintaining information systems with avoiding overlaps and mistakes in IT investment.	enterprise architecture framework;information system;information technology architecture	Kilsup Lee;Jinmo Kim	2009	2009 10th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligences, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing	10.1109/SNPD.2009.111	computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;software engineering;information management;management;information technology;information system	SE	-72.39112283072834	15.776437093230607	118382

Therefore business process and regulations compliance analysis audit and management tasks take a very important role in daily operational activities for each organization. Due to high complexity this task can become challenging. In some domains regulations are changing rapidly. Process models must be flexible and easy adjustable to changing requirements, since the lack of ability to comply with regulations can lower down the competitiveness of an organizations. Thus, rapid changes of regulations require rapid changes of related business processes. The goal of the PhD work is to develop business process and regulations compliance management technology which should enable business process construction from regulations and change monitoring of regulations and business processes to ensure easy and rapid modification of business process model or regulations, thus also ensuring compliance.	business process;process modeling;requirement	Ilze Buksa	2011	2014 IEEE 22nd International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)	10.1109/RE.2014.6912304	public relations;regulation;business analysis;economics;business requirements;business process reengineering;business process management;business administration;process management;business process;management;new business development	DB	-73.73313877917947	11.320264017885282	118820

GIS and GPS technologies, through providing optimized schedules, routings, and guidance, are especially important and helpful in transportation and logistics businesses. Though GIS and GPS technologies have been witnessed in many business sectors in developed countries, wide application of these technologies is still in its preliminary phase in companies in developing nations. In this paper, the authors present a study on the application of an integrated intelligent system that consists of GIS, GPS and related technologies to optimize logistic distribution of perishable products in urban environments. Through investigating GIS and GPS usage in a medium-sized logistics company in the unique settings of emerging economies, this paper addresses how these technologies enhance the management of businesses and analyze the interaction of GIS/GPS implementation and several key characteristics of the logistic distribution context by identifying major benefits, challenges, and limitations associated with the use of GIS and GPS.	artificial intelligence;geographic information system;global positioning system;logistics	Bin Zhou;Jeffrey Hsu;Yawei Wang	2010	IJISSC	10.4018/jissc.2010070104	enterprise gis;economics;developing country;marketing;operations management;geographic information system;traditional knowledge gis;computer security;economic growth;commerce	HCI	-71.74167492379121	4.379007781415495	119156
932c0d473c84ffed76ce0fd705854c9a27ad4107	gaining business value from it investments	it investment;business value	The evaluation of information technology (IT) investments has been of concern to researchers and industrial management for many years. Much of the discussion has been concerned with techniques: the difficulty in measuring the less tangible benefits, the problems surrounding the application of the most commonly used method, cost-benefit analysis and the search for a better approach. This chapter reviews the progress made in these areas. The need for a flexible evaluation method that includes not only the financial but also the more strategic benefits, and that can be applied to the diversity of IT investment decisions is highlighted. The impact of the context in which IT evaluation takes place-the business context, organizational culture, and management style-on an organization’s criteria for effectiveness and its attitude towards evaluation is examined. It is also recognized that benefits will not accrue automatically; the IT system provides the opportunity for changing business methods and processes, but it is these changes that will lead to the benefits, not the system itself. Thus the business changes and the delivery of the benefits need to be proactively managed; a model for managing this process is proposed. If investments in IT are to result in enhanced business value, the focus of IT evaluation must change-from a “once-off ” exercise, undertaken as a means of gaining approval for the investment, to seeing IT evaluation as part of a process which identifies the benefits, assigns responsibility for delivering them, plans for the organizational change which will be required, and regularly monitors the achievement. In this chapter, we consider the entire process of managing the IT investment: the initial justification, including specifying and measuring the benefits, making the investment decision and, continuing after implementation, managing the realization of the expected benefits.	business process;organizational behavior	Pamela Simmons	1998	Advances in Computers	10.1016/S0065-2458(08)60204-1	computer science;knowledge management;business value;management science	Web+IR	-77.03585801545768	9.922062874315998	119196

Both aspects are the fundamental components of a university-wide project named “PuL” at RWTH Aachen University. Primarily, the project aims at describing optimized processes in examination and teaching management. In this context, elaborated methods of Business Process Modeling (BPM) are used to create comprehensible and realizable process descriptions. These organizational target processes form the basis for the second objective of the project: the introduction of an integrated supporting IT system (Campus Management System). The final process descriptions supply IT system requirements which are edited in a comprehensive catalogue of requirements. The project stages following this aim to find an appropriate software provider in a tendering procedure and to introduce subsequently the IT system into the organization. This paper will expose the main findings of the project “PuL” at RWTH Aachen University and will illustrate the key aspects for a successful project realization. Focal points are the business process modeling and the requirements analysis which are indispensable for the success of introducing new organizational processes and a new Campus Management System.	business process;focal (programming language);management system;process modeling;procurement;requirement;requirements analysis;software publisher;system requirements	Marcel Lämmerhirt;Marguerite Franssen;Christoph Becker	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-38411-0_13	engineering management;engineering;software engineering;engineering physics	SE	-69.98594854561682	13.571211051998223	119314

A safety case is a written justification that the given system will be tolerably safe during installation, commissioning and operation, and in some cases decommissioning. A well-written safety case will give all stakeholders (operating authority, members of staff and regulators) justifiable confidence that the system is safe to operate and to continue in operation. Although production of a safety case is now regarded as best practice in many quarters, there is still relatively little experience of writing safety cases and only a limited amount of literature on the topic. Many safety engineers find it a daunting task and some safety cases are still poorly structured, difficult to understand and less than compelling.	operations room	Ron Pierce;Herman Baret	2005		10.1007/1-84628-130-X_4	automotive engineering;transport engineering	ML	-63.763055009988285	6.8323758936806485	119404

Some approaches have nevertheless been more successful in this respect than others. Quantitative decision making has moved from the study of decision theory founded on a single criterion towards decision support for more realistic decision-making situations with multiple, often conflicting, criteria. Furthermore, the identified gap between normative and descriptive theories seems to suggest a shift to more prescriptive approaches. However, when decision analysis applications are used to aid prescriptive decision-making processes, additional demands are put on these applications to adapt to the users and the context. In particular, the issue of weight elicitation is crucial. There are several techniques for deriving criteria weights from preference statements. This is a cognitively demanding task, subject to different biases, and the elicited values can be heavily dependent on the method of assessment. There have been a number of methods suggested for assessing criteria weights, but these methods have properties which impact their applicability in practice. This paper provides a survey of state-of-the-art weight elicitation methods in a prescriptive setting.	decision analysis;decision support system;decision theory;requirements elicitation	Mona Riabacke;Mats Danielson;Love Ekenberg	2012	ADS	10.1155/2012/276584	computer science;data mining;management science;information system	Web+IR	-77.22781425707733	11.09434395180414	119580

Basole, Jürgen Karla On the Evolution of Mobile Platform Ecosystem Structure and Strategy Platforms have become a core fundament of many technology industries. Platforms not only enable new products and services but have also been shown to influence strategies, shape business models, and even transform entire industries. Platforms play a particularly important role in the mobile ecosystem. The success of smartphones has led to an intense battle of mobile platforms, each looking for ways to become the system of choice for mobile device manufacturers, mobile network operators, and mobile application developers. Drawing on theories of platform markets, strategic networks, and business ecosystems, this paper uses a visualization approach to study the evolving global interfirm structure and examines strategies used in the mobile platform ecosystem over the past five years. We identify important differences between mobile platform strategies and discuss their implications for both mobile ecosystem participants and the future of the app economy.	app store;business & information systems engineering;business ecosystem;evolution;goodyear mpp;information system;level of detail;mad;master data management;microsoft outlook for mac;microsoft windows;mobile app;mobile device;mobile payment;openness;smartphone;strategic management;structural analysis;windows phone	Rahul C.

The product system is in fact influenced to a high degree by the environment. To consider this impact, this paper discusses the structuring of the environment into processes and locations and their influences to the product system. This allows the systematic use of field data to limit the quantity of elements and their interaction in the processes and locations in order to improve the process of problem-solving. The benefit is to learn from mistakes in the context of the GSE. This supports cause-analysis, effect-analysis and therefore the enhancement of product systems.	complex systems;fits;generic stream encapsulation;interaction;new product development;problem solving	Michel Mamrot;Petra Winzer	2013	2013 8th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering	10.1109/SYSoSE.2013.6575233	reliability engineering;systems engineering;engineering;product design specification;product and manufacturing information;product design;new product development;product engineering;systems design	SE	-65.43102434656161	17.434190650273337	120335

b76f4b38b410b4b6039660faa203b64b79de2848	an enterprise architecture-based approach to the it-business alignment: an integration of sam and togaf framework		Information technologies have evolved from its traditional back office role to a strategic resource role able not only to support but also to shape business strategies. For over a decade IT-business alignment has been ranked as a toppriority management concern and is widely covered in literature. However, conceptual studies dominate the field, while there is little research on practical ways to achieve the alignment. Enterprise Architecture development is a meth‐ odological approach to design of mutually aligned business and IT architectures. Most of the existing EA approaches do not distinguish between diverse IT-busi‐ ness alignment perspectives. Thus, the paper aims to attempt at providing a prac‐ tical guidance for IT-business alignment as well as a strategic guidance for EA development by integrating traditional Strategic Alignment Model and The TOGAF framework.	earthbound;enterprise architecture;enterprise architecture framework;strategic management;the open group architecture framework	Pavel Malyzhenkov;Marina Ivanova	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-68185-6_12	management science;the open group architecture framework;engineering;back office;information technology;enterprise architecture;strategic alignment	AI	-75.02692077552824	7.921846720314954	120667
7f05e6ac396b78b81b0545739ba32953a669ecb8	development of a co-simulation system as a decision-aid in lean tools implementation		Aside from the human and managerial skills necessary to propel any business, the right Lean deployment can play a big role in reducing waste and maximizing efficiency. Capturing these benefits is highly dependent on adequate Lean techniques integration. Companies shifting towards Lean conversion have tried one of many Lean Manufacturing optimization tools at their disposal today (JIT, Pull System, U cells, CrossTraining, Visual Management, SMED, Poka Yoke, etc.) hoping to capture the benefits of such conversion. One of the major hurdles these companies face is the difficulty to choose the Lean tools that best fit their economic contexts and that are best tailored towards reaching their productivity or quality milestones. The Discrete Event Simulation becomes an interesting approach, to imitate the evolution of a manufacturing system and to represent the transformation induced by the Lean tools integration in the manufacturing line. The system developed in this paper is a Co-Simulation system. It is built based on a two-level structure. The first level is a basic framework for modeling the manufacturing assembly line with its various components (using JaamSim), while the second is a hierarchical framework for executing parallel Lean Tools simulations (using MECSYCO). To demonstrate the usefulness of this Co-Simulation system, an example of an Aeronautic Assembly Line is used. Three Lean Configuration Scenarios are investigated under market fluctuation context (Batch Policy, Setup times reduction with SMED, Pull System), compared with an Actual model simulated as a Lean Free scenario.	co-simulation;simulation	Jalal Joseph Possik;Aicha Anne Amrani;Gregory Zacharewicz	2018			discrete event simulation;software deployment;performance indicator;process management;poka-yoke;milestone (project management);co-simulation;skills management;engineering;lean manufacturing	EDA	-75.92886954176906	8.41476627871231	120699

Siegel Providers of highly reliable information technology (IT) services have historically adopted multiple service delivery quality standards and have obtained certificates of registration or certification associated with these standards. In this paper, we present a case study involving a provider of IT infrastructure services and solutions. We describe the business context of the service provider, its approach to the analysis of the requirements of multiple standards, process integration efforts (both local and global), and the reuse of documentation and other evidentiary data in the context of obtaining certificates of registration or certifications. We compare the evidentiary data (e.g., documentation, observations, and interviews) used in the diagnostics of the International Standards Organization 9001:2000 standard and the eSourcing Capability Model for Service Providers standard to evaluate the unique value that each standard contributes to IT service delivery. The case study also provides initial examples of measures resulting from the adoption of these two quality standards that may be used to improve service delivery.	documentation;itil;requirement	Jabe Hickey;Jane Siegel	2008	IBM Systems Journal	10.1147/sj.471.0167	service provider;service level requirement;service level objective;business service provider;computer science;service delivery framework;service design;computer security	SE	-70.62917436413213	13.612374802786466	120878
9185160a7cfc81fd9d90cb7eef7f10c7459c8356	design of consistent enterprise models	enterprise modeling	Manufacturing industries are the most important contributors to prosperity in industrialized countries. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to meet the customers’ demands and to compete in the market. Enterprises must be able to react quickly to prevailing market conditions and to maximize the utilization of resources. Conventional approaches with hard automation are no longer able to meet these challenges, because they are very poor in information processing. The concept of virtual enterprises will help to master the challenges in future factories. The first part of the paper deals with global trends in manufacturing and describes in more detail the paradigm of virtual enterprises. The second part explains our system to support the modeling and simulation of virtual enterprises.	information processing;programming paradigm;simulation	Jörg Raczkowsky;Walter Reithofer	1998	Cybernetics and Systems	10.1080/019697298125614	enterprise modelling;computer science;management science	OS	-65.22583535070935	10.09928984072098	120958

The paper also discusses several rules-of-thumb that a manager considering a distributed Approach will want to consider. Several hardware confiyurations are enumerated and evaluated as part of a gener,rl framework that helps in understanding the evolutionary nature of distributed configurations. In distributed systems, different users often want to maintain different views of the same data. This problem and possible sclutions are discussed. The topic of languages for use with dpecialized data-base machines is a central issue. because the responsibilities of a data-base machine vis-a-vis the hostmachine depend to a large extent on the choice of language (or pro:ocol) that is used for communication between them.

New information technologies not only enable businesses to charge flexible prices on the Web, but also allow for new price setting mechanisms in which consumers specify their interests and requirements. Economic appropriateness, technical feasibility, and purposes of such pricing strategies depend mainly on product characteristics, customer groups, sales volume, and eventually the division of labour and power among suppliers, intermediaries, and consumers. This paper compares online and offline pricing strategies. It puts a particular focus on airline ticket sales based in a setting of structural changes in the airline industry and changing customer behaviour. It takes a critical look at predictions about the proliferation and success of flexible pricing schemes that were made at the end of the 1990s. Interpretative analysis and empirical evidence of Web-based pricing mechanisms, which aim at giving customers access to lower prices, lead to envision a scheme for developing pricing strategies that reflect the competitive environment of the online market space.	norm (social);online and offline;requirement;world wide web	Stefan Klein;Claudia Löbbecke	2003	Electronic Markets	10.1080/1019678032000052943	pricing;economics;strategy;marketing;intermediary;management;tourism;price discrimination;consumer behaviour;commerce	ECom	-75.39301688870067	4.735331050603053	121396

Supported by the government's Action Agenda, the Furnishing Industry Association of Australia developed the ''Production Efficiency Program'' to improve efficiency of the industry. The core of the program was three showcase projects demonstrating how return on investment can be achieved with the application of advanced manufacturing technologies. Instead of committing large capital expenditure in IT based manufacturing systems, the showcases started by applying lean manufacturing principles and transformed the business practices to adopting latest IT systems for the planning and control of manufacturing. This paper outlines the innovative aspects of the program, issues tackled and techniques applied to the showcases. The paper also reports a case study of a small furniture company that achieved 30% increase in productivity by implementing a new scheduling system that assisted implementation of lean manufacturing.

The structure-based System Dynamics analysis approach uses structural Multiple-Domain Matrix models as a basis to derive System Dynamics models which are able depict the behavior of the engineering design processes. The implications from the behavioral models can be used to analyze and optimize the structure of the underlying process. The development of an e-bike sharing system within a student project was used as basis for the case study to answer the question if the structure-based System Dynamics analysis approach can be successfully applied to model the behavior of the observed engineering design process. Based on the definition of this initial research question, the instruments to conduct the case are developed, the data is gathered and consequently analyzed. The simulation results of the engineering design process are presented, compared to the real process and finally discussed. Thereby benefits, challenges and further areas of research are identified.	engineering design process;system dynamics	Daniel Kasperek;Daniel Schenk;Matthias Kreimeyer;Maik Maurer;Udo Lindemann	2016	Systems Engineering	10.1002/sys.21353	control engineering;economics;systems engineering;process engineering;system dynamics;engineering design process	SE	-64.68058866116203	13.994825520819658	121442

The proposed metrics and the tool are supposed to allow decision makers to get an improved view of the service design process. Furthermore, the framework supports managers in decision making for the achievement of production objectives as well as operational strategies, resulting in potential reuse initiatives, likewise. To provide evidence of the impacts of the proposed framework, experimental activities are discussed focusing on a real life case study, referring to an Italian small size service provider. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.	real life	Marco Comerio;Carlo Batini;Marco Castelli;Simone Grega;Marco Rossetti;Gianluigi Viscusi	2015	Journal of Systems and Software	10.1016/j.jss.2015.01.055	service level requirement;service level objective;service product management;application service provider;business service provider;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;service delivery framework;software engineering;service design;service desk;data as a service;management	Metrics	-70.52259843145929	12.173407507491058	121873

The existence of a community plays a central role in the development of Open Source Software (OSS). Communities are commonly defined as a group of people sharing common norms or values. The common interest of an OSS project is obvious: to develop software under an OSS license. When we look at the rather general definition of a community, we see that there is a similarity to the term ‘organization’. This paper draws parallels between OSS projects and the general elements of an organization and shows the different elements comprised in an OSS community: people, organization and assets. Each of those elements is enriched with examples from different research in the corresponding OSS research stream and provides a broad overview of the elements of OSS projects. With the help of this comparison, research on OSS can be made more focused and aligned with organizational research.	open-source software	Remo Eckert	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-92375-8_1	knowledge management;computer science;license;systems engineering;software;social group	SE	-76.21439815136164	4.687402217322171	121942

When new technologies (like Smart Grid or Smart Energy) appear two types of challenges can be defined: technical and business challenges, therefore innovation has to be applied in both of them. Too often innovation is focus on the technical evolution and underestimated on the business field, however it is a key aspect for new technologies and services to reach commercial success. Traditional business models in the energy sector will suffer big changes in the next years, as the Smart Grid concept is developed. By the advent of new services and applications, horizontal and vertical partnerships with competitors and other actors will take place. In this context collaboration between actors, partnerships and agreements will be of key importance. This paper investigates the different actors involved in a Smart Energy ecosystem, its possible activities and suitable business models for the different Smart Grid building blocks or milestones.	context switch;ecosystem;internet of things;logistics;machine to machine;niche blogging	Oscar Álvarez;Amirhossein Ghanbari;Jan Markendahl	2015	2015 18th International Conference on Intelligence in Next Generation Networks	10.1109/ICIN.2015.7073816	engineering;knowledge management;environmental resource management;management science;internet of things	Robotics	-73.80404222917883	6.662144771204347	122007

However, adoption of EIS has often proved to be challenging and expensive. This work is designed as an inductive case study using a retrospective investigation to understand the process that allows a newly established company to obtain substantial benefits from an ERP system. The main contribution of this work is an improved understanding of how a successful implementation for the ERP system that incorporates some activities of benefits management framework but, without explicit adoption of these benefits managements techniques, can help organizations realise substantial benefits from the system. The results of this study also suggest that broad expectations and wide-ranging objectives are determined in the early stage, without detailed specification of the benefits. The findings also emphasise that a low level of customisation can lead to improved realisation of benefits.	directed acyclic graph;erp;enterprise resource planning;enterprise system;personalization	Luay Anaya	2014			knowledge management;operations management;business;enterprise planning system	HCI	-77.07556968183997	9.7617565853506	122102

5ad0962f346f62a6038fbcb29fd4e156ffb8321f	defining the responsibility space for the information systems evolution steering		Information System (IS) evolution is today a continuous preoccupation of every modern organization that aims to have a perfect support for its constantly changing business ecosystem. However, the task of IS evolution is not anodyne, it presents several risks towards IS sustainability as well as towards enterprise activity. Taking a decision related to any IS change can be a troublesome responsibility because of the amount of information that has to be processed and the uncertainty of the impact of the change on the enterprise and its IS. To reduce this uncertainty, we have developed a conceptual framework for IS evolution steering. This framework allows to capture the information on how enterprise IS supports its activities and regulations, and then to extract the information relevant for realizing IS evolution activities, simulating their impact, and taking appropriate decisions. This second part of the framework is called the responsibility space of IS evolution steering and is the main subject of this paper.	information system	Jolita Ralyté;Wanda Opprecht;Michel Léonard	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-48393-1_13	systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;management science	Robotics	-73.32678218724568	11.075257665537315	122597

Five generations of the WinWin negotiation framework have improved such capabilities, but even the latest WikiWinWin toolset has encountered problems with non-technical stakeholder usage. With the advent of social networking and popularity of Facebook and Gmail, we have developed a radically different way for collaborative requirements management and negotiations. The new avatar of the WinWin framework called 'Winbook' is based on the social networking paradigm, similar to Facebook and content organization using color coded labels, similar to Gmail. Initial usage results on 14 small projects involving non-technical stakeholders have shown profound implications on the way requirements are negotiated and used through the system and software definition and development processes. Winbook has also been adopted as part of a project to bridge requirements and architecting for a major US government organization.	gmail;programming paradigm;requirement;requirements management;software project management;usability	Nupul Kukreja;Barry W.

6c0d8c6a34d7c569aff658a37ccd037243c37aa8	interactive engineering systems design: a study for artificial intelligence applications	engineering system;artificial intelligent	Abstract   To develop KBSs as designer's assistants requires a detailed understanding of the process of design. We describe engineering systems design as a feedback process that suffers from several sources of uncertainty and complexity. Because of the broad range of design methodologies available, the need to classify design approaches, based on the amount of analytical information available to the designer, is argued. Three classes of design technique: analytical, procedural and experimental are identified and characterized. A detailed model of the procedural design process is developed and the importance of redesign is emphasized. Procedural design is a symbiotic process, the designer working closely with a computer. To establish which parts of the design should be performed by the designer and which by the machine, their respective information processing capabilities are examined. The designer works in terms of a conceptual framework and performs calculations using the machine's manipulative framework. He receives design assistance from a machine resident knowledge framework.	applications of artificial intelligence;mit engineering systems division;systems design	J. M.

de1f12c87e8dc4f3d7ede4ae68bb3076a37104da	recent advances in prognostics and health management for advanced manufacturing paradigms		Manufacturing paradigms have played their important roles in modern industry. In recent 20 years, production systems of advanced manufacturing paradigms (e.g. mass customization, reconfigurable manufacturing, sustainable manufacturing and service-oriented manufacturing) have been developed to exceed the traditional â€œmass productionâ€ paradigm. The reasons that make system health management especially difficult include individual machine deteriorations, different system structures, diverse production characteristics and exponential scheduling complexity. To address these gaps, we provide a review of the prognostics and health management (PHM) field focusing on prognostics approaches for asset health, and maintenance policies for more â€œinformedâ€ decisions. This paper addresses recent advances in PHM for advanced manufacturing paradigms to forecast health trends, avoid production breakdowns, reduce maintenance cost and achieve rapid decision-making. Furthermore, an in-depth look at future research interests is provided.		Tangbin Xia;Yifan Dong;Lei Xiao;Shichang Du;Ershun Pan;Lifeng Xi	2018	Rel. Eng. & Sys.

Advances in information technology allow more and more information to be shared across entities so that the activities can be better coordinated throughout the entire supply chain. For different products and under different demand patterns, sharing information may have quite different results. Our research aims to study the relationship between product nature, demand pattern,and information sharing strategy. As product nature changes at different stages in the production cycle, and over time, demand pattern changes accordingly, thus requiring changes in information sharing strategies employed. We use the multiagent simulation system to evaluate the effectiveness of the information sharing strategies under different product natures and demand patterns.	agent-based model;design pattern;entity;experiment;icis;information systems;network performance;os-tan;simulation;supply chain network	Gek Woo Tan;Bei Wang	2001			computer science;knowledge management;microeconomics;commerce	AI	-76.73486340258782	6.644019859900561	123358

Each company tries to find the best way to make generated Big Data sets valuable and profitable. However, in most cases, companies have not enough opportunities and budget to solve this complex problem. On the other hand, there are companies (i.e., in insurance or banking) that can significantly improve their business organization by applying hidden knowledge extracted from such massive data. This situation leads to the necessity of building a platform for exchange, processing, and sale of collected Big Data sets. In this paper, we propose a distributed big data platform that implements digital data marketplace based on the blockchain mechanism for data transaction integrity.	big data;bitcoin;business analysis;digital data	Denis A.

However, these claims are seldom supported by empirical evidence, while on the other hand there are several impediment factors which might overcome the advantages deriving from the use of OSS in a corporate environment: cost of transition, personnel training and, interoperability and integration with existing technologies. These factors are often used by OSS opponents. In this paper we first report of a smallscale deployment of OSS for office automation in Public Administration bodies. We describe the environment, the process and the problems encountered. Next, we describe a proposal for a future experiment for empirically assessing OSS impediment factors, focusing in particular on personnel productivity. We again propose the deployment of OSS office automation tools in Public Administration bodies and we describe a system for monitoring the effect of the use of OSS on personnel productivity.	automation;consortium;design of experiments;electronic data processing;hgnc;interoperability;open sound system;openoffice basic;server (computing);software deployment;universal instantiation	Bruno Rossi;Barbara Russo;Paolo Zuliani;Giancarlo Succi	2005		10.1007/978-3-540-32257-3_26	systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;software engineering	HCI	-71.92473178365167	18.080948401007934	123699

Although earlier research has been based mainly on Microeconomics and Games Theory, recent advances extended relevant research in Operational Research and Information Technology. Today, auctions and their applications form a challenging topic not only for economists but for operational researchers, marketers, logisticians and management engineers. This paper examines contemporary emerging auction formats, including auctions in which bids consist of many other parameters. The study of these emerging auction formats proceeds through the analysis of critical auction parameters that directly affect the decisionmaking process and the problems that auction participants face. This paper presents, with a presentation in graphical form, the decision framework for the majority of approaches presented in contemporary literature to highlight the association between decision elements and auction design.

They provide computerized support for owners of repetitive, highly standardized business processes, with a means of controlling the execution of instances of those processes according to predefined process templates. However, many real-life business processes are characterized by various forms of unpredictability and uncertainty. For workflow systems to be applicable in these environments therefore, they must incorporate methods of addressing uncertainty, vagueness, variability, exceptional cases and missing information. Methods that have been previously been applied include dynamic instance adaptation, partial completion and case handling - not to mention manual over-riding in the case of exceptions. Intelligent approaches have included stochastic and fuzzy Petri Nets.

The introduction of a new technology aims to improve productivity and quality of production processes, and to better adapt the products to market needs. Therefore, it can be used to improve effectiveness and efficiency of business goals. Unfortunately, innovation is not always well seen and accepted in that it introduces a change of techniques and methods that are ingrained in the production processes. It is often judged as too high of a risk for management that is unable to evaluate the exact costs and consequent benefits. Because of these reasons it is necessary to support technological innovation with theoretical and empirical results and to gradually transfer them within production lines. This allows to better estimate risks, costs and benefits. To face these issues EDS Italia Software uses Industrial Research Projects as a mean for technological innovation. In this way it is able to evaluate the feasibility of an innovation and to carrying out a gradual technological transfer within enterprise process.

The main aim was to gather versatile information about their views by posing 26 questions concerning decision making. Topics of interest of these questions included: decision makers, decision making process, used and needed methods and tools, confirmation of decisions, and decision criteria. Six important themes were identified and discussed: role of intuition, economical evaluation, confirmation of the decisions, group decision making, tool support, and success and limitations of the conducted empirical study. The most important findings include the following: use of intuition in decision making is polarized, economical evaluation is important and pursued but reliable estimation of benefits is hard fo achieve, decisions are seldom confirmed, group decision support aspects appear to be important, and tool support for expert judgment needs to be improved.	common criteria;decision support system;relevance;software industry;software modernization	Jussi Koskinen;Heikki Lintinen;Jarmo J.

This paper proposes a business process-IT alignment method for BI. The  proposed method has two phases of business processes: the first phase extracts and checks the validity of hypotheses for achieving  business goals and the second phase clarifies the actions needed to implement the hypotheses. Then, business information used  in each business process is defined. Four levels of BI systems are proposed in accordance with the maturity of the enterprises  they support, and each level is mapped to a subset of the business processes. Finally, three types of models used to clarify  and organize the hypotheses and the actions are proposed. Case studies have shown that the method explains a variety of business  processes for BI and BI systems.  	business process	Jun Sekine;Takashi Suenaga;Junko Yano;Kei-ichiro Nakagawa;Shu-ichiro Yamamoto	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-01862-6_5	business model;business analysis;business transformation;computer science;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;electronic business;business analytics;process management;business intelligence;business process;business relationship management;management;business rule;new business development;business process modeling;business activity monitoring;profitability index;business architecture	AI	-74.98808558861751	8.856481279144992	124271
caf14c8da4eb6674aacab0c2a1dfb2d978bf0289	an architecture for context-aware knowledge flow management systems		The organizational knowledge is one of the most important and valuable assets of organizations. In such environment, organizations with broad, specialized and up-to-date knowledge, adequately using knowledge resources, will be more successful than their competitors. For effective use of knowledge, dynamic knowledge flow from the sources to destinations is essential. In this regard, a novel complex concept in knowledge management is the analysis, design and implementation of knowledge flow management systems. One of the major challenges in such systems is to explore the knowledge flow from the source to the recipient and control the flow for quality improvements concerning the users’ needs as possible. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide an architecture in order to solve this challenge. For this purpose, in addition to the architecture for knowledge flow management systems, a new node selection strategy is provided with higher success rate compared to previous strategies.	algorithm;computer science;context awareness;flow network;in the beginning... was the command line;knowledge management;management system;ontology (information science);push technology;routing;software development	Ali Jarrahi;Mohammad Reza Kangavari	2012	CoRR		organizational learning;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;mathematical knowledge management;knowledge-based systems;management science;personal knowledge management;knowledge value chain;domain knowledge	AI	-67.5143658361959	8.680233962109627	124539

As digital goods or services can be delivered over networks, it is also desired that they can immediately be paid electronically. Thus, it is assumed that the trade with digital goods stimulates the deployment of electronic payment systems. Furthermore, new commercial models make new demands on specialized payment systems, e.g., low–value payments should be supported in an economically reasonable way. Meanwhile, there exists a large body of literature on electronic payment system. In this paper, we give a survey of these systems. We point out the requirements they should fulfill and present briefly the basic principles for different categories of payment systems, and consider a few candidates.	digital rights management;requirement;software deployment	Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi;Markus Schneider	2003		10.1007/10941270_9	marketing;business;commerce	ECom	-73.7254676910949	5.310077309472506	125065

3f01236968b293b40d3b0d71ceeb694b2bdf32c9	comparison of metadata quality in open data portals using the analytic hierarchy process		The quality of metadata in open data portals plays a crucial role for the success of open data. E-government, for example, have to manage accurate and complete metadata information to guarantee the reliability and foster the reputation of e-government to the public. Measuring and comparing the quality of open data is not a straightforward process because it implies to take into consideration multiple quality dimensions whose quality may vary from one another, as well as various open data stakeholders who – depending on their role/needs – may have different preferences regarding the dimensions’ importance. To address this Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem, and since data quality is hardly considered in existing e-government models, this paper develops an Open Data Portal Quality (ODPQ) framework that enables end-users to easily and in real-time assess/ rank open data portals. From a theoretical standpoint, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to integrate various data quality dimensions and end-user preferences. From a practical standpoint, the proposed framework is used to compare over 250 open data portals, powered by organizations across 43 different countries. The findings of our study reveals that today’s organizations do not pay sufficient heed to the management of datasets, resources and associated metadata that they are currently publishing on their portal.	accessibility;basis (linear algebra);benchmark (computing);common criteria;conformance testing;content format;data quality;decision support system;discoverability;downgrade;downstream (software development);e-government;json;openness;portals;real-time locating system;scalability;software framework;user (computing)	Sylvain Kubler;Jérémy Robert;Sebastian Neumaier;Jürgen Umbrich;Yves Le Traon	2018	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2017.11.003	multiple-criteria decision analysis;analytic hierarchy process;open data;economics;management science;public relations;decision support system;metadata;publishing;reputation;data quality	Web+IR	-68.73699088373874	11.728975436626714	125796
1a041e511d3debc1f2015391f8eae7d1095f57b3	a novel infrastructure facilitating access to, charging, ordering and funding of assistive services		Given that, nowadays, access to ICT is required for almost any kind of education, employment and commerce form, and is increasingly required for travel, it is mandatory to focus on integrating groups of users with any type of disability at a personally and societally affordable cost. In this paper, we outline an ICT-enabled novel infrastructure that significantly facilitates user access to a large set of specialised assistive services and enables small ICT players (e.g. web entrepreneurs) to develop novel services “on user/user group demand” supported by crowd funding. Our vision is to create an infrastructure that can move ideas more quickly from conception to market and consumer availability, that can be more efficient by being better targeted to user needs, that can move users closer to researchers and developers to ensure that the full range of needs are better addressed and that can reduce both the development and operation cost of assistive services. The system we propose consists of the Assistance on Demand (AoD) service infrastructure which aims to be a gateway for accessing on demand diverse types of human and machine-based assistive services. This AoD is accompanied by a flexible payment infrastructure that aims at enabling, for all relevant stakeholders (end users, service providers, etc.), the easy, flexible and reliable handling of multiple bills for different services, while at the same time supporting crowd-funding, as necessary, for user-driven assistive technology (AT) or service development. In this paper, we present the state-ofthe-art technologies and approaches that will serve as the basis for the design and development of the AoD and payment infrastructures and then we discuss the requirements that these intertwined systems have to fulfill and draw highlevel design directions.	assistive technology;crowdfunding;requirement;software development process	Gianna Tsakou;Helen-Catherine Leligou;Nikos Katevas	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07509-9_44	public relations;knowledge management;business;computer security	HCI	-74.34419355187728	14.02918052657038	125949

The purpose of such patterns is to contribute to more efficient operations, avoid repeating costly mistakes or guide continuous process improvements by facilitating systematic reuse of knowledge. The focus of this paper is on developing and validating organizational knowledge patterns in an enterprise context. The paper proposes an iterative development process for organizational knowledge patterns with alternating development and validation phases. The validation phases include a combination of internal and external validation in both theory and practice. The main contributions of this paper are (1) clarification of the term organizational knowledge pattern, (2) an approach for developing and validating such patterns for an industrial context, and (3) experiences from using this approach.

For operators of industrial equipment these contracts offer peace of mind at a fixed price, as service providers bear the cost for any action required to maintain or repair their clients' equipment after (unexpected) failures. In order to ensure profitable offers, providers require methods to both assess uncertainties in the contract design phase and to reduce their adverse business impact during service delivery. So far, research has primarily focused on the identification of uncertainties for various types of contracts. There has been a lack of focus, though, on how digital technologies can support a risk-based design of service contracts - either by reducing uncertainties (e.g. by employing technologies for data collection) or by mitigating their business impact (e.g. by reacting more effectively to unexpected events during service delivery). We address this research gap by elaborating on the interdependencies between uncertainties, their adverse business impact and measures to mitigate this impact. We portray the current state of the art in uncertainty management based on a literature review and complement these results with findings from exploratory interviews with experts of full-service providers in the industrial sector. Building upon the results, we discuss how digital technologies can improve uncertainty management in full-service maintenance contracts and, more generally, in service contracts overall.	algorithm;business informatics;data acquisition;itil;industrial engineering;interdependence;internet backbone;mind;risk management;uncertainty quantification	Björn Schmitz;Franziska Düffort;Gerhard Satzger	2016	2016 IEEE 18th Conference on Business Informatics (CBI)	10.1109/CBI.2016.22	service provider;contract management;actuarial science;operations management;service design;business;commerce	HCI	-75.37197881027572	12.919832030395067	126360

Many fields of science have taken advantage of these developments, and Software Engineering is one such field. Within this scope, we have developed a domain independent synchronous collaborative tool that can be specialized to work with several types of diagrammatical domains. Among those domains, the diagrams used in the Unified Process can be found. In this paper we describe how we have specialized this tool to work with use case diagrams and how we have carried out an empirical study with this tool to obtain conclusions regarding several issues: the analysis of three kinds of communication among users, the relationship between types of communication and coordination among users, and the relationship between communication and the quality of the modeling work.	collaborative software;diagram;knowledge level;offset binary;online chat;software engineering;unified process	Jesús Gallardo;Ana I.

a4ec85a181334d638e8380be50a6d459e586c093	understanding strategic moves and reciprocity on software ecosystems: a strategic modeling approach		Many software ecosystems comprise rival vendors that cooperate and compete with each other simultaneously. This type of relationship is termed coopetition wherein enterprises cooperate to increase collective benefits while competing to maximize their individual gains. In such a relationship, strategic moves by an actor can have significant consequences for other actors in the ecosystem. This paper proposes a model-based approach for analyzing strategic moves in software ecosystems using i* and game trees. We offer a methodology for developing complementary i* models and game trees. We also explicate guidelines for applying this methodology in a consistent manner. We draw upon a published case study as an illustrative example and instantiate a model based on it to assess the strengths and weaknesses of this methodology.	actor model;diagram;enterprise modelling;game engine;mathematical optimization;software ecosystem;temporal logic	Vik Pant;Eric Kai-Hsiang Yu	2017			reciprocity (social psychology);management science;software;business;ecosystem	ECom	-77.00271812802997	6.837011728775138	126538

In collaboration with manufacturing organisations, we are evolving tools and techniques to facilitate the elicitation and mapping of their strategic knowledge. The tools that we are developing can be used to communicate this knowledge across distributed teams of engineers, designers, and brand managers. The tools integrate and maintain the coherence of activity among these groups, and also facilitate the apprehension of new knowledge. We describe how this can be achieved using a mixture of spatial hypertext and reconfigurable information spaces. These tools provide scope for gradually building context, while simultaneously enabling exploration of detailed knowledge.		Andrew C.

0d3e6040289ccb8bb551c1fb685e200d60faaeb6	virtualising process assessments to facilitate continual service improvement in it service management		The IT Service Management (ITSM) industry has defined processes as best practices in the widelyaccepted IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework. However, studies on the measurement of ITSM process improvement are scant. Our research addressed the dual problems of the lack of transparency and the need for efficiency in ITSM process assessment. Using the Design Science Research methodology, we developed a Software-mediated Process Assessment (SMPA) approach that enables assessment of ITSM processes. The SMPA approach includes process selection; an online survey to collect assessment data; measurement of process capability; and reporting of process improvement recommendations. We implemented a decision support system (DSS) to automate the SMPA approach and evaluated it at two IT service providers. The evaluations indicated that the SMPA approach supports decision-making on process improvements. The findings provided design knowledge of virtualisation in ITSM process assessment and how this may facilitate continual service improvement.	best practice;cobit;decision support system;emoticon;isaca;iso/iec 15504;iso/iec 42010;itil;internal validity;iteration;jones calculus;knowledge base;visual artifact	Anup Shrestha;Aileen Cater-Steel;Mark A.

Extracting corporate knowledge and providing a repository for it have become essential because of the critical nature of strategic planning for the success of a business. Although Corporate Memory (CM) has been the subject of many studies in recent years, there are only few studies on the development of CM in relation to green product design, even though this is environmentally important. In particular, product design has gradually shifted to the goals of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle (3R-abilities). In this paper, so that industry can better achieve the 3R's, design knowledge is captured, generated, and modeled using CM architecture. In addition, a case is studied to validate the superiority and contribution of the proposed CM. This study is also relevant to other similar design problems that occur in many industries.

However, to construct an application service is a laborintensive and errorprone process. Application services developed through traditional development methods expose the same pitfalls witnessed in most development processes of enterprise applications such as late delivery, over budget, unpredictable quality, lack of reuse and so forth. We have leveraged clouds in developing application services within the context of large corporate with the magnitude of thousands of application services being built, delivered and used. Instead of using cloud simply for a better runtime engine, it is being used as the development platform to accelerate and optimize the solution development process based on large scale application services. This article will focus on the portal architecture of this framework— coined as Cogito-C that contains four spaces: (a) infrastructure space; (b) application space; (c) business space; and (d) presentation space. This article illustrates Cogito-C by scrutinizing the models in the aforementioned spaces. This article will focus on the descriptive models of this framework.

However, this assumption does not always hold, and situations of data inaccuracy might occur which bear substantial consequences to the process and to business goals. Until now, data inaccuracy has mainly been addressed in the area of business process management as a possible exception at runtime, to be resolved through exception handling mechanisms. Design-time analysis of potential data inaccuracy has been mostly overlooked so far. In this paper we propose a conceptual framework for incorporating data inaccuracy considerations in process models to support an analysis of data inaccuracy at design time and empirically evaluate its usability by process designers.	business process;exception handling;run time (program lifecycle phase);semantics (computer science);usability	Yotam Evron;Pnina Soffer;Anna Zamansky	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-59466-8_19	management science;work in process;business process;usability;exception handling;conceptual framework;business process modeling;data analysis;business process management;computer science	HCI	-63.010850935852446	17.880879833883522	127664

Unifying diverse software processes to produce process commonality is challenging. A group seeking to create a common development process must consider issues such as a rationale for process commonality, how to design a process for balancing commonality and customization, how to analyze existing diverse processes, and whether and how to measure process commonality.

The lean manufacturing paradigm has been used extensively in industrial sectors like automobile industry, where its assembly lines of components present better adaptability to the lean concepts. This paper starts with the proposition of applying lean manufacturing concepts in production processes, and contributes a lot to turn corporations more competitive. A System Dynamics (SD) based model has been developed for optimization of resources. The objective of this paper is to design the lean techniques for the foundry, to study the impact of lead time, shipment time, and correlation time on the throughput of the core shop and melt & mould shop, and also, on plant ready-for-dispatch (RFD) and dispatch section. The SD model developed through this research would serve the purpose of studying the influence of lead time, shipment time and correlation time to identifying the specific factors, which need to be controlled so as to enhance the plant efficiency.	ampersand;decision support system;dynamic dispatch;dynamical system;endeavour (supercomputer);enterprise modelling;instability;interdependence;lean software development;mathematical optimization;programming paradigm;simulation;system dynamics;throughput	Lewlyn Lester Raj Rodrigues;Dasharathraj K.

One approach to deal with such an expectation is to model the development process of the SDI system over time. If the model can be translated into the computer-based environment to be used as a virtual world, then the real situation can also be simulated. Such a simulation will enable the SDI coordinators/managers to gain knowledge about the behavior of the system under different decisions and situations and eventually help them to better develop the SDI through the informed decision making.

Many product and service providers have utilized the so-called technology-push and market-pull, the simple linear views of innovation which prescribe the use of technological discoveries and the involvement of the market respectively to produce goods and services. Others have gone further to adopt models of innovation which recognize the interaction of the different functional units of a firm and the combination of the technology-push and market-pull views with feedback from the external environment. Malawi has witnessed the introduction of a complete array of technology-based products and services catering for different business sectors. This paper investigates how Malawian firms manage the process of innovation in the development or introduction of Information Technology (IT) products and services and proposes suitable models which firms can adopt in managing and strategizing around technological innovation in the Malawian environment. The results suggest that while firms must adhere to specific models of innovation, it is generally useful to take full advantage of the linear market-pull model and the conceptual framework of innovation. 2002). Many models have been developed to help organizations understand and manage the innovation process. Rothwell (2002) identifies the simplest level as the linear model, which considers innovation as a sequence of activities. Dominant views in this model are that either technology or the market is the primary source of ideas to achieve successful innovation. These views are termed technology-push and marketpull respectively. Other models emphasize on the importance of combining the knowledge of the different functional units of an organization.

Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited. And yet others incorporate the technologypush and market-pull views and identify communication and feedback loops between the different elements of the organization and the external environment. The existence of many models of innovation does not, nonetheless, introduce a general model that may cater for all industries, or specifically any industry in Malawi. Innovation would create a competitive advantage for firms offering IT products and services in Malawi to one or more of such industries as telecommunications, banking, accounting, financial services, agriculture and healthcare. This paper, therefore, investigates the management of innovation in the introduction of IT products and services in Malawi. In this context, the various models of innovation are discussed to provide the necessary background for analysis and observation. The paper further draws from literature to propose innovation models suitable for Malawi. The document is organized as follows: the first section introduces the research followed by a review of literature in section two. In section three, the gap in literature which the study intends to fill is identified. The research methodology, presentation of the research findings and an analysis of the results dominate sections four, five and six respectively. A summary of the study is given in section seven. Literature on the Models of Innovation Niosi (1999) identifies four generations of the models of the innovation process which have been subsequently extended to five generations by Rothwell (2002). The first and second generations are characterized by simple linear models, the so-called technology-push and market-pull models respectively. The third generation models take into account the interaction and feedback between the different functions of an organization namely R&D, marketing and manufacturing. The fourth generation models focus on integrating the activities of different parts of an organization working on projects in parallel and creating links and strategic alliances with other organizations. The fifth generation models are considered to be emergent and focus on the use of the interactive model of innovation in combination with organizational processes that aim at improving efficiencies in knowledge transfer. The linear model of innovation has been influential in the science and industrial policy for many years (Trott, 2002). This model considers innovation to be a linear sequence of activities that are either technology-driven (technology-push) or market-driven (marketpull) (Figure 1). The technology-push view of innovation assumes a sequence of activities from the discovery of new ideas by scientists in R&D, application of the ideas to new products by manufacturing engineers and the promotion of the final product to customers by marketing personnel (Niosi, 1999). Borés et al. (2003) observes that in the technology-push model, product offerings by firms are based on assumed as opposed to well-known market needs. This model is only applicable in a few industries such as pharmaceuticals (Khilji et al., 2006) due to factors such as long lead times and high technical uncertainty (Becker & Lillemark, 2006). In such firms, often times as the technology evolves, the long lead times render any market research ineffective, or in worst cases misleading and the high levels of technical uncertainty, which often means insufficient knowledge is available to determine the exact benefits of a drug, hinders market input in product development. The market-pull view of innovation stresses on the importance of interacting with customers to achieve successful innovation (von Hippel, 1978, as cited in Trott, 2002; Clark, 1979). There’s a close interaction between an organization’s marketing function and customers to generate specifications for a product, which are then passed to R&D for design and finally to manufacturing engineers for production. In this model, the emphasis is on the market as a source of new ideas for products.

These demands calls for high flexible assembly systems, containing of standardised, process-oriented assembly modules, offering a robust process and high reuse ability of the equipment. To generate such a system a new concept for cross-functional development of products and the assembly system is being developed. The concept belief is that extreme and long-lasting flexibility cannot be achieved without a distinct connection between product design and the assembly system, i.e. assembly process knowledge must be structured. To achieve this, the assembly module platform (AMP) is being developed, containing all possible modules to assemble the products. The AMP is generating the module process description (MPD), which totally defines the process executed by the specific module. The design of the product can now be guided by the MPD, creating a process-oriented product design. Furthermore, the AMP-database is under construction, linking functions as economical evaluation tools, to compare possible configurations assembly costs and investments.		Erik Sandin;P.

Various methods and tools, from project modeling to the workflow management system, are used to develop these potentials. Decisive influencing parameters of cooperative development processes are hardly considered in these approaches. Thus, the IAW is pursuing an activity-centered approach in which, based on a participatory constructed task net, important influencing parameters are transferred into a time-extended higher Petri net.#R##N##R##N#Mathematical relationships illustrate the interaction of these influencing parameters. These parameters include - aside from obligatory measures, such as number of people, task dependencies or related tools - special influencing parameters such as information integration and the qualification of people.#R##N##R##N#The software presented in the following includes, for example, specific human resource allocation through forecasted personnel utilization, existing competencies and organizational structures, reduction of waiting times through improvement of information flow and the increase in tool utilization.#R##N##R##N#Beside the use for project planning, the article illustrates the function and relation of the individual Petri nets via a short example.

This framework provides a unified viewpoint for considering a wide array of security risk factors which can disrupt business continuity. Our approach integrates the three phases of security risk management, namely risk modeling, assessment, and control/mitigation, through a formulation based on directed graphs, cascades of failures, and mathematical optimization. We consider how security events can propagate through an organization and how resource allocation decisions can be made in order to mitigate the amount of damage they cause. The applicability and effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated through a numerical study which shows significant cost reductions when compared to heuristic methods.	approximation algorithm;business continuity;cloud computing;directed graph;dynamic programming;financial risk modeling;graph theory;heuristic;information system;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;risk assessment;risk management;scott continuity	Jeffrey Mounzer;Tansu Alpcan;Nicholas Bambos	2010	2010 Sixth International Conference on Information Assurance and Security	10.1109/ISIAS.2010.5604086	computer security model;cloud computing security;itil security management;security management;security information and event management;security convergence;risk management;asset;systems engineering;knowledge management;management science;risk management information systems;business;information security management;factor analysis of information risk	DB	-68.78654670436592	8.689719002164221	129253

The development process is a time-consuming and special budgeted project that follows the six stages of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Integrating security within the SDLC is a very important issue. The security of an IS is designed at the very early stages of its development. A security object that is nowadays a must is the Disaster Recovery Plan. Security questions like “Is the Information System Security an issue that has to be a matter of concern for the organization from the start of Information System development?” and “At which stage of its development does an Information System begin to be at risk ?” concern both the organizations and the developers. This paper proposes the enhancement of the SDLC stages in order to reduce the risks from the start of a development, by integrating the development of the Disaster Recovery Plan into the SDLC process. Details are given on how to achieve this, as well as the reasons and the benefits to the organization and to the manufacturer.	disaster recovery plan;information system;security question;synchronous data link control;systems development life cycle	George Aggelinos;Sokratis K.

In this report we briefly overview the developments of electronic commerce in apparel industry. We try to develop a framework for choosing the right technology and development options based on the business model and business orientation chosen. We illustrate the framework by four case companies, which have adapted different basic strategies and business models. The cases include companies with traditional operations with also physical retail outlets, as well as companies operating only on the Internet. There are still a number of unresolved problems related both to consumer-oriented e-commerce in general and to apparel industry in particular. Nevertheless, consumers are increasingly using the Internet to do extensive amount of research on products and fashion trends before purchasing through any media, also making more and more online purchases	academy;complex network;e-commerce;electronic business;foremost;internet;mortar methods;online shopping;outsourcing;purchasing	Virpi Kristiina Tuunainen;Matti Rossi	2002			e-commerce;business model;computer science;marketing;electronic business;world wide web;commerce	DB	-74.44543564927865	5.473575159689931	129648

Each of these enterprises use the same product for similar goals, albeit with different processes and configurations. Therefore, software vendors want to obtain insights into how the enterprises use the software product, what the differences are in usage between enterprises, and the reasons behind these differences. Cross-organizational process mining is a possible solution to address these needs, as it aims at comparing enterprises based on their usage. In this paper, we present a novel Cross-Organizational Process Mining Framework which takes as input, besides event log, semantics (meaning of terms in an enterprise) and organizational context (characteristics of an enterprise). The framework provides reasoning capabilities to determine what to compare and how. Besides, the framework enables one to create a catalog of metrics by deducing diagnostics from the usage. By using this catalog, the framework can monitor the (positive) effects of changes on processes. An enterprise operating in a similar context might also benefit from the same changes. To accommodate these improvement suggestions, the framework creates an improvement catalog of observed changes. Later, we provide a set of challenges which have to be met in order to obtain the inputs from current products to show the feasibility of the framework. Next to this, we provide preliminary results showing they can be met and illustrate an example application of the framework in cooperation with an ERP software vendor.	erp;enterprise resource planning;list of speech recognition software;organizational behavior	Ünal Aksu;Dennis M.

This work addresses two significant issues encountered in the Microgrid (MG) management systems: 1) the semantic interoperability, highlighting the need to ensure a seamless communication between several heterogeneous components, and 2) the multi-objective aspect of the MG, emphasizing the need to model all the aspects involved in the achievement of the MG objectives. Here, we propose OntoMG, a full-fledged Microgrid ontology, to resolve these two issues by providing an interoperable information model with existing standards and by modeling all the aspects/functionalities involved in the achievement of the MG objectives, namely: Identification, Operational, Mobility, Economical and Ecological. This research is undertaken in collaboration with Jema Irizar Group, leader of the ISare Microgrid Project, a real-size MG built in the Basque Country.	ibm power systems;information model;mg (editor);microgrid;seamless3d;semantic interoperability	Khouloud Salameh;Richard Chbeir;Haritza Camblong;Gilbert Tekli;Ionel Vechiu	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-23868-5_33	interoperability;simulation;computer science;knowledge management	HPC	-66.87476902124821	11.673967637018734	130039

This description serves as a springboard for discussion on the TEMO project (TEMO-Project, 2006), where the Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) model’s current situation and future possibilities in the Finnish engineering industry are being studied. In this paper we concentrate exclusively on C-class product management challenges. Because of the exceptional characteristics of these products, Cclass product monitoring cannot be directly adapted to the VMI models used by the food industry, which are usually based on Point of Sale (POS) information. By presenting the “ideal” model, as well as an adapted version which can be carried out using currently available technology, the researchers would like to open scientific discussion on the subject, especially considering challenges in stock monitoring. The main idea is to offer a higher level of service to customers as well as new business opportunities to service providers. This kind of technology implementation would bring new challenges to supply chain management but also new areas for research, such as information management, communications engineering, as well as ecommerce and added value services, to the forefront.	e-commerce;information management;microsoft forefront;point of sale;unmanned aerial vehicle;unmanned spacecraft	Ari Happonen;Erno Salmela	2007			simulation	DB	-70.91699659329967	8.384929699610398	130068

Still, spreadsheet applications are more likely to be used in many scenarios in which process management technology appears to be a more appropriate solution. Especially in the context of human-centric and knowledge-intensive processes, spreadsheets are widely used, even if more business-tailored applications exist. For example, financial service providers, like banks or insurers, prefer spreadsheet applications for accomplishing their daily business. However, this kind of usage reveals drawbacks when working collaboratively based on the same spreadsheet document. To remedy these drawbacks, we suggest the use of spreadsheet-driven processes, which shall combine the advantages of traditional process management technology with the ones of spreadsheets. Using a sophisticated scenario from the financial domain, this paper shows how spreadsheet-driven processes improve collaborative work, as required in the context of business processes, significantly. Moreover, a proof-of-concept prototype is presented to evaluate the approach in practice. Altogether, first results indicate that spreadsheet-driven processes may be a promising technical solution for everyday business involving human resources.	business process;light-weight process;microsoft outlook for mac;process (computing);process management (computing);prototype;requirement;router (computing);spreadsheet	Michael Stach;Rüdiger Pryss;Maximilian Schnitzlein;Tim Mohring;Martin Jurisch;Manfred Reichert	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-74030-0_24	business process;process management;management science;business process modeling;artifact-centric business process model;finance;computer science;financial services;multitude;human resources	HCI	-71.68539781650972	11.72353415609405	130322

622bf0202a140af80a3a7fe4d5942a779b78200a	editorial: a special issue on e-service intelligence	science general	Electronic-service ~e-service! intelligence is a new research field that deals with fundamental roles, social impacts, and practical applications of various intelligent technologies and methodologies on Internet-based e-services. It has been recently identified as a novel direction and a next stage of e-services for current and future development. E-services involve various types, delivery systems, advanced information technologies, methodologies, and applications of online services that are provided by e-government, e-business, e-commerce, e-market, e-finance, and e-learning systems, to name a few. They thus offer great opportunities and challenges for many areas, such as government, business, commerce, marketing, finance, and education. E-service intelligence comes from real-world requirements, where many government and business organizations are nowadays developing their e-service systems with various intelligent functions. These organizations need to integrate various intelligent technologies and methodologies into their e-service systems for realizing intelligent online services for their users. Over the past decade, in most developed countries both government and business online services have mainly gone through three stages: ~1! online information presentation, ~2! online transaction, and ~3! online information integration. As an example, we take the case of the development of the Australian e-government.

To efficiently reduce environmental and societal impacts of supply chains (SCs) while maintaining continued profitability, it is necessary that the entire SC is designed and managed from a total life-cycle perspective considering coordination between product, process, and SC design. Coordinating product and SC design decisions play a critical role in improving the SSC's performance. The product design determines all its future costs, both in forward and reverse-flow, which in turn depend on the SC configuration such as the number and location of SC partners their capabilities and capacities. Therefore, coordinating sustainable product and SC design decisions requires consideration of all four product life-cycle stages and incorporating a closed-loop flow within the SC. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it emphasizes on the need and importance of coordinating product and SC design decisions in SSCs (through illustrative case studies) and the limitations of existing models from a SSC perspective. Second, the paper explains some of the challenges that need to be addressed while developing such holistic integrated models, provides key factors influencing their performance, and thereby proposes a framework to perform this coordination.	cambridge structural database;holism;mathematical optimization;multi-level cell;process (computing);sql server compact;stochastic optimization	Haritha Metta;Fazleena Badurdeen	2013	IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management	10.1109/TEM.2012.2206392	supply chain management;economics;systems engineering;engineering;marketing;operations management;product design specification;industrial engineering;product management;product design;sustainable development;profitability index;product engineering	HPC	-76.89007095767668	7.614810480776499	130942
6feeb588edcbf5385575493415a6d5c8c02bb617	an ontology-based approach for integrating tools supporting the software measurement process	software measurement;semantic integration;semantic interoperability;ontology	Context: Software measurement is a fundamental practice to support process improvement and project management, since it provides useful data for decision making at both organizational and project levels. Due to the nature of software measurement activities, the use of computational supporting tools is essential. Software measurement can be performed in the context of various software processes and these processes generally have different supporting tools. Thus, it is common to use several tools to allow collecting data regarding the processes. Tools are usually developed at different time, by different teams and without concern for integration. As a result, organizations have to deal with integration issues to enable communication between tools and to properly support the measurement process. A key factor for integration is that tools share a common understanding regarding the meaning of the exchanged terms and services. In other words, it is important to deal with integration not only at the syntactic level, but also at the semantic level. Among the instruments used to address semantics, ontologies have been acknowledged as an important means to address semantic integration. Objective: This paper presents the Ontology-Based Approach for Measurement Systems Integration (OBA-MSI), an approach that uses ontologies as a basis to integrate tools aiming at supporting the software measurement process. Method: OBA-MSI was developed following the Design Science Research paradigm. To evaluate OBA-MSI, we carried out a case study in which we used the approach to integrate tools for a real software development organization. After that, we applied a survey to get feedback from users of the integrated solution. Results: The users stated that the integrated solution obtained from applying OBA-MSI properly supported the software measurement process and added value to the organization, providing more benefits than using the tools in isolation. Conclusions: The use of OBA-MSI to aid tools integration helps deal with semantic conflicts and contributes to obtain a proper support to the software measurement process.	artificial intelligence;domain of discourse;feedback;holism;matchware mediator;norm (social);ontology (information science);out-of-band agreement;requirements elicitation;semantic integration;software development;software measurement;software quality;static program analysis;upper ontology	Vinícius S.

There are many cases where human capital management process is not conducted in a satisfactory way. Key decisions usually come late, very often because of impossibility to consider a problem in its entirety. The cause of it usually lies in weakness and understatement of the human capital management itself and in this connection data management is not given adequate consideration. Data originating from inside and outside sources within information system (IS) are not integrated in a way which will provide an optimal use. In this connection, this article examines possibilities to innovate the entire human capital management process through the integration of respective data. Data warehousing (DW) possibilities and position within the integral business intelligence (BI) concept are noted as a first step towards its realization. In this article the necessity to innovate and promote permanently the quality of human capital management process is considered; the main features of the process are given as well. Business process innovation (BPI) as a systematic approach with a view to achieve significant business process change is presented; its connection with data aspect of IS is given too. According to the research of this article, HCM BPI is achieved by the data integration within existing IS. DW model intended for HCM has been elaborated as a solution which will innovate the process itself. The position and the role of DW within entire BI organization concept have been established as well. Finally, the benefits achieved by the research are explained.

This can be obtained by innovation of the already existing and development of new processes and procedures which will result in the integration of the information system’s data. Improving business processes is the top business priority for CIOs in 2009, while improving enterprise workforce effectiveness is at the 3rd place of business expectations for IT focus on improving current operations and performance (McDonald & Begin & Fortino, 2009). In the organizational context, innovation may be linked to performance and growth through improvements in efficiency, productivity, quality, competitive positioning, market share, etc. All organizations can innovate, including for example hospitals, universities, and local governments. While innovation typically adds value, innovation may also have a negative or destructive effect as new developments clear away or change old organizational forms and practices. Organizations that do not innovate effectively may be destroyed by those that do. Hence innovation typically involves risk. A key challenge in innovation is maintaining a balance between process and product innovations where process innovations tend to involve a business model which may develop shareholder satisfaction through improved efficiencies while product innovations develop customer support however at the risk of costly research and development that can erode shareholder return. Innovation, like many business functions, is a management process that requires specific tools, rules, and discipline (Davila & Epstein & Shelton, 2006). Information system which usually supports human capital management is not completely satisfying, since the data within it are not integrated on the data model level and because of inherited modularity they are disunited. The aforesaid disunity is manifested through inadequate (insufficient) connection between information subsystems within HCM IS. Possibility to make complex and user defined data analyses on the basis of time dimension which is indispensable in the decision making process are insufficient too. Obtained desired improved process should render possible the integration with other functional areas and processes within an organization. They can also be improved through other different approaches (neither necessarily through data integration, nor by elimination of it). Integration within organization system will be conducted on the basis of chosen and accepted strategy, in conformity with defined priorities, disposed human potentials, organizational procedures and chosen technology. Functional logics should be defined in order to satisfy conceptual unity of the improved process which is the first element of the IS unity. Improved process must be open and connecting point must be provided for. Aforementioned processes should lead to enterprise information integration (EII), as concept of data abstraction in addressing the data access challenges associated with data heterogeneity and data contextualization. The unanticipated changes in the IT infrastructure forced IT personnel to set new priorities that caused delays in other aspects of their work. There are several problems that information technology (IT) directors must monitor carefully when their organizations introduce complex IT-based projects that have strategic implications. Six major tactics that an organization may employ in order to ensure continuity and flexibility in its IT functions are: retaining by continuous training, evaluation by objectives, reward for smooth operations, reducing stress and burnout by encouraging creative ideas, job rotation, and finally involving IT personnel in the hiring process of new employees (Watad & DiSanzo, 1998). Stress and burnout are major problems and the IT director must make the work environment more enjoyable. There is a tendency to reward IT personnel who can resolve crises instead of rewarding managers who keep their operations running smoothly (Sturm, 1996). In general, reliability and continuity are more important than crisis handling. Therefore the reward system should be designed to reflect these values. Organizations cannot afford to lose IT personnel during an IT-enabled major organizational change. Retaining IT staff with older skills as the needs of the company change is a challenge. The cost of replacing IT professionals is much 15 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/human-capital-managementprocess-based/39058?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Business, Administration, and Management, InfoSci-Operations, Logistics, and Performance Assessment eJournal Collection, InfoSci-Select.

Many broad-based empirical studies have provided insights into the relationships of supplier development practices to supplier performance. Yet, specific tools available for organizations to internally evaluate such relationships are limited. To help further the research and development of decision tools in this area, we introduce a multi-method approach relying on grey system theory and rough set theory that can help organizations identify the important practices and programs related to suppliers’ performance. Our contribution includes introduction of a methodological approach for evaluating supplier development programs and identification of effective programs and relationships. Implications and results interpretation of the methodology, limitations and future research directions, further expanding the methodology and its applications, conclude the paper. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, many enterprise applications are subject to strict requirements -- e.g. regarding privacy, security and availability -- and are embedded into complex enterprise IT architectures with a multitude of interdependencies. For these reasons, many decision makers have developed a sceptical stance towards cloud computing. A solution might be a hybrid (local/cloud infrastructure) approach where only suited components are migrated to a cloud infrastructure. This, however, has significant architectural consequences that need to be taken into account. This contribution suggests a cloud migration framework that will be implemented as an IT-based decision support system based on modelling the interdependencies between components. The approach is illustrated with the example of Business Intelligence (BI), i.e. integrated approaches to management support. The underlying decision model would particularly consider data transfer volumes, performance, sensitivity of cloud based data repositories, as well as exposure to public networks. The potential of such an approach is illustrated with a selected set of BI scenarios. Based on this, conclusions are derived and generalised for approaches taking into account deployments on both the local premises and cloud infrastructures.	cloud computing;cloud storage;decision support system;embedded system;enterprise software;interdependence;requirement;scalability	Adrian Juan Verdejo;Henning Baars	2013		10.1145/2462307.2462316	cloud computing security;simulation;engineering;data mining;management science	Metrics	-64.79545269700529	9.684660799824982	131241

a0d447bdfc8dd96d01a6fc8ffcd4f219697ec8df	on the integration of event-based and transaction-based architectures for supply chains		Affordable and reliable supply chain visibility is becoming increasingly important as the complexity of the network underlying supply chains is becoming orders of magnitudeshigher compared to a decade ago. Moreover, this increase in complexity is starting to reflect on the cost of goods and their availability to the consumers. This paper addresses two key issues in the distribution phase of the supply chain, namely, affordability and pseudo real-time visibility oftruckload activities. The proposed framework creates a digital thread that tracks the pseudo real-time status of the shipment making the physical distribution process completely transparent to the stakeholders. The architecture of the framework is based on a dynamic hybrid peer-to-peer network and a private/public blockchain data model that leverages emergent sensor technologies.	bitcoin;complexity;data model;erp;emergence;enterprise resource planning;key distribution;peer-to-peer;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;semiconductor industry;software architecture;time complexity;x86	Zhijie Li;Haoyan Wu;Brian King;Zina Ben Miled;John Wassick;Jeffrey Tazelaar	2017	2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)	10.1109/ICDCSW.2017.51	architecture;data model;supply chain;real-time computing;service management;server;blockchain;thread (computing);database transaction;business;distributed computing	Robotics	-76.86864707864807	15.444836472114936	131317

In earlier times, developing the tods and technology in-house was the only alternative. But in the early 19703, a vigorous and competitive CAUCAD industry emerged which drove the cost of tools down as they recaptured their development investments over a wide customer base. So today, the cost of internally developing DA technology is prohibitive when compared with purchasing commercial alternatives. An example helps illustrate this. A typical schematic entry tod costs from $500 to $10,000 per copy depending on the vendor.

Modelo de recuperação de dados não estruturados para sustentação à estratégia de competitividade organizacional. (A model for the recuperation of non-structured data for the sustentation of a strategy for organizational competitiveness). Florianópolis. 2005. 204f. Tese (Doutorado em Engenharia de Produção) – Programa de PósGraduação em Engenharia de Produção, UFSC, Florianópolis. Organizations generally have a bulk of information in their computers out of the which they may make little use, because they do not possess an efficient form to access those information. The major difficulty in having access to those data is caused by their structuring nature. They are non-structured data. Considering this fact, this research aims to find a solution to permit the access to non-structured data. A strategy of competitiveness is adopted as a factor for the indexation of those data. Thus, Porter’s five competitive forces (PORTER, 1996) were chosen and, by means of the application of ontologies, a model was built that allows for the structuring of those data, making them accessible for computational processing. The results suggest that it is possible to transform non-structured data into semi-structured data, and then apply existing computational facilities to make those data available for the organization. The modeling of the domain of the knowledge included in the theoretical basis of Porter’s competitive forces permitted the development of the work, giving it a practical characteristic. The application of the proposed model allows for to the strategic realignment of the organization, clear definition of functions on the focus of the present research, and automation of a process inherent to the chosen strategy of competitiveness, which permits identification, selection and action, based on the non-structured data that enter the organization. The research proved the viability of the model and evidenced the contribution that models of this type can bring to the progress of the organizations, by optimizing the available computational resources. As far as the application of a domain modeling is possible, as well as its computational representation and processing, the organization is able to rescue non-structured data and information, which may be very important for the organization to reach its objectives.	competitive analysis (online algorithm);computation;computational resource;computer;data model;ontology (information science);semi-structured data;semiconductor industry	Antônio Pereira Cândido	2005			regional science;sociology	ML	-69.51029589263831	6.349201091139672	131517

Current database technology fails to allow organisations to comply with the requirements of the new data protection legislation.

Some of these tools fall under the heading Office Automation (OA) [7]. This paper and accompanying tutorial introduce four stages in assessing the potential, likely impact, required implementation, and performance tracking of automation in light of business objectives. Many analyses conducted today by independent management advisory firms (and indeed, by the internal consultants of large organizations) use task taxonomies in their study of OA and end-user computing. A task taxonomy is the categorization of the different activities a worker may perform [ll. The method discussed here is an alternative to that approach. This alternative method has proven technically and managerially valid in a host of organizations, large and small, across a multitude of industrial/service classifications, in both private industry and the public sector. Although not limited to Office Automation, the method is most appropriate for execution in environments where integrated technologies are used or are under consideration, hence its peculiar suitability to OA (including end-user computing). The method is presented in three parts: introduction and assumptions, delivery, and concluding remarks. In addition, two case studies are examined during the tutorial for illustrating the benefit and drawback of each study phase, and for presenting the instruments used in each example.

A structured database has been set up in order to demonstrate the interest of a single entry point for accessing various data related to standards. It is available on the web (http://www.crpgl.lu/ standards). The adoption of a standard depends on its technical properties but also (and often mainly) on business factors.

Major variations in belief were caused by varying use of the methodology checkel; inability to create proper tests for the presence of constraints, and ambiguity in natural language expressions of the methodological constraints under inspection.

On this matter, the open-source phenomenon may shed some light, as successful cases on distributed collaboration in the open-source community have been recurrently reported. In our research we explore collaboration networks in the WebKit and OpenStack high-networked open-source projects, by mining their source-code version-control-systems data with Social Network Analysis (SNA). Our approach allows us to observe how key events in the industry affect open-source collaboration networks over time. With our findings, we highlight the explanatory power from network visualizations capturing the collaborative dynamics of high-networked software projects over time. Moreover, we argue that competing companies that sell similar products in the same market, can collaborate in the open-source community while publicly manifesting intense rivalry (e.g. Apple vs Samsung patent-wars). After integrating our findings with the current body of theoretical knowledge in management strategy, economics, strategic alliances and coopetition, we propose the novel notion of open-coopetition, where rival firms collaborate with competitors in the open-source community. We argue that classical coopetition management theories do not fully explain the competitive and collaborative issues that are simultaneously present and interconnected in the WebKit and OpenStack open-source communities. We propose the development of the novel open-coopetition theory for a better understanding on how rival-firms collaborate with competitors by open-source manners.	distributed computing;open-source software;social network analysis;software crisis;software development;theory;webkit	Jose Teixeira	2014		10.1145/2641580.2641627	public relations;engineering;knowledge management;marketing	Web+IR	-77.00581357676771	5.322024982796537	132161
e19b76aedb64b9a3cc7ba0048737ab07c5e3c6ec	product lifecycel management requirements gathering: industrial pilot cases		Abstract   Product Lifecycle management (PLM) is a concept that aims to integrate the various processes and phases involved during a typical product lifecycle. This paper reports on the capture of requirements for PLM from five Industrial Partners in a FP7 project “advanced Platform for manufacturing engineering and Product Lifecycle Management” (amePLM). The objective of amePLM is to develop a software platform which will provide a collaborative extensible engineering platform that will leverage state-of-the art research on semantics, heuristics and visualization. The five Industrial Partners in amePLM vary in size (micro, SME to large) and by sector, from electronics, healthcare, advanced technology to engineering services. Independent of the company size and the sector it operates in the PLM requirements gathering reported in this paper shows that there are deficiencies in the support for collaboration, project management and visualization in the current PLM tools used by these companies. To capture requirements from the companies a new PLM requirements gathering methodology was developed which is reported on in the paper.	requirement;requirements elicitation	Matthew Daniels;Ivor Lanning;Pezhman Ghadimi;Cathal Heavey;Alan Ryan;Mark Southern	2013		10.3182/20130619-3-RU-3018.00434	systems engineering;engineering;operations management;product lifecycle;product management;application lifecycle management;manufacturing engineering	SE	-65.63696181759927	14.513023476338105	132163

They are now crucial in supporting operations of infrastructure, ranging from power plants to air-control systems. These networked information systems, essentially forming the current internet, are thus highly sensitive kinds of infrastructure where security plays a central role. However, assuring their security has to address certain specific aspects with regard to risk management. This paper presents a new approach to support decision making in this complex area. It is based on a generic risk management model for distributed information systems that deploys system dynamics. Such an approach provides many advantages, like suitability for interdisciplinary use, providing a graphical view on the system structure and components relationships, real-time support for “what-if” scenarios, and the possibility for inclusion in automated decision support systems. It is especially suitable for education and risk awareness programs in organizations.	control system;decision support system;graphical user interface;information system;internet;real-time locating system;risk management;system dynamics	Denis Trcek	2009	2009 Fourth International Conference on Systems	10.1109/ICONS.2009.40	power station;decision support system;intelligent decision support system;computer science;knowledge management;electrical engineering;management information systems;distributed computing;risk management information systems;information system	DB	-66.80897667590548	9.683529541306955	132427

To enable selective funding and resource optimization for BYOD, we propose that the enterprise determines its own service delivery policy, using an enterprise Business Context (eBC) Policy tool. The enterprise is best placed to ascertain session context and priorities from its internal context sources, kept only by the enterprise, to retain privacy. While NETWOK policies are controlled by network operators, the enterprise could and should determine the SESSION policies that are based on its business goals. The eBC policy can be further utilized for optimizing resource usage and influencing employee consumption. The enterprise goals need to be translated into standard policy rules and conveyed to the carriers via existing 3GPP standards, to fit in with existing networks.

The SESAR Program aims at reaching an ambitious performance target (for 2020) by developing a large collection of “Operational Improvement Steps” (OIs). This development is achieved by more than 300 projects, themselves involving a number of partners working at their own site throughout Europe. To face this challenge, the SJU supported by EADS through an “industrial support” contract, has organized the management of the contributing projects on some basic principles: -­‐ The SESAR Program is Performance-driven: this principle gives priority to developments that demonstrate significant performance gains within Key Performance Areas (KPA). -­‐ The programs monitors the maturity progress of the constituting OIs on a maturity scale (V1, V2, V3 maturity levels introduced by the European Operational Concept Validation Methodology) and revisits their priority in accordance with their maturity status. -­‐ The achievement of each maturity level corresponds to a phase, and the transition from a maturity level to the next is assessed on the basis of maturity criteria. -­‐ Each maturity criterion shall be demonstrated though evidences, relying on validation results. -­‐ Maturity criteria reflect the confidence that the Requirements attached to OIs will be met.

In response to this demand, various metrics such as cost, delivery, energy efficiency, quality, flexibility, etc. for measuring the efficiency of manufacturing facility are under development. However, since multiple efficiency metrics are under development, it becomes necessary to develop simple and effective method for assessing manufacturing facility energy efficiency by using multiple metrics. Currently, spider web chart and control chart that extends the capability of spider web chart are commonly used in various industries in order to effectively analyze the efficiency. The spider web chart and control chart method provide an easy comparison of holistic energy efficiency among multiple manufacturing facility or temporal trend. But, it is known that those methods have limitations such as equal weights on metrics and no overall evaluation. In order to resolve the limitations, we propose a weighted spider web chart model. The main objective of this paper is to present the general weighted spider web chart model and investigate the usefulness and applicability of the proposed weighted spider web chart model through the strength-weakness-opportunity-threat (SWOT) analysis.	effective method;holism;radar chart;requirement	Sangjin Jeong;Yong-Woon Kim	2016	2016 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2016.7427146	control chart;metric;organization;factory;performance indicator;efficient energy use;manufacturing	Robotics	-71.16752533175378	5.144933494513397	133181

The benefits which design explanation offers designers (as documented in the literature) suggested an investigation with a view to understanding the potential contribution of the IBIS (Issue-Based Information System) approach. The paper reports an investigation into the use of ad hoc design explanation, in which design decisions were documented as they were made using the IBIS notation. This study finds both strengths and weaknesses in the approach. It reveals ways in which IBIS might be used more effectively and leads us to suggest a further study into the complementary use of ad hoc and post hoc design explanation approaches.	design rationale;hoc (programming language);issue-based information system;software documentation;software requirements specification	LeMai Nguyen;Paul A.

This paper proposes a methodology to explore the graph. Each attack path is considered as an independent attack scenario from the source of attack to the target. The attack graph-based risk assessment model helps organisations and decision makers to make appropriate decisions in terms of security risks. We develop a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to determine the risks of attack paths and produce useful numeric values for the overall risk of a given network. The population-based strategy of a GA provides a natural way of exploring a large number of possible attack paths to find the paths that are most important.	genetic algorithm;population;risk assessment;software release life cycle	Mohammed A.

The approach concerned with the interaction of the organization, the market, and an external perspective to flexibility, is known as the Supply Chain Agility (SCA). The main purpose of this paper is designing the model of agile supply chain in Fars Nov Cement Company. For achieving this objective and for extracting agility indexes, research literature has been first reviewed in detail, and then a part of identified indexes were subjected to final confirmation according to the opinions of experts and Fuzzy Screening Method. After this stage agility model of supply chain was designed for this company based on opinions of experts and using Structural Interpretive Modeling (ISM) method. The results of this research show that proper planning and network orientation indexes form the basis of agility in supply chain are acted as a foot-stone of model. These two indexes also have the highest importance among other indexes of model.

Based on the review of four existing ITSM maturity models (CMMISVC, COBIT 4.1, SPICE, ITIL v3), we first develop a multi-attributive scale to assess maturity on an ITSM process level. We then use this scale in a survey with 205 ITSM key informants who assessed IT provider organizations along a set of 26 established ITSM processes. Our exploratory factor analysis and measurement model assessment results support the validity of an operationalization of ITSM capability as a second-order construct formed by ITSM processes that span three dimensions: service planning, service transition, and service operation. The practical utility of our survey instrument and avenues for future research on ITSM capability are outlined.	3d modeling;benchmark (computing);cobit;capability maturity model;direct inward dial;exploratory factor analysis;goto;itil;occam's razor;ostensive definition;relevance;spice	Jochen Wulf;Till J.

Product quality is influenced by temperature perturbations and time delays in interventions. Thanks to Internet of Things (IoT) considerable progress has been made in recent years in the improvement of temperature monitoring devices. However, temperature monitoring in medicine Cold Chain remains challenging. In this paper it is presented a conceptual model aiming at overcoming challenges of medicine Cold Chain related to temperature monitoring. The major particularity of our model is that it considers the complete Cold Chain according to two perspectives of pharmaceutical and healthcare industries in a single study. Besides this model can be applied also in vaccine Cold Chain and in temperature-controlled logistics of laboratory medicine. Our conceptual model supports the development of a smart Cold Chain system for temperature monitoring based on IoT. Our smart Cold Chain system can be used to improve Cold Chain responsiveness by studying weaknesses and deciding what Cold Chain characteristics to improve.	internet of things;logistics;responsiveness;software deployment	Sergio Monteleone;Mauro Sampaio;Rodrigo Filev Maia	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics (SOLI)	10.1109/SOLI.2017.8120995	operations management;conceptual model;wireless sensor network;systems engineering;engineering;software deployment;cold chain;patient safety;internet of things	Embedded	-63.4058404608414	8.933264687330164	134149

We conducted a qualitative study, using interviews and mockups, with fifteen industrial practitioners from four aeronautics companies, in order to investigate what tasks are actually performed by requirements engineers and how current tools support these tasks. We found that RE-specific tools constrain engineers to a rigid workflow, which is conflicting with the adaptive exploration of the problem. Engineers often start by using general-purpose tools to foster exploration and collaborative work with suppliers, at the expense of traceability. When engineers shift to requirements refinement and verification, they must use RE-specific tools to grant traceability. Then, the lack of tool usability yields significant time loss and dissatisfaction. Based on scenarios of observed RE practices and walkthrough, we formulate usability insights for RE-specific tools in order to conciliate flexibility and traceability throughout the RE process.	cognitive walkthrough;general-purpose modeling;interviews;refinement (computing);requirement;requirements engineering;systems engineering;traceability;usability testing	Hélène Gaspard-Boulinc;Stéphane Conversy	2017	2017 IEEE 25th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)	10.1109/RE.2017.20	requirements engineering;systems engineering;traceability;management science;requirements traceability;usability;software walkthrough;usability engineering;aeronautics;mockup;usability goals;engineering	SE	-64.47938940712581	15.886607480660611	134560

We posit that the level of vertical integration, market size and the position of the firm's product offerings in the phase of the product development lifecycle influence the propensity of entry into services. The mode of entry is a choice between firms exploiting its existing capabilities to enter services through organic growth or that of exploring for new avenues in the form of alliances or acquisitions (March, 1991). At this second step, we posit that the firm status, presence of industry standards and the degree of modularity in the firm's product offerings drive the decision on the mode of entry.	new product development;technical standard	Sukruth Suresh;Thiagarajan Ravichandran	2015	2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2015.171	uncertainty;service product management;innovation management;marketing;product management;new product development;statistics;commerce	Robotics	-75.73617078993435	14.299129588042264	135063

The following conclusions are obtained. First, regarding explorative innovation, when both the breadth and depth of the knowledge source are at a low level, the enhancement of the breadth of the knowledge source may rapidly lift explorative innovation performance; when the knowledge source is at a high level, the theory of ‘ambidexterity balance’ is more applicable to find a balance between the breadth and the depth of the knowledge source for the enhancement of explorative innovation performance. Second, in terms of exploitative innovation, ‘ambidexterity balance’ theory can be applied at all levels. In other words, the balance of the breadth and the depth of the knowledge sources greatly enhances the exploitative innovation performance.

Finally, it considers not only experts’ technical skills but also their social and organizational capabilities, as well as the affinity degree possibly shown by them when they worked together in the past.	affinity analysis;multi-agent system	Pasquale De Meo;Diego Plutino;Giovanni Quattrone;Domenico Ursino	2009		10.4018/978-1-60566-010-3.ch306	library science;computer science;data science;world wide web	AI	-70.07470410794207	10.842115228787813	135235
8433a06da4830f1be061784d0d8653b979c0b3d7	a detailed process model for large scale data migration projects		Data migration projects might sound exotic. They are not. Instead, they are common in all medium and large enterprises, e.g., when replacing applications with new (standard) software or when consolidating the IT landscape in the aftermath of mergers and acquisitions activities. Generalpurpose methodologies such as Scrum focus on managing projects. However, they do not discuss (data-migration) domain-specific tasks. These tasks are the focus and contribution of this paper. It elaborates and compiles them into a process-model. The model defines the logical and temporal dependencies between the tasks and clarifies roles and responsibilities in a migration project. Thereby, the variety of used know-how-sources sets this paper apart from any previous work in this area. We synthesize not only existing literature and own project experience in the German automotive and the Swiss banking sector. We also incorporate the results of twenty-five qualitative interviews from various industry sectors guaranteeing a high validity and applicability of our findings.	domain-specific language;half-life 2: episode one;process modeling;programming paradigm;risk aversion;scrum (software development);xml database	Christopher Schulz	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-30359-3_15	systems engineering;knowledge management;data migration;deliverable;computer science;software;project management;mergers and acquisitions;logical conjunction;scrum;automotive industry	SE	-69.22496238348978	15.183299261773016	135269

However, the introduction of computing and networking tools within an organization has greatly outpaced the organizational restructuring needed to maximally leverage the technology; the introduction of 3-D product models distributed and managed over LANs involves a unique set of organizational issues (Majchrzak, Chang, Barfield, Eberts & Salvendy, 1987). The central purpose of this research is to assist in the implementation of CAD/PDM into wood-based furniture companies located in the Southeastern United States. To this end, this research prepared organizational assessments of product development divisions with a particular emphasis on product design information flow among the departments. The goal is to create a more agile design and manufacturing environment that: 1) respects the messy, open-ended nature of the design process, 2) fosters collaborative, coordinated effort among members of the design and manufacturing teams, and 3) leverages computer and network technology to create an efficient and effective product information exchange medium (Kidd, 1994).	agile software development;computer-aided design;information exchange;new product development;nonlinear gameplay	E.

Given this prominence it is essential to find measurement methods that effectively analyse and communicate the performance to its stakeholders. Further, to assure contribution to both research and practice it is essential to verify the utility of the artefacts (i.e. methods) developed to help validate or justify that the solutions are suitable for practice, and fit the needs and contexts for which it is created. Grounded in the design science paradigm, this paper reports an exploratory evaluation of the perception of certain qualities of two recently developed measurement methods (The Project Performance Scorecard and Project Objectives Measurement Model) against the traditional Triple Constraint method. An analytic scenario-based survey of fifty-one (51) participants, comprising of three (3) sets of independent sample of seventeen (17) respondents each was used. The study analysed dimensions of task performance, ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived semantic qualities and user satisfaction from the perspective of the participants. The preliminary study revealed encouraging results for the new methods and the general design process which can help guide current use and further refinements. The limitations of the study and future research directions are discussed.	computer user satisfaction;information system;programming paradigm;report;usability	Corlane Barclay;Kweku-Muata Osei-Bryson	2009			program evaluation;project method	HCI	-76.7085297838439	13.520826440812534	135592
ebbd9eeaa775da33ece801d29e99fbcde8bcbdef	modelling customer relationships in ebusiness illustrated through the mobile industry	distribution channel	The goal of this paper is to provide an ontological approach to modelling customer relationships, which helps managers optimize channels, improve customer acquisition, retention and add-on selling particularly in an e-business context. The advantages of a systematic approach are multiple. Modelling and mapping customer relationships allows a better understanding of the way a company interacts with its customers. A formal description is also communicable between the various stakeholders. Further, conceptually seized customer relationships are comparable to the customer relationships of competitors. Finally, a formal approach eases design and transformation. We illustrate the model with two examples of the mobile industry at the level of distribution channels and customer relationships for acquiring and retaining customers.	add-ons for firefox;description logic;electronic business	Alexander Osterwalder;Yves Pigneur	2003			systems engineering;marketing;operations management;business	AI	-75.82324327986638	6.449889702730109	135747

The ability of a firm to establish its technology as a dominant design or so-called de-facto standard is a critical determinant of its long-term competitive position. Which strategy a company should choose in a de-facto standardisation process, e.g. introducing a new technology as a proprietary standard or as a more or less open standard, depends on a variety of situative factors. This paper seeks to analyse the effectiveness of different strategic actions in standardisation processes. Utilising economic theories on network effects, the paper develops a framework for analysing strategic behaviours of companies in de-facto standardisation processes with a special focus on openness strategies.

Loosely coupled heterogeneous IT systems and almost independent IT departments within business groups around the globe do not facilitate transparency of IT costs and performance. The management of costs and performance of IT, also known as IT controlling, describes the discipline of ensuring the effective and efficient usage of IT resources. The basis of this paper is a case study of seven multinational corporations. Our findings reveal several unaddressed requirements by best-practice IT management frameworks, with regards to managing costs and performance of IT in a group context. The case study shows that IT controlling at multinational corporations has not unleashed its full potential to support the pursuit of more effective and efficient management of IT resources.	knowledge management;mechatronics;requirement;the sims	Florian Hamel;Thomas Herz;Falk Uebernickel;Walter Brenner	2011			systems management;computer science;knowledge management;environmental resource management;marketing;operations management;information management;management;computer security	SE	-77.2002723635234	6.300583581812043	136091

We particularly argued that by analyzing separately the risks posed by the pressure of the explosion blast, the dispersion of toxic gases and the fragments cloud, current practices fail to account for the interdependencies between those hazards, potentially miscalculating the overall risk on the public and the surrounding infrastructure. In this work we set two objectives to expand on our claim. The first is to propose a methodology based on Distribution Envelope Determination (DEnv) to address the above need. The second on the other hand focuses on describing the ongoing software development activities aimed at implementing this methodology as an ArcGIS platform component.	arcgis;blast;it risk management;interdependence;software development	Serge N.

In an age of smart products and smart data, we can, however, expect that many of future service innovations need to be based on adding, transferring, dissociating, and associating existing value propositions. The purpose of this paper is to outline what properties constitute recombinant service innovation and to identify if current service engineering approaches fulfill these properties. Based on a conceptual in-depth analysis of 24 service engineering methods, we identify that most methods focus on designing value propositions instead of service systems, view service independent of physical goods, are linear or iterative, and incompletely address the mechanisms of recombinant innovation. We discuss how these deficiencies can be remedied and propose a first conceptual model of a revised service system engineering	agile software development;coupling (computer programming);emoticon;iteration;new product development;product engineering;recombinant dna;service innovation;smart products;systems engineering	Daniel Beverungen;Hedda Lüttenberg;Verena Wolf	2017			product-service system;knowledge management	DB	-72.71774907177819	8.816839830113356	136679

Both the ISO 9000 series and excellence models define the total quality management (TQM) philosophy in a specific way, but at different levels of TQM maturity. The gap between the TQM maturity levels defined through the ISO 9000 series and an excellence model are pointed out in the paper. An eight step approach is described that shows how an organisation can move forward from an ISO 9000 series base to be in a position to challenge for a recognised quality/excellence award. The implementation of self‐assessment against an excellence model is an important element in this migratory path. It is also pointed out that organisations need some experience with TQM before being able to effectively use self‐assessment against an excellence model.		Ton van der Wiele;A. R. T.

86634627157b4a32043270932797fcf0d91bffee	a risk assessment and optimisation model for minimising network security risk and cost	thesis or dissertation;network security;computer security;network security risk analysis;g420 networks and communications	Network security risk analysis has received great attention within the scientific community, due to the current proliferation of network attacks and threats. Although, considerable effort has been placed on improving security best practices, insufficient effort has been expanded on seeking to understand the relationship between risk-related variables and objectives related to cost-effective network security decisions. This thesis seeks to improve the body of knowledge focusing on the trade-offs between financial costs and risk while analysing the impact an identified vulnerability may have on confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA). Both security best practices and risk assessment methodologies have been extensively investigated to give a clear picture of the main limitations in the area of risk analysis. The work begins by analysing information visualisation techniques, which are used to build attack scenarios and identify additional threats and vulnerabilities. Special attention is paid to attack graphs, which have been used as a base to design a novel visualisation technique, referred to as an Onion Skin Layered Technique (OSLT), used to improve system knowledge as well as for threat identification. By analysing a list of threats and vulnerabilities during the first risk assessment stages, the work focuses on the development of a novel Risk Assessment and Optimisation Model (RAOM), which expands the knowledge of risk analysis by formulating a multi-objective optimisation problem, where objectives such as cost and risk are to be minimised. The optimisation routine is developed so as to accommodate conflicting objectives and to provide the human decision maker with an optimum solution set. The aim is to minimise the cost of security countermeasures without increasing the risk of a vulnerability being exploited by a threat and resulting in some impact on CIA. Due to the multi-objective nature of the problem a performance comparison between multi-objective Tabu Search (MOTS) Methods, Exhaustive Search and a multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) has been also carried out. Finally, extensive experimentation has been carried out with both artificial and real world problem data (taken from the case study) to show that the method is capable of delivering solutions for real world problem data sets.

The DW process, though supporting bottom-up extraction of information from data, fails in top-down enforcing the company strategy. A new approach to BI, called Business Performance Management (BPM), is emerging from this framework: it includes DW but it also requires a reactive component capable of monitoring the time-critical operational processes to allow tactical and operational decision-makers to tune their actions according to the company strategy. The aim of this paper is to encourage the research community to acknowledge the coming of a second era in BI, to propose a general architecture for BPM, and to lay the premises for investigating the most challenging of the related issues.	beam propagation method;content management system;dreamwidth;top-down and bottom-up design;window of opportunity	Matteo Golfarelli;Stefano Rizzi;Iuris Cella	2004		10.1145/1031763.1031765	business model;business analysis;business process reengineering;computer science;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;data warehouse;business case;top-down and bottom-up design;data mining;database;management science;business process model and notation;business analytics;process management;business system planning;business intelligence;business process;business relationship management;business process discovery;business rule;new business development;business process modeling;business activity monitoring;business architecture	DB	-74.57258898935702	9.665430455232405	137060

In this paper we present experiences gained by applying the System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) method for hazard analysis on a forward collision avoidance system. Our main objectives are to investigate effectiveness in terms of the number and quality of identified hazards, and time efficiency in terms of required efforts of the studied method. Based on the findings of this study STPA has proved to be an effective and efficient hazard analysis method for assessing the safety of a safety-critical system and it requires a moderate level of effort.	critical system;hazard (computer architecture);hazard analysis	Sardar Muhammad Sulaman;Taimor Abbas;Krzysztof Wnuk;Martin Höst	2014			risk analysis;hazard analysis;management;computer security	SE	-64.75225125833275	8.010808189372717	137280

This paper discusses development and application of an expert system for reasonable cost related decision making and continuous cost management process improvement. The system is called COMEX (cost management expert system). This paper also shows how COMEX can be used for improvement of the billing department business processes. COMEX relies on information generated using the activity-based costing (ABC) method, accounting method based on activities, created to improve cost management system by focusing on the driver costs of individual activities. Still, this paper focuses on design and implementation of the COMEX system, and only briefly surveys the ABC method. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditionally, mass customization was argued to be possible due to the advances of modern manufacturing technology. The paper discusses why mass customization is rather an application of electronic commerce than a manufacturing approach. Not flexible manufacturing capabilities but innovative information technologies enabling the integration of each single customer into value creation allow the strategic position of a mass customization system. Customer integration becomes the foundation of a new set of economies. The paper shows how these economies of integration underlie the cost and profit structures of a mass customization based ebusiness model. By examining and structuring the economic principles of mass customization the paper will provide insights not only into the benefits, but also into the limits and constraints of mass customization.	e-commerce;electronic business;integrated computer-aided manufacturing	Kathrin M.

The resources involved in DFR in large organisations typically include staff from multiple departments and business units, as well as network infrastructure and computing platforms. The state of DFR within large organisations may therefore be adversely affected if the myriad human and technical resources involved are not managed in an optimal manner. This paper contributes to DFR by proposing the novel concept of a digital forensic readiness management system (DFRMS). The purpose of a DFRMS is to assist large organisations in achieving an optimal level of management for DFR. In addition to this, we offer an architecture for a DFRMS. This architecture is based on requirements for DFR that we ascertained from an exhaustive review of the DFR literature. We describe the architecture in detail and show that it meets the requirements set out in the DFR literature. The merits and disadvantages of the architecture are also discussed. Finally, we describe and explain an early prototype of a DFRMS.	divergence-from-randomness model;prototype;requirement	Kamil Reddy;Hein S.

We explore the potential of combining these established practices with interactive enactment of executable prototypes that is widely used in UI prototyping and model-based interactive system design. Based on these fields, we develop the concept of process elaboration through scaffolded virtual enactment. The proposed concepts are instantiated in a web-based tool that enables to explore the potential of the approach. An initial exploratory study could confirm that the approach is considered supportive by end users and can be used to elaborate existing process models or develop models of work process from ground up.	business process;executable;interactivity;paper prototyping;software prototyping;software walkthrough;systems design;user interface;web application	Stefan Oppl	2017		10.1145/3040565.3040568	simulation;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process model and notation;process management;business process;scaffold;business process discovery;business process modeling	HCI	-64.55197133986144	15.40157016346431	137818

In this work, we 1) examine differences in the quantity and type of benefits derived by domain novices and experts from a specific decision support system, and 2) discuss how understanding of these differential benefits can help system developers to select a target user group, select appropriate DSS strategies to meet the needs of this user group, and where to focus development efforts.	decision support system;problem solving;subject-matter expert	Camline C.

a6f3e8be1417f18d4cf4c37ce6363cded445d683	supported approach for agile methods adaptation: an adoption study	agile software development;software methods customisation adaptation;agile process assessment	Adopting agile software development methods is a wide and complex organisational change that usually impacts several aspects of the organisation (e.g., its structure, culture, management practices, produced artefacts, technologies in use, etc). In order to successfully handle the several key challenges, it's crucial to understand the organisation context and carefully study the transformation strategies.   This paper presents an agile transformation experience that has been undertaken in a public organisation in Belgium and during which Scrum was applied in two pilot projects. The first project retrospective shows that the change cannot be accomplished only at the team-level without taking into account the overall structure of the organisation and that we must carefully evolve toward a context-specific adapted method. In the second pilot project, we defined structured and repeatable steps to assist the adoption of agile practices. The experience shows the usefulness of such an approach but suggests that automation efforts should be addressed.   The last section of the paper summarizes the issues encountered and presents the AM-QuICK framework which aims at providing a supported approach to guide the agile adoption, adaptation and assessment.	agile software development;organizational behavior;scrum (software development)	Hajer Ayed;Benoît Vanderose;Naji Habra	2014		10.1145/2593812.2593820	agile unified process;agile usability engineering;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;software engineering;agile software development;management science;empirical process;lean software development	SE	-68.70601925321225	16.266912923440618	138140

eb085777aa2e84c1d95ddcd7a50f4c5cc73ff2f5	merging supply chain and blockchain technologies.		Technology has been playing a major role in our lives. One definition for technology is all the knowledge, products, processes, tools,methods and systems employed in the creation of goods or in providing services.This makes technological innovations raise the competitiveness between organizations that depend on supply chain and logistics in the global market. With increasing competitiveness, new challenges arise due to lack of information and assets tractability. This paper introduces three scenarios for solving these challenges using the Blockchain technology. In this work, Blockchain technology targets two main issues within the supply chain, namely, data transparency and resource sharing. These issues are reflected into the organizations strategies and plans.	bitcoin;logistics;process (computing)	M. M. Eljazzar;Mohammed A. Amr;S. S. Kassem;M.

This fact represents one of the biggest challenges when creating visualizations for such datasets: the data does not align well in a tabular structure typically used to populate displays and reports. GRC Platforms provide reporting capabilities and data visualization techniques to summarize data, yet most common GRC visualizations are restricted to certain inflexible perspectives, e.g., Risk Matrix. This work presents a Visual Analytics system that provides multiple visual perspectives over GRC data. The evaluation of the system involved four GRC specialists. The results show that the multiple perspectives approach supports the summarization of different portions of the GRC data, especially regarding business process and business entity taxonomies, and risk/control relationships. The results provide useful insights for specialists working to explore and summarize GRC data and to integrate Visual Analytics Systems with GRC platforms. In addition, the multiple-perspective approach presented could also be applied in systems sharing the same data structure GRP Platforms use.	algorithm;align (company);business process;chart;data structure;data visualization;directed graph;enterprise resource planning;force-directed graph drawing;governance, risk management, and compliance;knowledge engineering;organizing (structure);population;sankey diagram;table (information);taxonomy (general);treemapping;usability testing;video;visual analytics	Vagner Figuerêdo de Santana;David Byman;Nathaniel Mills;Beatriz S.

Traditional fleet management systems focus on the whole vessel/ship. With the emergence of the Internet of Things and new smart technologies, smart fleet management systems are now embedded with greater power in comparison with traditional solutions, e.g. can be used to monitor the performance, status and behaviour of not just the whole ship but crucial internal components, such as engines, water treatment equipment, and propellers. However, developing, implementing and operating such new generation of fleet management system may not be straightforward and can encounter a wide range of socio-technical challenges, which have not been adequately explored in the current literature. This paper attempts to fill this knowledge gap by critically discussing these challenges, with practical suggestions drawn.	embedded system;emergence;fleet management system;internet of things;sociotechnical system	Jingyi Jiang;Guochao Peng;Fei Xing	2017	2017 International Conference on Information Science and Communications Technologies (ICISCT)	10.1007/978-3-319-91125-0_21	engineering management;fleet management;cloud computing;maintenance engineering;management system;sociotechnical system;internet of things;engineering	EDA	-63.997871806970885	9.100547148454732	138347

622902cbdb56f2c4ee89abb35573cd2489a5ec05	the impact of digitalization on the future of control and operations		The notion of Internet of Things (IoT), as well as related topics like Cyber-Physical Systems and Smart Manufacturing, is currently attracting a lot of attention both within the process industries. Clearly, IoT offers many potential applications for automation, ranging from how to engineer the installation of new plants to production management and more intelligent maintenance schemes. However, the focus of this paper is on the control and operations. Most likely IoT leads to new SW architectures where more open standards will result. Through a better connectivity, information will be much easier available, which could result in that previously isolated functions will be more closely integrated. Here modeling at the right level of fidelity will be absolutely key. It can be expected that the importance of optimization will increase and this paper discusses some aspects related to the opportunities, challenges and changes triggered by IoT.	cyber-physical system;internet of things;mathematical optimization	Alf J.

f75628b23ceae3bf9b9d71c428944e9fca85e077	analysis on the application of the internet of things technology to jingdong mall's supply chain management		In recent years competition among retailers has led to intense competition among supply chains. The rise of the Internet of Things provides a basis for retail enterprises to have detailed knowledge of their supply chain and hence to enhance its management. Using the Internet of Things, retail enterprises are able to increase the quality of their supply chain management, so as to offer a more intelligent and efficient service to consumers. In this paper, the authors briefly consider the Internet of Things and then the research status of the Internet of Things as applied to supply chain management. A supply chain analysis model is built under the Internet of Things environment using Jingdong Mall as a case study. The results show that the Internet of Things improved the quality of information available to Jingdong, enhanced its management efficiency and improved customers' satisfaction; it also reduced the cost of supply chain management whilst creating more new value. Finally, some problems encountered in the process of the application of the Internet of Things technology to Jingdong Mall are analyzed and corresponding solutions are proposed.	internet of things;while	Lili Sun;Jing Liu;Russell Higgs;Li Zhou	2017	22017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC)	10.1109/CSE-EUC.2017.270	computer network;supply chain management;marketing;information quality;supply chain;service management;computer science;internet of things	Robotics	-72.48473630543951	6.769165401682784	138711

The presented approach takes into consideration primarily the issues of the optimal model of cooperation on the line of the measuring organization and vendor of the IT tool. Focusing on the assumption that while maintaining the right architecture of the solution, it is possible to meet excessive business needs. The above goals are achieved by implemented fundamentals of Domain-Specific System Architecture (DDSA). We assume that the proposed IT solution can significantly improve the value of investments in the measurement process.

This report describes the findings of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Exploratory Team investigating cyber defense. Many defensive activities in cyber warfare and information assurance rely on ad hoc techniques. The cyber community recognizes that comprehensive, systematic, principle-based modeling and simulation are more likely to produce long-term, reusable approaches. A model-driven paradigm is predicated on mechanisms of modeling the organization whose mission is under cyber attack, the mission itself, and the systems that support it. The level of detail of this class of problems ranges from the level of host and network events to systems assets and up to business functions. Solving this class of problems is of significant difficulty. Such modeling could be used to explore multiple alternative mitigation strategies and select optimal mitigating actions. The paradigm applied to cyber operations is likely to benefit traditional disciplines of cyber defense. The team identified challenges for model-driven paradigms for cyber defense and reviews 2 in detail: 1) modeling adversarial aspects, including wargaming, of the cyber warfare, and 2) modeling of human cognitive processes in relation to cyber activities. Based on its discussions, the team makes recommendations on modeling and simulation for a broad range of cyber defense disciplines.	anti-copyright notice;authorization;cyberwarfare;exploratory testing;failure;hoc (programming language);information assurance;level of detail;model-driven integration;programming paradigm;recommender system;simulation	Mona Lange;Alexander Kott;Noam Ben-Asher;Wim Mees;Nazife Baykal;Cristian-Mihai Vidu;Matteo Merialdo;Marek Malowidzki;Bhopinder Madahar	2017	CoRR		simulation;computer science;operations research;computer security;algorithm	Security	-64.95661544018695	6.236709608632337	138905
ae56baa189cadafc516578ffc7156106a58f3c5a	methods in designing and developing capabilities: a systematic mapping study		Enterprises operate in dynamically changing environments that have an influence on both business and IT areas. Capabilities have been proposed as instruments to align business and IT in such environments. One aim of enterprise modelling is a better communication between the stakeholders of an enterprise at various levels. Thus, the alignment can be facilitated by the exploitation of enter- prise models as an abstraction instrument. In this respective the paper analyses the methods for capability design and development from the enterprise modelling perspective by conducting a mapping study, i.e. the level of methodological support for capability modelling is investigated. For this purpose 112 journals and 24 conference proceedings were analysed. The most important findings are that the research in capability design (i) adopts empirical research, mostly in form of case studies and surveys (ii) is mainly motivated by Resource Based View (RBV) and changing environments (iii) proposes development approaches and frameworks as solution artefacts, (iv) lately receives attention in the Information Systems Development & Tools of MIS subject classification lately, (v) provides a scarce methodological support that is mostly represented as procedures and most importantly (vi) only to some extent exploit enterprise models that could enhance stakeholder communication at various abstraction levels.

The analysis shows that the changing of enterprise boundary is the result that enterprise adapts the variation of environment. On the one hand, the enterprise boundary already expanded from the single enterprise to the industrial colony which superposes with the industrial colony's boundary day by day for 30 years. On the other hand, with the escalating of industrial colony and the continuous improvement of the function of industrial colony, the organization boundary of enterprise tends to become blurred or even virtualization.	computer cluster;industrial pc	Shanqing Liu	2010	2010 International Conference on E-Business and E-Government	10.1109/ICEE.2010.1158	transaction cost;economics;marketing;operations management;management;commerce	DB	-72.78630947309898	6.0849176242873355	139115

To ensure the quality of work, it was necessary to deal with process models. Based on decades of project experience, as well as using the knowledge from SPI-services a specific test process assessment model was developed and internally used. This test process model was aligned to the requirements of ISO 15504 TR 1998. Owing to the changes from ISO 15504 TR 1998 to ISO IEC 15504 it was necessary to rework the process model. A core team with an experienced test and quality manager was formed and supported by leading process assessment experts of SQS. The authors of this article are part of this core team. After a period of evaluation of potential process or process reference models the team decided to stay with the ISO 15504 using part 5 as the starting point for deriving a specific model to assess test processes (Figure 1). The standard ISO/IEC 15504 was designed for being enhanced by developing specific process reference models (PRM) and process assessment models (PAM) [1]. In the meantime specific models are available. The best known is the automotive SPICE developed by the user group in coordination with the automotive domain. Additional parts are published as technical reports and provides an exemplar system life cycle process assessment model (Part 6) and for assessing organizational maturity (Part 7). In the test business, there are two major assessment methods in the market: TPI NEXT and TMMI . Besides, there exists different schemes for the education of test professionals like ISTQB, which is recognized as a de facto standard at least in Germany.

The paper discusses how the TBM and CBM techniques work toward maintenance decision making. Recent research articles covering the application of each technique are reviewed. The paper then compares the challenges of implementing each technique from a practical point of view, focusing on the issues of required data determination and collection, data analysis/modelling, and decision making. The paper concludes with significant considerations for future research. Each of the techniques was found to have unique concepts/principles, procedures, and challenges for real industrial practise. It can be concluded that the application of the CBM technique is more realistic, and thus more worthwhile to apply, than the TBM one. However, further research on CBM must be carried out in order to make it more realistic for making maintenance decisions.

If the potential benefits of these systems are significant, the same applies to the risk associated with their implementation. The majority of ERP studies relate to software packages supplied by large vendors such as SAP and Oracle and by smaller vendors; but until now, few have studied the adoption of ERP systems developed “in-house”. Furthermore, few studies have explicitly focused on minimizing the risk of these systems at the adoption or pre-implementation stage. Presenting a critical case study which analyzes the adoption of an in-house ERP by a SME in the agri-food industry, this article proposes and tests a process framework of ERP systems adoption, based upon a literature review and a conceptual framework centered on risk minimization. The study shows that 1) in-house ERP seems to represent a credible alternative for ERP adoption by SMEs, 2) to minimize risk at the adoption stage, a SME can proceed in a rather intuitive and unstructured manner, based however upon certain principles, policies and practices. The successful ERP implementation in this case indicates that it is not always necessary to resort to formalized project management in order to minimize implementation risk.	erp;empirical risk minimization;enterprise resource planning	Placide Poba-Nzaou;Louis Raymond	2009			accounting;business;commerce	SE	-77.0295699409219	9.642778212452859	139392

To enable compa- nies to do this a thorough understanding of their internal processes is required. Experiments can provide significant opportunities for companies to generate knowl- edge about their product development processes. This chapter examines the role of experimentation in designing robust product development processes and the role of information technology in supporting this. It outlines an IT-based knowledge man- agement system to support the creation, transfer, and the use of knowledge amongst engineers in designing and conducting experiments that lead to robust product devel- opment processes. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the key issues for future research in this area.	knowledge management;management system	Emma O'Brien;Darren Harris;Mark Southern	2009		10.1007/978-1-4419-1081-3_3	systems engineering;engineering;operations management;management science	DB	-75.12963187409022	7.273315565482642	139397

Because of the substantial investment which many organizations have in computers, it is of significant benefit to use selection procedures which minimize computer costs as much as possible within the numerous difficult constraints always present in computer selections. The issues revolved in such selections are so complex, the needs and economies are so variable, and the trade-offs which must be made are so qualitative that it is not meaningful to suggest a single, universal approach to selection. Instead of attempting such a recommendatmn, this paper provides a framework and a basis from which the user can confidently determine a selection approach which is appropriate to his own circumstances. An exposition of the basic considerations underlying selection is presented, followed by a detailed analysis of the steps in the selection process, including alternative approaches to carrying out these steps. An account of procedures used by various organizations is given. Finally, a bibliography, organized by subject matter, is included to facilitate deeper investigation of the issues raised.

However, systems delivered at dynamic, complex and socio-technical workplaces have still failed at satisfying the users' real needs, mainly because they are unable to support users' activities entirely, especially those related with cognition and collaboration aspects. We argue that the use of a combination cognitive and observation techniques can contribute to enhance the requirements elicitation activity, particularly if a collaborative approach is also adopted. This paper describes a collaborative observation model and a collaborative observation method aimed at improving the quality of the requirements elicitation process. We also include the description of a groupware prototype that supports our approach.	requirement;requirements elicitation;system requirements	Renata Guanaes Machado;Marcos R. S.

Firms engaged in open innovation leverage external knowledge to accelerate innovation and exploit innovation more effectively. One way in which firms can connect with external sources of knowledge is by participating in value networks with a multitude of external stakeholders. Nevertheless, there are few studies of open innovation value networks, with relatively little known about the characteristics that impact such networks. We seek to address this gap by exploring the networking arrangements of eight European firms that have a formal strategy around open source software (OSS). The findings reveal that firms selectively engage in two types of value networks in order to benefit from open collaboration and innovation – one a high-density network comprising a limited number of familiar partners, the other a low-density network comprising a larger number of often unknown partners. Additionally, these networks are influenced by certain characteristics such as the level of commitment, knowledge exchange, the alignment of objectives and		Lorraine Morgan;Joseph Feller;Patrick Finnegan	2012			public relations;product innovation;economics;knowledge management;marketing;open innovation;management	Web+IR	-77.24797357246499	5.156849241420877	140221
9c96e2a308549a6197eff85faeed90576ed26f95	a pattern for structuring the information system architecture -introducing an ea framework for organizing tasks		Enterprise Architecture (EA) is an approach which aims to align IT and business strategy to help organizations invest wisely in IT and make the most of their current IT facilities. In fact, EA is a conceptual framework which defines the structure of an enterprise, its components and their relationships. It is considered to be a massive and also complicated job which if proper methods and approaches are not used, a huge amount of chaos and overheads will be caused. This paper aims to introduce a structure for organizing EA tasks. This structure provides guidelines on how to organize and document business ser- vices. Therefore, a more organized EA process will be carried out and both time and effort are saved. A case study is used to elaborate and explain the structure accompanied by the evaluation and discussion.	enterprise architecture framework;information system;organizing (structure)	Shokoofeh Ketabchi;Navid Karimi Sani;Kecheng Liu	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22191-0_24	computer science;engineering;knowledge management;software engineering;management	Robotics	-72.7826138551383	9.910367576360942	140806

Abstractionists make much use of formal models, such as goal dependency networks. An alternative design philosophy is contextualism, according to which the particularities of the context of use of a system must be understood in detail before the requirements can be derived. Contextualists use qualitative methods to uncover and help interpret these particularities. In this paper, we analyze what it would mean to combine the best features of abstractionism and contextualism, and we ground our discussion in an illustration of abstractionist and contextualist thinking about RE through goal refinement (GR). In the context of the domain of meeting scheduling, we contrast a wholly abstractionist approach to GR with one that incorporates data gathered using two ethnographic methods. In doing so, we consider each step of the abstractionist approach, illustrating where ethnographic data obtained in our work environment affects the model produced. As we proceed, we summarize the general lessons learned. We then discuss how other abstractionist and contextualist methods could be integrated.	requirements engineering	Colin Potts;Idris Hsi	1997	Ann.

be999213ca68831148c9a32c362eb507851d9158	rfid application in waste monitoring management of electronic products		The increasing awareness of environment protection had made the European Union request the enterprises, through legislation (such as WEEE, RoHS and EuP), to take the responsibility to minimize the environmental impact. Directive of WEEE stresses that producers are responsible for the collection and recycling of all electrical and electronic waste. This paper focuses on how manufacturers can meet WEEE through reducing, re-generating, and recycling the waste materials, what benefits can be gained during the process of RFID monitoring, and what regulations are required for the suppliers and recycling merchants on the environmental protection issues in performing and achieving the Green Management Policy or System. This study examines the current recycling methods, the merchants’ recycling operation procedures as well as the functions of RFID applied into the operation procedures. The efficiency of recycles tracing and monitoring further be discussed based on supply chain forward/reverse checking theory. We used Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram to explain how to simplify production procedures, consignment procedures, stocking procedures, and recycling procedures. We concluded three major findings: (1) The RFID technique could provide one of the best choices for the recycling procedure. (2) Manufacturers, government, and recycling merchants are all benefited from the lead-in of RFID technique into the operation procedures. (3) The establishment of WEEE monitoring procedures helps the enterprises to reappraise and reinforce their management skills that in return strengthen their competence.	diagram;directive (programming);electronic waste;radio-frequency identification;unified modeling language	Ling-Lang Tang;Ming-Tsang Lu;Wei-Chin Hung	2008	IJEBM		engineering;operations management;waste management;commerce	HCI	-63.366310418193	9.550882326945953	141227

In this paper, we propose a network-based method to analyze change impact. By defining interconnections among parts, we build a directed weighted complex product network model to represent the product structure under given requirements. Then, we discuss two requirement change cases and develop corresponding modification policies. To specify indirect impacts, we propose a change propagation searching model in light of Matthew Effect theory. To measure the degree of change impacts, we propose two criteria (network variation scale and extra network change cost), both of which can provide a systemic assessment of impacts. Finally, a case of clutch is presented to illustrate the proposed approach. The results can provide way of measuring overall change impacts on the product, which can support decision-makers to respond that the change request can be fulfilled or not.

During the user requirements elicitation processes, stakeholders who have different backgrounds, view points and understandings, need to clarify, capture and uncover user requirements in an efficient and effective manner. Many industry experts have admitted that collaboration among stakeholders in a facilitated workshop, aimed at defining and articulating user requirements, is one of the most difficult tasks in software development. In this research we present a collaborative process for user requirements elicitation. We used the principles of the Collaboration Engineering (CE) to design the process, which consists of Think Lets, as process building blocks. We designed the process to predictably guide the stakeholders through decision-making processes in a collaborative manner. The process is evaluated in a case-study within an industrial IT firm in China.	requirement;requirements elicitation;software development	Aida Azadegan;Xusen Cheng;Fred Niederman;Guopeng Yin	2013	2013 46th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2013.136	requirements analysis;requirements management;interview;facilitation;computer science;knowledge management;requirement;software engineering;requirements elicitation;formal specification;management;collaboration	SE	-66.38923252493598	17.72339940474805	141787

Three stages of evolution are described. In the first stage, a Gantt chart sequencing tool was converted to a scheduler’s information system. This change was driven by the need to support the scheduler’s daily task. The second stage of evolution was caused by an MRP–ERP conversion. The integration and conversion increased overhead and complexity in the job task and hence the tool, including the transformation of the previously integrated dispatching/scheduling task into separate dispatching and scheduling activities. The third stage of evolution has been small continuous improvements driven by management reporting requirements. PPS was developed in 1996 and has been fully operational since January 1997. Two major insights are discussed in this paper: the implications of supporting the scheduling task versus work sequence generation, and the software design requirements for evolutionary change as the software is used in an ever-changing situation. # 2007 Elsevier B.V.

That path led to the creation of the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), or Orange Book. The TCSEC placed great emphasis on requirements for mandatory security controls and high assurance, and the resulting TCSEC evaluation process was time-consuming and costly for commercial vendors and emphasized product features not valued by customers. As a result, vendor commitment to evaluations waned. The TCSEC was eventually supplanted by the international Common Criteria, which after almost 15 years, have moved to a model based on more straightforward requirements and a more deterministic evaluation process.	common criteria;computer security;linc;requirement;security controls;tracing (software);trusted computer system evaluation criteria	Steven B.

We structure this exploratory research according to the steps of the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISPDM) process. Firstly, we interview 22 experts to determine the information needs in long-term care which we, secondly, translate into 25 data mining goals. Thirdly, we perform a single case study at a Dutch long-term care institution with around 850 clients in five locations. We analyze the institution’s database which contains information from April 2008 to April 2012 to identify patterns in incident information, patterns in risk assessment information, the relationship between risk assessments and incident information, patterns in the average duration of stay, and we identify and predict Care Intensity Package (ZZP) combinations. Fourth and finally, we position all data mining goals in a two-bytwo matrix to visualize the relative importance of each goal in relation to both quality of care and financial state of care institutions.	cross industry standard process for data mining;information needs;risk assessment	Marco R.

The model is based on the similarities between the concepts of departments in large organisations and the object-oriented computer paradigm. It is a high-level model that takes a holistic view of information privacy risk management, and, as such, identifies risk in both manual and automated processes during the acquisition, processing, storage and dissemination of information. While conceptual in nature, the model is well suited to practical implementation due to the structure it derives from the object-oriented paradigm. The practical application of the model is demonstrated by way of an example scenario. This paper contributes by addressing the absence in the literature of freely available models for the holistic management information privacy risk in large organisations.	high- and low-level;holism;holistic management (agriculture);information privacy;interpro;management information system;norm (social);programming paradigm;prototype;risk management	Kamil Reddy;Hein S.

a20366215ae1519f79872ecdbb8aa3bc7de8a5ba	improving returnable transport equipment management with an autonomous approach		Challenges of returnable transport equipment (RTE) management continue to heighten as the popularity of their usage magnifies. Logistics companies are investigating the implementation of radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology to alleviate problems such as loss prevention and stock reduction. However, the research within this field is limited and fails to fully explore with depth, the wider network improvements that can be made to optimize the supply chain through efficient RTE management. This paper, investigates the nature of RTE network management building on current research and practices, filling a gap in the literature, through the investigation of a product-centric approach where the paradigms of “intelligent products” and “autonomous objects” are explored. A network optimizing approach with RTE management is explored, encouraging advanced research development of the RTE paradigm to align academic research with problematic areas in industry. Further research continues with the development of an agent-based software system, ready for application to a real-case study distribution network, producing quantitative results for further analysis. This is pivotal on the endeavor to developing agile support systems, fully utilizing an information-centric environment and encouraging RTE to be viewed as critical network optimizing tools rather than costly waste.

de9e175a6b989302ae3b35049b98a29e1efef188	modeling and simulation of cooperation and learning in cyber security defense teams		Cyber security analysts may be organized in teams to share skills and support each other upon the occurrence of cyber attacks. Team work is expected to enforce the mitigation capability against unpredictable attacks addressed against a set of cyber assets requiring protection. A conceptual model for evaluating the expected performances of cooperating analysts by reproducing their learning process within a team is proposed. Analytical approaches to solve the underlying state-space model under stochastic evolution and discrete-event simulation are both discussed. The basic assumption is that a set of regeneration points corresponds to skill achievement through learning. A Simulation-based Optimization (SO) tool ranging from the inner level modeling of the cooperation-based learning process to the outer assignment of analysts to assets is then presented. Team formation may be supported by the SO tool for obtaining the team composition, in terms of individuals and skills, that maximizes system performance measures.

The reason is that current project management systems mainly support the ongoing project phase and do not explicitly consider the initiating and closing phase of a project management life cycle. By implementing semantic technologies within an existing open source project management system, these weaknesses can be improved. This system incorporates and links historical project knowledge that contributes to a more effective setup of upcoming projects. To design, develop and implement such a system we conducted interviews with IT companies regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the project management systems in use. On the basis of the interviews we identified three scenarios, which deal with the most common problems of project management, such as consistent data storage and how to retrieve information. These scenarios, described in this paper, are used as requirements and to evaluate the designed prototype.	closing (morphology);computer data storage;interviews;open-source software;prototype;requirement	Birgit Dippelreiter;Michael Pöttler	2011	J.

63ad7749c8a0180ce963e2e19d5a6b76ce518256	railway system failure scenario analysis		Cyber security has emerged as an important issue for urban railway systems (URS) due to the increasing usage of information and communication technologies (ICT). As a safety-critical public infrastructure with complex, interconnected, and often legacy systems, URS pose challenges for stakeholders seeking to understand cyber threats and their impact, and prioritize investments and hardening efforts. However, other critical infrastructure industries such as the energy sector offer best practices, risk assessment methodologies, and tools that may be both useful and transferable to the railway domain. In this work we consider one successful security initiative from the energy sector in North America, the development of common failure scenarios and impact analysis (NESCOR failure scenarios), and assess their applicability and utility in URS. We use a publicly-available software tool that supports failure scenario analysis to assess example failures on railway supervisory control systems and identify directions for further improving railway failure scenario analysis.	best practice;control system;legacy system;programming tool;risk assessment;scenario analysis;threat (computer)	William G.

In these complex and networked settings, they define partnerships to complement each other’s features, acquire new skills, divide R&D costs and share customers. Such business model entails mutual dependence on companies for survival and effectiveness. It creates a flow of influence among them and makes the ecosystem resemble power-law distributions. Drawing on established concepts from Social and Behavioural Sciences, we performed an exploratory case study of six software companies to investigate their power-dependence relationships in an ecosystem environment. A prime result of this research is showing that it is possible to understand how power and dependence influence the behaviour and coordination of partner firms within a software ecosystem.	software ecosystem	George Valença;Carina Frota Alves;Slinger Jansen	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-49094-6_5	systems engineering;environmental resource management;marketing;social software engineering;power;software asset management	SE	-76.74563810281086	5.814941572649527	144203

The aim of this research is to explore and prioritise the challenges of Business Process Change (BPC) in Enterprise Systems Integrations (ESI) specifically focusing on two approaches that are Business Process Reengineering (BPR) and Business Process Modelling (BPMo), as well as identify the solutions for them. Literature review is carried out in order to explore and understand the BPC challenges of systems integration in BPR and BPMo perspectives. Secondly, a questionnaire is deployed to gather various industrial and academic views and compare these with findings from the literature. Then, BPC challenges are prioritised, and relevant solutions are recommended to address those challenges. The main finding of this research represents “minimising human Issues” as the most important BPC challenge in both areas of BPR and BPMo in ESI and the solutions such as top-down management and people involvement are proposed to address it.	business process;code refactoring;enterprise system;failure rate;imperative programming;system integration;systems architecture;top-down and bottom-up design;wired for management	Vahid Javidroozi;Ardavan Amini;Adrian Cole;Hanifa Shah	2014		10.5220/0004865201280135	artifact-centric business process model;process modeling;process management;management;business process modeling	DB	-73.15903026140073	10.012405706936374	144375
8ce5994437b671096842b6ece7a57c7f3092ad8f	optimal adaptation process of emergency medical services systems in a changing environment		Quality of emergency medical services (EMS) depends on the EMS infrastructure which is subject to exogenous conditions, like the considered demand area. Demographic changes, increased traffic volume, and structural modifications in the urban infrastructure lead to permanent changes in the demand area. To provide high EMS quality in a strategic perspective, an adaptive planning system to consider these future environmental changes is necessary. An anticipatory adaptation process based on the existing EMS infrastructure and anticipating future developments has to be determined. Assessment criteria of an adaptation process include (1) EMS quality, (2) periodic operating costs, and (3) system adaptation costs. A linear multi-criteria program is developed to support EMS decision makers to dynamically improve an existing EMS infrastructure with respect to multiple requirements during a strategic time horizon.

Among different kinds of operating costs, lowering manufacturing cost brings the most significant effect. Among different manufacturing processes, not only the correctness and efficiency during producing products, but also those losses and expenses result from critical exception of product quality should be considered. The paper proposes a PDCA-based system for handling exception management process after critical exceptional events occurred. By facilitating managers to convene Material Review Board (MRB) meeting of critical exceptions, to manage and trace actions, and to constructing exception handling knowledge base, recurrence rate can be decreased after the efficiency of exception handling process is enhanced. Moreover, with completely recorded losses and costs, managers can manage enterprise resources in a more efficient way.	correctness (computer science);error-tolerant design;event (computing);exception handling;knowledge base;management system;review board;semiconductor industry	Stefanie Angerer;Rob Pooley;Ruth Aylett	2010	2010 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/SASO.2010.43	mobile robot;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;natural language	HPC	-64.53796615921752	12.5484952630465	144624

In a high-tech business-to-business environment with demanding lead customers, innovation is driven by customer intimacy. In a fast-moving business-to-consumer environment, a combination of consumer marketing intelligence and technology is required, captured in a clear process to meet the critical time-to-market requirements. Innovation outside the existing business scope of the regular Philips divisions is handled separately. The role of Philips Applied Technologies (Apptech) is described, including competencies and processes. The central questions addressed in this paper are: ‘Which innovation models are being used by Philips?’ and ‘What is the role of Apptech in the innovation processes and how does Apptech effectuate its role?’ An open approach is evolving wherein innovation is performed in international networks of partners in new markets and with complementary skills. Assuming the task of integrator in such a network, entrepreneurs and lead customers complete the current technical and process-oriented capabilities of Apptech.	care-of address;customer relationship management;hyperlink;orchestration (computing);requirement	John van den Elst;Ronald Tol;Ruud Smits	2006	IJTM	10.1504/IJTM.2006.009456	innovation;product innovation;economics;innovation management;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;open innovation;management;information technology	SE	-74.80684862506455	5.658319132433453	144944

The inquiry addressed practitioners engaged in “steady-state” type problems and the outcomes reveal that simulation practice is more strongly influenced by user judgement than formal disciplines. This may, with experienced simulation specialists, lead to correct run control and results interpretation but, with non-specialists, there is higher risk. Particular areas of concern are identified and the study also considers further support that simulation software might bring to the experimentation process.	simulation	Brian W. Hollocks	2001	Simul.

In-depth determination of stakeholder needs entails analysis of their intentions; the overall aim of the work reported in this article is to establish a framework of intentional analysis, and its associated methods and techniques for improving traceability of design practice during the early phases of the design process. The specific aim of this article is to present a conceptual framework for design rationale systems. The framework built upon the cross-fertilization of approaches and methods drawn from systems engineering and philosophy, focussing on the notions of antecedence and consequence. It was developed in the course of tackling design problems originating in industrial contexts. The methods developed were thus evaluated, updated, and refined in real applications. Two application cases are described that have been drawn from the aerospace and power sectors, respectively. The applications showed that the framework's central antecedent/consequent scheme provides a cell from which to develop either a history of actual successive changes, or a tree of alternative possible projected designs.	design rationale	Vassilis Agouridas;Peter Simons	2008	AI EDAM	10.1017/S0890060408000255	reliability engineering;traceability;requirements management;idef6;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;ontology;management science;scenario analysis;design rationale	AI	-63.97832192100086	17.353905678866276	145278

This trend has been even more evident in some regions where the preservation of natural resources is of utmost importance, not only from an environmental perspective, but also from an economic one. In this context, technology has become one of the key factors to achieve sustainability goals. An example of these technologies are Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) which are being used more and more with sustainability purposes. However, although some efforts have been made to propose software approaches to model sustainability, some examples that model the impact of technology on sustainability are still needed. This paper presents an instance of a sustainability metamodel for the UAVs domain. This model allows to specify the impact of UAV-based processes on sustainability, and also to identify potential limitations that may hinder its applicability. Finally, the paper provides some suggestions to complete the metamodel based on the instantiation process.	aerial photography;approximation algorithm;case preservation;electronic commerce regulations 2002;interaction;metamodeling;universal instantiation;unmanned aerial vehicle	José María Conejero;Isabel Sofia Brito;Ana Moreira;Jácome Cunha;João Araújo	2016	2016 IEEE 24th International Requirements Engineering Conference Workshops (REW)	10.1109/REW.2016.044	sustainability organizations;systems engineering;engineering;environmental resource management;management science	SE	-68.05516856696403	11.285175324511068	145313
579a57ffaa8ce126fe2d01ec1e58ec38cf888668	context-specific intellectual capital - the next link in the knowledge chain	intellectual capital;project planning	"""Intellectual capital reuse and sharing in the specialized domain of project planning and execution are the focus of this paper. The key expansion beyond ordinary intellectual capital is pairing a context-specific intellectual capital structure with a matching context-specific intellectual capital management process. Beyond the fundamentals of gathering, archiving, indexing, and subsequently retrieving the appropriate intellectual capital, we explore both the context-specific structure and the related context-specific process specifically tailored to project planning and project execution. This tailored structure and process allow intellectual capital from multiple, different projects to be artfully blended, combined, and shared among multiple organizations and project teams. Traditionally, the two approaches to managing projects are: task-oriented and output-oriented. In the task-oriented approach, a work breakdown structure defines the phases, activities, and tasks that must be accomplished. In contrast, an output-oriented approach focuses on the work products that need to be created during the project. In this paper, we present a work-product-dominant approach that links to matching work breakdown structures. This primacy of outputs rather than tasks is orthogonal to many conventional approaches for process definition , but lends itself well to a robust intellectual capital (IC) management approach. The author's experience with context-specific intellectual capital (CSIC) is primarily with developing IC for software development and maintenance projects, most recently within the IBM Global Services Method. However, the approach described in this paper is applicable to a wide range of process-oriented and project-oriented endeavors. This paper first presents the structure of IC, defining terms and providing an example from software development and maintenance. It next reviews how a project manager might use CSIC during project planning. Having defined CSIC and shown how it is used, the paper then defines and examines the four elements of the CSIC Engagement Model Lifecycle: authoring, project preparation, project execution, and experience harvesting. After discussing these four elements, an organizational """" superstructure """" for managing CSIC is described. To evaluate the potential effectiveness of CSIC, the reasons why projects fail are discussed and the result is related to CSIC use as a mitigator. Finally, additional observations and conclusions are given. This paper is based on experience and is not intended to be a research paper. Skills-based approach. Skills imply the capacity for action toward some application. As such, much IC is prescriptive and attempts to supplement individual skills to achieve a solution or solve a problem. In organizations, IC may also focus on …"""	archive;automated planning and scheduling;input/output;key stretching;primacy of mind;software development;work breakdown structure	Carl Singer	2003	IBM Systems Journal	10.1147/sj.423.0446	individual capital;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;management;project planning	SE	-68.41832460469152	13.804339197891567	145646

The Artefact, the result of a program which engineered and combined three methodologies, is developed on the basis of an emerging concept since 2009 and recently (in 2016) implemented in several information systems. Because of the availability of several implementations of the artefact, a post evaluation based on hypothesis testing of the real artefacts is a feasible and necessary next research step, on which will we elaborate in this paper. Rather than a research question, three hypotheses are proposed in this research.	agile software development	Klaas Meijer;Maurice Nijssen;John Bulles	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-73805-5_22	systems engineering;implementation;information system;statistical hypothesis testing;design science research;agile software development;enterprise architecture;research question;computer science	EDA	-69.10422500336826	16.04580624312894	145672

Privacy metrics are defined by both parties with boundary values on each feature. Their distribution is relying on stress distributions used in this field .The use of service level agreements also casts privacy management into a business perspective with benefits and costs to either party in a process. This approach is especially relevant for communications operators as brokers and communication channels between content owners (individuals, businesses) and enterprise applications ; in this context, the privacy SLA management would be carried out by the operator, while the terms and conditions of the SLA negotiation reside with the individual and information gatherers .This work was carried out as part of the large EU project PRIME www.prime.project.eu.org on privacy enhancing technologies.	business process;enterprise software;internet privacy;privacy-enhancing technologies;service-level agreement	Louis-François Pau	2008	NOMS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium	10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575200	privacy software;privacy policy;information privacy;privacy by design;computer science;knowledge management;telecommunications service;business process;business communication;management;privacy;computer security;computer network;channel	DB	-73.48730095206301	15.725262783259627	145888

Enterprise architecture and analytical methods are helpful in selecting the most appropriate technology to ensure the right balance among strategic, development and usage considerations. This paper elaborates a mathematical model for evaluation of alternative solutions for implementation of analytical reports requested by users of enterprise applications. The alternative solutions are selected to minimize development and maintenance costs in accordance with enterprise architecture evolution principles such as centralization of common functionality and promotion of reuse. The enterprise architecture also provides input data necessary to run the model. Application of the model is demonstrated using an illustrative example highlighting some of the trade-offs faced by enterprises and systems architects. The model is intended as a decision-making guide during enterprise architecture change management.	enterprise architecture;enterprise software;mathematical model	Janis Grabis;Ruta Pirta	2017	2017 IEEE 21st International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Workshop (EDOCW)	10.1109/EDOCW.2017.21	data mining;enterprise life cycle;systems engineering;enterprise architecture framework;functional software architecture;enterprise architecture;management science;enterprise architecture management;computer science;solution architecture;architecture domain;enterprise integration	DB	-72.025785332431	10.525179087608672	146083

To define new business models, the enterprises are required to progress their applications and integrate them in one homogeny information system. In this field, the integration of existing applications (especially legacy systems) with the new ones presents a complex challenge. In Algeria, many of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) and administrative organizations use home developed software to progress their Information Systems. For this reason, the source codes of several legacy applications are generally available, which becomes the reuse of these applications easier and more possible. However, the main problem is related to the techniques and methods that can be used for integrating the existing applications in the new view of the information system. In this context, the most current architectural model is SOA (Services Oriented Architecture, where Web services present the main important technology to develop novel Web Information Systems.

Almost states that their employees use few different channels and applications for communication every day. However, the paradox is that more tools do not imply more effective collaboration. Besides, the Unified Communications and Collaboration (UCC) concept enables people to use the most appropriate communication medium for the task to be done and to switch channels as necessary. The value of unified communications lies in the integration of previously separate communications channels into one seamless platform. This is, however, also where the most challenges lie. To do this in practice, organizations need to integrate diverse systems and technologies. As a possible solution, an efficient business model of the migration towards UCC and its architectural realization Next Generation Network is needed.

This contribution presents a method, which enables scalability for satisfied communication in business organizations. This method has been applied in practice and further evaluated by two IT-companies, which operate globally in the field of Web Engineering, E-Commerce and Usability. In the course of the evaluation for a one-month period, personnel were introduced to a checklist, which is specially designed for capturing communication dissatisfaction. The findings within these two companies are alarming in several respects. Many communication channels, which personnel choose by default, are inadequate and thus unacceptable for them and for the respective communication partners.	e-commerce;scalability;usability;web engineering	Eldar Sultanow;Edzard Weber;Robert Lembcke	2010			communications management;management science	DB	-72.02002859506118	15.331820386109788	147442
04c31ec0103ed57212c3e9562a3cc903198482e8	a design approach for process-based knowledge management systems		PurposernrnrnrnrnThis paper presents a design approach for process-based knowledge management (PKM) systems that can support knowledge-intensive processes where effective task execution is highly reliant on the knowledge and expertise of participants executing the tasks. The proposed design approach includes design methods and kernel theories governing the design of PKM systems and can also be easily integrated with existing systems analysis and design techniques.rnrnrnrnrnDesign/methodology/approachrnrnrnrnrnThe design science research methodology is used to design and develop the artifact which includes the overall PKM design approach. Information systems design theory is used as a high-level framework to develop and structure the design approach. Relevant design methods and behavioral theories are reviewed to identify kernel theories that guide the design and development of PKM systems. The design approach consists of meta-requirements for PKM systems and design processes to achieve the meta-requirements. A feasibility study is conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnThe design approach presented in this paper can guide system analysts and system developers in the design of knowledge management systems for supporting knowledge-intensive processes. The paper also includes a comprehensive design theory for PKM systems consisting of meta-requirements and a synthesis of various kernel theories into actionable design procedures. The proposed procedures include knowledge requirements modeling, knowledge flows modeling and knowledge and process performance modeling procedures. The feasibility study indicates that the PKM approach can be more useful and effective than solely using unified modeling language (UML)-based systems analysis and design techniques for the design of PKM systems.rnrnrnrnrnResearch limitations/implicationsrnrnrnrnrnAn implication to information systems design research is the feasibility of developing a specialized design approach that incorporates significant domain knowledge to solve complex information system design problems. An implication to practice is the significant potential to improve productivity and effectiveness of systems analysts and designers in developing PKM systems. A limitation is the small sample size of the feasibility study used to evaluate the ease of use and utility of the design approach.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnThe study makes a unique contribution by proposing a design approach that integrates business process and knowledge management considerations. The approach is particularly valuable because of the focus on integration with existing systems analysis and design techniques, thus allowing for easier adoption.	knowledge management	Surendra Sarnikar;Amit V.

A thorough requirements elicitation will take into considerations the objectives and needs of all the actors involved. It is therefore important for an analyst to have conceptual instruments that support their identification, taking into account the different components of a Web site. In this paper we propose the application of a quality model the 2QCV3Q meta-model to the activities related to the requirements engineering process. To illustrate this we describe the requirements analysis for an ONLUS organisation called """"No Pain for Children"""", a nonprofit association for promotion of analgesic treatment. Developed to evaluate the quality of existing Web sites, the meta-model proved to be a useful tool also in gathering and negotiating the requirements. In particular, it was possible to highlight from its conception the priorities of the newly founded association and also the potential areas of conflict between the objectives of the association (and its promoters) and the needs of the doctors and families involved with it."""	best practice;hoc (programming language);iteration;iterative and incremental development;metamodeling;programming tool;requirement;requirements analysis;requirements elicitation;requirements engineering;software system;usability;virtual community;web application;world wide web	Luisa Mich;Mariangela Franch;G.

We report on a new kind of ecosystem around extensions to open source business applications, and examine the types of contributors and contributions relative to previous open source research. Our results show a surprising presence of small businesses, particularly consultants and freelance developers. These smaller firms bridge an important gap between lead users and producers, contributing disproportionately to new back-end and integration features.

As a result, the supply chain network (SCN) performance has become a driver of a firms' competitive ability. The different dimensions of complexity challenge MFs while designing their SCN for a certain product. The supplier selection is an essential activity of this design process. Methods for the supplier selection provided by literature are challenged by this complexity as well as a consideration of the collective behavior of suppliers in SCNs. As a result, this paper presents a system model as basis for the conducted method for supplier selection in SCNs. The method features three domains that describe a three dimensional model for the supplier selection, which consists of three individual but interlinked sets of matrices depending on the perspective on the selection process.	3d modeling;distributed manufacturing;outsourcing;supply chain network	Florian G.

Many publications and standards claim that approaches like Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) and Automatically Switched Optical Networks/Transport Networks (ASON/ASTN) will simplify network operation and will enable new services. In this paper, an approach is presented to analyze the business processes of transport network operators. The main operator processes are mapped to the well-known value chain concepts of Porter. This allows investigating the advantages of control plane technologies from an economic point of view. This paper shows that the introduction of control plane technology affects the business of the individual operators as well as the overall value system they form as a virtual enterprise.

Our contribution is a participatory development model called the Activity Driven ISD Model, aimed at developing work and information systems in parallel, in three phases: understanding the present state of an activity; describing the goal state of the activity; and planning for the transformation to the goal state. #N#Conclusion. The ActAD framework and the Activity Driven ISD Model meet six of the seven criteria set. The seventh requirement will be satisfied after the finalisation of the model.

7f136c02a397652ffe418a130f2ee407db65d36a	data quality problems in tpc-di based data integration processes		Many data driven organisations need to integrate data from multiple, distributed and heterogeneous resources for advanced data analysis. A data integration system is an essential component to collect data into a data warehouse or other data analytics systems. There are various alternatives of data integration systems which are created inhouse or provided by vendors. Hence, it is necessary for an organisation to compare and benchmark them when choosing a suitable one to meet its requirements. Recently, the TPC-DI is proposed as the first industrial benchmark for evaluating data integration systems. When using this benchmark, we find some typical data quality problems in the TPCDI data source such as multi-meaning attributes and inconsistent data schemas, which could delay or even fail the data integration process. This paper explains processes of this benchmark and summarises typical data quality problems identified in the TPC-DI data source. Furthermore, in order to prevent data quality problems and proactively manage data quality, we propose a set of practical guidelines for researchers and practitioners to conduct data quality management when using the TPC-DI benchmark.

Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is frequently perceived as overly wordy and bureaucratic while Agile and Lean methodologies are often positioned as a rejection of heavy handed process and governance. But IT Service Management, Agile, and Lean are all focused on the same thing: How to get valuable work done quickly and efficiently in the complex world of IT in order to enable a business’s competitive edge. Delivering IT solutions at the speed-of-business while maintaining quality, performance and availability of the Live Environment is a constant balancing act among simultaneous constraints. ITIL, Agile and Lean all contain best-practices to define and manage these constraints and the contexts in which they exist. The authors will compare and contrast the core of these methodologies to show how they align with the goal of providing a roadmap for successful implementation and coexistence.

This research contributes to extend Business Process Management (BPM) systems with resilience support. We applied concepts derived from resilience engineering and the study of hazards in highly reliable organizations to characterize resilient BPM. We developed a resilience framework based on two criteria, control, which may be prescriptive, mixed or discretionary, and response, considering planned and nonplanned actions. We review and classify techniques developed in the BPM field dealing with various types of hazards. Three out of five categories involve humans in various ways. A special focus is given to discretionary/unplanned human interventions. We developed a set of services integrating resilience support in BPM systems, including detection, diagnosis, recovery and escalation. One important feature associated with the diagnosis service is handling the dynamic trajectory of hazards. Another fundamental feature provided by the escalation service is involving different operators in the collaborative activities necessary to overcome more complex hazards. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We still expect people to intervene when things go wrong, however, and to diagnose and fix the problems. Aviation has a history of developing systems with a very good safety record. Domains such as high frequency trading (HFT), however, have a much more chequered history. We note that there are several parallels that can be drawn between aviation and HFT. We highlight the ironies of automation that apply to HFT, before going on to identify several lessons that have been used to improve safety in aviation and show how they can be applied to increase the resilience of HFT in particular.	complexity;high-frequency trading;parallels desktop for mac;system of systems	Gordon D.

The PPVC is the latest thinking in the field of Performance Measurement developed by the Centre for Business Performance, Cranfield School of Management. It provides a systemic process for using data to enhance decision-making, bringing together a vast array of tools to extract value from data and focus efforts on what will add real value to the organisation. Organisations, today have access to almost unlimited amounts of data – sales, demographics, economic trends, competitive data, consumer behaviour, efficiency measures, financial calculations, etc. However, many decision makers in organisations feel lost and perplexed. They have mountains of data and still find it difficult to make the appropriate decisions, or understand where they really are. Managers, today complain of “drowning in data while thirsting for information”. Organisations seem to be generating data at a much faster rate than any manager can master, and in parallel to that, the useful life of that data is collapsing. Moreover, performance measurement as a whole is becoming more and more costly. This phenomenon of drowning in data is having a profound effect on the way, boards manage their meetings. The volume and variety of transactions within today’s organisations mean that the board/executive team could easily get engrossed in incredibly detailed reviews of operational performance at their meetings. While interesting in themselves, such detailed reviews might overlook the strategic content. Executives world-wide are clearly recognising this issue and some are beginning to question whether the structure and focus of their performance reviews is appropriate for their business. The problem has never been lack of useful tools or proven techniques. Most tools for data analysis, interpretation, and visualisation have been around for many years. Neither was the problem any lack of capable IT or business systems to deploy these tools. In the year 2000, World Research Inc.[1] estimated that the “business intelligence and data warehousing” tools and services market was growing at an average of more than 50% and was estimated to reach $113 billion by 2002”. The problem stems from how these tools are used, their sequence, interaction, and what organisations do with the output. Today, more than ever, to succeed in multi-channel, high-speed environments, organisations need to leverage the data they have at their disposal. The performance planning value chain (PPVC) aims to facilitate that process. The PPVC is the latest thinking in the field of Performance Measurement developed by the Centre for Business Performance, Cranfield School of Management.

5eda7f2d022fc69348a8aa164cb0f5c0bedee275	analyzing the taxonomy of internet business models using graphs	business model;graph theory	Not only did the World Wide Web expedite the arrival of the information age in the last decade, it had also inspired a business revolution. Internet business, despite its infancy, has bred an unprecedented number of creative Internet business models (IBMs). Given that there are many creative models, there still lacks a universal well-defined IBM taxonomy. It is a tremendous challenge to create a universal taxonomy for these business models. Not only one has to face the babble of different existing models, one also has to address the evolving nature of Internet business. Hence, the imminent question is simply: Is it possible to construct a universal business model that could explain the existence of all of the current models and prescribe the evolving nature of Internet business models? In this paper, we propose that a simple scheme based on Euleru0027s graph, a discrete mathematical tool that can be used effectively to study existing Internet business models and their classification schemes. It is also used to accommodate evolving IBMs. Such a systematic and analytical scheme based on graph theory might then assist in the discovery of a unified taxonomy for Internet business models.	dot-com company;internet	Chiou-Pirng Wang;KwaiChow Chan	2003	First Monday		business model;simulation;business domain;computer science;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;graph theory;business case;management science;business process model and notation;business software;business process discovery;business rule;new business development;world wide web;business process modeling;business architecture	ML	-74.20353629311799	9.09810797827005	148818
17be81b6912593f87969fc1e48e49fdbfcdf66c0	the more, the merrier?: the interaction of critical success factors in business intelligence implementations		"""Business intelligence (BI) is a term that refers to a variety of techniques and software applications used to analyze an organization’s raw data. Companies use BI to improve decision-making, identify opportunities, and cut cost. However, implementing a BI system is challenging. Critical success factors (CSFs) are necessary elements for a project to succeed. The aim of this article is to identify critical CSFs and find possible interrelationships. Using a framework of CSF constructs, the authors conducted a qualitative case study at Norway Post, a large company that successfully implemented a BI system. This research offers three contributions. The first is identifying ten CSFs for a BI implementation, and the second is a ranked list of these CSFs. The third is the CSFs interrelationship model, which may be the most exciting result for BI practitioners. Knowing which factors to fulfill and how they interrelate will increase the chances of achieving a successful BI implementation.

Despite this fact, over the past years thousands of companies have implemented BI systems, because BI is a key ingredient for gaining competitive advantage (Gartner, 2007). Many factors can influence a BI implementation; thus, it is important to study and find these factors so that managers and BI practitioners can use them when implementing a BI solution. Critical Success Factors (CSFs) are defined by Rockart (1979) as activities which are necessary to ensure successful competitive performance. There have been a number of studies proposing CSFs, largely for the longerestablished ERP, customer relationship management (CRM), and lately for the newer BI too (Yeoh et al., 2007). Unfortunately, CSFs from ERP cannot directly be used in BI. ERP systems are concerned with arranging large amount of data, while BI is about transforming data to information. This transformation of data into information requires more human involvement in BI than in ERP. The research question for this paper is therefore: Which factors are critical to the implementation of a business intelligence system and how do these factors interact? This article begins with reviewing relevant literature, and presenting the case company and framework. We then present our findings and discuss them, and point to some limitations, before we propose the conclusion. BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE In the business environment, several factors put pressure on organizations. Examples are globalization, consumer demands, legislation and regulation, and markets and competition. This also gives opportunities for companies such as new strategies, collaboration, agility, increased productivity, new vendors, and new business models. Nevertheless, managers need the right information at the right time and in the right place (Turban, Sharda, Aronson, & King, 2008). To this end, BI can provide analysis, decision support and predictions. Concept and Objectives The concept of BI appeared for the first time in Hans Peter Luhn’s article “A Business Intelligence System” from 1958, where it was initially a term for data analysis tools. Today, BI is a broad category of applications and technologies for gathering, storing, analyzing, sharing and providing access to data to help enterprise users make better decisions. The major objectives of BI target the transformation of data into information, then into knowledge, and finally to decisions. Knowledge is typically obtained about customer needs, customer decision-making processes, the competition, conditions in the industry, and general economic, technological, and cultural trends (Turban et al., 2008). According to Wixom and Watson (2007), there are two main processes: the first is getting data in (data warehousing), and the second is getting data out (Business Intelligence). Furthermore, this can be separated into key components such as technologies for getting data in (extract, transform, and load tools), storing data (data warehouses and data marts) and getting data out (ad-hoc queries, reporting), as well as analytics tools (online analytical processing and data mining). A BI system can help users to make better decisions and organizations to identify threats and opportunities, decrease reaction time, increased business performance, cut cost and out-think the competition (Turban et al., 2008). For example, the company studied in this article, Norway Post, achieved an incredible performance boost. Their revenue increased 73% from 2000 to 2006. Profitability went from about -142 million USD in 2000 to +219 million USD in 2006. In addition, customer and employee satisfaction improved substantially (Howson, 2008). 13 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the publisher's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/more-merrier-interaction-critical-"""	bandwagon effect;customer relationship management;data mining;decision support system;erp;enterprise resource planning;hoc (programming language);luhn algorithm;nat friedman;online analytical processing;web page	Wanda Presthus;George Ghinea;Ken-Robin Utvik	2012	IJBIR	10.4018/jbir.2012040103	management science	DB	-73.86567338075547	4.964829345793168	148943
6a9e43c49dd90aebfec11539509cb9fe238e5d2a	how do software ecosystems co-evolve? - a view from openstack and beyond		Much research that analyzes the evolution of a software ecosystem is confined to its own boundaries. Evidence shows, however, that software ecosystems co-evolve independently with other software ecosystems. In other words, understanding the evolution of a software ecosystem requires an especially astute awareness of its competitive landscape and much consideration for other software ecosystems in related markets. A software ecosystem does not evolve in insulation but with other software ecosystems. In this research, we analyzed the OpenStack software ecosystem with a focal perspective that attempted to understand its evolution as a function of other software ecosystems. We attempted to understand and explain the evolution of OpenStack in relation to other software ecosystems in the cloud computing market. Our findings add to theoretical knowledge in software ecosystems by identifying and discussing seven different mechanisms by which software ecosystems mutually influence each other: sedimentation and embeddedness of business relationships, strategic management of the portfolio of business relationships, firms values and reputation as a partner, core technological architecture, design of the APIs, competitive replication of functionality and multi-homing. Research addressing the evolution of software ecosystem should, therefore, acknowledge that software ecosystems entangle with other software ecosystems in multiple ways, even with competing ones. A rigorous analysis of the evolution of a software ecosystem should not be solely confined to its inner boundaries.	academy;big data;blender (software);ecosystem;gephi;icis;information systems research;international network for social network analysis;open collaboration;open-source software;sociotechnical system;software ecosystem;tulip	José Apolinário Teixeira;Sami Hyrynsalmi	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-69191-6_8	strategic management;computer science;systems engineering;architecture;embeddedness;software ecosystem;cloud computing;software;ecosystem;reputation	NLP	-76.90629571056361	5.538011215292794	148946

As providing healthcare increasingly changes from isolated treatment episodes towards a continuous medical process involving multiple healthcare professionals and institutions, there is an obvious need for an information system to support processes and span the whole healthcare network. A suitable architecture for such an information system must take into account that it has to work as an integral part of a complex socio-technical system with changing conditions and requirements. We have surveyed the core requirements of healthcare professionals and analysed the literature for known problems and information needs. We consolidated the results to define use cases for an integrated information system as communication patterns, from which general implications on the required properties of a helathcare network information system could be derived. Key issues are flexibility, adaptability, robustness, integration of existing systems and standards, semantic compatibility, security and process orientation. Based on these results an IT architecture is being designed that is capable of addressing the requirements mostly on the basis of well-established standards and concepts.	floor and ceiling functions;information needs;information system;requirement;robustness (computer science);sociotechnical system	Mario Beyer;Klaus A.

The framework consists of two elements: a model for data and information quality management (CALDEA) and an assessment and improvement methodology (EVAMECAL) which uses CALDEA as a reference. An underlying concept to apply the framework is the Information Management Process (IMP), which allows us to model how data (raw material) is transformed into information (data products). The idea is to identify the IMP, and then, using CALDEA as the reference point, assess and improve the process by applying EVAMECAL.	benchmark (computing);capability maturity model;information management;information quality;interdependence;known-plaintext attack;linear algebra;reference model	Ismael Caballero;Angelica Caro;Mario Piattini;Coral Calero	2005			risk analysis (engineering);information quality;risk management information systems;data management;quality audit;information quality management;quality policy;business	DB	-69.8052549613084	8.024099197964274	149163

In this paper four different companies ranging from OEM to B2B suppliers have been interviewed on how they engage in technology and product development, create and maintain product platforms and how they respond to the changing requirements on the platforms and on the products and product families derived from them. The objective is to find how product platforms are used to meet the demands of efficient product customisation. The companies all have identifiable product platforms and established processes for product development. However, there are differences in how they define technology development, how the platforms are created, maintained, replaced and what the platforms contain. The introduction of new technology into the platforms and how the platforms are used from a Lean product development perspective has been of interest in the survey as reported in the paper.	requirement	Samuel Andrè;Roland Stolt;Fredrik Elgh;Joel Johansson;Morteza Poorkiany	2014		10.3233/978-1-61499-440-4-424	systems engineering;engineering;operations management;new product development;manufacturing engineering;product engineering	SE	-64.71266792096192	11.84383981276791	149402

These information service companies provide applications as public resources to support the business operation of their customers. However, no cloud computing service vendor (CCSV) can satisfy the full functional information system requirements of its customers. As a result, its customers often have to simultaneously use services distributed in different clouds and do some connectivity jobs manually. Services convergence and multi-clouds integration will lead to new business models and trigger new integration technologies that provide solutions to satisfy IT users’ complicated requirements. This paper firstly reviews the development of cloud computing from business and technical viewpoints and then discusses requirements and challenges of services convergence and multi-clouds integrations.

To meet the more requirements on agility, globalization, distribution and cooperation, the CQC argues to break the """"black boxes"""" in the traditional quality chain so as to build a cooperative, smooth, successive, controlled and agile quality chain among the partners in the global supply chain. By introducing the most recently information technical and managerial theories into the quality chain management, a four-layer conceptual framework of CQC implementation is put foreword."""	agile software development;black box;e-commerce;requirement;theory	Guijiang Duan	2005		10.1145/1089551.1089621	supply chain management;marketing;operations management;business;commerce	DB	-72.80869350363882	9.661271667674903	150538
a532f0bf679571314251cb4bca6a870b22d611a6	a decision method for returns logistics based on the customer's behaviour in e-commerce		Abstract   In recent years, many industries have realized that Reverse Logistics (RL) is a necessity for sustainable competitiveness. RL has become a key competence in modern supply chains. And it has been a field of importance for organizations due to growing environmental concerns, legislation, corporate social responsibility and sustainable competitiveness. As the important part of the RL, returns logistics has grown with the development of the E-commerce concept and practice. This study proposes a decision method to determine weather the customer's returns requests are accepted for the logistics enterprise, considering the customer's behaviour. At the beginning, the customers are divided into four types according with their demands. Then, the disruption measurement model is developed based on the categories of the entities in the returns logistics system. And the sensitivity of the time and satisfactions are considered in the research, Furthermore, the framework of the returns logistics is established and decision method for returns logistics based on the customer's behavior is provided. At last, a case study is carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. This will provide a reference for decision-making when they improve the quality of work in Systems Engineering.	e-commerce payment system;logistics	Wenjuan Wang	2015		10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.241	humanitarian logistics;integrated logistics support	AI	-72.43498948173351	6.85506130237746	150712

The search for more effective management to provide quality and efficient services to citizens has been the target to be reached by moderns governments. Within this perspective the study of information systems on public organizations is strategic. In this sense, this paper aims to investigate transparency in the electronic system of purchases of the Federal Government of Brazil, the ComprasNet, with the perspective of usability. In other words, this study evaluated whether the non-functional requirement of usability has been contemplated in the ComprasNet system interfaces to meet the transparency criteria. This article is designed from a qualitative exploratory approach about the use of ComprasNet. To achieve the goal, it was performed semi-structured interviews and a field research using the observation method with system users. As a result of this research, we found that the deficiency in the ComprasNet use is caused, in most cases, by the lack of usability rules in their interfaces. In addition, the present study suggests changes in interfaces that will improve the usability of the system and in its transparency.	angular defect;field research;functional requirement;information system;non-functional requirement;numerical aperture;semiconductor industry;usability	Francisco Chaves Pinto;Denis Silva da Silveira;Jairo S.

5b3b8b7a4907a9fbc8c4694ca891cf029fee21b0	rea modeling of mining companies		ABSTRACT: This research paper applies the resource‐event‐agent (REA) framework to model the unique patterns, in both the REA accountability and policy infrastructures, of the mining enterprise domain. A unique resource in this domain is the mineral resource (MinResc), and the acquisition and development of MinResc to prepare it for the mining conversion process requires a unique information acquisition event to create and expand an information resource entity. The physical mineral deposit entity set and the intangible information entity set are thus aggregated into a more abstract and more valuable MinResc resource. The aggregation of a physical resource and an intangible information resource into a more certain and more valuable physical resource is an extension of the REA ontology that has applications in enterprise domains outside of mining.

However, for an effective migration to cloud environment, it is paramount that a set of clear metrics based on business analytics objectives are defined. Once a comprehensive and systematic identification, evaluation and assessment of risks to the enterprise cloud operations is conducted, a responsive risk management framework is called for. The research into a responsive risk management framework commensurate with the requirements of the modern internet and Information Technologies and global cyber space is a multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder task. This paper aims to review risk and privacy issues of digital oil fields in the cloud and introduce advanced responsive risk management architecture for the modern cyber space applications such as digital oil fields.	cloud computing	Hamid Jahankhani;Najib Altawell;Ali G.

8b41ee830ea980f99d82acad7cbfc47e64c24c4c	network design for reverse and closed-loop supply chains: an annotated bibliography of models and solution approaches	network design	Historically, both the theory and practice of supply chain management have placed an emphasis on manufacturing and distribution operations, i.e., the forward channel, which consists of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers. Recently, increased attention to product recovery practices has extended the scope of traditional supply chain management by drawing attention to collection, demanufacturing, and remanufacturing operations, i.e., the reverse channel, which consists of final-users, collectors, demanufacturers, and remanufacturers. To optimize the performance of the extended supply chain, there is a need to establish an effective and efficient infrastructure via optimal network design. As a result, network design for product recovery has attracted the attention of a growing number of researchers in the past decade. In an attempt to draw more academic attention to this area, this annotated bibliography provides a detailed account of the published literature. The article is organized into two main sections that focus on (i) reverse supply chain network design, which is concerned with establishing an infrastructure to manage the reverse channel only and (ii) closed-loop supply chain network design, which is concerned with establishing an infrastructure to manage both forward and reverse channels in a coordinated manner. Specifically, we describe the operational characteristics of the underlying supply chain system considered in each paper, highlight the features of the network design model proposed therein, and discuss the proposed solution approach along with a brief description of significant computational work, if available. In conclusion, a critical review of the published literature is given and potential areas for future research are identified. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Many companies are inclined to outsource manufacturing, logistics and business activities globally. The senior managers of companies are faced with more complicated and dynamic situations to make decisions than ever before. They not only have to consider the internal factors including production, inventory, and financial status, but also have to take into account the external factors such as policies, market forces, competitive behaviors, etc. To survive in today’s fierce market environment, it has become increasingly important for companies to find ways to combine the multi-source decision knowledge, and utilize it to make sound decisions across the organizational boundaries.#R##N##R##N#In this paper, a rule-based ontology reasoning method is proposed to support decision makings and improve industrial practices for companies in the dynamic and heterogeneous GSC context. A shared GSC ontology is developed to describe the heterogeneous internal and external decision knowledge of the GSC companies and the dynamic market environments. It is contributed in enabling a semantic interoperable decision-making environment, along with the decision knowledge being evolved timely. In addition, semantic rules serving as decision requirements are developed to reason the shared GSC ontology to support the complicated and sound decision-makings, and also to provide suggestions on improving their industrial practices. A case study in China’s iron and steel industry is introduced to justify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ontology-based approaches.	decision support system	Xiaohuan Wang;T. N.

0c137986e7b80f20924c661767550e4f02068387	discovering causal factors explaining business process performance variation		Business process performance may be affected by a range of factors, such as the volume and characteristics of ongoing cases or the performance and availability of individual resources. Event logs collected by modern information systems provide a wealth of data about the execution of business processes. However, extracting root causes for performance issues from these event logs is a major challenge. Processes may change continuously due to internal and external factors. Moreover, there may be many resources and case attributes influencing performance. This paper introduces a novel approach based on time series analysis to detect cause-effect relations between a range of business process characteristics and process performance indicators. The scalability and practical relevance of the approach has been validated by a case study involving a real-life insurance claims handling process.	bottleneck (software);business process;causality;cluster analysis;filter (signal processing);information system;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;performance tuning;real life;relevance;scalability;time series	Bart F.

Furthermore, there are many sources that can provide input on important QRs and suitable levels. Responding timely to customer needs and realizing them in product portfolio and product scope decisions remain the main challenge. [Question/problem] Data-driven methodologies based on product usage data analysis gain popularity and enable new (bottom-up, feedback-driven) ways of planning and evaluating QRs in product development. Can these be efficiently combined with established top-down, forward-driven management of QRs? [Principal idea / Results] We propose a model for how to handle decisions about QRs at a strategic and operational level, encompassing product decisions as well as business intelligence and usage data. We inferred the model from an extensive empirical investigation of five years of decision making history at a large B2C company. We illustrate the model by assessing two industrial case studies from	align (company);bottom-up proteomics;capability maturity model;context-sensitive language;focal (programming language);feedback;new product development;qr code;requirement;requirements management;top-down and bottom-up design;usage data;user experience	Thomas Olsson;Krzysztof Wnuk	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-77243-1_11	management science;systems engineering;requirements management;requirements engineering;non-functional requirement;computer science;grasp;portfolio	SE	-74.4069713994937	12.57195783475107	152316
c6f1012e2b7d85e90e14dcbc3b2cad54241963e0	comprehensive business process management at siemens: implementing business process excellence		(a)rnrnSituation faced: Siemens is a complex organization with offices worldwide. Through many years of development, it grew into a set of businesses, each with a substantial degree of autonomy, supported by central departments. This autonomy gives the departments the flexibility needed to achieve customer intimacy, which requires different process flows in different businesses. When the global initiative concerning the implementation of standard business process management was introduced and enacted, businesses were bundled into four sectors. Every sector in the Siemens organization, including that in Poland, was managing its processes according to the local business specifics and needs, which made the comprehensive process management approach challenging. The processes were disconnected and stored in multiple conventions. Corporate initiatives that were intended to address the effectiveness and efficiency of business processes were not supported.rnrnrnrnrn(b)rnrnAction taken: Siemens strengthened its process-wise approach and worldwide process standardization by implementing a formalized process policy. As a first step, the Business Process Excellence (BPE) regulation (also referred to as BPE policy) was introduced. It formulated the Siemens Processes for Excellence (SIPEX) process standards, which replaced the previous processes base, referred to as Reference Process House (RPH). At the same time, process roles (sponsor, owner, and manager) and corporate tools with which to visualize the processes, such as ARIS, were introduced. In the Polish organization, the program was formulated as a vehicle with which to implement the process organization.

In the fields where mobility is a crucial part of the business, such as in transportation, it is beneficial if the services are also mobile - allowing the employees to process information where appropriate. However, mobility also introduces challenges as the context of use is changing and the information input and output is more troublesome. This paper presents a case study from the field of passenger transport and provides an analysis for understanding the relationship between the usability of mobile business services and business performance. The results indicate that both tangible and intangible effects of usability can be identified at individual, organizational, and customer levels.	input/output;usability	Maiju Markova;Anne Aula	2007	International Conference on the Management of Mobile Business (ICMB 2007)	10.1109/ICMB.2007.24	usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;web usability;business analysis;usability;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;marketing;business case;electronic business;industrialization of services business model;business;mobile business development;services computing;business relationship management;new business development;business process modeling;business activity monitoring	HCI	-70.52067342607019	4.6097013644503635	152384
d406f13ba67acae29ef8b17cfdf81e310f757055	design and management of web-based innovation communities: a lifecycle approach		Nowadays, web-based communities are a popular means to integrate external innovators into the innovation process of organizations. Combining extant research in innovation management and IS management, we integrate open innovation and application lifecycle management (ALM) to present an integrated understanding of the design and management of innovation communities. Therefore, the paper draws on an in-depth explorative case study. We describe the process of community design and management along the phases of ALM. From a socio-technical systems perspective, the manager of an innovation community has to specialize in designing and managing the social subsystem rather than the technical subsystem of an innovation community. Accordingly, we reveal that the community manager’s core asset is a specialized backend that supports these management tasks.	application lifecycle management;open innovation;sociotechnical system;virtual community;web application	Stefan Hallerstede;Angelika C.

In many situations it is not even possible to detect which of those changes are causes and which of them are effects. Nevertheless, it is possible to identify a set of changes that usually happen when one of the elements of the set changes its state. These sets of changes may be used as patterns for situation analysis to anticipate full range of activities to be performed to get the business process and/or information system back to the stable state after it is lost because of the changes in one of the elements. Knowledge about the change pattern gives an opportunity to manage changes of information systems even if business process models and information systems architecture are not neatly documented as is the case in many SMEs. Using change patterns it is possible to know whether changes in information systems are to be expected and how changes in information systems activities, data and users will impact different aspects of the business process supported by the information system.	business process	Janis Makna	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03973-7_4	change control;business transformation;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;change management;change management;business process;business process discovery;business rule;new business development;business process modeling;information system	HCI	-74.05309047393644	11.905132878119842	153261

Starting with a set of definitions, essential for the comprehension of environment, we attempt to provide a complete picture to the reader, describing at the same time an Information System of Communications Centre that serves a Collections application, focusing in issues relating with resources optimizations. We present with analytic way the application of a neural network, comparing it with currently used methods. In the following, a custom application is presented, implemented exclusively to support the present work, as well as acquisition and normalization of real-life data from a commercial CRM application, for feeding the input of our neural network. Finally, we present a number of results of our neural network. The paper concludes by identifying a number of subjects for future study and research.	artificial neural network;information system;mathematical optimization;program optimization;real life	Efstratios F.

The identification of an appropriate input–output set is of decisive significance if assessment of the relative performance of the units is not to be biased. This paper reports on a novel approach used for identifying a suitable input–output set for assessing central administrative services at universities. A computer-supported group support system was used with an advisory board to enable the analysts to extract information pertaining to the boundaries of the unit of assessment and the corresponding input–output variables. The approach provides for a more comprehensive and less inhibited discussion of input–output variables to inform the DEA model.

The results of this research will be timely, as governments are advocating and sometimes mandating the use of open standards. We found inequalities in the impact of open standards that suggest a power law relationship, found that the duration of the development process does not affect the impact of a standard, and found the length of a standard (number of words), which reflects the technical complexity of a standard, affects the impact of a standard.	consortium;multitier architecture;randomness;web standards;world wide web	Rajiv C.

Previous articles have investigated the use of Soft Systems Methodology (SSM), a problem structuring method, in healthcare simulation studies in order to define general system understanding, study objectives, and model content. However, no article has proposed the use of SSM in order to guide all CM phases. This article presents a theoretical discussion involving SSM in simulation and discussion on the methodology's knowledge acquisition capabilities and contributes to simulation literature by proposing a step-by-step SSM-CM approach, based on a combination of previously established SSM-CM techniques from scientific literature, in order to guide all conceptual modeling phases. A SSM view to simulation project management is provided, which may help simulation practitioners to structure project activities while also identifying good CM practices.	knowledge acquisition;scientific literature;simulation;soft systems methodology	José Arnaldo Barra Montevechi;Jonathan Daniel Friend	2012	Proceedings Title: Proceedings of the 2012 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)		project management;simulation;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;discrete event simulation;data mining	EDA	-65.13886996024858	14.833559671926302	153755

Specifically, interviews with a CIO, as well as literature from the ITIL Official site and from the practitioner’s journals are consulted in order to determine whether the best practices contained in the ITIL framework may improve the management of information technology (IT) services, as well as assist in promoting the alignment of Business and the IT Function within the organization. A conceptual model is proposed which proposes a two-way relationship between IT and the provision of IT Services, with ITIL positioned as an intervening variable.	best practice;chief information officer;itil;mediation (statistics)	Kevin P.

This article is one of the first attempts to explain these dynamics as part of a logical progression, from the Web's invention in 1989 to its evolution into machine-to-machine communication through Web services to SOA's role as an application discipline in virtualized cloud infrastructure context--all of which brings us to today's BYOD and BYOA.	bring your own device;cloud computing;color gradient;denial-of-service attack;ecosystem;emergence;machine to machine;web service;world wide web	Enrique Castro-Leon	2014	IT Professional	10.1109/MITP.2014.66	project management;dynamics;organization;knowledge management;service-oriented architecture;management;world wide web;computer security	Networks	-73.51648536198601	9.459526503516978	154289

In this context, organizations look for proposals that would assist them in this task. Recently a new and light alternative was introduced: ALPHAs, which are central elements of ESSENCE - Kernel and Language for Software Engineering Methods OMG standard. This paper presents the experience of a Mexican organization that uses ALPHAs to enhance its processes. The paper summarizes the actual use of ALPHAs in the organization, their advantages and disadvantages, and outlines some advice for organizations wishing to adopt ALPHAs. We conclude that ALPHAs are useful for monitoring and controlling software endeavors. Moreover, their harmonization with the organization's current process was a beneficial factor in renewing the CMMI-DEV and CMMI-SVC level 5 appraisals.	best practice;capability maturity model integration;enterprise architecture;high-level programming language;scalable video coding;software development;software engineering;software system	Miguel Morales Trujillo;Hanna Oktaba;María J.

At the same time, the scale of project is being revised upwards daily. In order to ensure the success of large scale projects, the manner in which cooperation is set up between different teams, such as systems engineers and project managers, is becoming an important issue. Cooperation between systems engineering and project management is now key in this respect. On the other hand, it is widely recognized that the use of standards can improve the success ratio. Thus, integration using standards or guides from systems engineering and project management can help companies improve their competitiveness. A host of standards or guides have already been published in both domains. The purpose of this paper is to choose those most frequently used standards or guides from the systems engineering and project management in order to compare and build a bridge between them and provide a view shared by systems engineers and project managers enabling them to carry out the project effectively.

We argue that crowdwork platforms can improve their value proposition for all stakeholders by supporting subcontracting within microtasks. After describing the value proposition of subcontracting, we then define three models for microtask subcontracting: real-time assistance, task management, and task improvement, and reflect on potential use cases and implementation considerations associated with each. Finally, we describe the outcome of two tasks on Mechanical Turk meant to simulate aspects of subcontracting. We reflect on the implications of these findings for the design of future crowd work platforms that effectively harness the potential of subcontracting workflows.	amazon mechanical turk;crowdsourcing;indivisible;microwork;real-time clock;simulation;the turk	Meredith Ringel Morris;Jeffrey P.

This shift from collection ownership to an information access model supports the distributed nature of learning and work. However, unanticipated consequences of these changes are emerging. One confounding result is a visible pattern of discontinuities in collections, with unique features for electronic products. Patterns of discontinuities encountered included the occurrence of intermittent holes and unintentionally masked information. This has both immediate and long-term implications for library users and services, and there are not yet coherent measures to assess these sorts of outcomes. A framework is required for the systematic evaluation of the effects of new systems such as bundled electronic resources. This research suggests that evaluating both use and non-use of electronic collections will supplement other acquisitions and service measures to support long-range planning and decision-making.	ada semantic interface specification;archive;coherence (physics);experiment;freedom of information laws by country;imperative programming;information access;information needs;intelligibility (philosophy);interaction;invisible ink;just-in-time compilation;knowledge management;librarian;library (computing);pdf/a;programming paradigm;projection screen;semiconductor;situated;unintended consequences	Lisa Covi;Melissa H.

Emergence theory gives a new perspective to promote the development and to improve the performance of complex systems. The happening of system emergence is a very complex process, but it isn’t mysterious. When and where emergent properties would appear and what emergent properties would come forth can be forecasted by setting up conceptual model and framework. The following work has been done in this paper. Firstly, emergence mechanism is introduced. Based on emergence mechanism, emergence comes from component effect, structure effect and environment effect. Secondly, synergy management, especially interface synergy is proved to be one of effective ways to induce emergence by analyzing its emergent properties. Then the emergence process through interface synergy is discussed, the conceptual model of system interface synergy inducing emergence is established and the generalized flow of interface synergy is summarized. Finally, this paper takes the system of construction project as an example to illustrate the application of synergy management.	complex systems;emergence;synergy	Wu Shaoyan;Du Gang	2010	2010 International Conference on E-Business and E-Government	10.1109/ICEE.2010.658	project management;simulation;concrete;construction;systems engineering;organization;engineering;knowledge management;conceptual model;systematics;systems thinking;emergence	Robotics	-63.36209610555506	12.042124509246717	156126

They have learned that mission-critical business opportunities abound and they must implement many e-commerce initiatives along the way to building the virtual corporation that thrives in the Digital Economy. To them, e-commerce is an infrastructure for a whole new way of doing business. They have learned if they extend their business processes across company boundaries and integrate them with their suppliers' and customers' business processes something totally new starts to happen. E-commerce applications can be categorized into the four major groupings shown in Figure 1. On the sell side of most companies, I-Market applications include online catalog management, order management , trading communities, marketing and advertising, while Customer Care applications involve customer self-service, customer relationship management and business intelligence support. On the buy side, Vendor Management Systems automate the procurement of indirect operating resources including sourc-ing, bid/ask buying and custom supplies catalogs. Extended Supply Chain Management includes collab-orative forecasting and planning, scheduling and logistics. These are general categories, and some companies such as GE and Home Depot already have identified more than 70 e-commerce opportunities for competitive advantage and business concept innovation. To achieve coherence and manage the complexity and change inherent in multiple e-commerce applications , an overarching structure is needed—an application architecture. Joined electronically, companies operating in the Digital Economy must share a common foundation for integrating their unique business processes and embrace the software component paradigm as the way forward. Their core business processes are embedded in legacy, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and client/server systems. In order to retarget these internal systems outward, common inter-enterprise application functions are needed.

436aef63e1dda883d931e395845b8a5b47418c32	open source networks: an exploration of business model and agility issues	business models	The growing interest of commercial organisations in developing and exploiting open source software (OSS) has led to increased focus on business model aspects of the OSS phenomenon. However, much of the work on OSS business models describes the revenue stream but neglects of other aspects of the business model. In addition, many OSS companies participate in business networks in order to offer the complete product / service offering (whole product) demanded by customers. Such collaboration is seen as vital in competing with large firms in delivering the ‘whole product. However, there are uncertainties about how such collaboration affects (1) the business models of participants and (2) the agility of the network. This paper examines Zope Europe Association (ZEA), a network of small open source companies co-operating to deliver the ‘whole product’. It investigates how participation in the network augments the business models of each participant company, and identifies the business agility challenges faced by the network. The paper concludes identifying the need to address adaptability and alignment issues in addition to business network agility.	open sound system;open-source software;sequence alignment;zope	Joseph Feller;Patrick Finnegan;Jeremy Hayes	2006			knowledge management;business activity monitoring;marketing;business architecture;business process modeling;process management;business requirements;artifact-centric business process model;business agility;computer science;new business development;business analysis	Web+IR	-75.91451315823998	6.378772338020492	156765

Using a case study approach and extensive interviews, the researchers found that a SAP system was rigid, highly structured and ignored by some elements of the social system. Moreover, it focused on technical prowess of the SAP solution at the apparent expense of supporting real-world activity. Such a focus allowed the spontaneous creation of 'feral systems' that involved ad hoc processes used to get around the SAP solution, to complete important work. This paper begins with an analysis of the feral systems concept and then examines the case study of feral systems in the organisation in question. This paper concludes with a call for future research into feral systems and their effectiveness on ERP systems to support real-world activity.	erp;feral information systems;information system	Luke Houghton;Don V.

However, there is a tendency identified currently in the industry that companies use PC to cover more lifecycle phases, such as engineering, manufacturing and service. This is described as configuration lifecycle management (CLM). Digitalization, increasing complexity and competitiveness are the main drivers of this need. This research analyses 59 case studies using PC in several lifecycle phases. The findings from the case studies confirm this tendency and the need towards a complete CLM solution is discussed.

f3adca6227ce676119259e7bc8ae14030b2987ca	how can we find out what makes a good requirements engineer in the age of digitalization?		Good requirements are commonly viewed as a key success factor for IT (and non-IT) projects, but still there seems to be insufficient insight into which competences requirements engineers need to have these days. Digitalization is likely to pose new challenges to requirements engineering. Chances are that digitalization will change the competences that are necessary for successful requirements engineering. This paper proposes a research design that will be used for clarifying which competences requirements engineers need nowadays and how these competences change due to digitalization. To that end, qualitative and quantitative research methods will be combined for developing a comprehensive competence profile for requirements engineering on a scientific basis. The resulting competence profile constitutes a starting point for devising competence-oriented learning settings. Thus, our research contributes to a better understanding of competences for requirements engineering and improves education of future requirements engineers, in particular for coping with challenges posed by digitalization.	complex systems;microsoft outlook for mac;requirement;requirements engineering;software engineering;system of systems	Yvonne Sedelmaier;Dieter Landes	2017	2017 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)	10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7942853		SE	-63.09305530508688	18.019835340945843	157493
0211126f8fa03067190eab1952a86f130f8caafd	analysis of the applicability of the idef-sim modeling technique to the stages of a discrete event simulation project		The IDEF-SIM technique was developed in order to facilitate the translation of conceptual models to computational models. Papers using this technique can be found in the existing literature, however, none present an analysis of how the technique behaves throughout all of the stages of a discrete event simulation project. Therefore, a research-action was developed with the practical objective of constructing a computational model as a help to future decision making. The knowledge objective is to analyze the applicability of this technique in all of the stages of the discrete event simulation project. It was concluded that the IDEF-SIM demonstrates as applicable: during the conception stage in which information of the process was documented in detail; during the implementation stage in which the conceptual model was converted into a computational model; and during the analysis phase, promoting the communication between modulators and managers in the presentation of proposed changes.	computation;computational model;idef;simulation	José Arnaldo Barra Montevechi;Mona Liza Moura de Oliveira;Fabiano Leal;Alexandre Ferreira de Pinho	2014	Proceedings of the Winter Simulation Conference 2014		simulation;computer science;systems engineering;management science	AI	-64.83882314666748	14.497654088173185	157528

A complex system has a large number of design variables and decision-making requires real-time data collected from machines, processes, and business environments. Enterprise systems (ESs) are used to support data acquisition, communication, and all decision-making activities. Therefore, information technology (IT) infrastructure for data acquisition and sharing affects the performance of an ES greatly. Our objective is to investigate the impact of emerging Internet of Things (IoT) on ESs in modern manufacturing. To achieve this objective, the evolution of manufacturing system paradigms is discussed to identify the requirements of decision support systems in dynamic and distributed environments; recent advances in IT are overviewed and associated with next-generation manufacturing paradigms; and the relation of IT infrastructure and ESs is explored to identify the technological gaps in adopting IoT as an IT infrastructure of ESs.

The primary characteristic of the target market is (very) low volumes over a (very) large number of items, thus agility and extremely low overheads are the essential factors for a viable business model. Being a new company (established 2004), without legacy software and with the freedom to make new choices, it was decided that the agent abstraction offered both short-term software engineering and longer-term business advantages. This expectation has been borne out in practice, in that it has been possible to construct an e-trading platform, using a 4-person team over a period of a few months, and that is now part of a live business operation handling just over 12,000 transactions daily. In this paper we explain how agents helped focus attention on the responsibilities of key software functions, how different functions should interact with one another and how to identify and propagate key performance indicator information through the system to detect unexpected behaviour. Agent technology has many potential benefits for dynamic fast-moving businesses where software requirements change quickly and business needs grow rapidly, all within a dynamic environment that has entirely different rules across the axes of geography, market, customer and competitor. Using autonomous agents allowed The Book Depository to build quickly a complex network of P2P relationships with a large number of suppliers and publishers of very different sizes who each utilize a variety of different trading and data interchange standards.	autonomous robot;book;business models for open-source software;business requirements;complex network;electronic trading;inventory control;legacy system;requirement;software engineering;software requirements	Emad Eldeen Elakehal;Julian Padget	2008		10.1145/1402795.1402798	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;supply chain	SE	-66.17499274156384	10.587036610965109	157754

The root cause of this problem is the low capacity of traceability and lack of synchronization between the computational models present in the EA. Among the negative impacts related to this problem are, for example, the obsolescence of models, the difficulty of carrying out impact analyzes and making decisions, in scenarios of organizational changes. This paper aims to propose an approach to enable the traceability and synchronization between the computational models of enterprise architecture. It is hoped to provide a greater alignment, understanding and adaptation of the organizational environment, from the strategic level to the operational level of IT.	computation;computational model;enterprise architecture;holism;information system;synchronization (computer science);traceability	José Rogério Poggio Moreira;Rita Suzana Pitangueira Maciel	2017		10.5220/0006374304600465	enterprise architecture framework;functional software architecture;real-time computing;architecture domain;applications architecture;enterprise architecture management;solution architecture;distributed computing;enterprise architecture;enterprise integration;view model;enterprise information security architecture;requirements traceability	SE	-73.60278953487628	9.454036514347582	158641

The field of security engineering has several generally accepted principles, but it currently lacks a comprehensive framework for evaluating security-engineering practices and integrating security engineering approaches with software quality improvment models.#R##N#The aims of this research are 1) to evaluate existing security engineering principles and software process improvement models (such as ISO 15504, CMM, ISO 17799), to identify weaknesses through a comparison.  2) To analyse and investigate the current security management practices in the different organisations, to explore and identify the potential security risks.  3) To integrate and set up a bridge between software quality improvement processes and security engineering principles.  4) To design a model which can provide organisations with guidance on how to gain control of their processes for developing software quality improvement and information security management, and how to evolve towards a culture of security management process through overcoming the weaknesses in above models.#R##N#The literature review has been conducted to study the existing software process assessment and information security management models.  The well-known software process assessment models CMM, ISO 15504, BOOTSTRAP, the information security management standard ISO 17799 and the USD Generally Accepted Security System Pronciple (GASSP) and SSE-CMM have been analysed.  The strengths and weakness of these models have been highlighted from model structure, major functions and frame analysis.  Additionally journals and conferences proceedings provide information and a comprehensive knowledge and background for informatuion security management in rapidly changing and e-business environment. In this study surveys on information security management in rapidly changing and e-business environments have been conducted, focusing on exploring and investigating the security management processes and ISO 17799 information security standard usage in different kinds of organisations.  The differences between UK and non-UK organisations have been analysed.  Some major activities for info-security management and ISO 17799 current status are highlighted, the most important security risk management processes and potential weaknesses have also been analysed.  Based on these results, recommendations and further considerations are presented for software houses, e-business companies, financial and security consultant organisations.#R##N#To provide valuable input in the development of such an approach, an in-depth analysis of the information security management special issues and best practices has been carried out.  This research also integrates the security engineering process into a project lifecycle.#R##N#A new Security Engineering Process Improvement Approach (SEPIA) has been developed as a major contribution to the software industry that fills an important gap between software quality improvement modelling and security engineering principles.  It includes more than 120 detailed process improvement and control areas.#R##N#The SEPIA model has been validated and verified in a global organisation, details of five projects have been presented and analysed, the existing problems in the organisation have been highlighted based on the SEPIA model.  After the verification and validation activities, more inputs were also gained to achieve the final SEPIA model.  The new model provides organisations with guidance and extra audit reference on how to gain control of their processes for devloping software security management, and how to evolve towards a culture of security management process through overcoming the weaknesses in the existing guidelines	security engineering;software development process	Haiwen Li	2005			software security assurance;information security audit;standard of good practice;itil security management;security management;information security management system;security information and event management;security engineering;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;operations management;information security management	SE	-70.31346332326339	14.921813962423949	159185

In such complex networked enterprises, it is increasingly challenging to interchange, share, and manage internal and external digital information. In this context, to achieve interoperability between information systems is a challenging task. In order to solve the interoperability problem at semantic level, several ontology-based approaches have emerged. Although methodologies, methods, techniques, and tools to support the ontology building process were proposed, there are no mature models to measure this process, and the quality of implemented ontologies remains a major concern. This paper presents a framework, OntoQualitas, for evaluating the quality of an ontology whose purpose is the information interchange between different contexts. OntoQualitas includes previous and new measures to evaluate the ontology considering its specific purpose. Additionally, an empirical validation of OntoQualitas is presented. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the discipline of Requirements Engineering there is a known solution to overcome the arising issue of needing to access this information as quick as possible. As we experienced the REQUIREMENTS PYRAMID 1 to be useful, but often not known by other roles such as architects, we decided to put theses practices into a pattern, making it available for everyone. Roles in projects, that could benefit from knowing this pattern among others are: project managers, requirements engineers, architects, business analysts, product life cycle managers. Please note, that in the discipline of requirements engineering, every single piece of information is called a requirement. You might now ask yourself what the profit of knowing the concepts of the REQUIREMENTS PYRAMID is. Assuming you are an architect who just had joined a running project. Now, you are trying to figure out why the architecture looks like it does look like. You might ask questions such as: What requirements made us coming up with this solution and not with any other? Here, the REQUIREMENTS PYRAMID offers support. By looking at Figure 1 you find the requirement camera shall support contious shooting.. To understand, why this requirement is to be developed, you simply look upwards the pyramid, meaning following the upwards arrow in the figure until you find the corresponding requirements on the upper level. Thus, you get to know, that DR.OS.C.1 is in place, because The system shall use the OptSys components and patents. is stated in requirement BR.BC.4. As this example shows the REQUIREMENTS PYRAMID ia as a ’conceptual model’ or ’mental model’ that helps you to structure and understand information steming from different stakeholders and often stated in different levels of detail.	requirement	Anne Hoffmann	2010		10.1145/2328909.2328915	architecture;conceptual model;stakeholder management;systems engineering;arrow;product lifecycle;requirements engineering;computer science;ask price;pyramid	Logic	-67.37610822088607	12.101061395453018	159502

These actors refine a set of fuzzy requirements into a concrete artefact through a series of activities producing increasingly detailed systems descriptions. Some of the problems we experience in complex system development stem from the simple fact that the actors misunderstand each other. The aim of this paper is to investigate the frequency and possible impact of misunderstandings between actors in the development of complex information systems. The results are based on the analysis of data collected during a two-day workshop session and a quantitative survey. Our findings show that misunderstandings are considered frequent between all types of actors and are a source of disturbances in the systems development process of complex information system products.	complex system;information system;requirement;software development process;visual artifact	Håkan Enquist;Nickolas Makrygiannis	1998		10.1109/HICSS.1998.654762	computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;human resource management;database;management science;management;information system;statistics	SE	-65.50654467079767	16.937159057913483	159800

As academic institutions produce large amounts of information in their teaching/research and administrative activities and this information should flow smoothly between departments, there appears the need to organize and manage this information thoroughly. In order to avoid information overlapping, this should happen considering the other internal existing systems. Nevertheless, because not all institutions afford to spend a lot on various systems, open source software is an appropriate solution for both educational and administrative services. Our aim is to prove the utility of Enterprise Content Management (ECM) in context of academic organizations. The first part makes an introduction to the concepts of ECM and open source software, as means to enhance process management. The second part regards the components of ECM systems and makes an analysis of their potential use in academic institutions. A system architecture based on ECM, by means of which ECM is usefully connected to other systems operating in educational establishments is proposed. A case study, discussing the implementation of an open source ECM in a large Romanian university, showing its efficacy and focusing on features related to document workflow, is analyzed.	enterprise content management;open-source software;systems architecture	Catalin Maican;Radu Lixandroiu	2016	Int J.

9d093a289e6ef4c879d249086e4990a47eda8229	advances of operations research in service industry	operations research;service industry	Service industry has received increasing interest in recent years. The economies in industrialized nations across the world have become more service oriented. The workforce employed in services continued to grow in developed economies during the second half of the 1980s and the 1990s. At the beginning of 2000, in several OECD countries, about three quarters of employees were working in the service sector [1]. In 2007, the world’s biggest source of employment was for the first time the service sector, rather than agriculture and industry. About 40% of the world’s workers were employed in the service sector, compared with 38.7% in agriculture and 21.3% in industry. About fifteen years ago, 43.1% of employees worked in agriculture, and only 35.5% in the service sector. It was predicted that in future the service sector would provide more than half of global employment opportunities [2]. It is obvious that services are playing a key role in today’s global economy, and such trend can be expected to continue in the future. As a result, the importance of studying the service industry in operations research (OR) perspectives has been increasing. An OR perspective can help better address the mathematical characteristics involve with service industries and possibly provide a framework, which will foster the development of formal models of service systems. Service industry is one of the most challenging sectors in industrial and economic development; and new management theories as well as the material flow theory, which can be applied to the service sector, have been proposed [3–8]. A variety of service industry paradigms have been developed to tackle the challenges. There are many research issues needed to be addressed using the methods including mathematical modeling and optimization; as such, a variety of OR models have been developed to tackle these challenges [9–11]. Today, not only large companies, but also medium or small-sized companies are learning that understanding service industries as well as its quantitative aspects are a required component of doing business. As a result, there is a growing demand for insights into challenges, issues, and solutions related to the OR methods in the service sector. To respond to the market needs from both academic researchers and practitioners, and to communicate research results on OR in service industries, this special issue provides an international forum for researchers in academia and industry to present their most recent findings in OR in service industries. This special issue of Computers and Operations Research presents thirteen papers. The purpose of this special issue is to report on the state-of-the-art of, and emerging trends in, research and practice in OR in the service sector.

This study reviews some of the major business applications of Web 2.0, and identifies Web 2.0-based business models. Six emerging Web 2.0-based business models were identified: 1 Broad Online Community, 2 Focused Online Community, 3 Social Shopping, 4 Content Intermediary, 5 Virtual World, and 6 Shared Web 2.0 Services. Along with these new Web 2.0-based business models, this study discusses how Web 2.0 applications are used to support activities of traditional businesses in the areas of customers, value networking, capability, and sustainability. Finally, the interaction dynamics between emerging web 2.0-based businesses, existing businesses, and the Web 2.0 tool and application development industry are analyzed from an ecological viewpoint.	web 2.0	In Lee	2011	IJEBR	10.4018/jebr.2011100101	business model;web application security;customer relationship management;web development;business process execution language;web analytics;economics;web standards;computer science;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;marketing;social semantic web;electronic business;mobile business development;business process;web intelligence;web engineering;business relationship management;rapid application development;management;web 2.0;new business development;world wide web;commerce;social network;collaboration	Web+IR	-75.13600163719558	5.722987671956583	161231

This means for companies to comply with an increasing number of rules of different origin and complexity. Especially purchasing activities are affected by various regulations that affect the whole supply chain. Companies then need to assure that compliance regulations are synchronized with its suppliers. In this paper, purchasing regulations are reviewed to derive risk categories that can be applied to the supplier assessment. We therefore adopt a generic supplier assessment method called SCOPE. The method is expanded by a compliance category (SCOPE-C) that refers to risks regarding disloyalty and corruption, the relationship to competitors as well as social and environmental factors and additional criteria to form a reliable supplier base. The extended SCOPE-C method can be used to assess to which extent suppliers fulfil corporate compliance policies.	business process;complexity;payment card industry data security standard;purchasing;risk assessment	Andrea Zasada;Michael Fellmann	2016	2016 IEEE 20th International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Workshop (EDOCW)	10.1109/EDOCW.2016.7584382	procurement;risk management;systematics;supplier relationship management;management	SE	-75.81254228957167	10.802947713190417	161357

At the moment, there is a lack of Big Data Quality Framework in existence particularly that is focusing on the specific context and needs of Malaysia’s Public Sector Open Data initiative. Most of existing data quality frameworks are catering the needs of traditional data types (i.e., structured data) and are very generic in nature. Due to the explosion of big data which consists mostly of unstructured data and structured data, and Malaysia’s vision of leveraging data in modernizing its service delivery, a new framework addressing the needs of Big Data for Malaysia is needed. Based on an extensive literature review, we develop a conceptual framework and systematic methodologies of how to construct the said framework to its fruition.	big data;data quality;itil	Mohamad Taha Ijab;Azlina Ahmad;Rabiah Abdul Kadir;Suraya Hamid	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-70010-6_8		DB	-69.32969911601293	12.056900511478192	161629

The technology landscape is missing an overall perspective that clarifies the fragmented understanding of technologies, unpredictable lifecycles, and the unknown adoption for organizations to enable their business with useful technologies. More than one million contributions of features, bugs, and changes were pushed on public available code repositories to develop big data technologies with hidden understanding of the underlying data basis. Using this source could help to identify insights about technological domains as well as their adoption process of contributors to new uprising big data technologies. A knowledge discovery process provided the potential to analyze 269 big data technologies regarding their contribution behavior of over 21,000 contributors. As a result, investigations show an ecosystem of structuring big data technologies based on dynamic contributor networks that have implications on organizations adoption.	big data;ecosystem;open-source software;software bug	Oliver Bieh-Zimmert;Carsten Felden	2018		10.1145/3281375.3281382	knowledge extraction;knowledge management;big data;structuring;computer science	ML	-73.87363653768628	11.884004799920065	161682

More specifically, every organization or team implements a customized agile method, tailored to better accommodate its needs. However, the extent to which a customized method supports the organizational objectives, or rather the ‘goodness’ of that method is questionable. Existing agile assessment approaches focus on a comparative analysis, or are limited in scope and application. In this research, we propose a structured, systematic and comprehensive approach to assess the ‘goodness’ of agile methods. We examine an agile method based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization to support the adopted principles and practices specified by the method, and (3) the method’s effectiveness. We propose the Objectives, Principles and Practices (OPP) Framework to guide our assessment. The Framework identifies (1) objectives of the agile philosophy, (2) principles that support the objectives, (3) practices that are reflective of the principles, (4) the linkages between the objectives, principles and practices, and (5) indicators for each practice to assess the effectiveness of the practice and the extent to which the organization supports its implementation. In this document, we discuss our solution approach, preliminary results, and future work.	agile software development;open prosthetics project;qualitative comparative analysis	Shvetha Soundararajan	2011	CoRR		agile unified process;extreme programming practices;agile usability engineering;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;software engineering;agile software development;management science;empirical process;lean software development	SE	-68.56956620398095	15.331543974216755	161926

Software engineering is now faced with two dynamic innovation streams: technological innovation and market innovation. Harshly shook by rapid technological development and highly volatile market environments, today's software development is under the constant necessity for swift and reliable development practices and market launch in appropriate timing. In short, software development has to be more and more strategic. Based on a brief review of the existing strategic management frameworks, the paper suggests that Eisenhardt's framework of 'Strategy as Simple Rules' is highly applicable to software development practices. Through a short case study of internet service development in Japan, the paper also suggests that dual roles of beta versions, as a product and media, would play a critical role in making strategic decisions in internet service development.	.net framework;internet;linkage (software);software development;software engineering;strategic management;swift (programming language)	Masao Kakihara	2006		10.1145/1137661.1137670	software project management;systems engineering;knowledge management;marketing;social software engineering;software development;software as a service;business;lean software development;software deployment	SE	-74.28412820650514	17.12855721832448	161957
6c4fd23d317b193dd2d06c1939bf781f77893f5a	demonstrating approach design principles during the development of a demo-based enterprise engineering approach		Enterprise engineering (EE) aims to address several phenomena in the evolution of an enterprise. One prominent phenomenon is the inability of the enterprise as a complex socio-technical system to adapt to rapidly-changing environments. In response to this phenomenon, many enterprise design approaches (with their own methodologies, frameworks, and modelling languages) emerged, but with little empirical evidence about their effectiveness. Furthermore, research indicates that multiple enterprise design approaches are used concurrently in industry, with each approach focusing on a sub-set of stakeholder concerns. The proliferating design approaches do not necessarily explicate their conditional use in terms of contextual prerequisites and demarcated design scope; and this also impairs their evaluation. Previous work suggested eleven design principles that would guide approach designers when they design or enhance an enterprise design approach. The design principles ensure that researchers contribute to the systematic growth of the EE knowledge base. This article provides a demonstration of the eleven principles during the development of a DEMO-based enterprise engineering approach, as well as a discussion to reflect on the usefulness of the principles.	enterprise engineering;knowledge base;modeling language;sociotechnical system	Thomas van der Meulen;Marne de Vries;Aurona Gerber	2017		10.5220/0006382204710482	simulation;systems engineering;engineering;software engineering;enterprise integration	SE	-63.00903248751286	17.913255296305927	161998

It suggests that effective implementation of these techniques requires a careful assessment of the various data mining tools and algorithms available. Both statistical and machine-learning based algorithms have been widely applied to discover knowledge from data. In this chapter we describe some of these algorithms and investigate their relative performance for classification problems. Simulation based results support the proposition that machinelearning algorithms outperform their statistical counterparts, albeit only under certain conditions. Further, the authors hope that the discussion on performance related issues will foster a better understanding of the application and appropriateness of knowledge discovery techniques. 701 E.

INTRODUCTION The volume of data collected by businesses today is phenomenal and is increasing exponentially. The challenge is to integrate and correlate data related to both online and offline sales, customer satisfaction surveys, and server log files. To this end, data mining (DM) the process of sifting through the mass of organizational (internal and external) data to identify patterns, is critical for decision support. Effective data mining has several applications, like fraud detection and bankruptcy prediction (Tam & Kiang, 1992; Lee, Han, & Kwon, 1996; Kumar, Krovi, & Rajagopalan, 1997), strategic decision-making (Nazem & Shin, 1999), and database marketing (Brachman, R.J. Khabaza, T. Kloesgen, W. PiatetskyShapiro, G. & Simoudis, E, 1996). Today, businesses have the unique opportunity for using such techniques for target marketing and customer relationship management. Analysis of massive data collected by businesses can support intelligence-gathering efforts about their competition, product, or market. Intelligent tools based on rules derived from web mining can also play an important role in personalization related to site content and presentation. Recently, there has been considerable interest on how to integrate and mine such data (Mulvenna, Anand, & Buchner, 2000; Brachman et al., 1996). Business databases in general pose a unique problem for pattern extraction because of their complex nature. This complexity arises from anomalies such as discontinuity, noise, ambiguity, and incompleteness (Fayyad, Piatetsky-Shapiro & Smyth, 1996). Historically, decision makers had to manually deduce patterns using information generated by query reporting systems. One level of analytical sophistication above this was the ability to look at the data and perform analyses such as What-If and goal seeking.

8465937aacf697765d3725ea807b9a95c437fee5	egovernment - minitrack introduction		The paper addresses the quality model of e-Government services (e-GSQ Model) by employing the ISO/IEC 9126 standard. This model is used to verify government services whether or not they meet citizens’ needs. There are fifteen characteristics describing government services in terms of services given by government organizations and five other characteristics describing government services in term of citizens’ needs. These characteristics are suggested to be minimum requirements for establishing the quality model of e-Government services. The result of tested quality metrics for e-Government services supports the basic characteristics of a quality model of e-Government services.	benchmark (computing);e-government;iso/iec 9126;requirement	Michael Gisler;Matthias Günter;Dieter Spahni	2001		10.1109/HICSS.2001.10017	computer science;knowledge management	Web+IR	-70.75864371662882	13.513259196380242	162728

We refer to this as the cyber security investment challenge. In this paper, we consider three possible decision support methodologies for security managers to tackle this challenge. We consider methods based on game theory, combinatorial optimisation, and a hybrid of the two. Our modelling starts by building a framework where we can investigate the effectiveness of a cyber security control regarding the protection of different assets seen as targets in presence of commodity threats. As game theory captures the interaction between the endogenous organisation’s and attackers’ decisions, we consider a 2-person control game between the security manager who has to choose among different implementation levels of a cyber security control, and 1Imperial College London. 2University of Brighton. 3Queen Mary University of London. Preprint submitted to Decision Support Systems December 21, 2015 a commodity attacker who chooses among different targets to attack. The pure game theoretical methodology consists of a large game including all controls and all threats. In the hybrid methodology the game solutions of individual control-games along with their direct costs (e.g. financial) are combined with a knapsack algorithm to derive an optimal investment strategy. The combinatorial optimisation technique consists of a multi-objective multiple choice knapsack based strategy. To compare these approaches we built a decision support tool and a case study regarding current government guidelines. The endeavour of this work is to highlight the weaknesses and strengths of different investment methodologies for cyber security, the benefit of their interaction, and the impact that indirect costs have on cyber security investment. Going a step further in validating our work, we have shown that our decision support tool provides the same advice with the one advocated by the UK government with regard to the requirements for basic technical protection from cyber attacks in SMEs.

Sometimes there are problems to establish these collaborations due to the lack of maturity in aspects related to interoperability. Unfortunately, the enterprises do not know enough about the concept of interoperability. The main goal of this article is to learn more about this framework and show how to develop an evaluation method by means of a questionnaire that allows the interoperability of an enterprise to be measured. The application of the questionnaire will serve to determine the level of interoperability achieved by the enterprise and to detect the aspects to be improved.	capability maturity model;develop;global serializability;interoperability	Noelia Palomares;Cristina Campos;Sergio Palomero	2010		10.1007/978-1-84996-257-5_36	systems engineering;knowledge management;operations management;business	Web+IR	-70.87408351436152	11.724107273577886	163468

Configuration Management Data Bases (CMDBs) store fundamental information about IT systems, such as the system's hardware, software and services. This information can help provide decision support for root cause analysis and change impact analysis. We have worked with our industrial research partner, CA, and with CA customers to identify challenges to the use of CMDBs to semi-automatically solve these problems. In this paper we propose a framework called DRACA (Decision Support for Root Cause Analysis and Change Impact Analysis). This framework mines key facts from the CMDB and in a sequence of three steps combines these facts with incident reports, change reports and expert knowledge, along with temporal information, to construct a probabilistic causality graph. Root causes are predicted and ranked by probabilistically tracing causality edges backwards from incidents to likely causes. Conversely, change impacts can be predicted and ranked by tracing from a proposed change forward along causality edges to locate likely undesirable impacts.	causality;configuration management;database;decision support system;semiconductor industry	Sarah Nadi;Richard C.

Socio-technical solutions are developed in big data projects to reach competitive advantage. Although these projects are aligned to specific business needs, common architectural challenges are not addressed in a comprehensive manner. Enterprise architecture management is a holistic approach to tackle complex business and IT architectures. The transformation of an organization's EA is influenced by big data transformation processes and their data-driven approach on all layers. In this paper, we review big data literature to analyze which requirements for the EA management discipline are proposed. Based on a systematic literature identification, conceptual categories of requirements for EA management are elicited utilizing an inductive category formation. These conceptual categories of requirements constitute a category system that facilitates a new perspective on EA management and fosters the innovation-driven evolution of the EA management discipline.	big data;business requirements;categorization;enterprise architecture management;holism;objectivity/db;problem domain;relevance;requirement;stumbleupon;type system	Stefan Kehrer;Dierk Jugel;Alfred Zimmermann	2016	2016 IEEE 20th International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Workshop (EDOCW)	10.1109/EDOCW.2016.7584352	market research;big data;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;data science;software engineering;data mining;database;systematics;management;computer security;encoding	SE	-73.81844723482241	10.424687439924178	163610

For this reason, they cannot be sold as plug &amp; play products and their implementation requires a clear definition of functional and technical requirements. The primary objective of ITSs is to improve the efficiency and safety of road traffic. In fact, nowadays, the number of motorways all over Europe is increasing. The road freight transport is also growing. These are one of some reasons of caused accidents. Solution to this problem may be implementation of ITS systems. But, a reliable work of them is possible when their reliability is at a very high level. The aim of this paper is to present a new model of reliability and operation analysis of the selected ITS system which include continuous provision of power to its elements.

One of the very important problems in this matter is the management of returns. As returned products are products with defects, there is always the possibility for proper treatment. Decisions about further management of defective product is difficult, regarding the product and its parts environmental impacts. Here, the useful tool is life cycle assessment (LCA), that can support reverse logistics processes in case of defective products management. LCA is used to assess environmental impact of cellular phone and 6 possible scenarios of its handling in case of any defects. The assessment shows that reuse and repair scenarios are helpful in mitigating environmental impact in life cycle while waste scenario and also recycling scenario have much higher impact.	enterprise life cycle;logistics;mobile phone;software product management	Marta Starostka-Patyk;Tomasz Nitkiewicz	2014	2014 International Conference on Advanced Logistics and Transport (ICALT)	10.1109/ICAdLT.2014.6866315	knowledge management;risk analysis (engineering);life-cycle assessment;phone;environmental impact assessment;reuse;computer science;reverse logistics;communication channel	SE	-63.35539603337659	9.622034115809747	164000

The resulting dynamics of critically high, exploding complexity urgently needs consistent understanding and efficient management. The new, provably universal concept of unreduced dynamic complexity of real interaction processes described here provides the former and can be used as a basis for the latter, in the form of “complexity revolution” in information systems controlling such “critically globalised” civilisation dynamics. We outline the relevant dynamic complexity properties and the ensuing principles of anticipated complexity transition in information and communication systems. We then emphasize key applications of unreduced complexity concept and complexity-driven IT to various aspects of post-industrial civilisation dynamics, including intelligent communication, context-aware information and control systems, reliable genetics, integral medicine, emergent engineering, efficient risk management at the new level of socio-economic development and resulting realistic sustainability.	control system;emergence;information and computation;information system;planetary scanner;risk management	Andrei P.

71f8f95a4b31dff9f88567e089f00d4eadc2c2d4	industry 4.0		Industry is the part of an economy that produces material goods which are highly mechanized and automatized. Ever since the beginning of industrialization, technological leaps have led to paradigm shifts which today are ex-post named “industrial revolutions”: in the field of mechanization (the so-called 1st industrial revolution), of the intensive use of electrical energy (the so-called 2nd industrial revolution), and of the widespread digitalization (the so-called 3rd industrial revolution). On the basis of an advanced digitalization within factories, the combination of Internet technologies and future-oriented technologies in the field of “smart” objects (machines and products) seems to result in a new fundamental paradigm shift in industrial production. The vision of future production contains modular and efficient manufacturing systems and characterizes scenarios in which products control their own manufacturing process. This is supposed to realize the manufacturing of individual products in a batch size of one while maintaining the economic conditions of mass production. Tempted by this future expectation, the term “Industry 4.0” was established exante for a planned “4th industrial revolution”, the term being a reminiscence of software versioning. Decisive for the fast spread was the recommendation for implementation to the German Government, which carried the term in its title and was picked up willingly by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and has become an eponym for a future project in the context of the high-tech strategy 2020. Currently an industrial platform consisting of three well-known industry associations named “Industry 4.0” is contributing to the dispersion of the term. Outside of the German-speaking area, the term is not common. In this paper the term “Industry 4.0” describes a future project that can be defined by two development directions. On the one hand there is a huge applicationpull, which induces a remarkable need for changes due to changing operative framework conditions. Triggers for this are general social, economic, and political changes. Those are in particular: Short development periods: Development periods and innovation periods need to be shortened. High innovation capability is becoming an essential success factor for many enterprises (“time to market”). Individualization on demand: A change from a seller’s into a buyer’s market has been becoming apparent for decades now, which means buyers can define the conditions of the trade. This trend leads to an increasing individualization of products and in extreme cases to individual products. This is also called “batch size one”. Flexibility: Due to the new framework requirements, higher flexibility in product development, especially in production, is necessary. Decentralization: To cope with the specified conditions, faster decisionmaking procedures are necessary. For this, organizational hierarchies need to be reduced. Resource efficiency: Increasing shortage and the related increase of prices for resources as well as social change in the context of ecological aspects require a more intensive focus on sustainability in industrial contexts. The aim is an economic and ecological increase in efficiency. On the other hand, there is an exceptional technology-push in industrial practice. This technology-push has already influenced daily routine in private areas.

Such options, on both capacity and output, play an important role in integrating longand short-term contracting between multiple buyers and sellers in such markets. This trend is especially important in capital-intensive industries, where improvements in fine tuning the coordination of supply and demand carry large economic benefits. Typically, such options are benchmarked (or defined) on the basis of spot market information conveyed through near real-time B2B transactions. This paper notes a broad set of goods and services currently being traded in both B2B short-run markets and long-term contract markets, and reviews economic and managerial frameworks that have been proposed to explain the structure of contracting in these markets. We provide a general framework based on transactions cost economics, and we use this framework to provide a review and synthesis of existing literature to explain various types of contracting linked to B2B exchanges in capital-intensive industries. The paper concludes with a discussion of implementation challenges and open research questions.

The project was part of a large-scale activity conducted over a 3-year period and was funded by the EPSRC under their Software Engineering for Business Process Change programme. The project has been looking at legacy systems and evaluating their potential for change. The methods adopted here are based on scenario generation and include an iterative process that attempts to ‘future proof’ organisational options for change. The empirical research presented in this paper took place within a large UK-based company that is structured around a call centre operation (referred to hereafter as CallCentre). The research focused on a particular job management function of the business (referred to as Works). Major problems were being encountered with the flow of work through the business process chain. CallCentre made it clear that the technology involved was inadequate to support the complexity and size of the tasks being performed. However, one of the main conclusions of this paper is that what appeared on the surface to be an information systems problem turned out to be much more to do with a need for change in work organisation and organisational attitude. Although at one level this challenged management expectations, it also had positive outcomes for the business. The OST demonstrated its effectiveness in highlighting the assumptions underpinning different technological and organisational choices at CallCentre and was able to assist the organisation in its decision-making process.

Business value attainment should be a key consideration when designing software processes. Ideally they are structured to meet organizational business goals, but it is usually difficult to integrate the process and business perspectives quantitatively. This research uses modeling and simulation to assess process tradeoffs for business case analysis. A model for commercial software enterprises relates the dynamics between product specifications, investment costs, schedule, software quality practices, market size, license retention, pricing and revenue generation. The system dynamics model allows one to experiment with different product strategies, software processes, marketing practices and pricing schemes while tracking financial measures over time. It can be used to determine the appropriate balance of process activities to meet goals. Examples are shown for varying scope, reliability, delivery of multiple releases, and determining the quality sweet spot for different time horizons. Results show that optimal policies depend on various stakeholder value functions, opposing market factors and business constraints. Future model improvements are also identified.	business continuity;commercial software;simulation;software quality;system dynamics	Raymond J.

In the last few decades a number of successful studies were reported in implementing performance measurement. However, very few studies were reported on performance measurement in businesses operating in construction industry. Hence the objective of this paper is to implement performance measurement in a business operating in the construction sector using action research. This study has shown that by introducing small changes in the construction industry through a structured performance measurement system (PMS) with appropriate management information systems (MIS), there are significant improvements such as successfully addressing all stakeholder requirements, focusing on critical improvement areas as well as bringing cultural changes (proactive management and decision making).

Information technology practices have been created to manage data from a variety of perspectives. The growth of data sources and the need to obtain more value from huge volumes have paved the advent of business analytics. Expectations from business managers and executives have risen accordingly. Today, the need to align the value of information and analytics to the resource-base of an organization has become the 'new normal'. Realizing this potential calls for new practices, i.e., IT-centric data management activities need to be complemented with business-centric practices that help understand raw and analytical information entities and their value to operations and strategy. This paper presents models and techniques to help assess the value of information and analytics at the realm of the asset base of organizations. The approach is based on models of business operations and the way information (raw and analytical) is connected to the organization and its business priorities. This linkage builds upon the notions of componentized business architecture, simplified information metamodel and basic relationship between the two concepts. A real-world case study in the insurance industry with the corresponding business architecture frameworks and information models illustrates the practical value of the approach.	align (company);business analytics;business architecture;entity;information model;linkage (software);metamodeling	Susanne Glissmann;Jorge L.

Adapting a well established supply chain portfolio, however, may involve high costs and expose a firm to unforeseeable risks. In this paper we address this issue. We differentiate business dynamics into product portfolio dynamics and global business dynamics and classify supply chain adaptation into high, medium and low. Building on these classifications we develop mathematical models to analyze how much supply chain adaptation a firm actually requires to respond to the business dynamics it faces. Our results indicate that supply chain adaptation may indeed be crucial for a firm to retain its competitiveness. The need for it, however, differs widely across firms. For example, a firm faced with product portfolio commoditization may be required to adapt its entire manufacturing footprint, while a firm with a high product turnover rate may not need to adapt its supply chain portfolio at all. Furthermore, the need for supply chain adaptation is not only determined by the business context a firm operates in but can be manipulated by the firm’s product portfolio decisions. Finally, we also argue that, to exhaust the attainable benefits, a firm should carefully align its supply chain portfolio with the employed supply chain adaptation strategy. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This is vital for this powerful methodology to deliver value to the company adopting it. There are several practices to implement and rely on simulation modeling for strategic and operational decision making, including hiring simulation engineers, building internal simulation team, or contract consultants. These practices are different in terms of budget, time to implement, and returns. In this paper, an innovative approach is described that provide a simulation solution that is affordable at the same time can be quickly implemented. it consists of generic interface that captures the information and structure of the supply chain then automatically generates simulation models. The user, which not necessarily a simulation expert, can quickly jump to the analysis and evaluation of scenarios. The paper presents a case study where the approach was implemented to model, simulate, and analyze NASA's Space Exploration Supply-Chain.	goto;simulation	Dayana Cope;Mohamed Fayez;Mansooreh Mollaghasemi;Assem Kaylani	2007	2007 Winter Simulation Conference		supply chain management;simulation;service management;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;simulation modeling;supply chain	AI	-67.61204439112318	17.81727710410822	165127

2a19c0faf5ef85670a73b64f5436a92c4e1f82b4	multi-agent systems and blockchain: results from a systematic literature review		Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) technology is widely used for the development of intelligent distributed systems that manage sensitive data (e.g., ambient assisted living, healthcare, energy trading). To foster accountability and trusted interactions, recent trends advocate the use of blockchain technologies (BCT) for MAS. Although most of these approaches have only started exploring the topic, there is an impending need for establishing a research road-map, as well as identifying scientific and technological challenges in this scope. As a first necessary step towards this goal, this paper presents a systematic literature review of studies involving MAS and BCT as reconciling solutions. Aiming at providing a comprehensive overview of their application domains, we analyze motivations, assumptions, requirements, strengths, and limitations presented in the current state of the art. Moreover, discussing the future challenges, we introduce our vision on how MAS and BCT could be combined in different application scenarios.	bitcoin;systematic review	Davide Calvaresi;Alevtina Dubovitskaya;Jean-Paul Calbimonte;Kuldar Taveter;Michael Schumacher	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-94580-4_9	accountability;management science;multi-agent system;blockchain;systematic review;computer science	HCI	-67.89507154172196	11.477697578675205	165436

They aim at optimising the management of manufacturing flexibility in turbulent environments through the offering of added-value services by system suppliers. However, they are currently defined at theoretical level and their economic sustainability for customers and suppliers has to be quantitatively demonstrated. In this paper, a methodology to assess the economic performance of flexibility-oriented business models based on probabilistic event-decision trees modelling is presented. The methodology was applied to a real industrial case and simulations were performed to identify win-win conditions that make business models sustainable for customer and supplier. Results allowed to understand which are the main variables determining flexibility-oriented business models’ success and they constitute a reference for companies willing to innovate their business model in this direction.

e3e66ce06cbd7b35a7a1be2f7c3f3d575301ac55	applying an open source software assessment model to select bi tools in public organizations		Public organizations face difficulties in manipulating data essential for implementing efficient management, which compromises the quality of the services provided by these institutions. The use of Business Intelligence (BI) tools can contribute to the improvement of the organizational processes of these organizations. However, the high financial cost, in many cases, makes it impossible for public institutions to acquire proprietary BI solutions. An alternative is the use of solutions based on free and/or open source software. To identify, among the available OSS-based BI tools, which is the most appropriate for implementation in public bodies, it is necessary to apply some specific model for evaluation and selection. The literature describes several generic methods for assessing and comparing OSS. In this work, we select a suitable method and derive a model for the comparison and selection of OSS-based BI tools able to meet the demands of public organizations. In addition, through a case study, we demonstrate how this model can be used in the selection of a tool that can contribute to the improvement of information management in an organizational environment.

Enterprise frameworks are expensive to develop and/or purchase, relative to system infrastructure (such as GUI and Choice Operating Systems) and middle-ware integration frameworks (object request brokers). However, enterprise frameworks can provide a substantial return on investment since they directly support the development of end-user applications and products [1]. In addition, the economic impact of framework technology is gaining momentum and therefore requires the attention of information and systems engineers as well as managers, executives, consultants, and researchers. System infrastructure and middle-ware integration focuses only on internal software development concerns. These are important aspects of an information system and are essential to the rapid creation and modification of highquality software, but they typically do not contribute to revenue generation for large enterprises [1]. In fact, corporate accounting accurately views the information systems department and its projects as cost center activities. Even though well architected information systems can yield a strategic advantage, an organization’s information system does not directly generate revenues. As a result, it is often more cost effective to buy an enterprise framework with a built-in system infrastructure and middle-ware framework rather than engaging in large-scale, in-house development projects [2, 3]. In order to realize the advantages offered by enterprise frameworks, it is critical that decision-makers understand the characteristics of a good enterprise framework [2, 3]. This column discusses the strategic budgetary, marketing, technical, and managerial advantages that impact an organization’s bottom-line and its ability to support and adapt to changes in the marketplace. Finally, we characterize the broader economic impact that we anticipate will result from the enterprise framework marketplace.	avionics;built-in self-test;efx factory;enterprise architecture;enterprise resource planning;enterprise software;graphical user interface;information system;software development;systems engineering;warez	David S.

dae6a0430d5bba268e2851a05a1d727808753be0	collaboration in value creating networks: the concept of collaborative commerce		A new development of e-business/e-commerce is the emphasis on collaboration aspects and collaborative interactions rather than external transactions. The resulting business model has recently been called ‘collaborative commerce’ or ‘c-commerce’. Various studies have shown the large potential of these enterprise strategies. Consequently enterprises will have to adopt approaches such as “collaborative commerce” (or “c-commerce”) to remain competitive in most industry segments. C-commerce should be considered a business model rather than a solution that can be offered by vendors. It benefits an enterprise by extending the enterprise’s visibility and cooperation throughout the value chain, thereby contributing to the realisation of virtual enterprises. C-commerce requires systems that enable enterprises to share information and collaborate in communities of interest. This paper discusses collaboration in value creating networks and positions and clarifies c-commerce. Some challenges and objectives for the next 3–5 years in c-commerce are presented.

ec8707fd4359475f1fcb5e67fd85883092bd4af8	modeling of technological performance trends using design theory		Functional technical performance usually follows an exponential dependence on time but the rate of change (the exponent) varies greatly among technological domains. This paper presents a simple model that provides an explanatory foundation for these phenomena based upon the inventive design process. The model assumes that invention – novel and useful design – arises through probabilistic analogical transfers that combine existing knowledge by combining existing individual operational ideas to arrive at new individual operating ideas. The continuing production of individual operating ideas relies upon injection of new basic individual operating ideas that occurs through coupling of science and technology simulations. The individual operational ideas that result from this process are then modeled as being assimilated in components of artifacts characteristic of a technological domain. According to the model, two effects (differences in interactions among components for different domains and differences in scaling laws for different domains) account for the differences found in improvement rates among domains whereas the analogical transfer process is the source of the exponential behavior. The model is supported by a number of known empirical facts: further empirical research is suggested to independently assess further predictions made by the model.	image scaling;interaction;probabilistic automaton;simulation;time complexity	Subarna Basnet;Christopher L.

They form a basis for establishing a new interdisciplinary research field. Diffusion of Internet, web services as well as deployment of mobile and pervasive technologies result in both industry wide and organizational transformations with far reaching micro- and macro economic effects. These transformations are triggered by pervasive ICT infrastructures, and new products and services that enable sustained product- and process-innovations. Examples of such innovations include Zero Latency Business, Mass Customisation, Enterprise Application Integration, Collaborative Supply Chain Management, Mobile Commerce, and Customer Integration in product development and distribution. Each one of them echoes deep changes that the Internet and Mobile Technologies are creating in that Internet and Mobile Technologies affect now all facets of production, distribution and usage of information goods and significantly transform development-, production- and distribution of physical goods.	enterprise application integration;internet;mobile commerce;new product development;personalization;pervasive informatics;software deployment;web service	Helmut Krcmar;Kalle Lyytinen	2005	2007 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'07)	10.1109/HICSS.2005.668	web service;supply chain management;computer science;marketing;operations management;mobile business development;digital economy;management;world wide web;commerce	HCI	-74.55281248793214	5.319027423031764	166432
a471ef0192ea1da7bf72323f3f35a58fa718bb20	conceptual methods to design sustainable it infrastructures - standardization, consolidation, and virtualization		Constructing IT infrastructures as a part of the enterprise architecture is influenced by aspects like customer’s requirements, and scope of technology. Today in discussions of designing new or redesigning existing IT infrastructures you may recognize the aspect sustainability, too. In relation to sustainability the keyword “green IT” is mentioned. First of all, we clear the scientific context and take a closer look at green IT and the sustainability of IT infrastructures. In addition, we show that the conceptual methods standardization, consolidation and virtualization can be assigned to the field of green IT, and that they influence the IT infrastructure and its sustainability. We gave also a practical example with a case study of the SAP University Competence Center Magdeburg's data center. In this case study we observed that from 2003 till today it was possible to reduce the power consumption (74%) and increase the performance (+ 60%) by realizing standardization, consolidation and virtualization as well as using new generation of hardware elements, and cooling systems. In conclusion, we point out that it is advisable for designing IT infrastructures to evaluate methods regarding to their benefit for sustainable. We have shown that common methods, documented in literature, can have a share for increasing sustainable IT infrastructures.	computer cooling;data center;enterprise architecture;hardware virtualization;magdeburg;requirement;semiconductor consolidation	Peter Krüger;Torsten Urban;André Siegling;Ronny Zimmermann;Hans-Knud Arndt	2012			virtualization;consolidation (soil);standardization;systems engineering;engineering	OS	-66.85172775865493	10.742875248538029	166864

Our main claim is that it is crucial, to achieve such goal, to build a global service framework able to account for complex processes involving people and computers, which however have always people at their ends. Thatu0027s why in this paper we mostly emphasize the role of social and business-oriented services, whose consideration is needed to evaluate the global quality of e-services in relation to their ultimate social benefits, taking the overall impact on the organizational structure into account. Along these lines, the contribution of this proposal is a first concrete step towards a unified, rigorous and principled ontology centred on the notion of service availability, which results in useful distinctions between service, service content, service delivery and service process. Services are modelled by means of a layered set of interrelated events, with their own participants as well as temporal and spatial locations.	dvd region code;ontology (information science)	Roberta Ferrario;Nicola Guarino	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-00985-3_13	service provider;public relations;service level requirement;service level objective;service product management;differentiated service;engineering;knowledge management;service delivery framework;service design;service guarantee;management science;services computing;data as a service;service system	DB	-67.65132059039274	12.44227316950522	167055

This study focuses on the evaluation of a health information system (HIS) adoption to intra-operating management of the anesthesia process in heart operation. We conducted a case study and applied the Lean method to the intra-operating management process. We applied the Value Stream Map and the A3 method as the common tools of the Lean method to evaluate the anesthesia process. Using the value stream mapping and A3 problem solving tool assist us to map the process and remove the “non-value” added steps and actions in the process, enhance data integration and process integration.

In order to manage major asset acquisition to transition new capability into the front line of Royal Air Force Fighter Groups whilst maintaining and supporting its current obligations, this paper looks at the steady state support solution and argues that in order to interchange from one support solution to a new architecture there must be a period of transition which may need its own short term business model and operational service. Preliminary study of several existing support solutions reveals the generic elements that need to be parameterised and traced throguh the trajectory. Research is continuing with detailing these parameters and validating through actual practical application of the proposed methdoology in this paper.		Kevin Downey;John P. T.

Change Management includes several activities, some of which need to evaluate the risk exposure associated with changes to be made to the infrastructure and services. We present a method by which risk exposure associated with a change can be evaluated and the risk exposure metric is applied to the problem of automatically assigning priorities to changes. A formal model is developed to this end; the model captures the business perspective by using financial metrics in the evaluation of risk. A case study, performed in conjunction with a large IT service provider, is reported and provides good results when compared to decisions made by human managers.	business process;change management (engineering);mathematical model;scheduling (computing)	Jacques Philippe Sauvé;Rodrigo A.

Since 1996, the Information Systems Audit & Control Foundation and the IT Governance Institute have published CobiT ® which brings mainstream IT control issues into the corporate governance arena. This paper illustrates how spreadsheet risk and control issues can be mapped onto the CobiT framework and thus brought to managers’ attention in a familiar format. 1. A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO COBIT 1.1. What is CobiT ? CobiT ® , Control Objectives for Information & related Technology is a tool set which helps business managers to understand and manage the risks associated with implementing new technologies, and demonstrate to regulators, shareholders and other stakeholders how, and how well they have done this. It is based on international best practice in IT management and control. The tool set facilitates IT governance, defined as “a structure of relationships and processes to direct and control the enterprise in order to achieve the enterprise’s goals by adding value while balancing risk versus return over IT and its processes” [ISACF 2000(1)] In an age where business is almost entirely dependent on technology, IT Governance is an essential element of wider corporate governance. 1.2.

This paper describes our experiences using the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) paradigm to help design a company-wide measurement program for Engineering Ingegneria S.p.A., an Italian software house. The introduction of the measurement program was supported by the Commission of the European Communities within the European Software and Systems Initiative (ESSI) as a Process Improvement Experiment (PIE). We found it necessary to supplement GQM into two ways. Firstly, we defined our measures rigorously in terms of entities, attributes, units and counting rules. Secondly, the original GQM plan was subject to an independent review. The most critical problem identified by the review was that the GQM plan identified too many productivity factors for any statistical analysis to handle concurrently. In order to address this issue, we developed an analysis technique based on a step-wise analysis of residuals. This has allowed us to identify the main factors affecting productivity and effort.

In order to use the project management information system efficiently, it is necessary to configure it according to project requirements. The project manager is not always aware of the most appropriate configuration for the particular project. Adequate knowledge would help the project manager define the configuration requirements. Knowledge in the project management area is divided into two forms: data and processes. To generate suggestions concerning data, grouping, statistical analysis and ordering of data items as well as analysis of semantic ambiguities are used. But concerning knowledge about the processes, differences between various process representations should be studied as well as evaluation of process similarity is required. The objective of the paper is to elaborate an approach to evaluate the project management process similarity and reuse of the project-specific knowledge when defining the configuration requirements.	dictionary;management information system;process group;prospective search;requirement;semantic similarity;xslt/muenchian grouping	Solvita Berzisa;Janis Grabis	2011	J.

The SIE system collects the experiential knowledge from the formal decisional events. This experiential knowledge is collected from the set of similar products having some common functions and features. Due to the fact that SIE system collects, captures and reuses the experiential knowledge of all the similar products apart from the knowledge about new technological advancements, it behaves like a group of experts in its domain. Through this system, the innovation process of manufactured products can be greatly enhanced. Moreover, entrepreneurs and manufacturing organizations will be able to take proper, enhanced decisions and most importantly at appropriate time. The expertise of SIE System is ever increasing as every decision taken is stored in the form of set of experience that can be used in future for similar queries.

33055a3818f8421b9d2f07ec37033ac2c2318e0a	a clinical system integration methodology for bio-sensory technology with cloud architecture		Here, we outline the design, implementation, testing and evaluation phases of our bi-directional semantic and syntactic interoperability framework interconnecting traditional healthcare, industrial telemedicine and IoT wearable eHealth-domains. Specifically, our study demonstrates system interoperability among a hospital information system, an industrial telemedicine instrument and an eHealth smart wearable consumer electronic product through the Open Telemedicine Interoperability Hub (OTI-Hub) embedded in a hybrid Cloud architecture. The novelty of this study is the handling of Internet-ofThingssmart healthcare devices and traditional healthcare devices through the same Cloud-based solution. This healthcare interoperability solution, service architecture and corresponding software engineering technique bridges technology barriers among the above-mentioned healthcare segments. Standard interoperability solutions exist and have already been described in related literature, but they are not applicable to the IoT healthcare devices and vice versa. Our study goes beyond isolated, individual interoperability solutions and seeks to bridge all major healthcare architecture frameworks including classical, telemedicine and eHealth IoT applications and appliances.nThis study presents the results of a two-year OTI-Hub Research Program. These experiments are manifestations of a trilateral cooperation among the University of Debrecen, Faculty of Informatics, the Semmelweis University 2nd Department of Paediatrics Pulmonology Division and an international hospital information system service provider.	system integration	Abel Garai;Istvan Pentek;Attila Adamkó;Agnes Nemeth	2017	Acta Cybern.	10.14232/actacyb.23.2.2017.6	mathematics;service-oriented modeling;hospital information system;enterprise architecture framework;discrete mathematics;systems engineering;data architecture;architecture;information technology architecture;interoperability;applications architecture	EDA	-69.02854980937923	10.66365284342751	168340

In an industrial setting pragmatic engineering issues related to the development and maintenance of agents come to the fore. In this paper a list of important engineering characteristics of agent architectures is presented. The list has the dual aims of providing evaluation criteria for agent users and design issues for agent architecture designers. Evaluation of an architecture with respect to the presented characteristics will allow industrial project managers to better assess the trade oŒs between architectures. Designing architectures that better ful® ll the characteristics should lead to more industrially relevant architectures and successful agent applications. This list is designed to start discussion and raise awareness of industrial issues. It is hoped that over time good metrics and an evaluation methodology evolve which provide a robust framework for evaluating agent architectures with respect to industrial concerns.	agent architecture;agent-based model;autonomous agent;autonomous robot	Paul Scerri;Nancy E.

As the goods go through various stages of the supply chain, the information undergoes numerous changes. For this reason, the IT systems used by all business partners to control the flow of goods and information within the supply chain must guarantee the integrity of information at every stage. Providing speed and accuracy of information in supply chains, is one of the main tasks of logistics controlling. In this manuscript the authors try to present the problem of integrating ERP in the supply chain and its impact on logistics controlling.	erp;logistics	Adam Kolinski;Pawel Fajfer	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-19536-5_48	supply chain management;process management	ML	-70.34641866767981	6.117285430245468	168579

Recently published papers show that the use of asset health monitoring technologies is being encouraged to improve the asset performance. This is based on reason rather than analysis. This paper aims to understand and assess the effect of different types of business processes for maintenance resource levels on the behaviour of the maintenance operations and asset availability located at different customer locations using different asset monitoring levels. Design/methodology/approach – A discrete event simulation (DES) model was developed to mimic complex maintenance operations with different monitoring levels (reactive, diagnostics, and prognostics). The model was created to understand and assess the influence of resources (labour and spare parts) on a particular maintenance operation. The model was created to represent different levels of asset monitoring to be applied in a case study. Subsequently, different levels of spare parts (...	simulation	Abdullah A.

The information spans from overall policies and standards to detailed guidelines, and the amount of such documents in larger corporations tend to be substantial. In business process models the aim is to model the same domain from a process perspective. In this project work we investigate the potential of utilizing text mining technologies together with a standard information retrieval system to link these two sources of information in a dynamic way. To test out the concepts we employ business process models and governing documents from Statoil ASA, a Norwegian oil and gas company.	business process;information retrieval;text mining	Tarjei Laegreid;Paul Christian Sandal;Jon Espen Ingvaldsen;Jon Atle Gulla	2006			business process discovery;artifact-centric business process model;data mining;business process modeling;computer science;business process model and notation;process mining;text mining	Web+IR	-72.72170588384638	10.789523271489218	168844

Selection of a formal software development methodology (FSDM) is usually left to the IS area which focuses on the detail component levels and features of an FSDM. The authors instead approach an FSDM evaluation from an organizational perspective. An organizational systems level (OSL) model should first be used to examine the potential impacts of a new FSDM on human resource policies and practices, organizational culture, structure and design, and work design and technology. Critical success factors (CSF) for an organizational FSDM are also discussed.	apache cocoon;business process;information system;job design;open shading language;organizational behavior;software development process	Daniel L.

Its unique safety requirements impose a serious challenge for the development of a safe electronic guidance system. In particular, the standard systems engineering methodologies applied need to be tailored in order to comply with the CENELEC railway standards EN50126, EN50128 and EN50129. From formal and traceable requirements capture to the rigorous verification and validation processes, the integrated development approach must provide not only a functional system in compliance with all stakeholder needs, but also evidence of quality and safety management in all phases of the life cycle. Once certification for Phileas is achieved, the chances for APTS to become an important player in the development of safe next generation vehicle intelligence are significantly increased.	documentation;guidance system;next-generation network;positive feedback;requirement;systems engineering;traceability;verification and validation	Jean-Luc Valk;Hans Vis;Gerard Koning	2010		10.1007/978-1-84996-086-1_8	reliability engineering;engineering;civil engineering;transport engineering	SE	-63.65852843693914	10.80332787788867	168945

1365fb9e31f4f996ec76cd1eb9eb9108e224e735	an agent based model of the evolution of supplier networks		We view supply chains as a type of complex adaptive system and develop an agent based computer simulation model of the evolution and performance of supply chains based on Stuart Kauffman’s NK models of fitness landscapes. Firms operate in networks in which they supply products to some firms and source inputs from others. They seek to maximize their own performance but they cooperate with other firms to gain access to inputs. We model firm performance in terms of the fit of its product with market demand and the contribution from first tier suppliers. The model uses genetic algorithms to mimic the way firms learn and adapt their products and supplier networks for more and less complex products and different switching conditions. We find that (a) as the complexity of the product increases, firms perform less well; and (b) firms build supplier networks with higher average in-degree, greater density, and significantly greater clustering to cope with product complexity. Our findings suggest that firms using highly specific assets or that face high switching costs are likely to pursue a supplier strategy that relies more on multiple suppliers and more clustered supply networks. Also, in industries characterized by highly specialized training, plants and machinery dedicated to specific products and other high product-specific transaction costs, we should observe more specialization at low levels of product complexity but less at high levels. The model contributes to our understanding of the evolution of supply networks, which is an under-researched topic, provides the basis for further extensions of the model and the development of more realistic models of actual supply chains. The model also provides a conceptual and methodological tool to assist firms and policymakers to better understanding the nature of supply chains and to identify and test strategies and policies.	agent-based model	David C.

The research work is focused on studying the possible impacts of Industry 4.0 on lean management (LM) tools which play a vital role to foster quality and reliability of products and services that are delivered to the customers. The LM tools which are impacted by the advent of Industry 4.0 and assisting in successful implementation of future smart factory will be investigated in particular focus. An interaction plot matrix is established to quantify the influence of LM tools on Industry 4.0. Interaction between these Industry 4.0 design principles and LM tools reveal several opportunities for achieving synergies thus leading to successful implementation of future interconnected smart factories. Overall, the research work serve as a guideline for industries that are under the transformation phase towards future smart factory and offers space for further scientific discussion.	industry 4.0;interaction;interdependence;interoperability;kanban (development);microsoft outlook for mac;production leveling;real-time transcription;smoothing;synergy;the matrix;trusted platform module;viable system model	Adam Sanders;Karthik R.

Among the main findings to emerge are the following: There is a wide difference between the formalised sequence of steps and stages prescribed by a methodology, and the methodology-in-action uniquely enacted for each development project. Also, there is much evidence which suggests that developers omit certain aspects of methodologies, not from a position of ignorance, but from the more pragmatic basis that certain aspects are not relevant to the development environment they face. Thus, methodologies are tailored to the needs of the prevailing development environment, and, being documented in a single manual often, are framed at a higher level of granularity which specify broad activities and objectives, rather than specifying in a very detailed fashion the exact manner in which development should take place. Additionally, the findings clarify the apparently contradictory position in the literature as to whether developer experience is positively or negatively correlated with methodology usage. The study would suggest that experienced developers are likely to use methodologies, albeit ones which have been heavily customised to the exigenceis of the particular situation.	color gradient;field research;software development process	Bob Fitzgerald	1997	Inf.

Corporate Data Quality Management (CDQM) describes the quality oriented organization and control of a company's key data assets such as material, customer, and vendor data. With regard to the aforementioned business drivers, companies demand an instrument to assess the progress and performance of their CDQM initiative. This paper proposes a reference model for CDQM maturity assessment. The model is intended to be used for supporting the build process of CDQM. A case study shows how the model has been successfully implemented in a real-world scenario.	business process;capability maturity model;data quality;reference model;requirement	Kai M.

European projects EQN and EU Cert have defined skills sets and a common certification scheme for about 20 professions, mainly in IT domain. A common way to describe IT domain from process perspective is concept ‘3S’ (software, systems, services). Software process can be seen as the first spearhead among these. First software process models, such as Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and SPICE, have existed already about 20 years. That is also the main reason to start process improvement profession from software processes, because we have much experience in that. Software Process Improvement Manager (SPI Manager) is one of new topics in EU Cert project. Development of SPI Manager training and certification scheme has been done in many small steps so far. This paper explains the current structure and main components of SPI Manager competences, training needs and certification scheme. Several other schemes will be developed in future for PI-related competences. Current version of SPI Manager skills set is based mainly on software, systems and service processes and their related reference models. It could be used in future also in other domains than IT.

The focus of ERP developers on the private and public sectors has widened the gap between user requirements and ERP system capabilities in deployments in international entities by preventing ERP vendors from learning and addressing needs that are unique to international organizations. This article presents actual experience during the early stages of the selection process of an ERP package in an international organization. It analyzes how to develop a Request for Proposal able to convey the needs of international organizations to ERP providers/integrators and that will effectively support an ERP application selection process.	business process;erp;enterprise resource planning;entity;procurement;request for proposal;requirement;user requirements document	Ildemaro Araujo	2006	IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications, 2006.	10.1109/AICCSA.2006.205216	marketing management;knowledge management;software engineering;database;computer security;information system	Robotics	-72.66428670286793	15.607481893687073	169815

It is becoming essential to efficiently manage it. Organizations are increasingly searching for more efficient and feasible ways in which to manage the content of their websites. Content Management Systems offer a solution by facilitating the creation of websites and providing content management. Many organizations are now using Management Content Systems. This increasing interest is apparent in the growing market of such systems and in the updates of existing systems. For an organization, the choice of a Content Management System is not easy, since this is a dynamic market shared among many different publishers. The offer evaluation process requires specific tools. In order to help these organizations in their choice, we have attempted to provide an analysis framework for these applications. This analysis framework designed to help organizations choose their application contributes to the evaluation of these applications. This article puts forward a Content Management software analysis framework and explains its application to a sample of 23 products. The size of this sample allows us to asses the strategic grouping of Content Management Systems. Effectively, the analysis results in the identification of two strategic groups whose main differences lay in the software characteristics and their target markets.

8423ffc02e09b0c12e0a25e1f38558ba6408e5ca	towards effective research recommender systems for repositories		In this paper, we argue why and how the integration of recommender systems for research can enhance the functionality and user experience in repositories. We present the latest technical innovations in the CORE Recommender, which provides research article recommendations across the global network of repositories and journals. The CORE Recommender has been recently redeveloped and released into production in the CORE system and has also been deployed in several third-party repositories. We explain the design choices of this unique system and the evaluation processes we have in place to continue raising the quality of the provided recommendations. By drawing on our experience, we discuss the main challenges in offering a state-of-the-art recommender solution for repositories. We highlight two of the key limitations of the current repository infrastructure with respect to developing research recommender systems: 1) the lack of a standardised protocol and capabilities for exposing anonymised user-interaction logs, which represent critically important input data for recommender systems based on collaborative filtering and 2) the lack of a voluntary global sign-on capability in repositories, which would enable the creation of personalised recommendation and notification solutions based on past user interactions.	application programming interface;collaborative filtering;global network;interaction;recommender system;software repository;user experience	Petr Knoth;Lucas Anastasiou;Aristotelis Charalampous;Matteo Cancellieri;Samuel Pearce;Nancy Pontika;Vaclav Bayer	2017	CoRR		engineering;knowledge management;data mining;world wide web	HCI	-68.3568829755257	11.023487526387624	170162

A number of proposals have been made for achieving strategic alignment. Despite still being a major concern for business executives there is little published research that attempts to give methodological support for achieving strategic alignment in day-to-day business. Additionally it seems that alignment needs to be investigated in terms of formulating and implementing IT strategy on lower levels of abstraction in order to analyze, monitor and control the desired results. At first this paper covers the design of an IT governance architecture, considering existing approaches of enterprise architecture and strategic alignment. Subsequently an approach for clarifying the domain IT strategy by designing fine grained artifacts is presented. By choosing this approach, alignment is more likely to be achieved in practice and therefore, IT strategy implementation is supported.	americas conference on information systems;artifact (software development);enterprise architecture;fractal dimension;information system;principle of abstraction;scientific literature;theory	Jens Bartenschlager;Matthias Goeken	2009			strategic planning;systems engineering;knowledge management;competitor analysis;enterprise architecture management;management science;enterprise architecture;business;technology strategy;strategic alignment;enterprise life cycle	AI	-73.54987473557287	10.341102917330232	170247

The framework is based on a context of adaptation of location, through telecommunications and transportation resulting in richer human presence, and its ensuing effect on the function and structure of enterprises. Eight principles or tenets are presented which exploit this context. We present principles of decision devolution, ubiquity, automation, human and system integration, distribution and decentralization to each provide forms of robustness through diversity. Principles of social coordination and management provide unity and bounds on this diversity.	control system	Dale Lambert;Jason B.

A prominent example of such an IT service is the user help desk that is often an integrated service, where different sub-services are being delivered by different service providers. Hence IT service providers face the challenges of integrating business processes and IT elements as well as service management tasks such as managing service contracts within a service delivering network more efficiently. Due to the dynamic nature of the IT services industry eliciting integration requirements is a crucial and recurring step in such endeavors. Hence we propose the foundation of integration patterns that supports eliciting integration requirements in two dimensions: process & IT and service management. Such patterns support reusing gained experience by capturing integration problems and proven solutions. Although our approach is still research in progress we present two pattern candidates.	business process;requirement	Michael Schermann;Tilo Böhmann;Helmut Krcmar	2006			service provider;service level requirement;service bureau;service level objective;service catalog;service assurance;service product management;application service provider;business service provider;differentiated service;systems engineering;knowledge management;service delivery framework;service design;service guarantee;process management;business;services computing;service desk;data as a service;customer service assurance;service integration maturity model;service system	DB	-73.87178422070859	9.684007522910688	170516

DSS will be in the form of web application in order to bring the most practical solution. The design of these algorithms is only one of the five stages of the research in field of data analysis. That means, the other stages will be described in this article only marginally - mapping the currents situation in this IT field, identification of parameters entering into the designed models, implementation of web application and verification of DSS using case studies. For each of these areas, a separate paper will be published later. Models presented in this article are ranked from the simplest to the most complex, in each case, the algorithm is demonstrated on a model example. DSS itself, which is the output of all research should facilitate decision of organizations about selecting a suitable analytical environment, application or platform. In other words, if the company has some amount of data and does not know what to do next. The only one thing the organization knows is the fact that data are a source of knowledge and time precious.	algorithm;decision support system;iteration;web application	Peter Michalik;Iveta Zolotová	2015	2015 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics (SISY)	10.1109/SISY.2015.7325355	decision support system;systems engineering;engineering;data mining;management science	Embedded	-66.36685517393754	11.970085309051715	170572

System development is seldom a linear progression from well-defined, fully-specified requirements to finished products that fully meet the initial requirements. More likely, there are ongoing cycles of exploration, design and implementation, taking into account evolving needs and capabilities, as well as lessons from earlier cycles. Existing requirements modeling and analysis techniques largely presume application settings that are stable and predictable. Can these techniques be used to support analysis in the new dynamic environment? Scenarios from the recent surge in demand for business intelligence capabilities in enterprises provide an interesting setting for examining organizational and IT responses to the challenges of high uncertainty and rapid change. In this paper, we apply existing requirements modeling techniques to these scenarios in order to uncover their inadequacies, and to identify research challenges.	color gradient;enterprise architecture;information systems;process modeling;requirement;requirements analysis;requirements management;snapshot (computer storage)	Eric Kai-Hsiang Yu;Alexei Lapouchnian;Stephanie Deng	2013	IEEE 7th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS)	10.1109/RCIS.2013.6577687	competitive intelligence;business requirements;goal modeling;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;software engineering;data mining;military intelligence;management science;management;information system	SE	-74.11484051107085	11.298955061491553	170683

Sports have offered many benefits beyond that of entertainment. At the time of this article, there exists not a competitive ecosystem for cyber security beyond that of conventional capture the flag competitions, and the like. This paper introduces a competitive framework with a foundation on computer science, and hacking. This proposed competitive landscape encompasses the ideas underlying information security, software engineering, and cyber warfare. We also demonstrate the opportunity to rank, score, & categorize actionable skill levels into tiers of capability. Physiological metrics are analyzed from participants during gameplay. These analyses provide support regarding the intricacies required for competitive play, and analysis of play. We use these intricacies to build a case for an organized competitive ecosystem. Using previous player behavior from gameplay, we also demonstrate the generation of an artificial agent purposed with gameplay at a competitive level. ar X iv :1 70 3. 04 87 4v 1 [ cs .C R ] 1 5 M ar 2 01 7 Department of Computer Information Systems Georgia State University	capture the flag;categorization;computer science;computer security;cyberwarfare;ecosystem;hacker;information systems;information security;intelligent agent;management information system;software engineering	Jovonni L.

Effects-driven IT development supports the management of a sustained PD process throughout design and organizational implementation. The focus is on the effects to be achieved by users through their adoption and use of a system. The overall idea is to (a) specify the purpose of a system as effects that are both measurable and meaningful to the users, and (b) evaluate the absence or presence of these effects during real use of the system. Effects are formulated in a user-oriented terminology, and they can be evaluated and revised with users in an iterative and incremental systems-development process that involves pilot implementations. In this paper we investigate the design, pilot implementation, and effects assessment of an electronic patient record. Effects concerning, among other things, clinicians' mental workload were specified and measured, but apart from the planned changes associated with these effects the pilot implementation also gave rise to emergent, opportunity-based, and curtailed changes. We discuss our experiences regarding conditions for making the specification of effects and their real-use evaluation central activities in IT projects.	emergence;emoticon;experience;iteration;iterative and incremental development;software development process	Morten Hertzum;Jesper Simonsen	2010		10.1145/1900441.1900451	simulation;human–computer interaction;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;prototype;law;information technology;formative assessment	HCI	-66.11714984203394	16.48415817489829	170814

One component of this integrated approach is a CBR-based experience management solution to support the dynamic aspects of IT security. The component - an intelligent IT security console - supports the daily work of the IT security personnel and supports them in systematically recording and using experiences in the form of weakly structured cases in their work process. The component is being developed in cooperation with an application partner. The approach is also used in projects with industrial partners.	case-based reasoning	Markus Nick;Björn Snoek;Torsten Willrich	2003		10.1007/3-540-45006-8_29	computer security model;web service;cloud computing security;case-based reasoning;simulation;security information and event management;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;database;security service;computer security	OS	-66.52774510498264	7.310540107800857	171017
12539212883af658301f943b858d91c9aefa63fe	hobbit: holistic benchmarking of big linked data.		Project Overview. Linked Data has gained significant momentum over the last years and is now used at industrial scale in many sectors including bio-medicine, plant manufacturing, smart cities, content creation and management, data journalism, asset management and storage, banking and many more. In these sectors, an increasingly large amount (volume) of rapidly changing (velocity) data in different formats (i.e., unstructured to structured data, variety) needs to be integrated (vocabulary), refined, curated (veracity) or even bundled (value) to serve as data basis for large-scale applications. However, deciding on the right framework to build a given pipeline is still a demanding endeavour. Works such as GERBIL [3] and BAT [2] point to the comparability of Linked Data solutions in the area of Named Entity Recognition and Linking being undermined by (1) frameworks being evaluated on different datasets (2) based on different implementations of homonymous measures as well as on (3) non-standardized hardware. This makes the comparability of the results presented across different publications rather difficult to establish. This reality however holds across the whole of the Linked Data lifecycle. HOBBIT aims to address these drawbacks by providing a family of industry-relevant benchmarks for the Big Linked Data value chain through a generic evaluation platform deployed on standardized hardware.

f7bbef4c367314de0be8ff746e84e2ba01e30ab4	digital ecodynamics in small firms: using information technology to compete		Today, digital technologies and content are integrated into almost all aspects of business and society. However, the Internet and related digital technologies continuously evolve, and businesses are hard pressed to fully utilize technology-related opportunities. The technologies in themselves do not necessarily provide business advantages but must be combined and coordinated with other firm resources to address business problems in innovative ways (Bharadwaj 2000; Mata et al. 1995). Used imaginatively, digital technology can “rapidly create new sources of competitive advantage, and concatenate a series of temporary advantages over time” (Tanriverdi et al. 2010, p. 822). Technology investments can spur innovation and increase competitiveness. Some firms use digital technologies (in particular, information technology or IT) to drive their business strategies, facilitating innovation and creating business value. As business activities are digitized or performed electronically, firms can share information with, and respond flexibly to, suppliers and customers; they can reduce cycle times, control quality, and improve customer satisfaction (Barua et al. 2004). Digital technology, along with other management, organizational, and environmental resources, can create business value (Barua et al. 2004; Bharadwaj 2000; Mata et al. 1995). It enables complementary strategic, operational and tactical initiatives (Sambamurthy and Zmud 2000).	competitive analysis (online algorithm);concatenation;digital electronics;internet;word lists by frequency	Yolande E.

234e26b450ee056b6883d955ea7c785675f1df21	comparing the openness of archetypical business-to-government information sharing architectures: balancing advantages of openness with the control of risks		Business-to-government (B2G) information sharing can benefit government organisations, as well as businesses. Yet, businesses are often reluctant to share, as data sharing might not just provide benefits but also entails risks. Therefore, a system supporting B2G information sharing should provide the appropriate level of openness, such that the advantages of openness and possibilities to control risks for businesses are balanced. At the same time, the information obtained by the government should be useful. We identified three architectural layers at which B2G information sharing architectures can have different levels of openness, viz. the Software Layer, the Access Control Layer and the Data Layer. In this work, we compare three archetypical configurations of architectures for B2G information sharing with different levels of openness. Our aim is to provide insight into their impact on the possibilities for obtaining advantages from information sharing and managing risks of opening up data. We found that the relationship between the different levels of openness and the advantages and risks of information sharing is highly complex. We discuss this complexity and find that different levels of openness are appropriate in different situations.	access control;business-to-government;existential quantification;openness;scalability;viz: the computer game	Sélinde van Engelenburg;Marijn Janssen;Bram Klievink;Yao-Hua Tan;Boriana Rukanova	2018		10.1145/3209281.3209350	access control;knowledge management;business-to-government;information sharing;data access layer;supply chain;government;computer science;data sharing;openness to experience	HCI	-76.8252687310709	11.991884953580719	171293

Enterprise value chains comprised of powerful business alliance partners will exceedingly compete as single entities for customers. Such extended corporations reach out not only with business relationships; they must integrate their business processes and information systems. In this paper, we review the business and technological requirements of modern extended organizations and explain how adaptive business objects and controlled interoperability are the key enabling technologies to the challenge of integrated value chains. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The risk due to failure of software in safety critical systems leads to severe consequences such as injury or death of humans. Medical instrumentation, railway signaling, and air traffic control are few examples of such systems. Safety-critical systems require the utmost care in their specification, design, implementation, operation, and maintenance. However, few other factors like timeliness, reusability, and cost are impaired. Safety Engineering Process is to identify, eliminate, or control hazards to acceptable levels of risk throughout a system’s life cycle. This paper gives a bird’s eye view of the impact of software failures on human society, outlines issues and concerns in this area of software engineering, and highlights future research directions to address these issues and concerns.

In many areas these technologies are being used to good effect. There is increasing evidence that current systems designs which owe much to Taylor and Deining notions of scientific management and quality systems may not always be appropriate. A new generation of technology is emerging sometimes called ‘Workware’. This technology tries to be ‘Idea’ or ‘Work Object’ centric rather than process centric.

Yet such boundedly open models are implied by open innovation literature and by the recent emphasis on client involvement  therein. The further amalgamation of traditional proprietary software licensing with open source licensing can be rationalised  through commodification of software, shift from products to services, the viability of the pure-form open source model, and  the continuing need for better operational efficiency. After reviewing other hybrid-OSS models, a very practical hybrid licensing  model is presented that responds to the need of software vendors in various vertical domains. Its benefits and limitations  are discussed, and it is positioned relative to the value co-production (co-creation) literature. A set of research questions  are raised to the information systems research agenda.

Two areas in particular are at the core: electronic commerce and supply chain management. Both have seen significant developments in recent years in business practice as well as in the academic community, emerging technology, systems, and innovative process models. Also impacted have been algorithms and methodologies, as well as creative implementations of early adopters that have created a rich field for research and practical applications. A total of seven papers will be presented in the two sessions of this minitrack. The first session introduces a number of concepts that assess the impacts of emerging technologies and electronic commerce on organizational relationships and inter-firm business processes. Raupp and Schober (best paper nomination) open the minitrack by introducing a formal approach to assess the strategic options of IT-supported organizational networks. Bichler then presents a classification scheme for the deployment of economic mechanisms in electronic commerce with a specific focus on negotiation processes. Robinson and Elofson continue the session by investigating whether the addition of market-making electronic brokers to a supply chain would increase the value of delayed product differentiation (postponement). The concluding paper for the first session looks more specifically at new technologies. Weitzel, Buxmann and v. Westarp outline an XML-based architecture to support business-tobusiness communication that could provide a viable alternative to expensive and inflexible EDI-connections. The second session of the minitrack emphasizes supply chain management issues. In the opening presentation Nissen builds upon recent work on agent-based supply chain integration to propose a set of techniques and tools to integrate process and agent design for the supply chain in an e-commerce context. Stricker, Riboni, Kradolfer and Taylor then propose the application of market-based workflow management in setting up supply chains for services which then would enable new forms of relationship between customers and suppliers. The minitrack concludes with a presentation that integrates the two previous sessions. Alt, Grünauer and Reichmayr use a case study to demonstrate how electronic commerce and supply chain management are inherently different and complementary at the same time.

However, SMEs typically do not have the time to invest in costly training programs and test the newest technology on their own. Most of the time they need support for their daily work processes, which often employ agile methods. In this paper, we exemplify how SE repositories can be employed to support such settings. A taxonomy for the content of such SE repository systems is given. Based on this taxonomy, we describe the internal repository structure of Germany's ViSEK portal: A portal implemented for offering up-to-date SE knowledge to support SMEs in their daily work.	software engineering	Raimund L.

We have identified some critical issues in literature that can explain this: the common use of classifying services as something homogeneous and not realizing the importance of splitting service processes into elements and analyzing each of these; identifying permeability with level of customer contact; thinking that permeability means variability and therefore is dichotomous with operation management optimization; not distinguishing between customization and personalization and not considering modern flexible/agile operation management approaches/algorithms. We hereafter propose an approach to face these issues and solve them methodologically. Finally we will show how what we are proposing has been able to sensibly improve performances in a case study.	agile software development;algorithm;mathematical optimization;performance;personalization;shadow volume;spatial variability	Vittorio Cesarotti;C.

Public service provision consists of two phases: informative and performative. During the informative phase, citizens or businesses obtain information before actually invoking a public service. This information includes required documents to be submitted, cost, responsible authority etc. The informative phase, although significant, has been overlooked at eGovernment literature. In this paper we present a notation for modeling the informative phase of public services as well as a set of indicators for measuring quantitative and qualitative characteristics of public services. We further present a prototype platform than enables modeling the informative phase of public services and automatically creating online dialogues to be used by citizens for obtaining personalized information on public services. We finally demonstrate the use of the platform by using the passport issuance public service.		Efthimios Tambouris;Vasiliki Outsetari;Konstantinos A.

As could be expected, this trend is influencing the area of software engineering at different levels. In software development, the amount of data available is becoming prohibitively overwhelming for analysis purposes with traditional techniques. As semantic technologies mature, they provide a consistent and reliable basis to handle large amounts of data. Besides, they enable added value, reasoning-based functionality to access such data in an automatic fashion. The authors present a system for supporting the design of teams for software development projects, which combines the benefits of semantics and social networks.

However, it appears that there is a need for an alignment approach that allows the continued operation of information system. In our work, we focus particularly on the operational alignment. Moreover, we deal with the topic of alignment by analyzing three levels: business requirement, business process, and software system. In this paper, we present an overview of this topic's concepts. Then, we analyze approaches related to our work by defining a set of criteria. Finally, we present the main idea of our proposed approach.	business process;business requirements;information system;software system	Maryam Habba;Mounia Fredj;Samia Benabdellah Chaouni	2017		10.1145/3149572.3149602	business process;information system;software system;process management;business requirements;profitability index;business;business-it alignment	AI	-73.24928169477701	9.705380895532416	173583

In many domains there are human experts whose knowledge is essential in building, interpreting and applying these models. However, the impact of integrating expert opinions into the decision-making process has not been sufficiently investigated. This research gap deserves attention because the triangulation of information sources is critical for the success of analytical projects. This paper contributes to the decision-making literature by (a) detailing the natural advantages of the Bayesian framework for fusing multiple information sources into one decision support system (DSS), (b) confirming the necessity for adjusted methods in this data-explosion era, and (c) opening the path to future applications of Bayesian DSSs in other organizational research contexts. In concrete, we propose a Bayesian decision support framework that formally fuses subjective human expert opinions with more objective organizational information. We empirically test the proposed Bayesian fusion approach in the context of a customer-satisfaction prediction study and show how it improves the prediction performance of the human experts and a data-mining model ignoring expert information. Organizational decision making often relies on a collection of intangible capabilities, which are invisible, subjective human-driven phenomena that include organizational routines and employee learning, and tangible capabilities in the form of procedural knowledge systems [1]. With the advent of (statistical) data-mining tools and computing power, the tangible capabilities for organizational decision making have become more important. In recent years this process has accelerated as a result of the exponential growth of electronically stored information, which is available to companies, organizations, and individuals. The literature on decision support systems highlights several application domains that have been significantly affected by this trend, including credit risk [2,3], bankruptcy prediction [4], customer relationship management [5,6], and fraud detection [7]. Typically, procedural knowledge systems take the form of statistical techniques that are incorporated into a data-mining system (DMS). In line with [8], we define a DMS as the """" complete """" system — the database or data warehouse, software for mining and analysis, the knowledge derived from these, and the part of the system that supports managerial decision making in a business setting.

This article explores the circumstances under which value is created in business networks made possible by IT. Business networks combine the capabilities of multiple firms to produce and deliver products and services that none of them could more economically produce on its own and for which there is demand in the market. We call this business network-based value creation. We apply economic theory to explain the conditions under which business networks will exist and are able to sustain their value-producing activities. Informedness has the potential to increase the complexity of consumer demand. Addressing this demand requires flexible production and delivery of products and services, and can be achieved by value-adding business networks supported by IT, standardized technology, and business process solutions. We also examine the benefits associated with business network-based value creation and fair value-sharing to support the sustainability of business networks. We develop a set of propositions and draw upon multiple case examples from the travel and hospitality industry to validate our theoretical perspectives on business network-based value creation. The results demonstrate that this industry is going through a digital transformation that makes it possible for many firms to engage in highly effective and innovative network-based value creation.	e-commerce	Robert J.

However, it has not been so well accepted in public administration. Nowadays, many projects for changes in government are related to electronic government. According to this, this article discusses the role of BPR in this context, its contribution to this kind of initiative, and if it is a required element to go forward. Also, the difficulties in carrying out the BPR in the particular case of e-government are analyzed, taking into account the characteristics of this kind of project, the stages that are generally involved and the environment in which it is performed. Finally, a basic structure for the development of egovernment is provided, specifying the insertion of BPR for reaching a more efficient, effective and foreseeable management of new projects.		R.

The ontology has five dimensions derived by parsing the problem statement, namely: (a) fostering methods, (b) fostering factors, (c) fostering functions, (d) knowledge types, and (e) knowledge sharing methods. Each dimension is a taxonomy of discrete categories. The exhaustive set of combinations of categories across the five dimensions, together with appropriate connecting words and phrases, constitutes a closed description of the problem. We map (a) the extant literature on knowledge sharing, and (b) the extensive experience of one of the authors in construction project management, to these combinations to synthesize (a) the current state-of-the-knowledge on the topic, (b) the gaps in it, and (c) an agenda for further research.

Similar challenges face defense contractors who need to respond rapidly to new requirements. The ARPA Manufacturing Automation and Design Engineering (MADE) program has been developing Internet-based tools, services, protocols, and design methodologies that will allow contractors to compose teams of specialists from different locations and organizations as project needs arise.

In this paper, we study the specific problems that can be experienced in the definition process of cloud software services when implementing cooperative procurement. In particular, we show the particular importance of the scalability of the contractually defined SLA themselves in this context. We propose some best practices. One is based on the use of meta-SLA and sub-SLA concepts. It is illustrated by an application on an innovative governmental cloud software services implementation program that was already described before.

ITSM uses the best practices of IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) that informs IT management what needs to be done and how it will get done from the process perspective. However when undertaking an ITSM a project to implement ITIL, ITIL does not provide a method for measuring quality or identifying and completing process improvement projects. By integrating the Six Sigma quality methodology, IT management will have the methodology and tools for measuring quality and improving processes. Adopting Six Sigma principles also helps IT managers focus on their business strategy and customers, manage proactively based on facts, and reinforce collaboration across the enterprise. The framework in our exploratory experience based research has been built upon a deductive study which has been developed through a literature review and synthesis and an exploratory inductive research which has been developed using a qualitative case study methodology in the e-services and mobile applications field.

It is argued that supply chain performance measurement is fundamental to efficient supply chain management. Over the past two decades, several frameworks and systems have been developed to meet this need. This study reviews the literature in the field of supply chain performance measurement and assembles an overview of those systems, approaches, techniques and criteria. For this purpose, 83 of 374 related articles from 1998 to 2015 were selected for final review using the Scopus and ISI databases. Findings disclose that performance measurement in supply chain contexts is still a fruitful area of research. The study also provides an overview of the performance measures employed in supply chain systems. These findings present a solid basis for future academic and practitioner work in the field of supply chain performance measurement.	system of measurement	Hasan Balfaqih;Zulkifli Mohd.

89afd739411b836cfc26168c47e7da21966ffb42	should this software component be developed inside or outside our firm? - a design science perspective on the sourcing of application systems	330 wirtschaft	From a national and global perspective, the sourcing of application systems has significantly matured and been widely adopted over the past years. However, little research has been conducted regarding the properties and contingencies of outsourced technological artifacts. In most scholarly published contributions, it is often difficult to find the IT artifact in the IS sourcing debate. Especially, it has not yet been explored on which rationales certain parts of an IS architecture are handed over to external vendors or kept in-house. In order to overcome this drawback, we focus in this paper on the outsourcing decision for components of IS architectures. This, in turn, directs the focus to the properties of software components and their surrounding contingency factors which may facilitate the decision to outsource a component or not. Thus, the unit of analysis will not be on an organizational or work group level, but rather on the level of a technological artifact itself: the software component which needs to be developed among others in order to achieve the desired system functionality. We are not aware of any research contributions in IS sourcing which have been conducted on a software component level so far. Thus, we aim to contribute towards an underexplored topic which is highly important since organizational decisions towards outsourcing are deeply rooted in the technical functionalities of the desired systems.	component-based software engineering	Tommi Kramer;Armin Heinzl;Kai Spohrer	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24815-3_7	systems engineering;engineering;marketing;operations management	EDA	-75.877346337891	7.455120732915027	176054

Business partners will have to prove to each other that they are adequately secured, before electronic commerce will really blossom. This can best be done through a scheme whereby information security can be evaluated and certified. To enable this, some international or generally accepted information security standard needs to act as a memorandum against which evaluation can be conducted. The British Standard, BS 7799, can fulfill this role as it is becoming very well known internationally. This paper proposes a scheme whereby information security, within an organization, can be evaluated against BS 7799 and certification can take place, if successful. This scheme will provide the mutual trust between business partners, as far as information security is concerned, that is required in electronic commerce.	bs 7799;information security	Lynette Barnard;Rossouw von Solms	1998	Inf.

End users of enterprise software are in a tough spot. While traditional desktop software and websites are increasingly designed with their needs in mind, unique challenges arise with enterprise software. Whether working with a specialized accounting system or a general-use intranet portal, users find themselves confronted with systems that are complex, difficult to learn and use, and dissatisfying. There are usually sound reasons for an information technology department to implement enterprise software, as opposed to building customized specialty applications. Enterprise software is attractive since total cost of ownership (TCO) calculations support a financial advantage. As Daniel Rosenberg stated, “In the enterprise software market, if the customers of your product are not successful you will go out of business...TCO is related to the real value the product provides [1].” Additionally, the integration possible with a comprehensive one-supplier solution helps streamline business processes. For example, the purchasing system’s database is accessible to the accounting system, and sales can be linked to inventory. Ideally, the end user is empowered and becomes more efficient and productive, but in the real world it’s not so easy. The power and high-level efficiency of enterprise software often bring complexity and a lack of flexibility. One of the primary challenges in the world of purchase-and-install off-theshelf (OTS) solutions is that end users are further removed from the creators of the software than ever before. Instead of user-centered design (UCD) professionals advocating on the part of the users to internal project-development teams, the challenge becomes advocacy to a completely separate entity in the supplier. For many, it’s a completely new approach that requires careful consideration. This article discusses the problems with OTS solutions and proposes ways to successfully implement them.	adobe streamline;bridging (networking);business process;desktop computer;enterprise software;high- and low-level;interaction;intranet portal;mind;purchasing;region of interest;total cost of ownership;usability;user-centered design;libotr	Kraig Finstad;Wei Xu;Shibani Kapoor;Sri Canakapalli;John Gladding	2009	Interactions	10.1145/1487632.1487635	systems engineering;knowledge management;world wide web	OS	-73.67089959425056	7.992885116813444	176424

These factors, caused primarily by the increasing demand for product variety and shortened life cycles, generate a number of issues related to the life cycle of manufacturing systems and networks. Focusing on the aspects that affect manufacturing network performance, this work reviews the exiting literature around the design, planning, and control of manufacturing networks in the era of mass customisation and personalisation. The considered life cycle aspects include supplier selection, initial manufacturing network design, supply chain coordination, complexity, logistics management, inventory and capacity planning and management, lot sizing, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, and supply chain control. Based on this review and in correlation with the view of the manufacturing networks and facilities of the future, directions for the development of methods and tools to satisfy product–service customisation and personalisation are promoted.	personalization	Dimitris Mourtzis	2016	Logistics Research	10.1007/s12159-015-0129-0	manufacturing execution system;marketing;operations management;computer-integrated manufacturing	Robotics	-75.98635000327475	7.463646577458802	176566

This paper proposes a model for Information Security Management, called an Information Security Management Model (ISM’), which puts all the various facets in context. The model consists of five different levels, defined on a security axis. ISM’ introduces the idea of international security criteria or international security standards. The rationale behind these is to enable information security evaluation according to internationally accepted criteria. Due to the lack of internationally recognized and/or accepted information security standards and criteria, this model cannot be implemented in its totality at this time.

Especially, more integrated approaches, like Dispersed Manufacturing Networks, present new challenges to decision-making, during all stages of product development and manufacturing, at strategic, tactical and operational levels for all companies involved. As a response to these challenges, this paper presents three models (Innovation Impact Point Model, Collaboration Model and Continuous Outsourcing Model) and a method for reconfiguration that support decision making in industrial networks. Together with the longer existing models for the Order Entry Points, these approaches will facilitate successful exploitation of industrial networks. However, many current approaches rely on the conversion to networks of models that fit the monolithic company. The characteristics of industrial networks call for theories and tools that address the instability caused by the interaction between the constituent agents and the dynamics for capturing market opportunities.	instability;new product development;outsourcing	Rob Dekkers;C.

From our perspective, it encompasses a set of situations in which different actors identified or unidentified, ratified or not, distributed in space and time, contribute to a sometimes ill-defined collective goal, using most of the time low-overhead web-based technologies. Doing so, people participate to a collective design that aims at generating a bunch of perpetually moving collective knowledge and decisions submitted to discussion, negotiation and sometimes dismissal. To avoid the design of services as a repeated """"one-shot"""" process we have gradually built a transverse software infrastructure that can be used in various projects aiming to design participatory services using complex knowledge and cooperations. Thanks to this “non-disposable” infrastructure, the participatory services designed take profit from the scientific outcomes of each previous project."""	autonomy;emergence;emergentism;experiment;fits;high-speed serial interface;open system (computing);overhead (computing);semiconductor consolidation;sociotechnical system;software engineering;transverse wave;web application;world wide web	Jean-Pierre Cahier;Aurélien Bénel;Pascal Salembier	2013	IxD&A		collective intelligence;knowledge management;software;citizen journalism;dismissal;business;negotiation	HCI	-72.63574579649242	4.204731427681146	177166

These alliances face a variety of challenges regarding an integrated approach to customer relationship management (CRM) by the partner companies. In this paper we describe the challenges derived from an analysis of five financial services companies that formed different financial services alliances. The main inhibitors of a consistent approach towards customers are found in business processes and information systems that are not sufficiently integrated. Some partner companies’ customer-oriented business processes only have an incomplete knowledge of their customers, which is especially conspicuous in after-sales service management and complaint management processes. The limitations of the information systems infrastructure are the source of most challenges in collaborative CRM processes. The partial standardization of CRM systems in financial services alliances inhibits the exploitation of economies of scale as well as the integration of systems. Consequently, obtaining a comprehensive view of a customer relationship becomes complicated if the integration of systems containing knowledge of customers, such as operational and analytical CRM systems as well as transaction systems, is limited. An increased integration of these systems has the potential not only to improve the quality of customer consultancy, but also to foster the exploitation of a customer’s potential.	americas conference on information systems;applications architecture;business process;customer knowledge;customer relationship management;emergence;information system;system integration	Malte Geib;Lutz Kolbe;Walter Brenner	2004			enterprise relationship management;customer to customer;customer relationship management;marketing;customer intelligence;business;customer retention;commerce;customer advocacy	DB	-76.01676743283001	5.878796516002637	177174

0f61a12445ea3f7b8898d715ae70e5a44d27fad1	specializing a design science research methodology for the domains of is/it management and it project management		This research-in-progress paper presents a research agenda to specialize an initial version of a design science research (DSR) methodology for social systems further for the areas of IS/IT management (ITM) and IT project management (ITPM). The methodology was synthesized based on the current state-of-the-art of DSR in the management discipline and is aimed at designing, instantiating, and evaluating management artefacts. The research agenda to specialize the currently very abstract methodology is divided three phases: 1) substantiating the elements of the methodology further for management artefacts by filling identified research gaps, 2) adapting the abstract methodology to the two domains of ITM and ITPM by reconstructing cases of the introduction of ITM/ITPM artefacts of practice, and 3) application of the substantiated and adapted methodologies to conduct actual DSR and design ITM and ITPM artefacts to solve classes of real-world ITM or ITPM problems. In the end, IS researchers can use the specialized methodology to conduct ITM and ITPM DSR while taking the special nature of organizations and management artefacts into account. Furthermore, the phases of the research agenda can serve as a foundation for further research on how to reduce the level of abstraction of artefacts in a systematic way.ion of artefacts in a systematic way.	ansi escape code;closing (morphology);in-phase and quadrature components;irish transverse mercator;partial template specialization;social system	Andreas Drechsler	2014			program management;opm3;knowledge management;management science;design management;project management triangle	EDA	-68.63311960662539	16.097509256937354	177352

Many collection methods are being used to capture those valuable resources. This paper introduces “VOC 3.0”, a new Voice of the Customer (VOC) collection method through customer co-creation. This new method is aiming to create value with customers through co-creation activities and exploit knowledge residing both in customers and company. This study identifies the differences of VOC 3.0 from other traditional VOC collection methods. We also propose a theoretical framework for VOC 3.0 and introduce the case of Fuji Xerox’s Customer Co-creation laboratory’s open laboratory as an example of a successful company with VOC 3.0. From this case study, key activities of the collection method are listed by using Process-Workplace-Tool framework. Findings in this study also show the examples of process, workplace and tool that might be key activities in VOC 3.0.	categorization;diversification (finance);exploit (computer security);finalize (optical discs);information;new product development	Weekij Sachamanorom;Dai Senoo	2016			marketing;operations management;advertising;customer retention;customer advocacy	ECom	-75.53261087705796	5.4455185023218915	177442

The IT program was not able to provide the basic assistance to the end-user, adequate reporting to middle and senior management, and lacked training of IT and end-user staff to venture into the rapidly changing technologies in network management, operating systems, data security, risk management, and systems integration, as well as, the need for innovative data management. The need for these services were exacerbated by increased demands on the IT services group and budgetary pressures restricting the resources available to accomplish the mission until an IT governance structure was adopted and the development and implementation of an enterprise architecture with corresponding risk management planning was undertaken. In order to overcome the inadequacies in the IT program, USCP established several ambitious goals for updating its strategic planning process, developing and implementing an enterprise architecture and risk management plan, setting up an IT governance structure to provide the necessary standards and guidance, as well as the relevance, accessibility, and timeliness of its information technology support.

In the past, threats leading to possible evacuation were primarily natural disasters. In recent years the broadened nature of threats, including hazardous material spills and terrorist incidents, has complicated this already complex problem. Its importance continues to grow, but there is still no consistent approach to tackle this problem. Plan development and evaluation are crucial to the plan's refinement which leads to successful response when an evacuation threat occurs. This research describes the issues inherent in planning and evaluation along with the complexities of constructing appropriate models for emergency preparedness and evacuation.	refinement (computing)	Kevin M.

Engineering teams are becoming more and more interdisciplinary and distributed, products and the environments they are created, used and recycled in are increasingly complex. Design engineers, system architects as well as requirements engineers and managers have to be able to understand the product and its whole lifecycle in order to be able to respect the constraints and requirements that are imposed on the product by different actors. Many of these skills have to be developed and improved in the course of a professional career rather than in initial education. This paper gives insight into the development of one component of a consistent qualification and certification scheme, which is in its entirety particularly targeted at Integrated Design Engineers in various industrial sectors.

In designing shared services in public administration various views need to be integrated in order to make well-sounded trade-offs. In this respect, it is often argued that there is insufficient support for structural reorientation and transformation of public organizations.The overall objective of this ongoing research is to support the planned change and transformation of public administration through the implementation and deployment of shared services. In this poster presentation we will demonstrate how flow-oriented, discrete-event simulation can be used to model and unravel shared services by capturing the organizational, business process, and application views. In this way simulation can support the diverse stakeholders that are involved in the structural reorientation of public administration. Moreover, we will show using case study how simulation can support decision-making and facilitate the making of trade-offs through what-if analyses.	business process;shared services;simulation;software deployment	Marijn Janssen;René W.

Coherence Management is an umbrella term we use to cover, and more importantly, stimulate research on relationships between identification, measurement, and action on phenomena which reflect tensions between information in requirements representations. Such tensions exist between information which is, for example, logically inconsistent, or stakeholders disagree on, or signals tradeoffs (meaning that improvement on some requirements, for instance, necessarily means some quantifiable (or not) deterioration of others). These tensions are an important topic of research in Requirements Engineering, and various methods have been proposed for the identification, measurement, and action on logical inconsistency in requirements models, on negotiating disagreements, and on settling tradeoffs. Despite focusing on related phenomena, these methods are different and each come with their own specific definition of when a representation of requirements is incoherent and what to do about it. This makes it hard to compare existing methods, design new ones, and choose those to apply when doing RE. In this short communication we outline our research agenda for developing a unified formal framework for the systematization and classification of Coherence Management efforts in the context of RE, as well as exploring their compatibility.	coherence (physics);constraint satisfaction;mathematical optimization;requirement;requirements engineering;settling time;software verification;umbrella term;utility	Alexander Borgida;Ivan Jureta;Anna Zamansky	2015	2015 IEEE 23rd International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)	10.1109/RE.2015.7320436	requirements analysis;software requirements specification;requirements management;economics;business requirements;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;requirement;needs analysis;requirements elicitation;management science;requirements engineering;non-functional testing;management;non-functional requirement	SE	-63.069356847815364	17.947318150667112	179515
16046b5849969d4519c84b09c598cbeb3faa3d0c	identifying and defining knowledge-work waste in product development: a case study on lean maturity assessment		Product development (PD) involves highly multi-disciplinary tasks that need to be accomplished in project mode. PD projects mainly involve knowledge work; due to the inherent nature of knowledge work, it is a a challenging task to use formal Lean concepts and definitions in the PD context. This manuscript first identifies and defines waste related to knowledge work in the PD context in general. Then, it proposes a methodology for assessing the status of PD maturity in relation to Lean concepts. A case study was carried out in an Oil & Gas (O& G) organization providing engineering services [i.e. an engineering contractor (EC)] that involves PD activities. The knowledge work related critical waste categories were identified using the suggested methodology as presented.		Felix P. Santhiapillai;R. M.

As businesses continually evolve, so do risks. Risk management becomes a crucial part of every successful business model to deal with uncertain and risky socio-economic changes. The emergence of supply chains which coordinate organizations, people, activities, information and resources dramatically increases risk crises. Efforts have resulted in process reference models, such as the supply chain operations reference (SCOR), which measures total supply chain performance. Although the SCOR model is designed and maintained to support supply chains of various complexities across multiple industries, the current version does not provide a basis for the risk management of projects and decision making workload. This paper attempts to propose an approach to bridge the gap between the SCOR model and risk management. Its underlying approach focuses on the types of threats in SCOR implementation projects and applies empirical benchmarks to measure risks in process elements.	emergence;money;risk management;threat (computer)	Jean Stephan;Youakim Badr	2007	2007 2nd International Conference on Digital Information Management	10.1109/ICDIM.2007.4444258	supply chain risk management;business model;supply chain management;reference model;it risk management;risk management;value chain;service management;knowledge management;risk management information systems;supply chain	SE	-77.18424385397704	7.492658152806361	180082

It is also well recognized that overall supply chain focus should be given an overriding priority over the individual goals of the players, if one were to improve overall supply chain surplus. Therefore, supply chain performance has attracted researcher’s attention. A variety of soft computing techniques have been employed to improve effectiveness and efficiency in various aspects of supply chain management. The aim of this paper is to summarize the findings of existing research concerning the application of soft computing techniques to supply chain management.	soft computing	Sunil Kumar Jauhar;Millie Pant	2012		10.1007/978-81-322-1041-2_40	process management;supply chain management;fuzzy logic;globalization;supply chain;soft computing;business;supply chain surplus	NLP	-72.55242296056856	6.777312940860085	180153

The author explains that in achieving software process improvement (SPI), the primary emphasis has to be on changing the behaviour of people—effectively a maintenance process. This book concentrates not on tools or technology, but on working together toward goals. While the book draws upon both European and American experience, the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) receives the most attention. This book, in spite of the word ‘business’ in its title, is as applicable to governmental, non-profit, research, commercial, and industrial organizations as it is to business. The real focus of this book is on discipline in software work processes wherever they may be found, a condition that appears to be applicable in software maintenance processes, although software maintenance processes are not this book’s nominal domain.

Such changes create a new system that bears little similarity to the current state and often involves significant risk due to the uncertainty involved with the new design. This paper outlines the steps taken to demonstrate the feasibility anla quantify the benefits of an innovative use of an automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS) and an automatic guided vehicle system (AGVS). These systems perform material handling tasks for fabrication, subassembly, assembly and packing by moving totes between these work areas. The complexity of this design prevented simple calculations of the costs, benefits and consequences. Simulation was required to dietermine the quantity and timing on tote transactions, enabling the project team to determine the peak level of tote transaction requests associated with various levels of production. After proving that .the design was feasible, the project team used simulation to quantify the costs, benefits and consequences of the new design, as well as identify additional o pportunities for improvement. The financial numbers generated from the model demonstrated the immense value of the new system and provided ample justification for corporate approval. Following corporate approval, the model has continued to provide benefits by supplying the material	business process;simulation	M. Thomas Jones;Robert Elliott;David Z. Ball;Gerald F.

Since this global communication medium naturally supports marketing-related activities, it is not surprising that the current literature highlights such usage. The web's business potential, however, goes far beyond just marketing. US companies are using the web to facilitate the entire range of primary business activities-from product/service design and production to marketing, sales, delivery and after-sales customer service. In addition to supporting traditional businesses and business activities, the web is providing a new locus for value creation and fundamentally transforming traditional ways of doing business. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive insight into the usage of the WWW by US companies to realize both operational and strategic benefits.	world wide web	Debabroto Chatterjee;Vallabh Sambamurthy	1999	Electronic Markets	10.1080/101967899359355	web application security;web development;the internet;business process execution language;web analytics;web design;business marketing;web accessibility initiative;web standards;computer science;marketing;ws-policy;space;webcast;electronic business;web intelligence;web engineering;web 2.0;new business development;world wide web;commerce	ECom	-75.36614670245397	5.586901279096553	180926

Lessons from a case study of one of the earliest tests of agile collaboration among small firms, the Agile Web, Inc. guides implementation. The study illustrates that small firm owners may not have the expertise, time, or inclination to initiate new opportunities outside their existing markets, nor can they effectively manage across unfamiliar enterprises. An intermediary or a domain expert is required whose major responsibilities include: the identification of market opportunities, forming collaborative teams, and project managing the resulting virtual enterprise.

83436a8870304968519c903841d80d6e4de15e16	obtaining key performance indicators by using data mining techniques		Currently dashboards are the preferred tool across organizations to monitor business performance. Dashboards are often composed by different data visualization techniques, amongst which Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) play a crucial role in facilitating quick and precise information by comparing current performance against a target required to fulfill business objectives. It is however the case that not always KPIs are well known, and sometimes it is difficult to find an adequate KPI to associate with each business objective. On the other hand, data mining techniques are often used for forecasting trends and visualizing data correlations. In this paper, we present a novel approach to combine these two aspects in order to drive data mining techniques into obtaining specific KPIs for business objectives in a semi-automatic way. The main benefit of our approach, is that organizations do not need to rely on existing KPI lists, such as APQC, nor test KPIs on a cycle, as they can analyze their behaviour using existing data. In order to show the applicability of our approach, we apply our proposal to the novel field of MOOC courses in order to identify additional KPIs to the ones being currently used.	data mining	Roberto Tardío;Jesús Peral Cortés	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-25747-1_15	data mining	ML	-66.95373196230187	13.28170161924681	181052

The traditional focus of aviation security is on preventive security aircraft and airport measures. When it comes to air navigation, the concept and scope of security is evolving. This goes in hand with the understanding and the implementation of security requirements and capabilities in new system developments. Security incident management is a research gap in the on-going transformation programmes SESAR and NextGen. This paper proposes an engineering concept for the development of a dynamic security incident management capability for the future ATM system context (e.g. SESAR) based on the findings of previous research and the associated development of a situation management framework model. The results obtained demonstrate the general applicability of the situation management modelling approach to the design and validation of such a dynamic security management capability as part of the recently launched EU project on Global ATM Security Management (GAMMA). A set of principal research requirements for this project is derived addressing the emerging need for security incident management capabilities in general, e.g. self-protection / resilience, emergency response. The proposed modelling approach and the anticipated GAMMA deliverables offer an opportunity to address the research gap of SESAR and provide novel technological solutions to the envisaged European Security Operation Centre recently proposed under the umbrella of the centralised services for European ATM.	atm turbo;airport security;centralisation;incident management;requirement;security management	Rainer Koelle	2014	2014 Ninth International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security	10.1109/ARES.2014.80	software security assurance;computer security model;standard of good practice;cloud computing security;itil security management;simulation;security information and event management;security engineering;systems engineering;engineering;information security;security service;network security policy;computer security;information security management	DB	-66.507092049547	9.337462119361373	181275
8ce06100778c9fa0862904c45107c617b10f2ea9	managing software processes: do we need new approaches?	software process	Dear Reader, Welcome to another issue of SPIP. This issue brings together a collection of papers focusing on different approaches to development. Software development has a range of methodologies, approaches, processes and life cycles used in different contexts. The diversity of processes, and the ideas they embody, enrich the disciplines of software development and software engineering. However, it is rare to see representatives of the full range of approaches covered in a single issue of a journal. In putting together this issue I have managed to do just that and in the process provided a broader insight into the approaches and solutions used by practitioners. With different approaches come different sets of problems and issues regarding adoption, growth and improvement. By positioning the papers together in one issue, it becomes possible to appreciate the true diversity within the discipline while also introducing new ways of combining, integrating and borrowing from other established processes. Approaches to development come in many different flavours. Put bluntly, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. A key challenge facing developers is the ablility to select the most suitable approach and in tailoring the approach to the context, organisation and environment. Burns, Klashner and Deek look to general systems theory to provide a more robust foundation for adapting existing approaches and methods based on identified general properties.

Besides, the rapid adoption of eBusiness has resulted in an ever-increasing set of complex applications and IT infrastructure components to be managed. Thus, in this paper, we address the substances specific for the complex service management and identify some possible problem areas arising from contractual agreements between involved parties as well as from the directions of where service management is heading nowadays. Initially we examine what may be perceived as heterogeneous and agile eBusiness. We perform an aspectbased analysis of researched scientific literature: a detailed assessment of various definitions, requirements and other facets specific to the dynamic nature of service management in heterogeneous e-Business environment. Furthermore, we evaluate business-driven against conventional approaches to design SLAs; finally we examine various service management models giving priority to on SOA architecture. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

e5efccdd27b14dd843a35fe1fdfaf91cf3356dfa	transformation of the efqm approach from business towards operations excellence		The purpose of this paper is to provide an enabler-based approach for a supervised self-assessment of operations excellence (OsE). Based on the latest approaches of excellence in operations from the literature as well as on the philosophy of the EFQM model, an OsE working definition was developed. In contrast to operational excellence (OE), which deals exclusively with the optimization of result driven processes, OsE promotes the enhancement of operation-specific enablers and linked results. The evaluation of crucial cause–effect relationships of relevant enabler and result criteria supports the determination of a company’s capability to achieve sustainability and excellence in terms of its operations. To foster a methodical integration of OsE in organizations, a phase model for a systematic assessment process was designed and verified with 24 companies in the Austrian machinery and metalware industries.	customer relationship management;definition;fractal dimension;interdependence;mathematical optimization;multi-level governance;object process methodology;top-down and bottom-up design	Andreas Jaeger;Kurt Matyas	2016	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-016-0665-8	systems engineering;engineering;operations management;management;mechanical engineering	SE	-71.39673396201225	8.349537826417825	181874

Organisations are facing the challenge to manage the knowledge and skills of their workforce in the context of human resource development. It is needed to prevent the crucial lose of knowledge for competitive advantage. Therefore organisations incorporate the concept of knowledge management. However, this concept needs technical support to provide employees a central platform for knowledge capturing and sharing. Corporate portals with their capabilities can facilitate this task as technical enablers. More and more companies realise that only implementing them doesn’t assure a successful initiative of knowledge management. However, distinctive barriers inhibit the effective usage of the existing knowledge within an organization. To be able to provide companies measures how they will overcome these barriers with the help of knowledge management applications an in-depth literature analysis is conducted. In addition to that experts have been asked about their opinions regarding challenges, critical success factors and barriers in the context of portal-based knowledge management. The results are summarized in a model of challenges, success factors and barriers to identify the factors which are relevant for the success of a knowledge management initiative. The analysis of various reference models in the area of portal-based knowledge management leads to the need of integrating these factors into those models. Therefore a reference model for portalbased knowledge management is created based on these results of literature analysis and expert opinions. A proof of concept for this reference model is conducted to ensure useful insights for practice. Three relevant facilitators (“content”, “context” and “community”’) for successful knowledge portals are identified. The thesis concludes with an outlook about the future of portal-based knowledge management.	knowledge management;microsoft outlook for mac;portals;reference model;service innovation;technical support	Christian Zietz	2010				AI	-72.16825690383939	9.740241144146307	182412
d5bdac31c85af25612f44de8e9aec692e4492a81	special issue: platform product development for mass customization	computers;mass customization;artificial intelligence;article;product development	Platform product development is a contemporary approach to agile product development for mass customization. Distinctive product variants are derived or customized from a platform that is defined as components and subsystems commonly shared across a product family. A well-organized platform is essential to connect different parties of an enterprise including soliciting customer needs through order fulfillment to field service. Hence, it is also critical to achieve the economy of scale by identifying repetitive applications of share tooling, knowledge, and other resources. In this Special Issue, we attempt to cover the different aspects of platform product development. The topics span a wider range of artificial intelligence (AI) disciplines, from knowledge representation to knowledge support systems. It identifies a fertile area not only for applying AI to contemporary issues of design and manufacturing systems but also for enriching the methodology for developing AI systems in manufacturing enterprises. Indeed, we consider that numerous successful applications in the industrial sectors highlight a future direction for productive AI applications in industry.	new product development	George Q.

d602b937cc83b38255bad26c03fe26bf6ad53e3e	inside story of business process reengineering in state bank of patiala (sbop): straight from the horses' mouth		In India, the changing dynamics of Indian economy have brought many reforms in financial sectors especially in banking and insurance sector. To meet new competitive challenges due to technology induction in banks and change in the customers’ perspective forced organizations to rethink about their ways of doing business operations. Consolidations, amalgamations, pressures to reduce operating costs stressed banking community to adopt tools like Business Process Reengineering (BPR) in order to bring strategic benefits to organizations. State Bank of Patiala (SBOP) has initiated BPR initiatives on the lines and under the umbrella of State Bank of India (SBI). The study attempts to determine whether there is an improvement in the competitive measures of cost management, customer service, quality and productivity of bank under study. In India, no such study on BPR in banking specifically with reference to State Bank of Patiala has been found so far. Thus, present study contributes to the research in banking with regard to BPR.	business process;code refactoring;synchronous backplane interconnect	Ratinder Kaur	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-19423-8_39	engineering;operations management;management	HCI	-75.58866487413118	4.396546391768893	182687
8a50530f46f4f2791116e7e174364b900ee47dff	functional service domain architecture management: building the foundation for situational method engineering	logic design	Functional service domains are logical design artifacts that are intended to achieve better business/IT alignment. Their widespread utilization clearly indicates their perceived usefulness in managing the complexity of aligning business structures with IT structures. However, a common understanding of functional service domains and the associated principles that govern their design and evolution is still missing. So far, the literature provides only little guidance in closing this gap. This article contributes to the foundations that allow for the design of a situational method for functional service domain architecture management. Reviewing current literature, a framework is proposed that supports the identification of functional service domain architecture management patterns. Based on a better understanding of functional domain architecture management approaches, situational method engineering for functional domains can be applied by identifying context types and goal vectors, designing fragments, and associating successfully adopted method fragments with specific situations. The validity of the proposed framework is tested by five case studies.	business logic;closing (morphology);cluster analysis;data validation;galaxy morphological classification;iterative method;mathematical morphology;method engineering;relevance;service-oriented architecture	Daniel Stock;Robert Winter;Jörg H.

Recently ”Standard Services Offerings” based approaches are proposed to reduce such cost where only a few set of versions and configurations are used to build an Enterprise IT services platform. A key challenge in these approaches is the choice of appropriate base set of configurations that can be used as seed configurations. Our paper addresses the above problem by studying several methods towards choosing the right set of application stack with configurations that minimizes the cost of building the target services environment from this seed set of offerings. We present four different methods and use model driven simulation studies to compare the performance of these approaches. We validate our key findings by analyzing our approaches for a large Enterprise customer IT environment.	greedy algorithm;k-medoids;medoid;random seed;simulation;state management;steady state;synthetic data	Sanghwan Lee;Sambit Sahu;Rajeev Puri	2012	2012 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium	10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211934	simulation;simulated annealing;computer science;operating system;cluster analysis;steady state;management;computer security;activity-based costing;computer network	DB	-71.20866034961129	18.062513127075135	183100

These initiatives inevitably involve redesign and alterations to the existing information systems that support the business processes. The implications for information systems and how an organisation’s existing systems can evolve to support a reengineering project is an area, which has been relatively under researched. Although it is recognised that information systems design and development is difficult in BPR environments, there is little overlap between research in BPR and systems analysis, so that there is no shared vocabulary and perspective. This paper examines how information systems redesign can be integrated with business process reengineering through a review of relevant literature and empirical research.	business process;code refactoring;information system;systems design;vocabulary	Vishanth Weerakkody;Wendy L.

The result now is that Public Authorities’ legacy systems are based upon heterogeneous and vendor specific solutions. To increase their efficiency is one of the most challenging issues that Public Administrations are facing in the latest years in order to ensure a faster communication among public bodies, avoid data redundancy and improve the service provided to citizens. The key element is to increase the cooperation among public bodies allowing a seamless communication which will not modify the already existing systems. The Friuli Venezia Giulia Region interoperability framework, presented in this paper, provides a layer which ensure the communication between Administrations increasing the efficiency of administrative procedures, through the adoption of secure electronic communication, and lead to the delivery of a better public service in terms of content and response time.	data redundancy;interoperability;legacy system;response time (technology);seamless3d;synchronization (computer science)	Francesco Sasso;Margherita Forcolin;Gilda de Marco	2009			engineering;environmental resource management;data mining;computer security	Mobile	-71.31822772838848	11.017664167130087	183940

An important dimension of eGov is electronic provision of public services. Consequently, considerable funds are investigated in developing Web-based public service provision (PSP) eGov systems. In this paper, we argue that the introduction of a relevant PSP domain model can provide significant benefits for all involved stakeholders. For this purpose, we start by identifying the relevant activities (prepare legislation, procure, develop and use eGov system) and stakeholders (politicians, public servants, consultants, ICT industry, citizens, and businesses). We thereafter survey relevant European research projects to conclude there is no comprehensive PSP domain model although it is a fundamental ingredient of relevant eGov systems. We then present the benefits and challenges from introducing a PSP domain model in the whole PSP value chain. The main benefits include reduced development costs, improved software quality, improved users experience and interoperability across different eGov systems. The main challenges arise from the universal dimension of the model, the lack of relevant methodological tools and the difficulties in building consensus.	domain model;interoperability;procurement;software quality	Efthimios Tambouris	2008	2008 Third International Conference on Digital Information Management	10.1109/ICDIM.2008.4746837	web service;user experience design;value chain;computer science;knowledge management;domain model;data mining;database;open system;law;world wide web;computer security;information system;standardization;software quality	SE	-72.17588624603324	14.029543725237492	183948

However, the implementation and configuration situation of a packaged application project may significantly differ from another. In this paper, we propose a generic method and model for assessing the cost and benefit of IT services using packaged applications. The proposed method utilizes a questionnaire-based approach to project scoping to capture the heterogeneity. The questionnaire also helps define rules to model the relationship between effort requirements and possible scenarios of packaged application implementation. The proposed method utilizes a rule-based approach to generate cost estimations of given IT service projects. For packaged applications, template data can be pre-defined and customized by using reference process and metrics models, and solution hierarchies. Then, for a given implementation scenario, the business value is estimated by using and customizing the template data. Once the cost and benefit of an IT initiative is assessed as described, other derivative analyses such as business case analyses and pricing can be done by using the estimated costs and business benefits.	agent-based model;benchmark (computing);best practice;business process;erp;logic programming;oracle database;requirement;scope (computer science)	Chunhua Tian;Shun Jiang;Rongzeng Cao;Wei Ding;Juhnyoung Lee	2008	2008 IEEE Congress on Services - Part I	10.1109/SERVICES-1.2008.21	reliability engineering;engineering;data mining;database	SE	-71.53137684835586	12.82865311305402	183960

In the e-business era the level of competitiveness is determined by agility, the ability to react and adjust rapidly to market and industrial changes and to overcome burdens originating both from inside and outside the SC borders. An agile SC addresses direct and indirect sources of risk, which expand outside the SC boundaries. Sources of risk in the e-SC have various origins, which cannot always be predicted owing to their dynamic nature, such as turbulence in oil or currency prices, physical or man made disasters, production failures, product recalls and so on. This paper proposes a Supply Chain Event driven Architecture (SCEDRA) to address unexpected and detrimental events during e-SC operations.	information system	Soultana Pavlou;Maro Vlachopoulou	2008	IJBIS	10.1504/IJBIS.2008.018042	supply chain risk management;supply chain management;economics;value chain;service management;marketing;operations management;electronic business;supply chain;management;information system;commerce	DB	-73.70569686360743	7.120201240189487	184056

In a peer-topeer financial interaction the loss incurred is usually the financial loss to the resources of the trusting peer that are involved in the interaction. Hence a way for the trusting peer to analyse the Risk in interacting with any trusted peer in order to decide wether to interact with it or not, is to determine the possible loss to its resources that are involved in the interaction. In this paper we will propose a methodology by which the trusting peer can determine the possible loss that could be incurred to it in interacting with a trusted peer.	interaction;peer-to-peer;trust (emotion)	Omar Khadeer Hussain;Elizabeth Chang;Tharam S.

The issue is particularly relevant for industries with highly engineered products and extensive supply networks. We provide insights on the impact of the adoption of collaborative design technologies by an aerospace manufacturing firm and how these relate to electronic negotiations. We provide a set of consequences of the adoption of this technology to add to the body of knowledge of the impacts of e-commerce in supply chains.	collaborative product development	Kevin Laframboise;Felipe Reyes	2003		10.1109/DEXA.2003.1232129	e-commerce;the internet;computer science;body of knowledge;supply chain;aerospace;new product development;computer-aided technologies	HCI	-76.5176057657628	5.319398308807131	184158

Such major changes in Automotive are light weight design, electro-mobility as well as modern mobility concepts, all increasing the product complexity. Increasingly an overall approach is requested that is able to consistently integrate Requirements, Functions, Logic and Physics (RFLP approach). Not only with regards to mechanical aspects, but also considering demands of electric/electronic as well as software development.The Systems Engineering approach is addressing the consistent availability and linkage of product information. Well established in aerospace and defence since decades the concept arrives in Automotives just right now, driven for example by the introduction of integrated product development environments. However the Systems Engineering introduction to an automotive OEM still might be a challenge. Typical obstacles are different structured and detailed design requirements (customer requirements versus vehicle requirements and component characteristics) as well as missing consideration of configuration, effectivity and maturity. Additionally the two dimensions of automotive consistency (Vehicle to component – vertical integration – versus integration of early concept stages via development, verification, approval until the final start of production – horizontal integration) contribute to the challenge.Finally also an improvement of interdisciplinary interaction is needed (mechanics including simulation, electric/electronics and software). The introduction of Systems Engineering is not only challenging the coordination of process IT infrastructure (Authoring systems, TDM and PDM) but also needs to consider organizational aspects (process and appropriate organizational units, integration of design partners and suppliers). Frequent acquisitions among IT system vendors – especially in the CAD/PLM/CAE market – as well as the need to select a system considering functional as well as economic aspects drive the demand for open interfaces.The presentation highlights the success and payoff of the application of Systems Engineering for Automotive processes. Implications for the process IT infrastructure coordination will be introduced.Necessary process IT adaptations will be addressed using target templates for processes, design system infrastructure, integration and mapping.Finally BMW’s concept to enforce openness from all OEM, Supplier and System Vendor based on the Codex of PLM Openness (CPO) will be discussed. Success stories as well as lessons learned will be shared.

785ee35c9412d08f94aac53b4d859b1ca612d687	improving health analytic process through project, communication and knowledge management		A health analytics process model is necessary to carryout projects in a manageable and a repeatable way without having to rely on the individual skills and experiences. This study is one of the first steps in developing a comprehensive process model for health analytics. Literature suggests that successful IT systems require project management, communication management and knowledge management dimensions. This paper explores the inter-relationship among these supporting dimensions on health analytic project performance based on apriori determinability of project requirements as per their difficulty and clarity. The data were collected by one author working as an intern in a health analytic department of a hospital. The findings from this case study will be useful in developing and evaluating a well-defined process model as well as a theoretical model to represent health analytics process model usability.	apriori algorithm;centralisation;computer simulation;expect;experience;feedback;iteration;knowledge management;process modeling;requirement;theory;usability	Supunmali Ahangama;Danny Chiang Choon Poo	2015			program management;opm3;knowledge management;management science;management process;personal knowledge management;project management triangle	HCI	-67.95676202432497	13.745267651145943	185760

Environmental consideration only emerges in most recent discussions under the label of green IT. As the evaluation of environmental and climate impact involves too many parameters, some of which are indirect and hidden, it is very hard to make rationale analysis without the support of a holistic strategic analysis framework. In this paper, we propose to extend the goal-oriented requirements modeling language, GRL, to model the rationality behind IT system design, in particular, how the environment related considerations come into play in such design decision making. It can be adopted as a strategic analysis framework to facilitate concrete decision makings under different environmental settings. Example real world scenarios are used to illustrate how the proposed approach can help improve the state of the practice.		He Zhang;Lin Liu;Tong Li	2011	J. Strategic Inf.

70f4cb9c42aa3d978e123d68d6e987c3d1e87dd1	a study on the priority decision making of it goals in cobit 5 goals cascade		Nowadays, as IT becomes a key element in most business models, it is very important for countries and corporations to create effective business / IT value from IT-related investments. To do so, the process and structure for business / IT value creation must be designed appropriately for the organization's goals and context. For this, the IT governance models that organizations can use typically include COBIT(Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies) 5, ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library), and TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework). This research helps to use the COBIT 5 Goals Cascade when companies use COBIT 5 to design processes for business / IT value creation. The COBIT 5 Goals Cascade is a mechanism that translates the needs of stakeholders into actionable and customized enterprise goals, IT-related goals and enabler goals. However, this mechanism does not give priority to what goals should be prioritized. According to the COBIT 5 Enterprise Goals to IT-related Goals Mapping table, multiple IT-related goals must be fulfilled to achieve a single enterprise goal. As a result, the IT-related goals for some enterprise goals will be much larger, confusing which goals should be undertaken. To contribute to this problem, this research presents a prioritized methodology that determines the IT-related goals that are more relevant to the organization's goals in realizing IT-related goals. This prioritization methodology is based on the AHP(Analytic Hierarchy Process) using the 'Balanced Scorecard' and 'Governance Objectives' as indicators.	binary symmetric channel;cobit;itil;norm (social);the open group architecture framework	Juhyeon Lee;Youngin You;Kyungho Lee	2017		10.1145/3149572.3149605	cobit;process management;the open group architecture framework;analytic hierarchy process;making-of;balanced scorecard;information technology infrastructure library;business;business model;corporate governance	Web+IR	-72.3607939853602	9.473483654156773	186104

SLRs are an important component of the evidence-based practice (EBP) paradigm, which is receiving increasing attention in information systems (IS) but has not yet been widely-adopted. We illustrate the model-driven approach to SLRs via an example focused on the use of BPMN (Business Process Modelling Notation) in organizations. We discuss in detail the process followed in using the model-driven SLR method, and show how it is based on a hermeneutic cycle of reading and interpreting, in order to develop and refine a model which synthesizes the research findings of previous qualitative studies. This study can serve as an exemplar for other researchers wishing to carry out model-driven SLRs. We conclude with our reflections on the method and some suggestions for further research.	amiga reflections;business process model and notation;digital single-lens reflex camera;information systems;information system;knowledge base;mathematical model;model-driven architecture;model-driven engineering;model-driven integration;programming paradigm;relevance;systematic review;theory;x86	Briony June Oates;Helen M.

There are still many people in manufacturing, health care, process reengineering and human factors industries who are not using any sort of simulation software and see no advantage to using this powerful tool. Even in the information age of the 1990's it is still hard for the potential user of simulation to find the necessary facts to keep up with the changing market of computers and simulation software. We focus on the changes in simulation software over the years, the ease of use of the 1990's simulation software, the broadening market for simulation software, along with a step by step approach to using Micro Saint simulation software in several key areas.	business process;code refactoring;computer simulation;graphical user interface;human factors and ergonomics;industrial engineering;money;programming language;simulation software;usability;what if	Catherine E.

This advancement in technology has often taken over the role of the designer carrying out calculations and providing solutions. This has resulted in certain cases; designers having very little to no understanding or practical experience of the manufacturing processes and the design calculations required to ratify product designs. The resultant loss of information and intent and the lack of exploitation of manufacturing constraints and product knowledge can and quite often lead to product re-design and in some cases failure in the hands of the customer. Research carried out here has studied knowledge management and the knowledge required to support the development of new products within the cold roll forming industry and analyses whether knowledge management to support product development can be defined as lean product development.	knowledge management	Alan Harris;Ahmed Al-Ashaab;Chike Odouza	2006			lean project management;systems engineering;engineering;operations management;new product development;manufacturing engineering;product engineering	DB	-64.48900264200833	12.437973099167282	186671
b1870e93e77b1211525ce764b3a333eb0d8a0ed7	book review: can we improve the ability to improve?		Improvement is key for organizations. In spite of its importance success rates of improvement and innovation projects are quite low. In this paper a book review of ImprovAbility: Success with Process Improvement is presented. The model, developed as a result of a study on the characteristics of successful and failed projects on the topic, presents 20 parameters that in°uence success and failure in improvement projects. The importance of software and its globalization have pushed software process improvement (SPI) initiatives to a higher level. However, SPI e®orts are not new. For instance, the founding of the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI) by the U.S. Department of Defense dates back to 1984 and rst technical reports describing the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) were issued three years later. Since then, many organizations adopted existing models and standards, such as ISO 9000 series of standards, ISO 15504, the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and the Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI) from the Software Engineering Institute (SEI). Many of these organizations have used considerable resources for SPI. However, investments in SPI e®orts often have not led to the overall improvements and failure rates are still too high.

Since then the necessity to capture and process real-time data from multiple sources has surged and needs to be considered in a world where everything must be exchanged and available anywhere, anytime and in any format. Yet the abstinence of novel approaches on the architectures of Enterprise Systems creates a gap between the increasing requirements and existing information systems. In this paper, we suggest a new architectural design approach, which will close the gap between increasing requirements and existing information systems. In order to determine a future-proof architecture, the authors conducted a Delphi survey where technology providers and users were inquired on the business needs and technical requirements. The result of the Delphi survey has been used to create a proposal for a different approach towards ES architectures.	anytime algorithm;enterprise system;software architecture	Eldar Sultanow;Carsten Brockmann;Renee M.

896a1e329f3b3000af45492ffe00864722086125	concepts and dynamics of the application service provider industry	application service provider	The enterprise intelligence through e-transformation is one of the cornerstones of the next-generation ebusiness era where the Internet constitutes the core business resource. Furthermore, the severe competitive landscape of e-business makes firms focus on their core capability and farm out staffing functions such as IT. Under this circumstance, enhancing intelligence and synergy through e-transformation will be accomplished by IT outsourcing via ASPs (application service providers). The ASP industry now provides an essential infrastructure for the Internet-based e-business transactions, thereby accelerating corporate e-transformation. An ASP is generally defined as a third-party service firm that deploys, manages, and/or remotely hosts a software application through centrally located servers in a lease agreement. ASPs started their business by providing online application programs such as ERP (enterprise resource planning) and CRM (customer relationship management) solution packages to corporate customers. The first customers were small companies or local branches of multinational companies where IT outsourcing was the only option to deploy IT resources due to financial or regional constraints. As seen in these cases, the biggest merit of employing ASPs is that corporate customers do not have to own the applications and take responsibilities associated with initial and ongoing support and maintenance. Consequently, ASPs are differentiated from the existing IT services in that ASPs provide IT resources to multiple corporate clients on a one-to-many basis with a standardized service architecture and pricing scheme.	customer relationship management;erp;electronic business;enterprise resource planning;internet;one-to-many (data model);outsourcing;synergy;web application	Dohoon Kim	2005			service provider;service delivery framework;service level objective;application service provider;process management;business;business service provider;service level requirement;service design;customer service assurance	Web+IR	-74.58826963727638	6.5210079024342065	187280

A Self Organising Map (SOM) is a dimension reducing transform that maps an high dimension information set to a two dimensional grid that is amenable to visualisation. This dimension reduction step is a key component of all financial analysis tasks. The potential of this method to identify structural change is investigated in the context of the problem of takeover target identification. Use of SOM analysis on two samples from different time periods charts temporal instability in the information sets of sufficient magnitude to breach the stationarity assumptions of standard statistical modelling methods, the results are confirmed by probabilistic regression analysis. This finding helps to explain the poor discriminatory power of many takeover target prediction exercises.	chart;dimensionality reduction;instability;self-organizing map;sensor;stationary process;statistical model	Fethi A.

Therefore, the need arises to clearly define the goals of the maintenance, in order to evolve and continuously enhance the management methods, to efficiently integrate the maintenance activities with the ones related to the production, the service provisioning, and the operation, and to use smart computer-based maintenance systems. This paper proposes a general maintenance approach and its specific application to the railway sector.

However computing applications in construction have been in general unevenly distributed across the industry. The significance of such a situation cannot be overstated, particularly in the North American context where fragmentation plagues the structure and the mode of operation of the industry. The paper attempts first to characterize the adoption of computing and IT tools by the industry, to describe the current status of this penetration as well as factors that prevent the practice from embracing the new technologies. Integrative approaches may hold the key to the development of a new generation of computing and IT tools that counteract effectively fragmentation in the industry. An on-going research project is briefly described to illustrate recent developments in the area of collaborative work and integration across disciplines for the conceptual design of building structures.

The technological innovation systems (TISs) literature has generated valuable insights into the processes which need to be stimulated for the successful development and implementation of innovative sustainability technologies. To explore the applicability of the TIS framework from the perspective of entrepreneurs, we conducted a case study in the Dutch smart grids sector. We found that the TIS framework generally matches the perspectives of entrepreneurs. For its use by entrepreneurs, we suggest a slight adaptation of this framework. The process ‘Market formation’ needs to be divided into processes that are driven by the government and processes that are driven by entrepreneurs. There should be a greater emphasis on collaborative marketing, on changing user behaviour and preferences and on the development of fair and feasible business mo...

While choices of the technology, method and organization are pretty straightforward; supplying the enterprise knowledge management system with cheap, reliable, relevant and fresh knowledge remains to be the key challenge for the enterprise KM program. This paper describes an internal, corporate system providing such services for the WiseWare IT KM suite. We outline the general context and follow with an architecture view of the KM workbench in the second sections. Some rationales and design decisions are given in the third section. We follow with some numerical figures and usage lessons. We conclude the fifth section with insights and useful advice.	knowledge management;numerical analysis;workbench	Kemal A.

861c1d20e69c90347c58e6ba09c2e1dcaa94e621	a network-based approach to capture provenance of a policy-making process		A policy-making process entails large sources of data for its creation, the tracking of which can provide a significant insight into a process and data that was being employed for its creation. However, a process employed for creating policies varies with each policy case due to different nature and requirements of policies. Therefore, a flexible approach is required to capture process details of different policies. Thus a novel autonomous provenance capturing technique has been introduced that is inspired from IP packet switching networking concepts. This novel technique is used with a model-driven approach to enable flexibility in a system. It is expected that this new technique will be able to systematically capture provenance in a dynamic sociotechnical environments.	autonomous robot;model-driven architecture;network packet;packet switching;requirement;sociotechnical system	Barkha Javed;Zaheer Abbas Khan;Richard McClatchey	2017		10.1145/3105831.3105850	computer science;data mining;database;sociotechnical system;internet protocol;workflow;provenance	SE	-72.0659549168001	13.633361833636163	188613

Sequential and cyclical work takes place in the value configuration of a value shop. While typical examples of value chains are manufacturing industries such as paper and car production, typical examples of value shops are law firms and medical hospitals. Often, such companies are called professional service firms or knowledge-intensive service firms. Like the medical hospital as a way to practice medicine and the law firm provides a standard format for delivering complex legal services. Similarly, police investigations represent knowledge work to solve crimes. The case of police investigations is presented in this paper.

It is a trending new enterprise system or platform which seemingly offers more features for acquiring, storing and analysing voluminous generated data from various sources to obtain value-additions. However, current research reveals that there is limited agreement regarding the performance of “big data.” Therefore, this paper attempts to thoroughly investigate “big data,” its application and analysis in operations or supply-chain management, as well as the trends and perspectives in this research area. This paper is organized in the form of a literature review, discussing the main issues of “big data” and its extension into “big data II”/IoT–value-adding perspectives by proposing a value-adding framework.#R##N#Methodology/research approach#R##N#The research approach employed is a comprehensive literature review. About 100 or more peer-reviewed journal articles/conference proceedings as well as industrial white papers are reviewed. Harzing Publish or Perish software was employed to investigate and critically analyse the trends and perspectives of “big data” applications between 2010 and 2015.#R##N#Findings/results#R##N#The four main attributes or factors identified with “big data” include – big data development sources (Variety – V1), big data acquisition (Velocity – V2), big data storage (Volume – V3), and finally big data analysis (Veracity – V4). However, the study of “big data” has evolved and expanded a lot based on its application and implementation processes in specific industries in order to create value (Value-adding – V5) – “Big Data cloud computing perspective/Internet of Things (IoT)”. Hence, the four Vs of “big data” is now expanded into five Vs.#R##N#Originality/value of research#R##N#This paper presents original literature review research discussing “big data” issues, trends and perspectives in operations/supply-chain management in order to propose “Big data II” (IoT – Value-adding) framework. This proposed framework is supposed or assumed to be an extension of “big data” in a value-adding perspective, thus proposing that “big data” be explored thoroughly in order to enable industrial managers and businesses executives to make pre-informed strategic operational and management decisions for increased return-on-investment (ROI). It could also empower organizations with a value-adding stream of information to have a competitive edge over their competitors.	big data	Richard Addo-Tenkorang;Petri T.

However, for the integrated health system (IHS) to function effectively in a complex inter-enterprise healthcare delivery environment, designers must focus on approaches such as soft systems methodology (SSM) to enable the design of robust integrated digital health systems (IDHSs). A service-oriented architecture (SOA) offers a flexible framework for IDHSs to become de-centralized, fully functional and modular systems with interoperability. This article identifies the design issues in IDHS and explores the potential of an SSM methodology-based SOA for the development of interoperable IDHSs. In the process we compare and contrast the functionalist socio-technical approach to the interpretive SSM. We also describe a prototype SOA application for an IDHS setting and discuss challenges in the application of SOA to healthcare.	centralized computing;clinical decision support system;interoperability;prototype;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;service-oriented infrastructure;sociotechnical system;soft systems methodology;systems design	Wullianallur Raghupathi;Amjad Umar	2009	IJITSA	10.4018/jitsa.2009070102	reliability engineering;soft systems methodology;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;operations management;service-oriented architecture	HCI	-69.2325751544706	10.275980470403162	189076

First, a deeper integration of all the actors in/each actor of the industrial system, from the raw materials suppliersup to the customerservice department dealing with customers’rising demands. This is known as the concept of “supply chain”, generally international as the market is globalized. The second evolution is due to an increasing need for flexibility and reactivity, on one hand to answer to an increasingly varied demand, and on the other hand to have a better reaction to the disruptions appearing in the increasingly complex manufacturing systems. These evolutions imply a deep modification of the structure of these manufacturing systems, progressively mutating from an hierarchical organization – where the decisions are taken level by level, top to bottom, each level communicating its decisions to lower levels – to a networked organization, each node of this network being to some extent an/more or less an autonomous decision center. This control concept is very attractive, as it enables to significantly increase the control’s robustness by considering modeling uncertainties and disruptions. However, very few academic papers deal with a detailed example of highly intelligent products in a context of product driven systems. This paper intends to show the evolution of a flexible manufacturing system, from a data oriented perspective to a product driven one.	autonomous robot;control theory;entrepreneurial network;evolution;network-centric organization;robustness (computer science)	Francisco Gamboa Quintanilla;Olivier Cardin;Pierre Castagna	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-35852-4_11	simulation;systems engineering;engineering;operations management	Robotics	-65.38184295745984	10.081505333434073	189094

Taking this issue into account the objective of this paper is to identify and analyse the weaknesses in the IS security defences of organisations from a holistic perspective, and propose a dynamic IS security governance process model for the implementation of appropriate controls and mechanisms for optimised IS security. Optimization is achieved through the strategic overlap of security and governance frameworks implemented in a prioritized phased manner for efficiency and effectiveness in cost, time and effort. The paper starts with the analysis of data breaches to identify the weaknesses in the organisational information system. This is followed by the analysis of recommended requirements and dimensions of effective IS security architecture, IS governance, concepts and models to identify relevant frameworks used in IS security and governance. Thereafter, the best practices for implementing the model is evaluated and finally the frameworks and IS entities are integrated into an optimized Information Systems Security and Governance (ISSG) process model.	best practice;computer security;data breach;entity;holism;information system;intrusion detection system;process modeling;requirement;threat (computer)	Mathew Nicho	2012			software security assurance;information security audit;computer security model;standard of good practice;cloud computing security;itil security management;security management;security information and event management;security convergence;information governance;environmental resource management;information security;data mining;security service;business;network security policy;computer security;enterprise information security architecture;information security management	Security	-74.81229733205298	11.408827566461284	189163

This paper explains the relations between strategic goals and business processes by adopting a regulation point of view. This point of view holds that the main property of business systems is their constancy. A business achieves constancy by regulating its relationships with other business entities. We model this constancy with maintenance goals which could be seen as a more precise definition of strategic goals. We then link these maintenance goals to achievement goals that correspond to operational goals. We further link these achievement goals with the business processes designed to achieve them.	business process;entity;point of view (computer hardware company)	Gil Regev;Alain Wegmann	2002			business model;business analysis;business transformation;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;operations management;management science;process management;business;business process;business process discovery;business rule;new business development;philosophy of business;business process modeling;business architecture	Web+IR	-74.78783967176905	9.281820598492134	189291

Design/methodology/approach – An exploratory case study was conducted at a paper mill and their main IT-vendor. Using a qualitative approach eight semi-structured interviews were carried out with representatives from both organizations. Findings – The paper identifies four critical challenges in the integration and adaptation of IT-infrastructure in the process industry: integration as an ongoing process; maintaining stability in the installed base; locking the right stuff in; and balancing user value, continuity of production and compatibility. Practical implications – Given the centrality of IT infrastructure in today’s process industries, the importance of dealing with these challenges must be emphasized. The four challenges identified in this study are of such a complexity that they can only lend themselves to the evolutionary strategy. Such a strategy is in concert with the sensibility towards risk found in the paper industry. Originality/value – This paper contributes by building on and expanding IT-infrastructure literature, as a result of exploring IT-adaptation challenges in process industry organizations. The findings also provide managers with a valuable insight into recognizing and handling these challenges.	centrality;lock (computer science);scott continuity;semiconductor industry	Lars Rönnbäck;Jonny Holmström;Ole Hanseth	2007	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/02635570710833965	information technology architecture;information and communications technology;information science;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;management science;evolution strategy;law;information technology	HCI	-75.90617384736674	5.464168359060528	189633

8b04bebd9fe3c845e716001393cbf6c46c834cf4	audit maturity model		Today it is crucial for organizations to pay even greater attention on quality management as the importance of this function in achieving ultimate business objectives is increasingly becoming clearer. Importance of the Quality Management (QM) Function in achieving basic need by ensuring compliance with Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI) / International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a basic demand from business nowadays. However, QM Function and its processes need to be made much more mature to prevent delivery outages and to achieve business excellence through their review and auditing capability. Many organizations now face challenges in determining the maturity of the QM group along with the service offered by them and the right way to elevate the maturity of the same. The objective of this whitepaper is to propose a new model –the Audit Maturity Model (AMM) which will provide organizations with a measure of their maturity in quality management in the perspective of auditing, along with recommendations for preventing delivery outage, and identifying risk to achieve business excellence. This will enable organizations to assess QM maturity higher than basic hygiene and will also help them to identify gaps and to take corrective actions for achieving higher maturity levels. Hence the objective is to envisage a new auditing model as a part of organisation quality management function which can be a guide for them to achieve higher level of maturity and ultimately help to achieve delivery and business excellence.	cpu cache;capability maturity model integration;customer relationship management;data quality;downtime;gene ontology term enrichment;smart meter	Uttam Bhattacharya;Amit Kumar Rahut;Sujoy De	2013	CoRR		systems engineering;management;service integration maturity model;people capability maturity model	Web+IR	-75.70231849089775	11.00448326009807	189693

Arguing that sensemaking from big data sources is a complex series of processes extending beyond just the application of sophisticated analytics, this paper proposes a big data reengineering BDR framework to guide requisite categorization, contextualization and remediation processes. The authors discuss the characteristics that uncertainty presents to organizations using big data streams as potential knowledge sources-surfacing relationships between the underlying knowledge flows and uncertainty and presenting typologies that categorize the effects of several common sources of uncertainty.

However, firms struggle with how to successfully implement API-enabled service innovation. APIs are either boundary resources through which platform strategies are enacted or they represent distribution channels for software, data, or infrastructure. We use a service innovation framework to integrate ten elements that determine business-oriented API design and that were discussed by prior API research. We report the preliminary results of a cluster analysis of 96 randomly sampled and qualitatively coded APIs. We identify three archetypes of API-enabled service innovation that are characterized by distinct configurations of API elements. We use a measure of API popularity to find structural differences of the archetypesu0027 market impact. With our planned research addressing the interplay of API design, ecosystem-based value creation strategies and API performance, we intend to contribute to theory that explains the impact of API design on digital innovation.	application programming interface;biological anthropology;service innovation	Jochen Wulf;Ivo Blohm	2017			knowledge management;service delivery framework;application programming interface;information management;service innovation;management science;software;computer science;popularity;service design;systems engineering;typology	HCI	-76.79117329372912	5.521167990443371	189943

The difficulties of reuse at the front end of the projects have overwhelmed the potential benefits downstream. Enterprise Solutions Structure (ESS) is designed to provide a rigorous and powerful structure to facilitate the sharing of experience and IT architectural assets across ISM'S solutions development community worldwide. The key question this paper seeks to answer is, can the ESS approach address this very real barrier and deliver the promised value? Described here by the consultants involved are a number of customer engagements in which the early ESS work was exploited. We show how relevant assets could readily be identified and the value they contributed to both our clients and ISM at different stages of the full engagement life cycle-at bidlproposal time, in contract definition and scoping, and during the engagement-and the continuing benefit after the engagement. Finally, we outline some of the challenges yet to be addressed. F ew people would argue that reuse of experience and """" piece parts """" is not a desirable objective. It is a standard engineering discipline in many areas. The promise of reduced time frames and lower costs and risks is an attractive one-indeed, with the growing complexity of today's IT (information technology) systems and the increasing business pressures to deliver them in shorter times, it could be regarded as an imperative. But it has proved an elusive goal. The significant costs of investing in standard, complete , and unambiguous ways to describe IT solutions are justified only if the intended experience sharing and reuse is achieved in subsequent projects and engagements. Many practitioners who have struggled with this will recognize that the key challenge is in representing the information in such a way that later projects can quickly identify relevant material and easily adapt it to their needs, without a detailed knowledge of the earlier project and without risking the integrity of the later ones.

Its proponents consider it a powerful software engineering too l that fosters a logical, disciplined approach to program development, resulting in programs that can be understoo d and maintained more easily . However, objective evidenc e that this is so is scarce, and in the business programmin g community, where COBOL is the dominant programmin g language,* universal acceptance has not been gained . The benefits of structured programming are taken for granted in much of the trade literature . But after six o r more years of general availability for business programming, many programmers do not use it, and with reasonabl e justification : They have not seen objective, quantitative evidence to prove its value as a principle of good programmin g practice . The case histories that have been publicized generally have not presented clearly defined comparative dat a to show that structured programming (and whatever othe r new project development tools that were also used) coul d account for an improvement in the programs . Many, an d perhaps most, system designers and programmers have, i n fact, become convinced . But the fact that many are stil l unconvinced is by itself enough to give legitimacy to doubt s about structured programming . This article provides some quantitative comparative dat a on structured and nonstructured programs . The data item s analyzed were chosen in an attempt to measure objectivel y the relative complexity of those programs . The sample pro grams were written for business applications in the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program. The results seem to show that, for these samples at least, structured program s are indeed less complex . Evaluation of the true worth of software engineering tools is important because of the tremendous investment made in those tools by their users .

This includes the request/reply style of the Internet and the Web, which is embedded in the IP and HTTP protocols, respectively. However, despite its many successes, there are problems with client/server computing. Choosing it as the default architecture can result in a mismatch between the client/server system’s request/reply style and the pattern of interaction inherent in a firm’s business models. The adverse effects of such mismatching are many: high operating cost, bandwidth bottlenecks, and, in a worst-case scenario, a lack of system scalability. With the objective of clarifying choices and guiding decision making in the design and selection of architecture styles, I posit a descriptively relevant conceptual framework. Based in communication theory, speech-act theory, and the information systems strategy literature, this framework will lay down elements of fit upon which business requirements and information systems characteristics can be matched.	business requirements;client–server model;conceptual schema;embedded system;enterprise architecture;hypertext transfer protocol;information system;internet;programming paradigm;request–response;requirement;scalability;server (computing);systems architecture;theory;world wide web;worst-case complexity;worst-case scenario	Christoph Schlueter Langdon	2003	Inf.

Traditionally, a single centralized model that encompasses multiple participants in the supply chain is built when optimization of the supply chain through simulation is required. However, due to the heterogeneity of supply chain, a centralized simulation model has a limit to reflect the dynamics of each supply chain participant. This research focuses on the conceptual and the technical issues about the supply chain simulation with a parallel and distributed simulation (PADS) concept. In particular, to ensure the decomposition of supply chain simulation model by each supply chain participant, the simulation framework is proposed using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) in e-collaboration environment. For a clear proof of concept, the virtual supply chain simulation model is implemented and experienced using business process modeling tools in SOA. Due to the reusable, interoperable, and scalable characteristics of the proposed supply chain simulation framework, various alternatives for supply chin optimization can be generated and evaluated.

This approach includes a variety of methodologies. The main part of that approach considers income allocation based on the realised performance. Therefore a concept for the order-specific performance analysis has been developed. Additionally incentive mechanisms are considered. By the help of that approach new impulses for the operative enterprise management and controlling are available.	profiling (computer programming)	Hendrik Jähn	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40543-3_16	environmental resource management;finance	PL	-75.79913268300572	7.754223275930067	190502

"""" Formative evaluation of electricity distribution utilities using Data Envelopment Analysis """". Abstract — The use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in the electricity distribution sector has been prolific in the number of papers published in research journals. However, while numerous studies have been documented, they have mostly been summative. Their aim has been predominantly descriptive and classificatory. This paper argues that evaluations of a formative nature are more effective than summative studies in promoting a better understanding of the structures and processes of electricity distribution utilities and, consequently, are more appropriate to contribute to performance improvement. To illustrate the use of DEA for formative evaluation, and highlight some of the difficulties of using DEA in practice, this paper compares the cost-efficiency of the Portuguese electricity distribution companies from 2002 to 2006. A dynamic analysis using Malmquist Indices is also conducted in order to evaluate the changes in productivity over this period. Our analysis shows that the application of DEA for formative purposes meets some difficulties. In particular it shows that whilst the modelling of productivity/efficiency scores using DEA is relatively straightforward, it is comparatively more difficult to develop models that are economically valid and that produce results with face validity. Based on the insights derived from this analysis the paper provides some recommendations regarding the successful application of DEA for performance improvement."""	data envelopment analysis;while	Sérgio P.

However, challenges exist that prevent these organizations from actually executing and successfully bringing simulation into their organization. From the lack of the right model building resources to missing upper management support to not having robust software, simulation initiatives can dwindle for various reasons. This paper will address why simulation is important, what makes a good project, who should build the model, the expected return as well as common pitfalls. Practical advice for organizations serious about developing internal expertise and conducting simulation projects will be provided.	robustness (computer science);simulation	Carley Jurishica	2010	Proceedings of the 2010 Winter Simulation Conference		structure–organization–process;simulation;model building;competitive intelligence;computer science;systems engineering;organization;knowledge management;discrete event simulation;management science;business intelligence;computational model	Web+IR	-68.03251042570278	17.758401229852446	190513

To help the decision making process, guidance is required. Enterprise Knowledge Development (EKD) is a method offering a guided knowledge development process. The guidance provided by the EKD method is based on a decision making pattern promoting a situation and intention oriented view of enterprise knowledge development processes. The pattern is iteratively repeated through the EKD process using different types of guiding knowledge. Consequently, the EKD process is systematically guided. The presentation of the decision making pattern is the purpose of this paper.	enterprise modelling	Colette Rolland;Selmin Nurcan;Georges Grosz	2000	Information & Software Technology	10.1016/S0950-5849(99)00089-0	decision-making;enterprise systems engineering;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;knowledge engineering;management science;management;software development process	AI	-64.13831644968658	14.582234353592472	190653

The proposed method of human-centered requirements elicitation is based on the situation -- transition structure which is a directed weighted graph that represents transition from one situation to another. We illustrate the proposed methodology through some case studies with open access data sets. Requirements thus elicited appear to be valid after manual inspection.

18c660659714223cff74bdad819798a94ad1c962	special issue on e-maintenance	special issue	With today's growing demand on system productivity, availability and safety, product quality, customer satisfaction and the decrease of profit margins, the importance of the maintenance function has increased [1,2]. Indeed the maintenance function plays a critical role in a company's ability to compete on the basis of cost, quality and delivery performance (maintenance synchronised with production requirements) [3]. For example, studies over the last 20 years have indicated that around Europe, the indirect cost of maintenance is equivalent to between 4% and 8% of total sales turnover (similar amount as for the direct cost). Thus, in the countries where modern maintenance practices have yet to be well adopted by industry, the potential savings from modern maintenance are massive. These modern and efficient maintenances imply to identify, at least, the root-cause of component failures, reduce the failures of production systems, eliminate costly unscheduled shutdown mainte-nances, and to improve productivity as well as quality. To support this role, the maintenance concept undergone through several major developments to lead to proactive considerations which require changes in transforming traditional ''fail and fix'' maintenance practices to ''predict and prevent'' e-maintenance methodology [4] (potential impact on service to customer, product quality, cost reduction.. .). The advantage of the latter is that maintenance is performed only when a certain level of equipment deterioration occurs rather than after a specified period of time or usage (from current meantime between failure (MTBF) practices to meantime between degradation (MTBD) technologies). E-maintenance is a sub-concept of e-manufacturing and e-business for supporting next generation manufacturing practices (NGMS). Therefore, e-maintenance is defined at the ''Intelligent Maintenance Centre'' 1 as ''the ability to monitor plant floor assets, link the production and maintenance operations systems, collect feedbacks from remote customer sites, and integrate it upper level enterprise applications.'' A more general definition is that ''maintenance management concept whereby assets are monitored and managed over the Internet.'' Indeed Internet regarded as a new technology, have led for some companies to replace conventional reactive strategy by proactive versus aggressive strategies [5]. It is a revolutionary change rather than evolutionary advance. In that way, e-maintenance is integrating the principles already implemented by tele-maintenance which are added the web-service and collaboration principles [6]. Collaboration allows not only to share and exchange information but also knowledge and (e)-intelligence (new services, new processing), and this not only between units but also between units, departments, experts, processes, companies.. .

This has turned consumers into multi-channel shoppers and rendered their channel choice unpredictable. Yet, a thorough understanding of multi-channel behavior is needed to influence it appropriately. We conducted a systematic literature review on the determinants of multi-channel behavior with a focus on services, and numerically assessed the research frequency of each behavioral influence. Our results show that multi-channel behavior is influenced by the stage of the buying process, the channel characteristics, the consumer attributes and the product category. Moreover, we discovered that services are under-researched compared to the retail sector. Based on these under-researched areas, we derive three research questions that enhance the knowledge on multi-channel behavior in the service industry. Further, we offer an outlook for an upcoming laboratory experiment.	microsoft outlook for mac;norm (social);numerical analysis;systematic review	Dennis Hummel;Silvia Schacht;Alexander Maedche	2016			environmental resource management;socioeconomics;management science	HCI	-77.25711918241322	5.002561311531692	190880
4c1d8eaa9a4ee81d90fc925244e402018d806657	increasing the probability of developing affordable systems by maximizing and adapting the solution space	systems theory;requirements	Abstract   The present research suggests that the size of the solution space, which for a given set of stakeholder needs is delimited by system requirements, relates to the probability of finding affordable solutions. As a result, the effectiveness of tradespace exploration techniques is limited by its size and internal ordering. Therefore, we suggest that there exist models to elicit and use requirements that, for a given set older needs, could facilitate the maximization of the solutionof stakehspace so that the probability of finding more affordable solutions during tradespace exploration is also maximized.The present research proposes a mathematical model of the requirements elicitation process that facilitates defining performance objectives for the requirements elicitation process in striving for system affordability. The uniqueness of this research lays on two elements. First, the requirements elicitation process is mathematically modeled so that their objectives with respect to the effects on the solution space can be mathematically, and thus rigorously, described. Second, the system of interest focuses on the definition of the solutionspace as a driver for system affordability instead of on its actual exploration. The present research closes therefore the loop between stakeholder needs, system requirements, solutionspaces, and system affordability. The results of the present research are generalized to discrete requirements, fuzzy requirements, and continuous requirements or value functions.	feasible region	Alejandro Salado;Roshanak Nilchiani	2014		10.1016/j.procs.2014.03.067	requirements management;data mining;management science;non-functional testing	Robotics	-64.33124184687789	16.769525680392025	191001

This paper proposes a new service innovation-based conceptual framework for designing new business models to create and capture the potential value of new technologies. By unpacking the theoretical constructs of various well-known business models from the extant literature and reframing them in the context of the """"value co-creation"""" principle defined by service dominant logic, this paper shows that """"service concept design"""" provides a conceptually sound yet practical method for incorporating the """"outside-in"""" end-user view of a new technology into a new business model design. From this mapping a service innovation-based conceptual framework is proposed as a foundation of a new business model design method. Amazon's famous technology-based retail business model is used to exemplify the practical applicability of the proposed new service innovation-based business model design method prescribed by the framework. In the process, the paper also sheds light on how service innovation may relate to business model innovation - a relationship which, to date, is not well understood."""	align (company);classification tree method;coherence (physics);exemplification;holism;monetization;requirement;service innovation;terms of service	Eng Chew	2014	2014 IEEE 16th Conference on Business Informatics	10.1109/CBI.2014.23	business model;product innovation;business domain;business service provider;business process reengineering;systems engineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;service delivery framework;marketing;service design;electronic business;business process model and notation;business;mobile business development;business rule;service integration maturity model;new business development;business process modeling;business activity monitoring;business architecture	HCI	-75.293594559717	6.858564971464185	191032
05af3e5d524d99c9be84587993fb506f51909fad	digital intelligence and chip design		The semiconductor industry has seen exponential growth in design complexity. Product development schedules are getting shorter, not longer, which means productivity per engineer must increase by several factors to keep up with the complexity increase. Semiconductor design activity produces vast amounts of data, but the design community has not been able to leverage data generated during the chip design process for systematic and structured insights and improved workflows. Fortunately, recent advances in datadriven approaches can be successfully applied to chip design. This paper seeks to enable a deep understanding of how chip designers can leverage data generated in their design process to improve the quality of results, time to results and cost of results.	big data;data system;information silo;quality of results;semiconductor industry;time complexity	Sashi Obilisetty	2018	2018 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test (VLSI-DAT)	10.1109/VLSI-DAT.2018.8373256	computer science;chip;real-time computing;new product development;leverage (finance);big data;workflow;quality of results;design process;integrated circuit design	EDA	-63.66745925625308	16.0579938109091	191108

Business users have to deal with changing information needs, but suffer from their inability of adapting the used information systems to support their changing needs. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, which act as the main source of information in many enterprises, are still too complex to be adapted to current information needs and working practises by business users themselves. Business users face considerable challenges when trying to use tools to create individual information artefacts to support and facilitate their working tasks. Targeted at improving the design of such tools, we started our design process with a qualitative empirical study, presented in this paper. The study discloses main problem areas business users face and identifies design challenges from an End User Development (EUD) point of view. The study was conducted as a combination of semi-structured interviews and a participatory design workshop, which were analysed to derive design constraints for EUD tools.	erp;end-user development;enterprise resource planning;enterprise system;information needs;information source;information system;point of view (computer hardware company);requirement;semiconductor industry	Michael Spahn;Christian Dörner;Volker Wulf	2008			user interface design;design;user experience design;social science;enterprise systems engineering;economics;human–computer interaction;knowledge management;systems development life cycle;user interface;management;systems design	HCI	-70.43924299042114	6.486196634955306	191341

To execute this important task efficiently the quality of these systems must equal their importance. This article presents a topology of Information Systems classification according to their purpose. Each type is further divided into sub-categories representing features that enable users to drive their business and reach their goals. This paper summarizes the quality attributes that may be considered as most important and relevant to each type of information system of the classification.

Unfortunately, as it is suggested by the results of the international survey on applicability of ISO 9126 (ISO, 2001) this sometimes may be the case among the developers as well. The proposed typology puts in hands of both developers and users a relatively simple tool allowing for easy identification of the minimal set of quality attributes required for their category of Information System. It also helps create a common knowledge platform useful when testing the system and even developing the contracts. OBJECTIVES OF THE RESEARCH The objective of the presented research was to analyze the relationship between the functional specifications of information systems and the sub-characteristics of the ISO 9126 quality model (ISO, 2001), and identify the most relevant of them for each category of information systems.

Employing IGS, a collective of individuals collaboratively and continually construct a collective-level graph by incrementally aggregating the individuals' working results. Each individual can work independently without direct interaction with others, facilitating mass collaboration among a large number of individuals. A conceptual model illustrates the effects of IGS.

To facilitate this process, different methods and tools for the development of new business models have emerged. Nevertheless, business model approaches are missing that enable the representation of cocreation as one of the most important service-characteristics. Rooted in a cumulative research design that seeks to advance extant business model representations, this goal is to be closed by the Service Business Model Canvas (SBMC). This contribution comprises the application of thinking-aloud protocols for the formative evaluation of the SBMC. With help of industry experts and academics with experience in the service sector and business models, the usability is tested and implications for its further development derived. Furthermore, this study provides empirically based insights for the design of service business model representation that can facilitate the development of future business models.	business model canvas;usability	Andreas Zolnowski;Tilo Böhmann	2014			knowledge management;marketing;business model canvas;business process model and notation;multimedia;business process modeling;business architecture	HCI	-75.98529278499956	6.228991378256012	192124

A Service Provider is an enterprise whose business is to manage the IT business of other enterprises. To manage its cost the Service Provider must host multiple diverse customers in a shared environment. The customers have unique business requirements, such as customizations of the processes based on customer policies and role, which the Service Provider must address while supporting the services in such a way that they provide functionality that appropriately spans organizational units, satisfying the customers' goals to be ITIL compliant and meeting the economic pressures of constantly reducing cost. The paper considers the impact that hosting multiple customers in a shared environment has on data segregation, process definition, and security, explores different models of Service Provider operations and outlines future work needed in this area.	business requirements;itil;multitenancy;norm (social);requirement	Larisa Shwartz;Naga Ayachitula;Melissa J.

af8f4d207816a2b4333a7cdd8891b2a4e722344c	organizational simulation in support of global manufacturing enterprises	risk analysis;organizational simulation;enterprise network governance;socio technical system behavior	In the past several decades, manufacturing has begun the process of transforming from a production firm centric enterprise into one in which a lead firm engages multiple partner and supplier firms in a networked enterprise to produce complex systems and products. Inherent in this transformation is the notion of global manufacturing as a socio-technical enterprise, co-emphasizing socio-interaction among firms with the more traditional technical focus on meeting production quotas, minimizing costs and maximizing profits. This chapter presents the methodology of organizational simulation as applied to the study and analysis of global manufacturing. Computer simulation has a rich history of application in analyzing the behavior and performance of manufacturing systems from a technical perspective, focusing on such concepts as forecasted product demand, production capacities and lead times, transportation capacities and lead times, inventory locations and levels, and production schedules, as well uncertainties associated with these factors. This perspective fails to consider socio-behaviors associated with firms and their interactions. Organizational simulation is a new paradigm whereby technical process modeling and social behavior modeling are combined to represent the behavior and predict the performance of the socio-technical enterprise. It has been applied in military acquisition, product design and health care. This chapter presents its application in global manufacturing enterprises, particularly to the issues of stakeholder alignment during change, alignment of stakeholder expectations and allocation of limited shared resources.	simulation	Douglas A.

The concept of composability has been a goal of the US Department of Defense (DoD) for many years, most recently taking the form of Platform-based Engineering. Despite this focus, the goal of effective modularity and design reuse has been somewhat elusive in the aerospace and defense sectors. This paper describes an ecosystem construct which incorporates market factors, business practices, and trends that occur in industries where composability and reuse have taken hold in order to identify a path forward for effective adoption of composability in the aerospace and defense marketplace. A number of examples of composable design are described, followed by proposals for necessary changes within the DoD ecosystem to facilitate its support. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Case management systems are evolving to handle the growing demand for providing operational support to knowledge workers involved in these processes. While enabling flexibility in human actions is an integral part of these systems, this capability increases the potential for errors in case handling. We propose a new paradigm of case health aimed at providing knowledge workers and supervisors a case health service to continuously and objectively assess both the current state of a case instance and provide a prognosis for the future state of the instance. The case health service is composed of constituent services each of which provide case health indicators and can be combined in flexible ways to determine the overall health of an instance. We have implemented case health with respect to a simulated credit card dispute scenario modeled in IBM Case Manager and evaluated the utility of computing the case health of running instances of the credit card dispute scenario. Results indicate the utility of incorporating case health in a case management system in terms of early detection of undesired outcomes and abnormal execution patterns in running case instances.	business process;content management system;execution pattern;floor and ceiling functions;programming paradigm;semiconductor industry	Geetika T.

Throughout the operational life of any system, changing regulatory requirements, additional safety evidence and a changing design can challenge the corresponding safety case. In order to maintain an accurate account of the safety of the system, all such challenges must be assessed for their impact on the original safety argument. This is increasingly being recognised by many safety standards. However, many safety engineers are experiencing difficulties with safety case maintenance at present, the prime reason being that they do not have a systematic and methodical approach by which to examine the impact of change on safety argument. The size and complexity of safety arguments and evidence being presented within safety cases is increasing. Nowhere is this more apparent than for Electrical, Electronic and Programmable Electronic systems attempting to comply with the requirements and recommendations of software and hardware safety standards such as   IEC 61508 [Functional Safety of Electrical/Electronic/Programmable Electronic Safety-Related Systems. International Electrotechnical Commission, Draft Standard, 1997]   and UK Defence Standards 00-54 [MoD. 00-54 Requirements of Safety Related Electronic Hardware in Defence Equipment. Ministry of Defence, Interim Defence Standard, 1999], 00-55 [  MoD. 00-55 Requirements of Safety Related Software in Defence Equipment. Ministry of Defence, Defence Standard, 1997], and 00-56 [MoD. 00-56 Safety Management Requirements for Defence Systems. Ministry of Defence, Defence Standard, 1996  ]. However, this increase in safety case complexity exacerbates problems of comprehension and maintainability later on in the system lifecycle. This paper defines and describes a tool-supported process, based upon the principles of goal structuring, that attempts to address these difficulties through facilitating the systematic impact assessment of safety case challenges.

Adequate Information sharing is one of the key factors which will highly improve the efficiency of supply chain. The cooperation models of supply chain are modeled and analyzed, and a two-dimensional enterprise symbiosis model is set up to analyze the symbiosis behaviors between enterprises and the symbiosis energy functions of the model to realize that how the enterprises get their competition advantage by supply chain. According to the analysis, the importance of suitable information sharing to supply chain is obvious. Moreover, a two-dimensional enterprise information sharing model is built to express how the information sharing affects the efficiency of supply chain. To different symbiosis models, the enterprises should share different rank information to meet the demand of symbiosis. The article gives a guideline to enterprises in supply chain that how to make information sharing strategy to get a satisfactory works efficiency at a low information sharing risk rank.	extended enterprise	Renjing Liu;Honghong He	2006		10.1007/0-387-34456-X_68	knowledge management;operations management;business;commerce;enterprise information system;enterprise life cycle	ECom	-75.69983966608692	7.053528851547246	193339

The method was defined on the basis of our experience where the authors participated as project members; the project developed in-house software development support tools based on a software product line. The method consists of a meta-model and processes for utilizing the meta-model. We analyzed the evolution of core assets in relation to an actual project. Tacit knowledge for prioritizing requirements was extracted, made explicit, and used to define decision rules and processes for applying the rules. These rules and processes were specific to the project. To develop decision rules and processes for applying them in other projects, we generalized the basic concept and defined a method for launching, applying and improving requirements prioritization decision rules.	requirement;software product line	Mari Inoki;Takayuki Kitagawa	2016		10.1007/978-981-10-3256-1_3	reliability engineering;software requirements specification;requirement prioritization;systems engineering;management science;simple prioritization	Logic	-66.38213967330994	17.360552603394822	193976

e024374f797769bb1327a09e98cd7dcdffa64ae3	data governance and semantic recommendation algorithms for cloud platform selection		Platform as a Service is the major productivity enabler in the cloud computing stack. By providing managed and highly automated application environments, it enhances developer productivity and reduces developer operations and maintenance efforts. The market, however, is fast-changing and offerings are differing conceptually as well as in their supported technological ecosystem. Therefore, provider selection is an important but currently not well supported step for companies trying to benefit from the technology. Influenced by the diversity of service offerings and the absence of applied standards this is a tedious task, especially for ensuring application portability. In this paper, we present a multi-criteria selection approach for cloud platforms based on a field-tested ontology and a comprehensive data set. The methodology is enhanced by semantic algorithms and mappings to reduce hidden query and data biases. This allows not only the exact matching of requirements but also the evaluation of possible alternatives that can be adapted to fit the defined requirements. We validate our approach by contrasting real user queries against the results of our semantically enhanced algorithms.	algorithm;cloud computing;data governance;ecosystem;platform as a service;requirement;software portability	Stefan Kolb;Guido Wirtz	2017	2017 IEEE 10th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)	10.1109/CLOUD.2017.89	computer science;data mining;semantics;cloud computing;knowledge-based systems;algorithm;software portability;data governance	Visualization	-72.07378578675913	12.04159665570815	194213

308b169d9e9dbdaa28c0d7f3791cfb672aff6d01	foster strategic orientation in the digital age - a methodic approach for guiding sme to a digital transformation		The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the need for a structured framework and instrument to support SME in adjusting their organizational strategy to environmental changes in the digital age. Since SME in particular face many challenges transforming their business, a structured and easy to use approach that takes into account the challenges and opportunities of an SME such as limited resources or high flexibility offer a high potential for success. A framework-based method named Transformation Compass extends previous instruments in including all relevant business aspects of an enterprise such as marketing, processes, change management or innovation and allowing a “thinking outside the box” approach while the impacts of the digital age are seen as digital enabler. Combing the different aspects of an enterprise based on basic principles of business management, the instrument is divided into four main building blocks that are Customer Centricity, Business Models, Operational Excellence and Organizational Excellence. Hence, the Transformation Compass serves as a starting point for strategic discussion and possible reorientation of the company.

This capability combines the prescriptive, top-down view of organizations, which describes how they work “on paper,” and the descriptive, bottom-up view, which describes how they actually work, by focusing on three components in the light of agent-based modelling and simulation tools—structural, functional, and normative. Our approach enables decision-makers to anticipate the evolution of an emerging crisis and evaluate the effectiveness of different configurations on the response. The initial results of our simulation, based on an experiment which investigates the impact of three separate parameters, are also presented and reveal the joint effectiveness of the organizations involved.	agent-based model;bottom-up proteomics;simulation;top-down and bottom-up design;video game graphics	Nicola Bicocchi;William Ross;Mihaela Ulieru	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642285	public policy;simulation;computer science;multi-agent system;top-down and bottom-up design;management science	Robotics	-66.48093929229695	9.266501408052742	194593

We believe that companies will pay for software as they pay for electricity and telephone. They will pay for what they use. We present why and when it happened. That it came from the outsourcing idea and became possible by the advances in the Internet. Software retailers will become service provides. The main points taken into account by companies when choosing a service will be: cost, usability, availability and trustworthiness. This model allow companies to reduce its initial investments in software.

What the industry thinks safety is and how it can be achieved are both questionable. This article looks at six safety-related assumptions, or safety myths, which can be found across most industry practices. These myths are related to human error, procedure compliance, protection and safety, root causes, accident investigation and ‘safety first’. We argue that while relying on such myths makes safety management easier, they also make it flawed and ineffective. Therefore, we propose a critical discussion leading to a set of managerial messages. In this paper, we present the six myths in sequence and then discard them through the analysis of various industrial examples. We then replace the myths with six clearer statements in order to build an alternative view of safety.	accident analysis;chaplin.js;endeavour (supercomputer);glitch;heart rate variability;human error;human reliability;human-based computation;interaction;mit engineering systems division;sociotechnical system;stored procedure;type safety;visual artifact	Denis Besnard;Erik Hollnagel	2012	Cognition, Technology & Work	10.1007/s10111-012-0237-4	human error;medicine;environmental health;engineering;suicide prevention;human factors and ergonomics;injury prevention;root cause;transport engineering;forensic engineering;computer security;mechanical engineering	Security	-63.942558780408724	7.000558223418361	195088

Today, companies collect feedback directly from customers, as well as indirectly from their products. As a result, companies face a situation in which the amount of data from which they can learn about their customers is larger than ever before. In previous studies, the collection of data is often identified as challenging. However, and as illustrated in our research, the challenge is not the collection of data but rather how to share this data among people in order to make effective use of it. In this paper, and based on case study research in three large software-intensive companies, we (1) provide empirical evidence that ‘lack of sharing’ is the primary reason for insufficient use of customer and product data, and (2) develop a model in which we identify what data is collected, by whom data is collected and in what development phases it is used. In particular, the model depicts critical hand-overs where certain types of data get lost, as well as the implications associated with this. We conclude that companies benefit from a very limited part of the data they collect, and that lack of sharing of data drives inaccurate assumptions of what constitutes customer value.	agile software development;feedback;new product development;waterfall model	Aleksander Fabijan;Helena Holmström Olsson;Jan Bosch	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-33515-5_4	data quality;knowledge management;marketing;data mining;customer intelligence;business	Web+IR	-75.79017840407231	12.627393946681568	195469

Specifically, the experiment compared the use of hypermedia systems development methodologies to that of conventional software engineering methodologies in enabling knowledge work processes during the development of hypermedia-intensive business applications. Results obtained indicate that there is value in effectively matching methodologies to application domain. Based on this finding, there is justification in employing strong-typed methodologies for systems design projects particularly in the cases where the application domain is quite specialized. Our results also suggest that Information Technology (IT) studies that assess methodology influences on the resultant Information System (IS) artifact need to include knowledge and/or cognitive elements and their related theories. Since systems development is knowledge intensive, inclusion of cognitive and knowledge aspects provide a more complete model of how methodologies influence the various aspects of the IS artifact. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Drawing from established theoretical work on trust and relationship marketing, a series of trust constructs and trust-building processes are synthesized to propose a framework for the formation of trust in customer-business relationships. The framework is conceptualized in the context of an electronic servicescape, where trust is formed through iterative interactions with promises being made, enabled and fulfilled. This research-in-progress paper concludes by describing the research approach for empirically validating the depicted relationships.	e-commerce;interaction;iteration	Panagiota Papadopoulou;Panagiotis Kanellis;Drakoulis Martakos	2001			business relationship management;knowledge management;e-commerce;marketing;relationship marketing;computer science;digital economy	AI	-76.25913228820045	6.447179208480311	196951

In particular, policies are a cornerstone for the governance system of financial institutions. In international organizations, a lot of policies span all country-local representatives and span all organizational levels. This work is part of a series concerning the improvement of requirements engineering methods for process-based organizations. This requires enhancing a shared vision between employees of the process responsibilities, by advocating cross-functional thinking with the focus set to the outcomes of the processes, and defining the outcomes in relationship with the business goals. We complement the works on business process models by the managers' concerns, i.e. the managers' responsibilities for value to be delivered by the processes. This research proposes a method for constructing policy models. Ontology is defined for interoperability purposes of the models of different organizational levels. The main formal analyse that is used for verification purposes is the reliability of the policy system and its impact on the reliability of the operational system which is one important objective of recent governance regulations.	requirement;requirements analysis	Christophe Feltus;André Rifaut	2007		10.1007/978-1-84628-858-6_3	financial regulation;knowledge management;business administration;business;international financial management	SE	-73.11225034303845	12.462947371057421	197616

One of the consequences of digitization and automation of transport processes is the identification and continuous increase of the telematics risk. To effectively eliminate the threats, it is necessary to conduct detailed analyzes which will provide an information about critical processes in the system, the current security level and the stocks of the most vulnerable components. In this paper the authors present a high-level risk analysis of IT systems on the example of weighing in motion system. The authors identified critical elements of the system based on assessment of their default ICT security level. In addition, the paper contains recommendations for changes to in the current security, which can significantly reduce the risk of attack for the presented system.	risk assessment	Wiktoria Loga;Artur Rygula	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-66251-0_37	automation;big data;business;information technology;risk analysis (business);risk assessment;telematics;intelligent transportation system;information and communications technology;reliability engineering	Crypto	-64.63817192178135	8.45289388567624	198185

Moreover, the cost associated with an integral socio-technical framework that addresses user needs for interaction, support and maintenance after the initial installation is the real driver toward adoption of robotics technology over equivalent human service.	internet;service robot;sociotechnical system;television;world wide web	Larry J.

Because of this, in early phases of the EE process, enterprise context models are often built and used to reason about organizational needs with respects to actors in their context and vice versa. However, far from simple, this task is usually cumbersome because of knowledge and communication gaps among technical personnel performing EE activities and their administrative counterparts. In this paper, we propose the use of strategic patterns expressed with the i* language aimed to help bridging this gap. Patterns emerged from several industrial applications of our DHARMA method, and synthesize knowledge about common enterprise strategies, e.g. CRM. Patterns have been constructed based on the well-known Porter’s model of the 5 market forces and built upon i* strategic dependency models. In this way technical and administrative knowledge and skills are synthesized in a commonly agreeable framework. The use of patterns is illustrated with an industrial example in the telecom field.	architectural pattern;baseline (configuration management);bridging (networking);customer relationship management;diagram;erp;enterprise engineering;frege–church ontology;hybrid system;level of detail;linear algebra;requirement;scalability;theory;whole earth 'lectronic link	Juan Pablo Carvallo;Xavier Franch	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-34163-2_3	enterprise systems engineering;enterprise software;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;operations management;enterprise integration;enterprise planning system;enterprise life cycle	SE	-73.13992319512937	9.221435902750526	199090

Compliance comprises all necessities for obeying legal regulations as well as mandatory norms, and violations can entail painful penalties. Since nearly all companies base their daily business on the execution of business processes (consciously or unconsciously), these business processes also have to be compliant. Hence, as part of business process management, business process compliance becomes increasingly important for companies. However, the checking of business processes for their compliance is – against the backdrop of many existing business processes and incessantly changing regulations – not an easy task. Several research approaches have been developed for supporting compliance checking. A common way is to examine the models of the business processes automatically to detect compliance violations with predefined patterns that represent possible violations. Unfortunately, only the fewest approaches are actually applied by companies due to high technical restrictions or difficult handling. The presented graph-theoretic approach strives to overcome this with a high level of simplicity and the applicability to real-world process models. For that, a real legislative passage is gradually transformed into an automatically searchable compliance pattern and applied to real process models.	backdrop cms;business process;consciousness;graph theory;high-level programming language;obedience (human behavior)	Steffen Höhenberger;Dennis M.

Through employing the technology of app stores, ERP and CRM vendors have been reported as shifting from delivering software as a service (SaaS) to platform as a service (PaaS). Through an in-depth case study of one ERP vendor’s app store initiative, the study identifies and discusses instances of negotiated order of the ecosystem. The results show that the introduction of an app store for ERP brings with it the threat of restructuring both the incumbent business model and the power relationships nested in the ecosystem, thus spurring intensified instances of negotiated order. This is discussed in terms of different arenas of conflict for negotiated order.	app store;customer relationship management;erp;enterprise resource planning;platform as a service;software as a service;software deployment;software ecosystem;theory	Johan Magnusson;Andreas Nilsson	2013	IJBIS	10.1504/IJBIS.2013.056140	business model;customer relationship management;ecosystem;economics;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;database;management;world wide web;computer security;information system	Metrics	-76.57261337487816	6.51537889105637	199305
d94c58598edfcfe6e8acf454fcd25e4fe0082ddb	economic assessment of virtual validation processes in the automotive development — an analytical approach		In the automotive development process virtual methods contribute significantly to the reduction of development costs and time. To further increase the use of simulation methods and support the management of the virtual validation process it is important to perform an economic assessment. The economic assessment is a complex task, as the virtual validation process is a highly decentralized process with a large number of boundary conditions influencing the simulation activities and therefore the process costs. In this paper we present a generic methodology consisting of a framework for the scenario-based economic evaluation of the virtual validation process. The main step of this analytical approach consists of matrix-based methods to model the complex virtual validation process and the dynamics of the boundary conditions. The integration of a process cost calculation and scenario selection in the matrix framework is presented and the benefit assessment is shown generically. The application of the approach is then shown in a case study with the discussion of the results. The presented methodology therefore significantly supports the decision-making process about the use of virtual validation methods during the development process of an automotive project.	biological system;commercial software;master data management;simulation;the matrix;user experience	Max Stanglmeier;Christoph Schafer;Robert Wandt;Michael Schenk	2018	2018 Annual IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon)	10.1109/SYSCON.2018.8369496	economic evaluation;industrial engineering;complexity management;automotive industry;process costing;validation methods;computer science	Visualization	-63.54403116834282	12.904535217216365	199418

The short case studies of Mobile-ICT illustrate that regardless of institutional orientation or process, the most important standardization strategy for equipment and service providers is to create platforms that are open to the development of complementary products and services while at the same time preserving the proprietary edge necessary to ensure lock-in effects. Both cases yield strong reasons to doubt whether many of the traditional advantages of standardization (interoperability, economies of scale, positive externalities etc.) will be achieved equitably for all of the stakeholders.	interoperability;linkage (software);programming paradigm	Pieter Ballon;Richard Hawkins	2007	2007 5th International Conference on Standardization and Innovation in Information Technology	10.1109/SIIT.2007.4629323	service provider;business model;mobile telephony;economics;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;economies of scale;marketing;operations management;advertising;management;digital video broadcasting;complementary good;standardization	Robotics	-73.53786474860038	14.060592074669055	199595

Nowadays, Service-Oriented Architectures begin to be promoted as a new field where companies may  realize their visions and put all their new strategies in practice.    Although they initially were focused on intra-organizational integration efforts, now they begin to be used for inter-organizational  business processes engineering support in networked organizations. But, when implementing these kinds of initiatives, successful  histories are mostly linked to major companies, with considerable budgets allocated to the project.        By counterpart, the INPREX project (Spanish acronym for Interoperability in Extended Processes), here presented, falls out  this category. By contrast, this is an undergoing initiative leaded by a Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) and founded by  a local government in Spain. In this work, we will present main project’s achievements where the IDIERE Platform is used to  improve the co-ordination in a Networked Organization scenario. Five SMEs are involved in a project which main objective is  to deploy a low cost and scalable platform that allows them to improve a Collaborative Production Planning business process.      	service-oriented architecture	Rubén Darío Franco;Ángel Ortiz Bas;Rosa Navarro	2005		10.1007/0-387-29360-4_47	systems engineering;operations management;computer engineering	AI	-70.89755883961837	11.044727175615042	199609

Two exploratory cases based in the Netherlands were studied under the framework. Preliminary evidence shows that mobile workforce solutions have a direct impact on many aspects, though they are not radically changing the organizational structure and business processes within a company. The results indicate a need for an engineering approach that integrates the consideration of potential the impact on organization, business process and individuals. The study provides a basis for further research to improve business processes with mobile workforce solutions.	business process	Yan Wang;Els van de Kar;Geleyn R.

They provide an additional communication and transaction channel, that can be applied to enhance existing e-Business applications. However, while during the mobile hype in the years 1999-2000 there were many visions how mobile technologies can provide benefits to companies, the challenges and necessary prerequisites related to the application of mobile technologies have been hardly addressed in literature. This paper tries to contribute to fill the gap and provides, an overview of application areas and challenges of m-business for organizations. The overview is created based on a broad literature review of published essays, cases and experiences.	electronic business;experience	Katarina Stanoevska-Slabeva	2004			systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;management science	HCI	-73.7362951113364	7.171205935993685	199702
1ad5cd529210d258f83b67240870b9bbeda7ea5d	facilitating electronic business planning with decision making support systems	business model;support system;data access;electronic business;management science	Decision making support has evolved over time and across disciplines (3) with much research focusing on ways to improve such support. In the process, there has been an evolution from simple data access and reporting to complex analytical, creative support. Meanwhile electronic business planning, a complex process, that can be facilitated through management science, economics, statistics, and other technological tools, has shown great promise for overall business control and management in the new E-era. However, managers are rarely aware of these tools, are unskillful in their use, unwilling to, or incapable of, acquiring the proficiency. In this ongoing project, we intend to explore how decision making support systems (DMSS) can facilitate electronic business planning by deriving an operational e- business model and illustrating how the model can be delivered through a DMSS. Such delivery will enable managers to measure and evaluate the impact of plans on electronic business performance.	electronic business	Lidan Ha;Guisseppi A.
