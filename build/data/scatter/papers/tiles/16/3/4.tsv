One obstacle to wider adoption of this approach is the perceived difficulty of obtaining useful data from users. This paper argues that quantitative experimental methods may not be practical at early stages of design, but a behavioural record used in conjunction with think-aloud protocols can provide a designer with the information needed to evaluate an early prototype in a cost-effective manner. Further, it is proposed that a method for obtaining this data can be specified which is straightforward enough to be used by people with little or no training in human factors. Two studies are reported in which trainee designers evaluated a user interface by observing a user working through some set tasks. These users were instructed to think aloud as they worked in a procedure described as """"cooperative evaluation"""". The instruction received by the designers took the form of a brief how-to-do-it manual. Study 1 examines the effectiveness of the trainee designers as evaluators of an existing bibliographic database. The problems detected by each team were compared with the complete set of problems detected by all the teams and the problems detected by the authors in a previous and more extensive evaluation. Study 2 examined the question of whether being the designer of a system makes one better or worse at evaluating it and whether designers can predict the problems users will experience in advance of user testing."""	bibliographic database;human factors and ergonomics;iterative design;iterative method;prototype;think aloud protocol;usability testing;user interface design	Peter C.

The multiple-choice question format, offering a choice between a correct selection and common misconceptions, can provide an assessment of students' conceptual understanding in various dimensions. Misconceptions of some engineering concepts exist due to a lack of mental frameworks, or schemas, for these types of concepts or conceptual areas. This study incorporated an open textual response component in a multiple-choice concept inventory test to capture written explanations of students' selections. The study's goal was to identify, through text analysis of student responses, the types and categorizations of concepts in these explanations that had not been uncovered by the distractor selections. The analysis of the textual explanations of a subset of the discrete-time signals and systems concept inventory questions revealed that students have difficulty conceptually explaining several dimensions of signal processing. This contributed to their inability to provide a clear explanation of the underlying concepts, such as mathematical concepts. The methods used in this study evaluate students' understanding of signals and systems concepts through their ability to express understanding in written text. This may present a bias for students with strong written communication skills. This study presents a framework for extracting and identifying the types of concepts students use to express their reasoning when answering conceptual questions.	categorization;inventory;mental event;signal processing;systems concepts;text mining	Andrea M.

90ead60890267f348a2b9b6be519221d17ca0741	using constructivist instructional design for flipped classroom to enhancing cognitive learning performance		A flipped classroom pivots from a traditional learning style which learners contribute to outside-of-class exercises or self-learning to, instead, building knowledge or apprehending contents before coming to class. This study brings in the constructivist theory as a foundation of the instructional design as an online self-study management outside of class as well as hands-on activities in actual classrooms. The researchers developed constructivist learning management system (CLMS) and collected the data from the students to investigate how they built knowledge during the knowledge transfer, in particular. The study on students’ cognitive ability found that on the correlation between students’ learning retention and transfer of learning, there was a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.569). According the findings, students employed three processes to transfer their learning: (1) accessing the prior knowledge or schema from the existing cognitive structure; (2) constructing a link between new contexts and prior knowledge; and (3) utilizing that connection to resolve problems in the new contexts at hand.

Furthermore, understanding which visual strategies are successful can help us improve educational materials that foster successful use of these visual strategies. Previous studies have demonstrated the predictive value of eye tracking for student performance. Chemistry is a highly visual domain, making it particularly appropriate to study visual strategies. Eye tracking also provides measures of pupil dilation that correlate with cognitive processes important to learning, but have not yet been assessed in any realistic learning environments. We examined the gaze behavior and pupil dilation of undergraduate students working with a specialized ITS for chemistry: Chem Tutor. Chem Tutor emphasizes visual learning by focusing specifically on graphical representations. We assessed the value of over 40 high-level gaze features along with measures of pupil diameter to predict student performance and learning gains across an entire chemistry problem set. We found that certain gaze features are strong predictors of performance, but less so of learning gains, while pupil diameter is marginally predictive of learning gains, but not performance. Further studies that assess pupil dilation with higher temporal precision will be necessary to draw conclusions about the limits of its predictive power.	cognitive tutor;dilation (morphology);eb-eye;expect;experiment;eye tracking;graphical user interface;high- and low-level;q-chem;visual learning	Joshua C.

To address the problem, at least two training approaches--rule-based and pattern-based--have been suggested. A rule-based approach prescribes a sequence in modelling the conceptual modelling constructs, and the action to be taken at each stage. A pattern-based approach presents data modelling structures that occur frequently in practice, and prescribes guidelines on how to recognize these structures. This paper describes the conceptual framework, experimental design, and results of a laboratory study that employed novice designers to compare the effectiveness of the two training approaches (between-subjects) at three levels of task complexity (within subjects). Results indicate an interaction effect between treatment and task complexity. The rule-based approach was significantly better in the low-complexity and the high-complexity cases; there was no statistical difference in the medium-complexity case. Designer performance fell significantly as complexity increased. Overall, although the rule-based approach was not significantly superior to the pattern-based approach, the study still recommends the rule-based approach for novice designers given the significantly better performance at two out of three complexity levels.	data modeling;logic programming	Dinesh Batra;Nicole A.

These perceptions were studied across individual variables such as: Internet use skills, frequency of Internet use, voting, and civic group membership. A total of 701 randomly selected pre-service teachers from a major research university in Turkey participated in the study completing a fourteen item questionnaire. The overall distribution of the data was examined through the descriptive statistics while the Mann– Whitney U, Kruskall–Wallis H, and Jonckheere–Terpstra tests were employed to determine the differences and trends. The results showed that most of the pre-service teachers believed in e-democracy, while they rarely participated in e-politics. Findings also indicated that Internet use skills, frequency of Internet use, voting, and civic group membership had significant effects on specific components of e-democracy. The impacts of the results were discussed in terms of teacher education. The results highlight the need for integration of e-democracy components into the pre-service teacher education curriculum. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Safety training and learning effectiveness become essential issues of adult learning. To reduce the costs of educational training, enterprises have also started to aggressively introduce e-learning education training. Unlike the construction industry, few studies have investigated the effectiveness of e-learning and conventional learning. This study tested the effectiveness of the safety education to prevent falls by different learning modes used to assess safety behavior and learning effectiveness during the education training period. According to the average pass rate, satisfaction degree of course and total number of unsafe behavior, the e-learning mode improves learning effectiveness. Additionally, when the e-learning mode is introduced in the construction safety education training, the labor can use the teaching material more independently and multimedia system, such as animated teaching materials, case teaching, and repeated course learning, to reduce the error rate of operation, property loss rate, and light (heavy) injury. Under this condition, the e-learning mode is positively associated with the learning effectiveness of construction safety education training. High learning effectiveness promotes safe behavior during construction operations. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A quantitative and qualitative study design based on two instruments was used. The first instrument was a five-point Likert scale which included ten modes of commenting and track changes and their ten features. The other is an open-ended question survey about the advantages, disadvantages, and development of modes of commenting and track changes in writing. Participants consisted of one group which was taught for ten sessions, and they used only one mode of commenting and track changes in each session. Results from the quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed that students have a positive attitude toward using some modes of commenting and track changes in writing marginal comments and inline track changes, inline track changes, marginal comments, inline comments, and inline footnote/endnote as they help them to develop their writing skill. However, they did not feel comfortable about the others horizontal reviewing panel, vertical reviewing panel, marginal track changes, and bottom footnote/endnote and reported that they do not enhance their writing performance. Suggestions for developing modes of commenting and track changes and their use in developing the writing skill were presented.	comment (computer programming)	Ali Farhan AbuSeileek	2013	IJLT	10.1504/IJLT.2013.057060	psychology;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;communication;computer-mediated communication	HCI	-76.34837187568813	-41.87995610545607	59442

LUCIA works on standard MPEG-4 Facial Animation Parameters and speaks with the Italian version of FESTIVAL TTS. LUCIA is totally based on true real human data collected by the use of ELITE, a fully automatic movement analyzer for 3D kinematics data acquisition. These informations are used to create lips articulatory model and to drive directly the talking face, generating human facial movements. We are exploiting the use of LUCIA WebGL as a virtual guide in the Wikimemo.it project: The portal of Italian Language and Culture. The easy integration of this technology in websites offers promising future uses for the WebGL Avatars: on-line personal assistant, storyteller for web-books, digital tutor for hearing impaired are only few examples.	book;data acquisition;elite;flash animation;online and offline;open-source software;software versioning;speech synthesis;webgl	Giuseppe Riccardo Leone;Piero Cosi	2011			world wide web;web application;mpeg-4;computer science	Graphics	-67.05507671779864	-40.24846970845647	59755
f988905f562ab22e2f157bd12fe7a0d35bdada73	exploring instructional support design in an educational game for k-12 computing education		Instructional supports (Supports) help students learn more effectively in intelligent tutoring systems and gamified educational environments. However, the implementation and success of Supports vary by environment. We explored Support design in an educational programming game, BOTS, implementing three different strategies: instructional text (Text), worked examples (Examples) and buggy code (Bugs). These strategies are adapted from promising Supports in other domains and motivated by established educational theory. We evaluated our Supports through a pilot study with middle school students. Our results suggest Bugs may be a promising strategy, as demonstrated by the lower completion time and solution code length in assessment puzzles. We end reflecting on our design decisions providing recommendations for future iterations. Our motivations, design process, and study's results provide insight into the design of Supports for programming games.	gamification;iteration;programming game;software bug	Rui Zhi;Nicholas Lytle;Thomas W.

Using as the model the Star Wars Role-Play community of the virtual environment of Second Life, and a related news-styled blog, the ''Galactic News Network'', we analysed here the impact of this media complexification on immersion process. Specifically, we analysed how meta-media can act on virtual community behavior, and on the immersive potential of the virtual world. We combined ''out-of-world'' analysis of the blog, and ''in-world'' qualitative and quantitative evaluation of meta-media-related social activities. Our results demonstrate that meta-media strongly contribute to reinforce the immersive potential of the virtual setting via several mechanisms: by increasing three parameters of the virtual world (cohesion, coherence, and commitment), by increasing the social density of the virtual community, and by acting on the perceived time factor. The combined ''in-world'' and ''out-of-world'' action of the meta-media increases the possibilities of inter-individual connections. The combination of 2D asynchronous media and 3D instantaneous virtual settings in a homogeneous and coherent immersive environment reinforces the immersive potential of the virtual world. Thus, meta-media seem to be a factor of long-term stabilization of social structures in virtual environments.	metamedia;virtual world	Matthieu J.

This provided more general insight into the way in which students actually engage with assessment and feedback, which is not necessarily the same as their self-reported behaviour. Response length and type varied with whether the question was in summative, purely formative, or diagnostic use, with the question itself, and most significantly with students’ interpretation of what the question author was looking for. Feedback was most effective when it was understood by the student, tailored to the mistakes that they had made and when it prompted students rather than giving the answer. On some occasions, students appeared to respond to the computer as if it was a human marker, supporting the ‘computers as social actors’ hypothesis, whilst on other occasions students seemed very aware that they were being marked by a machine. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous research has shown that learning from examples is an effective learning strategy, especially for novice learners. A worked example provides step-by-step explanations of how a problem is solved. Many studies have compared learning from examples to unsupported problem solving, and suggested presenting worked examples to students in the initial stages of learning, followed by problem solving once students have acquired enough knowledge. This paper presents a study in which we compare a fixed sequence of alternating worked examples and tutored problem solving with a strategy that adapts learning tasks to students’ needs. The adaptive strategy determines the type of the task (a worked example, a faded example or a problem to be solved) based on how much assistance the student received on the previous problem. The results show that students in the adaptive condition learnt significantly more than their peers who were presented with a fixed sequence of worked examples and problem solving. Novices from the adaptive condition learnt faster than novices from the control group, while the advanced students from the adaptive condition learnt more than their peers from the control group.	adaptive grammar;assistive technology;asymptotic equipartition property;cognitive science;error message;experiment;problem solving;randomness;sql;word lists by frequency	Amir Shareghi Najar;Antonija Mitrovic;Bruce M.

Machine learning approaches have their own limitations. Therefore, in this research, we propose a big data approach to formulating a predictive model. We used commonly available (student demographic and academic) data in academic institutions augmented by derived implicit social networks from students’ university smart card transactions. Furthermore, we applied a sequence learning method to infer students’ campus integration from their purchasing behaviors. Since student retention data is highly imbalanced, we built a new ensemble classifier to predict students at-risk of dropping out. For model evaluation, we use a real-world dataset of smart card transactions from a large educational institution. The experimental results show that the addition of campus integration and social behavior features refined using the ensemble method significantly improve prediction accuracy and recall.	big data;ensemble learning;machine learning;purchasing;real-time computing;real-time transcription;smart card;social network	Sudha Ram;Yun Wang;Faiz Currim;Sabah Currim	2015			predictive analytics;social network analysis;computer science;artificial intelligence;data science;marketing;machine learning;data mining;database;world wide web	ML	-76.42403872663054	-50.40162562356918	60656

The AMRM was formulated by adapting two popular conventional approaches, namely, model-rival method and label-training procedure. In our validation trials, we used a semi-autonomous parrot-inspired robot, called KiliRo, to simulate a set of autonomous behaviors. A proposed robot-assisted therapy using AMRM was pilot tested with nine children with autism spectrum disorder for five consecutive days in a clinical setting. We analyzed the facial expressions of children when they interacted with KiliRo using an automated emotion recognition and classification system, Oxford emotion API (Application Programming Interface). Results provided some indication that the children with autism spectrum disorder appeared attracted and happy to interact with the parrot-inspired robot. Short qualitative interviews with the children’s parents, the pediatrician, and the child psychologist who participated in this pilot study, also acknowledged that the proposed parrot-inspired robot and the AMRM may have some merit in aiding in improving learning and social interaction abilities of children with autism spectrum disorder.	application programming interface;autonomous robot;emotion recognition;parrot virtual machine;semiconductor industry;simulation;teaching method	Jaishankar Bharatharaj;Loulin Huang;Rajesh Elara Mohan;Ahmed M.

The purpose of the tests, which were carried out soon after the take home assignments were submitted, was to validate the students' assignments as individual work.  We found widespread discrepancies between the marks achieved by students between the two types of tasks. Many students were able to achieve a much higher grade on the take-home assignments than the invigilated tests. We conclude that these paired assessments are an effective way to quickly identify students who are still struggling with programming concepts that we might otherwise assume they understand, given their ability to complete similar, yet more complicated, tasks in their own time. We classify these students as not yet being at the neo-Piagetian stage of concrete operational reasoning.	piaget's theory of cognitive development;unsupervised learning	Donna Teague;Colin J.

MR ability is important in various fields ranging from art and education to engineering and technology. MR ability can be improved by computer based training. Most existing techniques require weeks of training and are based on proprietary software. We developed a three-hour training module using Blender, an open source software. In this paper, we present experimental details of the effect of our training on the improvement of MR ability. Our sample was42 first year engineering undergraduate students and we used Vandenberg's Mental Rotation Test for pretest and post-test. We analyzed the results and found them to be significant, leading to a large effect size for the entire sample.

An experiment was conducted with 15 learning dyads divided into three conditions of videoconference-based learning: without shared workspace, with shared workspace and with shared workspace plus a contentspecific graphical representation. Compared with those with a shared workspace, learning dyads without a shared workspace in the videoconference-based setting tended to make more effort at verbal coordination. This coordination effort did not affect the quality of collaboratively written texts or individual knowledge acquisition. Without shared workspace, participants’ coordinative utterances involved more frequent referrals to the learning content, which might have facilitated the cognitive processing of the learning content and might have compensated for the potential disadvantage of verbal coordination load. The content-specific graphical representation led to more coherent content-related dialogues and had positive effects on the quality of the collaboratively written texts and on individual knowledge acquisition. The study shows that content-specific graphical representation can be a meaningful support measure in videoconference-based learning settings, whereas the effects of a shared workspace should be further investigated. Introduction Desktop videoconference settings are becoming increasingly interesting for the organisation of net-based learning environments because of increasing network capacities and price reduction in hardware equipment. So far, there have been only a few investiFostering videoconference-based collaborative learning 237 © 2006 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2006 British Educational Communications and Technology Agency. gations into how such learning settings should be arranged and thereby, how collaborative learning can be promoted (Kopp, Ertl & Mandl, 2004). In videoconference-based learning settings, the groups are often not only supported by video, but can also work with shared applications or shared workspaces (Rummel & Spada, 2005). Until now, there have hardly been any empirical investigations concerning the effects of these shared workspaces, though it could be assumed that in many cases, these additional applications improve collaboration. This study aims at investigating whether a shared workspace in a videoconference-based learning setting makes the coordination of collaborative activities easier, and therefore may have an effect on the learning process and learning results. Moreover, the study tests if a content-specific graphical scaffold is able to facilitate collaborative knowledge construction and learning in the workspacesupplemented videoconference-based setting. The study was based on a videoconference setting implemented in a local area network (LAN) by using VCON ViGO personal conferencing appliance with two ViGO towers (video cameras, audio encoders and integrated loudspeakers) combined with PC workstations. Application sharing was accomplished with Microsoft NetMeeting. Theoretical framework Shared workspace as a tool for collaborative learning A number of investigations concerning the use of videoconferences in collaborative learning provide evidence that videoconferences show no substantial disadvantages compared with face-to-face cooperation, neither with respect to process variables nor with respect to learning outcomes (Fischer, Bruhn, Gräsel & Mandl, 2000; Jucks, Paechter & Tatar, 2003). Nevertheless, even if the quality of data transmission is high, videoconferences have certain limitations in comparison with face-to-face communication: eye contact is not possible, deictic gestures are restricted, and contextual conditions are merely apparent to the communication partner to a limited degree (Bruce, 1996; Finn, 1997; Whittaker, Geelhoed & Robinson, 1993). In view of the observed lack of differences in process variables or learning outcomes compared with face-to-face communication, learners in videoconference-based settings seemingly make more of an effort to compensate for these limitations in communication (Fischer & Mandl, 2002). However, in many videoconference-based learning settings, the groups are not only supported by video, but they can additionally work with shared applications or shared workspaces. For collaborative learning settings without video (especially groupwaresupported settings), there has been a lot of research on using shared workspaces. These studies have been directed towards the function of a shared workspace as external memory, towards focussing collaborative processes by a shared workspace or towards the role of a shared workspace in the development of shared cognition (eg, Hoppe, Gassner, Mühlenbrock & Tewissen, 2000; Reinhard, Hesse, Hron & Picard, 1997; Suthers, Weiner, Connelly & Paolucci, 1995). Altogether, these investigations show that shared workspaces can be regarded as predominantly positive for collaborative learning. Research on workgroups has already shown that shared workspaces reduce coordination requirements for collaborative work in both editing and design tasks, because 238 British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 38 No 2 2007 © 2006 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2006 British Educational Communications and Technology Agency. shared workspaces present a permanent representation of the current work status as an external working memory, and support the work awareness and the mutual understanding of the cooperating partners (eg, Dourish & Bellotti, 1992; Gutwin & Greenberg, 2002). Concerning collaborative learning, a shared workspace assumingly eases the task-related coordination of the group—this includes the coordination of the treatment of the task, the distribution of subtasks and the coordination in the course of the work routine (Cannon-Bowers & Salas, 1998; Whittaker et al , 1993). A lower coordination load should allow for more discussion of the contents. Moreover, relieving the group from task-related coordination could lessen the cognitive load of the learners and therefore improve learning (Van Bruggen, Kirschner & Jochems, 2002). Contrary to these assumptions, other research points out that coordination activities in learning groups can have positive effects on learning if they increase referral to the learning content and if they stimulate metacognitive processes and the self-control of the learners (Rogoff, 1991; Wertsch, 1991). In this study, we assume that the shared workspace lessens the verbal coordination requirements because many user actions are immediately visible to the cooperating partner and do not have to be verbally communicated. The shared workspace we used for this experiment allows joint editing and facilitates the exchange of task-related knowledge of the learning partners. To investigate the effects of coordination requirements more precisely, we differentiated among several verbal coordination activities. We examined in which way the verbal coordination effort, through the use of a shared workspace, affects the collaborative process and learning success in the videoconference, compared with a setting without a shared workspace. Content-specific graphical representation as a means to facilitate collaborative learning Another aim of this study is to test if a content-specific graphical scaffold can facilitate collaborative knowledge construction and learning in the workspace-supplemented videoconference-based setting. The content-specific graphical representation functions as a content schema (Kopp et al , 2004; Suthers & Hundhausen, 2001) that aims to structure the content to be learned. It appears to be able to diminish the hampering mutual referencing in videoconferences (Finn, 1997) and to focus the learners’ discourse on the important topics in the course of the collaborative knowledge construction. In this way, in the applied videoconference setting, a content-specific graphical representation should structure the collaborative knowledge construction. Studies that analyse the effects of content schemes in videoconferences have seldom been undertaken (Kopp et al , 2004). However, with non-video-based learning settings, a number of studies have been done. Suthers and Hundhausen (2001) investigated graphical representations used as content schemes in collaborative groups. They explained the effects of graphical representations by way of their function in making central characteristics of the learning object salient, thus leading the learning discourse by representational guidance. Graphical representations serve as a contextual anchor supporting the learning partners to focus the discussion on the contents relevant to learning. The presence or absence of the central topics becomes Fostering videoconference-based collaborative learning 239 © 2006 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2006 British Educational Communications and Technology Agency. apparent to the learners through these external representations. These findings are supported by a number of studies showing that graphical representations can play an important role in the negotiation and co-construction of meaning during communication. Roschelle (1992) showed that diagrams could be social tools for attaining common meaning in a discourse because they support individual thinking and facilitate negotiation of meaning. Van Boxtel, van der Linden and Kanselaar (2000) found in a study on collaborative students constructing argumentative diagrams and concept maps that the requested product forced students to pay attention to key principles in the domain. The diagrams proved supportive for maintaining a shared focus on the task and the communication process. Fischer, Bruhn, Gräsel and Mandl (2002) examined the effects of graphical representations given to collaborative problem solvers, and they found positive effects on process and result of collaborative knowledge construction.

We proposed an Active Learning System (ALS) for student’s self-learning. For low and middle level class, we showed that the students could keep high concentration by using traditional ALS. However, for high level class, many student could not keep their concentration, because of they have a lot of question that they did not understand. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a method of group discussion to deal with students’ questions for high level class. We also present the performance evaluation of ALS for high level class. The evaluation results show that when the lecture use proposed ALS for high level class, the average dropping out was half compared with the conventional ALS. Also, the method of group discussion increases the students’ concentration for high level class.	performance evaluation;smartphone	Noriyasu Yamamoto;Noriki Uchida	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-75928-9_13	active learning;machine learning;interactive learning;computer science;artificial intelligence	HCI	-75.4364151931232	-46.332079582031646	61162

Each student log is categorized in a cluster based on the number of errors and the total time spent to complete the entire practice. For each cluster an extended automata is created, which allows us to generate more reliable predictions according to each student type. States of this extended automata represent the effect of a student correct or failed action. The most common behaviors can be predicted considering the sequences of more frequent actions. This is useful to anticipate common student errors, and this can help an Intelligent Tutoring System to generate feedback proactively.	automata theory;automaton;categorization;virtual reality	Diego Riofrío-Luzcando;Jaime Ramírez	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-28883-3_25	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia	AI	-74.63567277175306	-46.97659025561684	61223

We collected gaze data from users interacting with the CSP applet, an IS for constraint satisfaction problems. Two classifiers built upon this data achieved good accuracy in discriminating between students who learn well from the CSP applet and students who do not, providing evidence that gaze data can be a valuable source of information for building user modes for IS.	applet;cluster analysis;constraint satisfaction problem;eye tracking;information source;interaction;interactivity;simulation;statistical classification	Samad Kardan;Cristina Conati	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-31454-4_11	computer vision;simulation;user modeling;computer user satisfaction;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-74.24912273747694	-48.515516786124834	61322

To attain the success of effective human tutors, these systems should adapt to a student's learning style. We introduce a pedagogical framework that incorporates the Felder­Silverman learning style model and their validated instrument for assessing individual learning style. The framework provides a feedback infrastructure based on the learning style model dimensions (such as visual, verbal, intuitive, sensor, etc.). It has been implemented as part of the DesignFirst­ITS, helping novices learn how to design a class in UML from a problem description. The system has been evaluated in a CS1 class with results that show that students found the learning­styles based feedback effective in helping them identify and correct errors so that all were able to complete a non­trivial problem.	algorithm;error message;graphical user interface;unified modeling language	Shahida M.

Searches undertaken by 16 same-sex groups of two or three students (six of boys, ten of girls) for information to support a class assignment were captured on videotape. The multiple search sessions took place over several weeks. An analysis of the search sessions reveals that the groups of boys formulated queries comprising fewer keywords than the groups of girls, the boys spent less time on individual pages than the girls, the boys clicked more hypertext links per minute than the girls, and in general were more active while online. The study overall demonstrates academic, affective and behavior differences between grade-six boys and girls working in same-sex groups on a Web-based class project.

As a result, personalization has transformed the interaction between the user and the system, and specific new usability issues have arisen. Methods used for evaluating personalized systems should be able to reveal the issues and problems specifically associated with personalization. Therefore this study evaluated three of the most common test methods used to detect usability problems in a personalized search engine. This was done by comparing the comments generated from thinking-aloud, questionnaires, and interviews. Questionnaires and interviews appear to be more useful for assessing specific usability issues for personalization, whereas thinking-aloud generates more comments on the usefulness of the system in the intended context of use and identifies the most critical and serious problems. Interviews, on the other hand, appear to yield a disproportionate number of positive comments. During the formative evaluation of a personalized system it is best to use a combination of thinking-aloud and questionnaires. This article concludes with a summary of implications for practitioners.	personalization;usability	Lex van Velsen;Thea van der Geest;Rob Klaassen	2011	Int. J. Hum. Comput.

Previous studies have found varying degree of associations between attitudes, behavioral intention and perceptions and corroborate the fact that attitudes influence patterns of behavior. As computer technology is becoming pervasive in the society, researchers have attempted to explore the links between individual's perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and their intention to use the computer technology. A study was conducted in two higher education institution in the United Arab Emirates to find out students' intention to use computer technology employing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by Reference [1] as a theoretical framework and Structural Equation Modeling as an analytical tool. The results revealed strong relationships between the students' attitudes toward computer and intention to use. This paper further reports the applicability of technology acceptance model and its robustness and generalizability in different research contexts.	computer;ibm tivoli access manager;pervasive informatics;structural equation modeling;usability	Myint Swe Khine;Ernest Afari	2014	2014 International Conference on Education Technologies and Computers (ICETC)	10.1109/ICETC.2014.6998907	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;mathematical model;reliability;computational model;statistics	HCI	-75.84284647592659	-40.880708792172875	61807

Forty secondary students of 7 th and 8 th grades (13 to 15 years old) participated in the two-year IPS instruction designed in this study. Twenty of them participated in the IPS instruction, and the remaining twenty were the control group. All the students were preand post-tested in their regular classrooms, and their IPS process and performance were logged by means of screen capture software, to warrant their ecological validity. The IPS constituent skills, the web search sub-skills and the answers given by each participant were analyzed. The main findings of our study suggested that experimental students showed a more expert pattern than the control students regarding the constituent skill ‘defining the problem’ and the following two web search sub-skills: ‘search terms’ typed in a search engine, and ‘selected results’ from a SERP. In addition, scores of task performance were statistically better in experimental students than in control group students. The paper contributes to the discussion of how well-designed and well-embedded scaffolds could be designed in instructional programs in order to guarantee the development and efficiency of the students’ IPS skills by using net information better and participating fully in the global knowledge society.	embedded system;knowledge society;problem solving;screenshot;search engine results page;web search engine	Esther Argelagós;Manoli Pifarré	2012	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2011.10.024	psychology;simulation;computer science;multimedia;social psychology;world wide web	HCI	-75.6172440094969	-42.79807527876236	62142

The description of behavioural patterns found from the experiment supports this notion. The findings show that once the direction was initiated by the teacher with the help of an external structure like a course management system (CMS), the learners could organise the resources in the system autonomously, took on new learning roles that were different from those in a traditional face-to-face classroom, and eventually they could develop autonomous perceptions and behaviours as an outcome of their engagement in this blended learning environment. The data from four research tools: i.e., questionnaire, student learning journals, interviews and classroom observation are triangulated and amalgamated to increase the validity and reliability of the findings.	autonomous robot	Navaporn S.

In recent years, the number of applications to the UTCS PhD program has become too large to manage with a traditional review process. GRADE uses historical admissions data to predict how likely the committee is to admit each new applicant. It reports each prediction as a score similar to those used by human reviewers, and accompanies each by an explanation of what applicant features most influenced its prediction. GRADE makes the review process more efficient by enabling reviewers to spend most of their time on applicants near the decision boundary and by focusing their attention on parts of each applicant’s file that matter the most.

Research questions: (1) How do global managers currently use and experience professional virtual worlds (Virtual Worlds) as a communication media for global work? and (2) How do these Virtual Worlds support global and professional communication in a geographically distributed context? Literature review: We reviewed Virtual World literature in the area of social sciences, education, and games. Little research has been conducted on Virtual Worlds for workgroups. But those studies support the assumption that Virtual Worlds are suitable for global distributed work as a collaboration and communication medium. Methodology: With an explorative and qualitative interview research approach, we conducted 47 semi-structured interviews with virtual world vendors, researchers, and managers using virtual worlds in their work. Data were analyzed based on Grounded Theory Analysis methods. Results and conclusions: The results show four different use cases applied for professional Virtual Worlds: small team meetings, trainings, community building, and conferences. Furthermore, our findings confirm Virtual World literature that states that the professional Virtual World as a communication and collaboration tool supports geographically distributed work as well as visualization and learning in a global context.	computer-mediated communication;semiconductor industry;virtual world	Petra Bosch-Sijtsema;Anu Sivunen	2013	IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication	10.1109/TPC.2012.2237256	human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;metaverse;virtual reality;multimedia;management;collaboration	Visualization	-71.27123884743534	-40.973764484230735	62681

It is important to consider that instructional material can be designed with various types of learning materials, and that the degree to which learning performance is enhanced depends on the type of learning materials provided to the learner. This study develops a problem-solving learning system (PSLS) based on animated game-based materials and problem-solving theory. The PSLS consists of a series of solution-inferring tasks that can be used to train a learner in problem solving. In this study, 134 university students were employed to analyze the differences in learning performance and learners’ self-perception of difficulty when using different learning materials. This study is an in-depth analysis of the relationship between learning materials and personal traits. The results of the experiment showed that both gender and learning styles influence not only learning performance but also self-perception of difficulty levels with animated game-based material in certain scenarios. Moreover, eight teachers were included in this study to examine the effectiveness of the PSLS. The results show that the participants have a 95% probability of obtaining above-average user satisfaction, which suggests that PSLS can be a good vehicle for providing problem-solving activity.

While many online learning quality rubrics do exist, thus far there has been l ittle empirical evidence establishing a clear link between specific course design features and concrete, student-level course outcomes. In the current study, the authors develop an online course design assessment rubric that includes four areas, and explore the im pact of each area on student end-ofsemester performance in 23 online courses at two co mmunity colleges. The results indicate that the quality of interpersonal interact ion within a course relates positively and significantly to student grades. Additional analyse s based on course observation and interview data suggest that frequent and effective student–instructor interaction creates an online environment that encourages students to comm it themselves to the course and perform at a stronger academic level.

The starting point of this research, is an existing application known as “edrama”, a 2D graphical environment in which users are represented by static cartoon figures. Tools have been developed to enable integration of the existing edrama application with several new components to support avatars with emotionally expressive behaviours, rendered in a 3D environment. The functionality includes the extraction of affect from open-ended improvisational text. The results of the affective analysis are then used to: (a) control an automated improvisational AI actor – EMMA (emotion, metaphor and affect) that operates a bit-part character in the improvisation; (b) drive the animations of avatars using the Demeanour framework in the user interface so that they react bodily in ways that are consistent with the affect that they are expressing. Finally, we describe user trials that demonstrate that the changes made improve the quality of social interaction and users’ sense of presence. Moreover, our system has the potential to evolve normal classroom education for young people with or without learning disabilities by providing 24/7 efficient personalised social skill, language and career training via role-play and offering automatic monitoring.	actor (uml);anomalous experiences;automatic control;emma;emoticon;graphical user interface;multi-user;nonlinear gameplay;virtual reality	Xiang Lin;Marco Gillies;Kulwant Dhaliwal;Amanda Gower;Dale Robertson;Barry Crabtree	2009	I.

c8fcf24781fb1adc0dfb8d5448adad67bc2e1af4	improving the user-friendliness of aat through a staged evaluation	databases;software;data mining;learning management systems;data visualization	With the rapid adoption of online learning technologies, there is a pedagogical imperative to evaluate the success of online courses and analyze how student interact with electronic communication and learning resources. There is substantial data in learning management systems (LMSs) to inform this research, and many software tools aimed at mining LMS data or providing statistics or visualizations about those data. However, these tools provide either overviews or are very specific to the information they show. In this paper, we intro-duce the latest revision of the Academic Analytics Tool (AAT), which empowers users (e.g., teachers, learning designers) to do their own investigations into complex educational data stored in LMS databases. AAT allows non-technical users to answer almost limitless questions about learners' behavior and the impact of teaching methods and learning designs. To improve the user-friendliness of AAT, which is one of the core goals of the tool, a staged, qualitative evaluation study has been conducted. By improving AAT's user-friendliness, the tool gets more effective in supporting users and enabling them to use the huge amounts of educational data to learn how students interact with courses and learning materials as well as about the effectiveness of teaching methods and learning designs.	accessibility;art & architecture thesaurus;database;experiment;imperative programming;online machine learning;teaching method;usability	Tamra Ross;Ting-Wen Chang;Cindy Ives;Nancy Parker;Andrew Han;Sabine Graf	2016	2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)	10.1109/ICALT.2016.81	computer science;data science;database;multimedia;world wide web;data visualization	HCI	-76.69056944828684	-44.52533123674261	63028

This highly demanding process of coherence formation can, for example, be assisted by interrepresentational hyperlinks, which foster the visual search for correspondences. In three studies we analyzed the effectiveness of hyperlinks depending on the amount of intrinsic cognitive load (ICL), which is on the one hand determined by the complexity of the learning task and on the other hand by the learners’ expertise. In the first two studies we varied the complexity of the integration task and found that the hyperlinks were only effective for the less complex task (low ICL). In the third study the amount of ICL has been varied by the level of expertise and the effects supported the previous outcomes: the help again was only effective in conditions of low ICL (higher expertise), whereas with high ICL (lower expertise) it was ineffective. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Code-switching is a phenomenon common to multilingual schools where learners are taught in a language which is not their first language. In these environments, code-switchers frequently alternate between their first and second languages, seeking alternative words to clarify their understanding of the topic being studied. This paper presents a study based in South Africa, where mathematics learners interacted with a mobile learning system named M-Thuto, supporting learners who code-switch while learning and providing them with digital resources. The system consisted of summarised notes, class exercises and a class quiz. Through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, data were gathered and analysed from 90 learners to gain perspectives on their interaction processes. The study aimed to establish how mobile learning can be used to support multilingual learners in under-resourced schools. The results of the study reflect the need for mobile learning resources that support their learning considering their linguistic challenges. The results also reflect the important role that mobile phones can play as alternative digital learning resources.	ccir system a;content adaptation;mobile phone;semiconductor industry	Mmaki Jantjies;Mike Joy	2015	Educational Technology & Society		mathematics education;questionnaire;interaction;usability;semi-structured interview;computer science;experiential learning;mobile device;multimedia;world wide web;statistics;pedagogy	HCI	-73.32395003522015	-39.66117949256576	63436

The sample of 110 kindergarteners had a mean age of 5.64 years and approximately equal numbers of boys and girls, randomly chosen from four kindergartens in a low SES Israeli township. All participants spoke Hebrew. None had been diagnosed with learning disabilities. Participants were randomly assigned to four groups: 30 tutors, 30 tutees, and 30 individual learners, all of whom used the e-book, and 20 children in a control group who were only exposed to their regular kindergarten program. Pre- and post-intervention emergent literacy measures included phonological awareness, reading of words from the e-book, word recognition, and story comprehension and production. The overall improvement in the measured emergent literacy skills from pre- to post-intervention of the children in the three experimental groups was higher than that of the children in the control group. In addition, there were significant learning context differences in several of the children's measured emergent literacy skills, suggesting that those who work on an e-book activity in a paired peer learning context with same age peers (tutors and tutees) seem to gain an advantage in phonological awareness, emergent reading, and story comprehension over those who work with it individually. Implications for educators and e-book designers are discussed.	accessible surface area;cd-rom;emergence;screenwriting	Adina Shamir;Ofra Korat;Nili Barbi	2008	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2007.05.010	psychology;developmental psychology;word recognition;socioeconomic status;intervention;semitic languages;sociology;peer tutor;communication;law;scientific control;pedagogy	AI	-74.01578299267706	-43.533985614281995	63475
a1f32fa1d2d4f879514f9e8b90f9c91ac10c0f9b	visual attention based evaluation for multiple-choice tests in e-learning applications		Multiple-choice (MC) question is an important form of test to assess the students' academic achievement, especially in the e-learning applications. However, the classical evaluation metrics on MC questions (such as the correctness ratio) only consider the correctness of the final selection but ignore the solving progress of the testee. In the existing literature, the eye-tracking based visual attention was studied to infer the testee's cognitive progress towards a specific MC question. However, there is little work on the visual attention based evaluation of one complete MC test. In this paper, we measure the eye movement data of a group of students in an online test, which consists of forty more MC questions. We divide the screen area into five AOIs (area of interests), including one for the question and four for the candidate options. The fixation duration as well as the gaze sequence on these AOIs are recorded and studied. In the case study on the most difficult question, we observe the great differences among the eye movement of the testees in different academic levels. A new metric, namely Visual-Attention-assisted Score (VAS), is proposed to assess the student's performance with the bias of his fixations on the correct options. Experiment results show that, this metric can reflect the difference of gaze movement of testees, and thus it is helpful for the teachers to infer the real level of the students' academic achievement.	correctness (computer science);eye tracking	Wei Liu;Mengling Yu;Zijian Fan;Jing Xu;Yuan Tian	2017	2017 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2017.8190633	multiple choice;sociology;social psychology;gaze;academic achievement;visualization;knowledge management;correctness;eye movement;cognition	HCI	-74.09461516918496	-46.96046395293816	63672

f69f767c7a6180908ef1f134e073fe7fe8ed7227	how are they watching me - learning from student interactions with multimedia objects captured from classroom presentations		The performance of a teacher in the exposition of a subject is a rich experience that can be captured and transformed into a corresponding multimedia learning object, given the multimodal and multi-device nature of the presentation. Using as a starting point an interactive multimedia object which is an electronic version of a problem solving lecture recorded by the teacher, in this paper we report how a group of students interacts with one multimedia learning object composed of synchronized videos, audio, images and context information. The qualitative analysis of the data allows the teacher to infer useful information not only for refining the lecture content but also for improving its presentation. The case study presented illustrates how a similar analysis can be performed by other instructors with respect to their own lectures, and demonstrates both the power of capturing the multimodal and multi-device nature of the original presentation, and the utility of logging the student-multimedia learning object interaction.	multimodal interaction;problem solving	Caio César Viel;Erick Lazaro Melo;Maria da Graça Campos Pimentel;César A.

This paper discusses a study conducted at the University of Auckland and at Manchester Metropolitan University on how their students use Facebook, and its impact on their social and academic lives. Using theories of social capital and knowledge management, we explore some potential educational uses of Facebook. Guidelines are included for the educational use of Facebook by tutors in a university environment. These include both positive recommendations and activities and approaches to avoid; and include educational, administrative and legal issues.	knowledge management;social capital;social network;theory	Rex Wang;Philip Scown;Cathy Urquhart;Julie Hardman	2012	Education and Information Technologies	10.1007/s10639-012-9206-z	public relations;educational technology;social science;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;sociology;management;world wide web;economic growth;pedagogy;social network	HCI	-74.58272397055639	-39.146370052936916	63911
4d5df5af6c49186b781d0849305c18aff6b553eb	interactivity and e-learning - an experimental study		Interactive features play an important role in e-learning. In this paper we report an experimental pilot study which tested e-learning units with different degrees of interactivity. A specific experimental design adapted to a blended-learning scenario was developed. Participants learned with e-learning units, dealing with different movement analysis concepts (MACs), which differ only in interactive features (different degrees of interactivity). Pretest and posttest measured participants’ basic knowledge and knowledge transfer of the MACs. A further measurement of participants’ basic knowledge was performed immediately after learning. Moreover participants’ experience of activation and interactivity was assessed by a questionnaire. The results show that students could improve their knowledge. However we did not find any significant impact of different degrees of interactivity. This result may be due to confounding problems or a small sample size. In some items the groups who learned interactively or actively rated activation and interactivity higher than the non-active or non-interactive groups. Open-ended questions showed, that when being exposed to non-interactive or non-active e-learning units students complained about the absence of interactive features.	design of experiments;experiment;interactivity	Nina Roznawski;Josef Wiemeyer	2010	Int.

The goal was to build a model of learning for schedule-based interventions. Participants (n = 230) completed multiple reading and test trials with fill in the blank sentences about basic statistics concepts. The experiment was a 2 (trial type: read or drill) x 3 (learning trial spacing: wide medium, or narrow) x 2 (fill-in term during learning: variable or constant) x 2 (fill-in term during posttest: variable or constant) within-subjects design. The model of the results captures the data with recent and long-term components to explain posttest transfer and the testing and spacing effects. These results, and data on the conceptual confusions amongst statistical terms, are discussed with respect to implications for future intelligent learning systems.	heart rate variability	Jaclyn K.

The challenge is how to use the most effective presentation format that would result in performance improvement. This paper addresses the added value of video presentations in a technology-mediated learning environment for a basic Management Information System course at MBA level. We postulate two hypotheses that take into account students’ mastery learning and satisfaction with regard to the usefulness of video presentation, moderated by students’ self-interest to learn the subject matter (i.e., intrinsic motivation).

In order to verify the effectiveness of the use of in-game cards as rewards, the research team integrated the trading card game into a web-based English vocabulary learning system. Students can receive cards as rewards every time after they use the learning system. A 6-week experiment had been conducted at an elementary school with 172 fifth-grade students. The results showed that boys have higher intention of getting the in-game cards as rewards. The research also showed that the use of the in-game cards as educational rewards not only motivates students to use the vocabulary learning system but also improves their learning outcome. The research result supported the recommended process for teachers to adopt the trading card game in their courses.	virtual world;vocabulary;web application	Peayton Chen;Rita Kuo;Maiga Chang;Jia-Sheng Heh	2017		10.1186/s41039-017-0054-8	multimedia;educational technology;knowledge management;computer science;vocabulary	HCI	-74.6818903536027	-43.70052192661025	64334

In an experiment concerning learners' transfer performance and mental effort, the simulation presented the three strategies to three groups of learners and measured their performance on the transfer tasks. In this experiment, conventional problem solving was contrasted with two worked example strategies. The results indicated a significant difference between practicing problem solving and using worked examples. Learners who practiced problem solving in an interactive simulation outperformed the learners who studied computer-based worked examples. They also invested lower mental effort in transfer tasks. When accounting for the difference in the learners' domain knowledge, the strategies were not significantly different among the more experienced learners. For the less experienced learners, those who practiced problem solving significantly outperformed their worked example counterparts. Among all participants and also among less experienced learners the problem solving group invested significantly lower mental effort in the performance of transfer tasks. Based on the results of this study, the authors recommend the use of the conventional problem solving strategy with or without worked examples for learning complex skills.	computer simulation;problem solving	Aubteen Darabi;David W.

Socio-cultural theories have been imported from cognate fields to suggest that cognition and learning take place at the level of groups and communities as well as individuals. Various positions on this issue have been proposed and a number of theoretical perspectives have been recommended. In particular, the concept of common ground has been developed to explain how meanings and understandings can be shared by multiple individuals. This paper takes a critical look at the concept of shared meaning as it is generally used and proposes an empirical study of how group cognition is constituted in practice.	cognition;technical support;theory	Gerry Stahl	2005	J.

Although GeoGebra provides multiple representations of mathematical objects, it can help students discover connections between mathematical objects and their graphical representation. Students take more responsibility for their own learning, and the dynamics of classroom activity shift to more discussion, interest, motivation to study, and cooperative learning. The contribution of this paper is to present new trends in technology and learning. In a technical sense, this paper presents a Geogebra applet, which could be especially important for the future development of e-learning of college mathematics. In a methodological sense, the contribution of this paper is to present a methodological framework with several specific examples. The aim of this paper to show how concepts of dynamic geometry can be applied to topics in calculus with suggested GeoGebra software tools. In addition, the work emphasizes the important role of free open-source software packages for mathematics teaching world-wide. Index Terms —GeoGebra, college mathematics, FOSS I. INTEGRATION OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE TRADITIONAL TEACHING OF COLLEGE MATHEMATICS The modern vision of education has relyied on the application of new communication and computer technologies with the aim of grasping new levels of creativity and knowledge in the context of the investigation. ICTs and 'Computer Aided Teaching' have become important parts of contemporary life, and are widely used to improve teaching and learning techniques. The main forms of teaching mathematics with computers are: • Web teaching and learning systems Using ICTs, many Universities have established virtual education and distance learning systems in the field of mathematics, offering all new possibilities for students. • Mathematics software packages Many mathematics software packages have been developed, which are very powerful and have numerous functions, such as: • Instantaneous numerical and symbolic calculations; • Data collecting, analysis, exploration, and visualization; • Modeling, simulation, and prototyping; • Presentation graphics and animation in 2D and 3D; • Application development. The goal is to use technologies to provide an environment for active exploration of mathematical structures through multiple representations, or to show students some aspects of mathematics that are not possible with pen and paper. The students can concentrate on ideas; additionally computers can stimulate the students' geometric intuition through interesting visualizations in 2D or 3D, or make it possible to ask questions involving theoretical issues that are arithmetically too complicated to be treated in a traditional way.

However, research has found that these learners might not gain equal benefit from such resources, in particular because culture may affect how people learn from and use online resources. We therefore expect to see cultural differences in how people use and benefit from visual debuggers. We investigated the use of one popular online debugger which allows users to execute Python code and navigate bidirectionally through the execution using forward-steps and back-steps. We examined behavioral logs of 78,369 users from 69 countries and conducted an experiment with 522 participants from 82 countries. We found that people from countries that tend to prefer self-directed learning (such as those from countries with a low Power Distance, which tend to be less hierarchical than others) used about twice as many back-steps. We also found that for individuals whose values aligned with instructor-directed learning (those who scored high on a “Conservation” scale), back-steps were associated with less debugging success.	debugger;debugging;list of educational programming languages;power distance	Kyle Thayer;Philip J.

The present paper is concerned with understanding the factors that make different engineering works perceived as easier or harder to manage. We describe an approach building on notions of ‘span of control’, through which we developed the TOECAP inventory (Team, Organisation, Environment, Communication, Activity and Personal). This tool was validated through both interviews and questionnaires. As well as identifying the physical factors involved, the work also emphasised the importance of collaborative and attitudinal factors. We conclude by discussing limitations of the present work and future directions for development.		Robert J. Houghton;Chris White;David Golightly;John R.

A high degree of """"social disfordance"""" of an MST system signifies that it may not provide the appropriate social affordances for mediating touch in a particular context. The development of the Social Disfordance of Mediated Social Touch (SDMST) instrument included a systematic literature review, expert feedback, and think-out-loud piloting. Its refinement included an exploratory factor analysis with a subsequent reduction of questions and scales. We report its psychometric properties, including metrics of inter-item reliability, convergent validity, test-retest reliability, and concurrent validity, confirming that these properties are sufficient for future use.

This is a computer software intended for fitting workplaces to people with disabilities. Once evaluated the workplaces, some adaptations were proposed and implemented. One of the main measures adopted was the use of PDAs to help workers in performing their tasks. After the adaptation of the workplaces, an assessment process was carried out to evaluate the adequacy of the executed measures. The results of the study were implemented in a web page in order to provide information about real cases to professionals and users.

We examined the effects of two collaborative modes (learner-on-computer agent mode and learner-on-learner mode) on the CPS performance of 64 college students (28 women, 36 men; age range = 18–22 yr., M = 20.1, SD = 1.2). Participants’ CPS performance scores in the learneron-computer agent mode were significantly higher than those in the learner-onlearner mode. The optimal mode for teaching CPS skills, the practical implica‐ tions of using a CPS system, and the limitations of this study are also discussed.	command & conquer:yuri's revenge;problem solving;software agent	Sakae Yamamoto	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-40397-7	human–computer interaction;services computing;human resource management system	HCI	-67.97087070289909	-48.511220815814966	65136

This means that his behavior and affective response are personalized. In this work, we attempted to build personalization into Game-Based Learning (GBL) system according to user's personality and affective response. User's personality is depicted with a set of attributes such as preference, attitude, character tendency, knowledge & skill, and so on. User's profile is constructed via psychological testing, facial expression recognition, psychophysiology analysis, and behavior analysis. And then, the GBL presents appropriate scenarios and levels adapted to user profile. This will contribute to user's mastery of knowledge & skill, and help user to regulate and improve his personality traits.	computation;human–computer interaction;personalization;user profile	Chang-Neng Zhou;Xueli Yu;Yujie Dong;Jing Tian;Qian Cui;Lingzi Hu	2007	2007 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology - Workshops		simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;affective computing;psychological testing;multimedia	AI	-69.72875342322556	-46.1117802791525	65259

5e6bbd5817e5b7f70f3b6b46c620eddb36afd13c	the “assistance” model: leveraging how many hints and attempts a student needs		An important aspect of Intelligent Tutoring Systems is providing assistance to students as well as assessing them. The standard state-of-the-art algorithms (Knowledge Tracing and Performance Factor Analysis) for tracking student knowledge, however, only look at the correctness of student first response and ignore the amount of assistance students needed to eventually answer the question correctly. In this paper, we propose the Assistance Model (AM) for predicting student performance using information about the number of hints and attempts a student needed to answer the previous question. We built ensemble models that combine the state-of-the-art algorithms and the Assistance Model together to see if the Assistance Model brings improvements. We used an ASSISTments dataset of 200 students answering a total of 4,142 questions generated from 207 question templates. Our results showed that the Assistance Model did in fact reliably increase predictive accuracy when combined with the state-of-the-art algorithms.	algorithm;correctness (computer science);ensemble forecasting;factor analysis	Yutao Wang;Neil T.

Our goal is to analyze the question: """"Does it matter when a hint is used?"""". We look at students who use identical attempt counts to get the right answer and look for the impact of help use and action order on future performance. We conclude that students who use hints too early do worse than students who use hints later. However, students who use hints, at times, may perform as well as students who do not use hints. This paper makes a novel contribution showing for the first time that paying attention to the precise sequence of hints and attempts allows better prediction of students' performance, as well as to definitively show that, when we control for the number of attempts and hints, students that attempt problems before asking for hints show higher performance on the next question. This analysis shows that the pattern of hints and attempts, not just their numbers, is important."""		Eric Van Inwegen;Seth Adjei;Yan Wang;Neil T.

20bbc08ce15f187433bd992eb14f7f8a20960653	tradeoff between problem-solving and learning goals: two experiments for demonstrating assistance dilemma		Recent intelligent tutoring systems give participants various types of supports. We hypothesize that a high level of support activates participants’ orientation to problem-solving goals but reduces the priority of attaining learning goals; as a result, higher problem-solving performance is attained, but the learning effect is reduced. We tested this hypothesis by using two relatively largely different experimental tasks: Tower of Hanoi puzzle as a simple problem solving task and Natural Deduction learning as a more complex learning task. Overall results supported our hypothesis and were discussed from the viewpoint of the assistance dilemma.

However, there is a lack of theoretical and methodological background for the analysis of collaboration. Manual assessing of nonmoderated chat discussions is difficult and time-consuming, having as a consequence that learning scenarios have not been widely adopted, neither in formal education nor in informal learning contexts. An analysis method of collaboration and individual participation is needed. Moreover, computer-support tools for the analysis and assessment of these conversations are required. In this paper, we start from the “polyphonic framework” as a theoretical foundation suitable for the analysis of textual and even gestural interactions within collaborative groups. This framework exploits the notions of dialogism, inter-animation and polyphony for assessing interactions between participants. The basics of the polyphonic framework are discussed and a systematic presentation of the polyphonic analysis method is included. Then, we present the PolyCAFe system, which provides tools that support the polyphonic analysis of chat conversations and online discussion forums of small groups of learners. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used in order to identify topics, semantic similarities and links between utterances. The detected links are then used to build a graph of utterances, which forms the central element for the polyphonic analysis and for providing automatic feedback and support to both tutors and learners. Social Network Analysis is used for computing quantitative measures for the interactions between participants. Two evaluation experiments have been undertaken with PolyCAFe. Learners find the system useful and efficient. In addition to these advantages, tutors reflecting on the conversation can provide quicker manual feedback.	algorithm;chat room;computer-mediated communication;experiment;graph (discrete mathematics);interaction;natural language processing;online chat;social network analysis;technical support;theory	Stefan Trausan-Matu;Mihai Dascalu;Traian Rebedea	2014	I.

This study investigated the effects of the joint construction of external representations on the collaborative process and the learning outcomes. By providing representational guidance, the study aimed at promoting co-elaborated and domain-specific reasoning. Since it is assumed that the representational format may be of influence on the collaborative process and outcomes, three representational formats, namely an argumentative diagram, an argument list and a matrix, were compared with a control group. Sixty-five student pairs from pre-university education collaborated on a historical writing task in a CSCL environment. The analyses included analyses of interaction processes in the chat, the quality of the co-constructed representation, the quality of the essay and the scores on the individual posttest. The results indicated that each representational format has its own affordances and constraints. For example, Matrix users talked more about historical changes, whereas Diagram users were more focused on the balance in their argumentation. However, this did not result in differences in the quality of historical reasoning in the essay, nor in outcomes on the posttest. 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Educators have been using storytelling as an effective mode of teaching since long time. Collaborative activities promote conversation among the learners, and this assists learning by providing each one of them with a slightly different view of the subject matter. Studies have shown that virtual environments with children interacting and cooperating with each other has a positive effect on their learning experience. In the e-learning arena, many efforts have been made to model the storytelling concepts. In this paper, we do a quick review of these tools and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. We go on to describe NatakWeb, which incorporates the collaborative features for effective story creation and playback.	accessibility;interaction;subject matter expert turing test;virtual reality	R.

The questions for the metric were chosen on the basis of an expert evaluation and short iterative pilot tests, with the emphasis on ergonomics and the usability of the metric for both the commissioner of the questionnaire and the subjects filling it in. Basic questionnaire design guidelines were applied for building a logical and understandable structure of questions and the process for the evaluation event. The metric was finally adapted for the evaluation of four everyday drinking glass designs and tested in a small field study with 20 subjects. The usability of the questionnaire was evaluated according to chosen parameters for speed, understandability, and subjective experience, while usefulness was evaluated in terms of how well the metric could highlight defining characteristics for the objects under evaluation. Overall, satisfactory values were received for all parameters defined, and the questionnaire did manage to bring out defining characteristics for the glasses in the context of a rapid implementation.

Many ITSs provide student performance reports, but they may not be designed to serve teachers’ needs well, which is important for a well-designed dashboard. We investigated what student data is most helpful to teachers and how they use data to adjust and individualize instruction. Specifically, we conducted Contextual Inquiry interviews with teachers and used Interpretation Sessions and Affinity Diagramming to analyze the data. We found that teachers generate data on students’ concept mastery, misconceptions and errors, and utilize data provided by ITSs and other software. Teachers use this data to drive instruction and remediate issues on an individual and class level. Our study uncovers how data can support teachers in helping students learn and provides a solid foundation and recommendations for designing a teacher’s dashboard.	contextual inquiry;dashboard;diagram	Françeska Xhakaj;Vincent Aleven;Bruce M.

Efficient learning with cases requires discussion on the case as well as on the meaning of abstract knowledge. We find that students who first experience chat + high-quality video, focus significantly more on abstract knowledge than students first exposed to chat-only and chat + lowquality video. We also found that these students expressed a preference for face-to-face discussion. We conclude that video should be employed to improve case-based CSCL or in other methods where a balance between discussions on abstract and concrete knowledge are important.	videotelephony	Michael Tscholl;John D.

Mastery learning in intelligent tutoring systems produces a differential attrition of students over time, based on their levels of knowledge and ability. This results in a systematic bias when student data are aggregated to produce learning curves.

The metaphors behind the design of virtual places are quite diverse, from replication of real universities to art museums and scientific labs. This paper reports the results of a case study where the students of our university, as a part of their course assignment, analyzed place metaphors used in a range of 3D educational CVEs vs. the corresponding educational goals. The students suggested a design for a virtual campus representing the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The results of this study provide some suggestions concerning the characterization of different design features in educational CVEs and the suitability of such features for different educational goals. Also, a preliminary set of design guidelines for an ideal virtual campus representing a real university is presented. Finally, some challenges associated with using 3D CVEs in various educational situations are discussed.	collaborative virtual environment;common vulnerabilities and exposures;iteration;virtual reality;virtual world	Ekaterina Prasolova-Førland	2008	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2007.01.009	three-dimensional space;simulation;human–computer interaction;virtual reality;multimedia;communication	HCI	-70.64934319250996	-42.04996903515351	66956

The traditional teaching model, which is limited by classroom size, credit hours, and many other factors, can barely meet the teaching demands of a modern classroom. The continuous optimization of mobile techniques and the mobile environment has been witnessed in recent years. Several mobile terminals have emerged, which strongly support the future of micro-learning of digital mapping. This study builds a mobile digital mapping teaching system to explore effective learning models for mobile terminals. Content analysis is combined with questionnaire survey to analyze the basic characteristics of learners, learning content, learning behavior, and learning effects. Results suggest that the WeChat official account admin platform plays a positive role in attracting learners, spreading micro-content, promoting personalized learning, and evaluating real-time learning effects. In summary, this study enriches research on mobile teaching and provides teachers with new perspectives in teaching digital mapping and other specialized courses to Surveying and Mapping Engineering majors.	digital mapping	Caiyun Gao;Jingyan Wang	2017	iJET		multimedia;questionnaire;human–computer interaction;content analysis;digital mapping;computer science;personalized learning;learning effect	EDA	-73.80777673566998	-39.96231252522286	66998

We describe two studies that utilised either an online or offline methodology to detect the affective states of a learner during a tutorial session with AutoTutor. The online study relied on self-reports for affect judgements, while the offline study considered the judgements by the learner, a peer and two trained judges. The studies also investigated the relationships between facial features, conversational cues and emotional expressions in an attempt to scaffold the development of computer algorithms to automatically detect learners’ emotions. Both methodologies showed that boredom, confusion and frustration are the prominent affective states during learning with AutoTutor. For both methodologies, there were also some relationships involving patterns of facial activity and conversational cues that were diagnostic of emotional expressions.	algorithm;deep learning;multiple dispatch;online and offline	Sidney K.

The potential use of the device as a mediating learning tool, in order to develop students’ collaboration and interaction, is discussed with reference to data compiled from students’ learning diaries, focus group interviews, and online log files. rnrnThe results suggest tablet devices aid learning by providing meaningful opportunities to use the target language in context and encouraging collaborative interaction. The findings also indicate that various types of teacher support, as well as interaction with the teacher and other students, remain necessary alongside tablet-assisted language learning.	enlightenment foundation libraries;tablet computer	Haifa Albadry	2017	iJET		collaborative learning;cooperative learning;educational technology;simulation;interdependence;computer science;experiential learning;multimedia;active learning;management;world wide web;pedagogy;collaboration	NLP	-73.32457143469644	-39.47999002107214	67198

However, a student may fail to have robust learning in two fashions: they may have no learning, or they may have shallow learning (learning that applies only to the current skill, and does not support transfer or PFL). Within this paper, we present automated detectors which identify shallow learners, who are likely to need different intervention than students who have not yet learned at all. These detectors are developed using K* machine learned models, with data from college students learning introductory genetics from an intelligent tutoring system.	algorithm;cognition;cognitive tutor;elegant degradation;emoticon;os-tan;online machine learning;procedural programming;sensor;word lists by frequency	Sujith M.

Study 1 collected cross-sectional data from 55 Japanese learners of Korean as a foreign language and 18 Korean native speakers. The results show that the acquisition order was as follows: the progressive -ko iss→ the resultative -ko iss→ the resultative -a iss-. Study 2 examined the influence of instruction order by testing two groups of learners that were taught aspect markers in different orders. The results show that the order of instruction did not yield significant differences except in the rate of accuracy of the resultative marker -a issin the comprehension task.	cross-sectional data;item unique identification;order by	Ju-Yeon Ryu;Kaoru Horie;Yasuhiro Shirai	2010			speech recognition;engineering;linguistics;communication	HCI	-73.83031865066522	-43.75135827735776	67286
135e9640930bd924760bc4ad01686fc9cdbed079	complementary effects of sense-making and fluency-building support for connection making: a matter of sequence?		Multiple graphical representations can significantly improve students' learning. To acquire robust knowledge of the domain, students need to make connections between the different graphical representations. In doing so, students need to engage in two crucial learning processes: sense-making processes to build up conceptual understanding of the connections, and fluency-building processes to fast and effortlessly make use of perceptual properties in making connections. We present an experimental study which contrasts two hypotheses on how these learning processes interact. Does understanding facilitate fluencybuilding processes, or does fluency enhance sense-making processes? And consequently, which learning process should intelligent tutoring systems support first? Our results based on test data and tutor logs show an advantage for providing support for sense-making processes before fluency-building processes. To enhance students' robust learning of domain knowledge, ITSs should ensure that students have adequate conceptual understanding of connections between graphical representations before providing fluency-building support for connection making.	cognitive tutor;experiment;graphical user interface;sensemaking;test data	Martina A.

This research proposed an interactive environment for error correction and corrective feedback. First, we developed an online corrective feedback and error analysis system called  Online Annotator for EFL Writing . The system consisted of five facilities: Document Maker, Annotation Editor, Composer, Error Analyzer, and Viewer. With this system, teachers can mark error corrections on online documents and students can receive corrective feedback accordingly. The system also classifies and displays error types based on user query. Second, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this system. Fifty EFL (English as a Foreign Language) college freshmen were randomly assigned to two groups. The experimental group received corrective feedback with the developed system whereas the control group used the paper-based error correction method. After the treatment, students in both groups conducted corrective feedback activities by correcting the same document written by an EFL student. The experimental results were encouraging in that the analysis of students’ corrective feedback revealed significantly better performance in the experimental group on recognizing writing errors. Implications for further research are discussed.	error detection and correction	Shiou-Wen Yeh;Jia-Jiunn Lo	2009	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2008.12.014	psychology;foreign language;educational technology;the internet;simulation;error detection and correction;speech recognition;computer science;instructional design;multimedia;peer feedback;communication;world wide web;scientific control;pedagogy	HCI	-76.20210370831265	-42.60731994091941	67821

Consultant-client dyads involved in ten system dynamics consulting engagements were interviewed to identify individual clients' Critical Learning Incidents—defined as the moment of surprise caused after one's mental model produces unexpected failure and a change in one's mental model produces the desired result. The cases, which are reprised from interviews, include assessments of the nature of the engagement problem, the form of system dynamics model, and the methods employed by consultants during each phase of the engagement. Reported Critical Learning Incidents are noted by engagement phase and consulting method and constructivist learning theory is used to describe a pattern of learning. Research outcomes include descriptions of: the role of different methods applied in engagement phases (for example, the role of concept models to commence problem identification and to introduce iconography and jargon to the engagement participants); how model form associates with the timing of Critical Learning Incidents; and the role of social mediation and negotiation in the learning process.	agent-based model;conceptualization (information science);data validation;external variable;interaction;mental model;predictive modelling;simulation;socialization;system dynamics;theory	James P.

Two class practices for undergraduates and graduates were performed, in which participants were required to construct a computational running model of solving subtraction problems and then develop a bug model that simulated students’ arithmetic errors. Analyses showed that by creating cognitive models, participants learned to identify buggy procedures that produce systematic errors and predict expected erroneous answers by mentally simulating the mental model. The limitation is that this benefit of creating cognitive models was observed only in participants who successfully programmed a computational model.	cognition;cognitive model;mental model	Kazuhisa Miwa;Nana Kanzaki;Hitoshi Terai;Kazuaki Kojima;Ryuichi Nakaike;Junya Morita;Hitomi Saito	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-19773-9_29	psychology;cognitive psychology;cognitive model;cognitive remediation therapy;developmental psychology;socio-cognitive;elementary cognitive task;cognitive reframing;cognitive restructuring;cognitive load;social psychology;cognitive ergonomics;cognitive robotics	HCI	-72.95451943234406	-46.98207974927611	67925

There is also research that shows that contemporary CSCL environments do not completely fulfil expectations on supporting interactive group learning, shared understanding, social construction of knowledge, and acquisition of competencies. There appear to be two major pitfalls impeding achievement of the desired social interaction in CSCL environments: taking social interaction in groups for granted and the lack of attention paid to the social psychological dimension of social interaction outside of the task context. Current solutions offered to avoid the pitfalls placed responsibility on instructors and teachers to encourage collaborative learning and social interaction. To both free educators from this burden and be more cost effective, we propose an intelligent CSCL environment. The environment is based upon a theoretical framework that suggests embedding certain properties in the environment to act as social contextual facilitators social affordances to initiate and sustain learner’s social interactions. Finally, a group awareness widget (GAW) a software tool providing the learner group awareness about the others in the task and in the non-task context is introduced as an embodiment of this theoretical framework.	interaction;programming tool;social affordance	Karel Kreijns;Paul A.

In order to strengthen their conceptual understanding of such complex phenomena, students need to have a great amount of interest, and an enhanced psychological investment in learning i.e. persistence in the face of failure or challenge, all of which are indicators of cognitive engagement. By providing ease of use, aesthetic appeal, choice, feedback, challenge, variety and interactivity, technology has great potential to engage learners. This also provides students with opportunities where they can think critically, make judgments and solve complex open ended problems. This study uses three different kinds of technologies to engage students as they study about one such complex system -the aquatic ecosystem.

Since the user is the ultimate judge of whether privacy was acceptably maintained, our metric views all aspects of the privacy implementation from the perspective of usability. By examining the privacy policy, technical implementation and customizable features and interface from the perspective of usability, our metric identifies modifications to privacy policies and implementations which would improve user privacy outcomes in practice. Our work is motivated by the potential of improved privacy metrics to help organizations systematically identify and implement improvements in their privacy practices and interfaces. We evaluated ten websites using our metric and reveal potential for improvement in all websites as well as contrasts between websites with similar functions, such as social networking, online shopping and information retrieval.	information retrieval;internet privacy;online shopping;privacy policy;usability;web service	Brad Miller;Kaitlyn Buck;J.

A collaborative concept map provides an explicit visualisation tool that affords the underlying cognitive structure and facilitates visual navigation along these associations of ideas. The Merlin Concept Map integrates both the collaborative and the conceptual space with the above intentions. The spider map encourages the explication and restructuring of the learners' mental structure of the learning environment through discussions. The hierarchical map is incorporated into the spider map through the use of colour-coded notations to help learners to visualise hierarchies and associations of concepts. Furthermore, multimedia elements and links to external resources are activated only upon demand thus constraining the exploration space. These multimedia elements also afford associations of concepts through dual coding. Hence, ideas are no longer abstract but tools that enable hypothesis-making, testing and decisionmaking with explicit consequences. Causal and associative relations are therefore highlighted.	cognitive model	Chien-Sing Lee	2002		10.1109/CIE.2002.1186082	concept map;distance education;education;computer vision;the internet;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;conceptual framework;multimedia;law	HCI	-71.4957378600063	-38.62881885042116	69165

However, research has not yet examined how characteristics of students as learners influence their responses to ART. The current study examined aptitude for learning, objective learning (i.e., class performance), subjective learning (i.e., self-perceived learning), and conceptualizations of the learning process as influences on students' evaluation of ART. Students who had used ART over the course of a semester in one of three large lecture classes (N=703) completed surveys assessing their learning characteristics, perceptions of ART influence on their attendance, motivation, and learning, liking for ART, and evaluations of the course and instructor. Controlling for course and instructor evaluations, aptitude and objective learning were weakly but negatively associated with evaluations of ART and subjective learning was positively associated with evaluations of ART. Further, different conceptualizations of learning have distinctive associations with ART evaluations. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for instructors' use of ART.		Erina L.

In this paper, we mainly focus on the use of game design elements for the transmission of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) knowledge and, especially, for the learning of traditional dances. More specifically, we present a 3D game environment that employs an enjoyable natural human computer interface, which is based on the fusion of multiple depth sensors data in order to capture the body movements of the user/learner. In addition, the system automatically assesses the learner’s performance by utilizing a combination of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) approach and provides feedback in a form of a score as well as instructions from a virtual tutor in order to promote self-learning. As a pilot use case, a Greek traditional dance, namely Tsamiko, has been selected. Preliminary small-scaled experiments with students of the Department of Physical Education and Sports Science at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki have shown the great potential of the proposed application.	dynamic time warping;experiment;gamification;human computer;human–computer interaction;sensor;serial ata	Alexandros Kitsikidis;Kosmas Dimitropoulos;Deniz Ugurca;Can Bayçay;Erdal Yilmaz;Filareti Tsalakanidou;Stella Douka;Nikolaos Grammalidis	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20684-4_46	simulation;engineering;multimedia;communication	AI	-67.06394593767554	-46.19730225108897	69390

To avoid these negative effects, researchers recommend—among other things—an interface with a structural overview of the relations between sections. Some authors have found that with such an overview, information is looked up faster and remembered better. This study examined whether a structural overview also leads to a deeper understanding. Forty students read a hypertext about the effects of ultraviolet radiation in one of two presentation conditions (structural overview and list). In the list condition, the same topics were mentioned as in the overview condition, but just in the format of a list. After reading, they answered textbase questions which measured their recognition and also inference questions supposed to measure their situation model constructed from the information read. The last type of questions indicated the readers’ understanding of the text. On textbase questions, subjects with low as well as high prior knowledge scored equally well in both conditions. In contrast to our expectation, the overview did not improve the recognition of main points. However, on situation model questions low prior knowledge subjects scored significantly lower in the overview condition than in the list condition. These results supported our hypothesis that a structural overview may hinder the understanding of less knowledgeable readers, because it draws their attention to the textual macrostructure at the expense of attention to the microstructure of the text. Introduction Hypertext is emerging as an increasingly prevalent form of information presentation. The links in this medium make it possible to flexibly combine linear and hierarchical structures of information. Links are connections between sections on different levels (pages) in the hierarchy of the text. However, as the number of links goes up, the structure of a hypertext becomes more fragmentary. The consequences of a fragmented structure are: cognitive overload, navigation inefficiency and disorientation (Conklin, 1987; Gärling and Golledge, 1989; Oliver and Oliver, 1996; Van Nimwegen et al., in press). To avoid these negative effects, researchers recommend—among other things— an interface with a structural overview of the links between sections (Jonassen, 1986; Halasz and Conklin, 1989; Heller, 1990; Thüring et al., 1996). With the help of overviews that make clear which sections on which pages are present, users have less problems with looking up task-relevant information (Nielsen, 1995). In view of the educational possibilities of hypertext, Dee-Lucas (1996) investigated the effects of a structural overview. She found that with such an overview as browser, information is looked up faster. Besides this, she reported that subjects who used the overview recalled more main points of the text. However, it remains the question of whether a structural overview also leads to better comprehension. This question formed the focus of our study. Theoretical background According to Van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) there exist three levels whereby readers mentally represent textual information (see also Van Oostendorp and Goldman, 1998). The first level concerns the surface structure of sentences. On this level, readers remember, for instance, the sequence of words in a sentence. A text is remembered at the textbase level. The representation at this level can be seen as a network of related propositions. However, what readers really understand of a text and integrate with prior knowledge is called the situation model (Van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983; Van Oostendorp, 1996). Because of the importance of comprehension and application of knowledge in education, the construction of situation models is the most important objective of instructional texts (Perrig and Kintsch, 1985). For this reason, the question of effect of the structure of a text has on the construction of situation models is highly relevant. McNamara et al. (1996) examined the role of structure in the comprehension of science texts and based their research on the Construction-Integration (CI) model developed by W Kintsch (1988). Structure is defined by the extent of connectiveness between propositions in the textbase. In constructing a textbase, the reader must infer the semantic relations between propositions underlying sentences. The process of drawing these inferences is relatively simple when the surface level of the text has a well developed or explicit structure. In this situation, the semantic relations between propositions are almost explicitly present. A text has a locally coherent structure if propositions refer clearly to each other, for example, by the presence of referents. A text has a globally coherent structure if the semantic relations across parts, such as paragraphs and larger sections, are fully expressed. A writer may explicitly link each section to other sections and to the overall topic with topic headers and sentences which explain these links providing the text with a globally coherent structure. The crux of the CI-model is that readers can only integrate the textbase and prior knowledge successfully into a situation model if the textbase is sufficiently interrelated. Thus, a well developed structure is a necessary condition for the integration and situation model construction. If the text makes this integration process too difficult by 130 British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 30 No 2 1999 © British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, 1999. lack of structure, the reader must try to (re)construct the relevant semantic relations on the basis of prior knowledge. Results reported by McNamara et al. (1996) are in line with this notion. They measured the textbase by free recall and recognition questions and the situation model by inference and problem solving questions (see also Van Oostendorp and Bonebakker (1998) for the plausibility of this distinction). McNamara et al. found interactions between level of prior knowledge and the structure of a text on comprehension, that is on the construction of the situation model. In their experiment, a well developed structure improved the comprehension of readers with low prior knowledge, but impaired comprehension of high prior knowledge readers. This result fits the CI-model of Kintsch (1988); for answering inference and problem solving questions, readers must have developed a coherent textbase representation during the reading. The coherence of the textbase depends on the structure of the text: a well developed structure leads to a coherent textbase, a weak structure to an incoherent textbase. If the text has a weak structure, then the textbase is not coherent and, consequently, a reader must derive the required semantic relations between propositions from background knowledge. Low knowledgeable readers encounter here more problems than high knowledgeable readers. Thus, low knowledgeable readers can only develop an adequate situation model if the textbase is coherent. In contrast, subjects with high prior knowledge scored better on situational questions if they had read the incoherent version of the experimental text. McNamara et al. explain this result by supposing that a strong textual structure hinders the understanding of knowledgeable readers, because it reduces the amount of active processing during reading. Easing the reader’s burden of figuring out the meaning of the text could result in less effective learning (see also Kintsch, 1990). McNamara et al. further established that a strong textual structure improved textbase recall. This result was found earlier by Beyer (1990) and Britton and Gulgoz (1991). McNamara et al. (1996) distinguished in correspondence with the theory of Van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) macropropositions and micropropositions. Macropropositions concern the central, summarizing idea units of a text, micropropositions concern details. They reported that both a strong local and a strong global structure significantly supported the recall of macropropositions, but structure manipulation did not have a significant effect on the recall of micropropositions. They also found that a strong global structure improved the recall of macropropositions better than a strong local structure. The effect that a strong textual structure particularly supported the recall of macropropositions corresponds to the result found by Dee-Lucas (1996) in her study of hypertext. Hypotheses In our study we presume that the effect of a structural overview on the situation model that learners construct of a hypertext deviates in one respect from the study of McNamara et al. (1996). We agree that the local structure of a text is highly relevant in constructing a situation model in the case of low prior knowledge. Indeed, particularly less knowledgeable readers must attentively keep track of the local semantic Cognitive effects of a structural overview in a hypertext 131 © British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, 1999. relations to attain comprehension, because they lack the prior knowledge to infer these relations themselves. The CI-model of Kintsch (1988) and the study of McNamara et al. (1996) provide evidence of this assumption. However, in the case of a structural overview adjoined to a (hyper)text that has a strong local structure, we suppose that during reading learners do not use the in principle available local structure because of the negative attentional effect of the global structure added by the overview. This effect particularly hinders the comprehension of readers with low prior knowledge: their construction of a situation model depends more on the local structure of the text than the model construction of readers with sufficient prior knowledge does. Thus, in contrast to McNamara et al., we expect that a well developed global structure provided by the structural overview hinders 	boolean algebra;coherence (physics);existential quantification;fits;gauss–lucas theorem;hypertext;interaction;list comprehension;plausibility structure;problem solving;word lists by frequency	Rijk Hofman;Herre van Oostendorp	1999	BJET	10.1111/1467-8535.00101	psychology;statistical hypothesis testing;social science;simulation;cognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;instructional design;mathematics;higher education;communication;management;world wide web;pedagogy	NLP	-72.33531068779266	-49.26749309005306	69434

The setting of this game is that of a failed state where an UN intervention takes place after massive conflict that requires a CA to stabilize the situation. That is, the civil and military actors need to collaborate effectively, taking into account their respective strengths, mandates and roles. Underlying the game is the Go4it CA simulation Model (GCAM2.0). GCAM2.0 was extensively field-tested in eight sessions with about 16 persons each, aiming at assessment of the perceived realism and learning effects. It was found to provide a sufficiently authentic experience to obtain awareness of the CA in novices. With regard to improving the deeper understanding of the dynamics and complexity of the CA, in a cooperation-oriented setting only deeper learning can be reached.	complexity;simulation	Anja van der Hulst;Rudy Boonekamp;Marc van den Homberg	2014			computer simulation;social science;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;marketing;simulation modeling;learning effect;management science;management;world wide web;information system	AI	-69.06328707191454	-48.587218288110876	69443

Thereby, two types of metacognitive prompts are compared with respect to learning behavior and learning outcomes. In a pre-post experimental design, students in experimental group 1 ( N  = 54) learned with predefined (fixed) metacognitive prompts whereas students in experimental group 2 ( N  = 54) were instructed to configure their own (self-directed) metacognitive prompts and to learn with them afterwards. Students in the control group ( N  = 55) received no instructional support and learned without prompts. The results show that self-directed and fixed prompts lead to less linear learning behavior than no prompts. Regarding learning outcomes, no significant main effects were found. Further, findings indicate that interactions between learner characteristics and treatment have a significant impact on learning behavior and learning outcomes. Students with lower verbal intelligence and reading competence especially seem to benefit from prompts. Hence, when prompting students, their learner characteristics should be considered. Further research should investigate further conditions and the underlying mechanisms of prompt use.

The contributions of 197 introductory psychology students (148 females, 49 males) participating in asynchronous CMC as part of their course were collated and coded for their language content using a qualitative content analysis procedure in Atlas.ti 4.2. Nearly 700 postings were characterised according to gender on the basis of seven categories relating to language and communication style – attenuated, authoritative, traditional male and female language features, mixed language, positive socioemotional and negative socioemotional. Gender interactions were analysed in terms of positive and negative socioemotional content, focusing on explicit markers of agreement and disagreement. Gender-related patterns in language use and interaction style were found. Females were more likely than males to make attenuated contributions and express agreement, whereas males were more likely than females to make authoritative contributions and express disagreement. These results are discussed in terms of the implications for the increasing use of CMC in education.	computer-mediated communication;focus group;interaction	Jane Guiller;Alan Durndell	2006	J. Comp.

Two experiments examined this hypothesis with middle-school students learning electrical circuit analysis in a computer-based environment with an Animated Pedagogical Agent (APA). Experiment 1 was designed to determine whether matching the gender of the APA to the student has a positive impact on learning outcomes or student perceptions. One hundred ninety-seven middle-school students learned with the computer-based environment using an APA that matched their gender or one which was opposite in gender. Female students reported higher program ratings when the APA matched their gender. Male students, on the other hand, reported higher program ratings than females when the APA did not match their gender. Experiment 2 systematically tested the impact of providing learners the choice among four APAs on learning outcomes and student perceptions. Three hundred thirty-four middle-school students received either a pre-assigned random APA or were free to choose from four APA options: young male agent, older male agent, young female agent, or older female agent. Learners had higher far transfer scores when provided a choice of animated agent, but student perceptions were not impacted by having the ability to make this choice. We suggest that offering students learner control positively impacts student motivation and learning by increasing student perceptions of autonomy, responsibility for the success of the instructional materials, and global satisfaction with the design of materials. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We designed two interactive web-based instructional modules that included animated movies, “listen and repeat” exercises, and interactive practice. One module used a back-story (“Mission Impossible” detective quest) and the other did not. Students in the back-story condition scored marginally higher than learners in the control group on a timed online posttest, but not a significant difference. After the assessment, students were introduced to an open multiplayer online game (http://clubpenguin.com) in which they had the opportunity to use what they had just learned to complete tasks cooperatively. This paper will describe the design of the instruction as well as the implications of the findings. In particular, the role back-stories is discussed in light of Mayer’s coherence effect, which calls on designers of multimedia environments to avoid including extraneous information.

With the goal of providing an easy and effective way of learning Guqin, we have created an interactive learning system called ChinAR which employs augmented reality. We have made three main contributions in this paper: (1) a systematic method to design for instrumental learning combing eastern and western musical concepts; (2) a primary validation of the effect of augmented reality in facilitating learning of the Chinese Guqin (3) a natural user interface for the learning system applying gesture detection. The result of user study shows our design is helpful in providing better learning experience and enhancing performance and memorization with markedly less time spent learning. This work shows how a new interface helps promote the use of heritage instruments and culture.	augmented reality;natural user interface;usability testing	Yingxue Zhang;Siqi Liu;Lu Tao;Chun Yu;Yuanchun Shi;Ying-Qing Xu	2015		10.1145/2739999.2740003	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-68.28462434591565	-42.97110656782743	70585

Not so long ago, it has moved from the paper version to the digital word allowing for a wider usage. In this paper we propose its usage as a teaching tool in the area of literature reading for the Croatian class (primary language). We have conducted a preliminary research in five Croatian high schools of a different profile to see how storyline visualization, and visualization of school materials in general, affects students understanding of the material being studied. Each school participated with two groups of students where one group was exposed to the storyline visualization of a novel Prokleta avlija by Ivo Andrić [N=103 in total] during the reading period, and the other one was reading without the visualization [N=93 in total]. We will present our results taking into account students' gender and type of a school.		K.

An empirical model of gaming motivations allows developers and researchers to create more effective and engaging experiences for entertainment and serious games. We developed an online app and used an iterative process to create the Gamer Motivation Profile. Using survey data from over 250,000 gamers worldwide, we used factor analysis to develop an empirical framework of gaming motivations and a validated tool to measure those motivations.  We identified 6 clusters of gaming motivations: Action (Excitement & Destruction), Social (Collaboration & Competition), Mastery (Strategy & Challenge), Achievement (Power & Completion), Creativity (Design & Discovery), and Immersion (Story & Fantasy).  In this talk, we'll first describe the motivations we identified, present findings on the higher-order relationships among these motivations, how they vary by gender and age, and how they are related to the Big 5 personality traits.  Respondents to the Gamer Motivation Profile also listed specific games they've enjoyed playing. In the second part of the talk, we'll present case studies of how we have applied this game audience data within the game industry to provide actionable insights for game marketing and production.	experience;factor analysis;immersion (virtual reality);iterative method;self-destruct;social collaboration;social engineering (security)	Nick Yee	2016		10.1145/2967934.2967937	psychology;simulation;multimedia;social psychology	HCI	-65.1269380011544	-39.333917157978725	70652

However when it comes to digital libraries, the interfaces have typically been designed for older children or adults. Therefore, we have begun to develop a digital library interface developmentally appropriate for young children (ages 5-10 years old). Our prototype system we now call SearchKids offers a graphical interface for querying, browsing and reviewing search results. This paper describes our motivation for the research, the design partnership we established between children and adults, our design process, the technology outcomes of our current work, and the lessons we have learned.	computer;digital library;graphical user interface;library (computing);prototype	Allison Druin;Benjamin B.

6fa53c71e3a5647c2f06683eeda0b6c09bcffb67	the impact of learning design on student behaviour, satisfaction and performance: a cross-institutional comparison across 151 modules	learning design;learner satisfaction;academic retention;learning analytics;virtual learning environment	Pedagogically informed designs of learning are increasingly of interest to researchers in blended and online learning, as learning design is shown to have an impact on student behaviour and outcomes. Although learning design is widely studied, often these studies are individual courses or programmes and few empirical studies have connected learning designs of a substantial number of courses with learning behaviour. In this study we linked 151 modules and 111.256 students with students' behaviour (<400 million minutes of online behaviour), satisfaction and performance at the Open University UK using multiple regression models. Our findings strongly indicate the importance of learning design in predicting and understanding Virtual Learning Environment behaviour and performance of students in blended and online environments. In line with proponents of social learning theories, our primary predictor for academic retention was the time learners spent on communication activities, controlling for various institutional and disciplinary factors. Where possible, appropriate and well designed communication tasks that align with the learning objectives of the course may be a way forward to enhance academic retention. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, limited by the layout of teaching materials, it is impossible to incorporate all knowledge referred by the curriculum outline into teaching materials, thus, some are selected and some are abandoned. For example, as the contents can only cover the key points of the general direction, more subtle knowledge could not be incorporated to be used as the expatiation among different key points, due to layout limitations, resulting in relatively weak correlations among the key points. The students who have poor comprehension may not understand the correlations, which thereby affect the students' learning effectiveness. This study suggest that concept maps can be used by teachers as an aid to design teaching material characteristics of more correlation and flexibility. Therefore, this study mainly designs a concept-map-oriented e-book teaching material design system. First, the teachers plan out the concept maps of the teaching materials according to their teaching experience, next, the system connects to the online e-book library, as based on the keywords on the concept maps, to obtain relevant information, then, the teachers select the information to be incorporated into the teaching materials, and finally, the teachers develop the selected information into teaching materials. Thus, the students will be able to read the e-book-format files and obtain the e-book teaching materials through e-book readers. This study divides the students into an experimental group and a control group in order to learn different teaching materials and evaluate the effectiveness of learning, according to test scores after learning, and the questionnaire of system acceptance degree. According to the experimental results, the average test scores of the experimental group are better than those of the control group. In other words, the teaching materials designed with the aid of concept maps can improve students' learning effectiveness.	compiler;concept map;e-book;e-reader;experiment;list comprehension;material design;teaching method	De Wei Chang;Chin-Feng Lai;Shih-Yeh Chen;Yueh-Min Huang;Yu-Lin Jeng	2014	2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing	10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.218	concept map;mathematics education;simulation;computer science;electrical engineering;machine learning;teaching method;mathematics;multimedia;electronic publishing;correlation;algorithm	AI	-77.16443369067434	-41.96588228089751	70821

The main objective is to build a research community around the intersection of these topical areas. In particular, SE@VBL aims to develop a critical discussion about the next generation of video-based learning environments and their analytics, the form of these analytics and the way they can be analyzed in order to help us to better understand and improve the value of educational videos to support teaching and learning. SE@VBL is based on the rationale that combining and analyzing learners' interactions with other available data obtained from learners, new avenues for research on video-based learning have emerged. This can have a significant impact in current educational trends such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Flipped Classroom.	design rationale;interaction;massive open online course;next-generation network;smart environment;synergy	Michail N.

Games have become a sophisticated extension of the reality and an interesting way for complementing human mind utopias. Training software allows the trainee to immerse in quasi-real controlled situations that could be measured by trainers. In this work we discuss the duality existing between the training based on a serious game and a simple game, based on state of the art technologies. Then we show a training system for telecommunications technicians based on a combination between serious games and “traditional” e-learning platform. We show results for a trial made with a group of students from different disciplines (not only engineering) in order to evaluate learning outcomes using serious games versus other learning approaches. In this paper we discuss such results and make a descriptive statistical analysis of the results.	mind	Andrés Navarro Cadavid;Juan Vicente Pradilla Ceron;Sebastian Londoño;Patricia Madrinan Rodriguez;Ivan Abadia Quintero;Julio Cesar Alonso;Alejandra Ximena Gonzalez	2013	2013 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2013.6684878	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;game mechanics;game developer;multimedia	HCI	-69.07989104990513	-43.49180317174215	70917

Farmtasia is the first online game designed to facilitate the VISOLE approach. We conducted a qualitative case study, in the setting of formal curricular teaching in a secondary school, to look into the course of students¡¦ learning in VISOLE. This paper discusses a part of the entire study, focusing on delineating an impeding phenomenon, arbitrary gaming, which emerged in an academic achievement-oriented student¡¦s learning process.

In this paper, we present COPSE: a novel and unique software framework for instantiating Microworlds as collaborative problem solving activities on tangible tabletop interfaces. The framework provides three types of building blocks: widgets (provide input and localized feedback), equations (define the model), and scenes (visualize feedback), which can be specified in the form of structured text. Aim of COPSE is to simplify processes of creating, adjusting, and reusing custom Microworlds scenarios. We describe the structure of the framework, provide an example of a scenario, and report on a case study where we have used COPSE together with 33 teachers to build new scenarios on the fly.	accessibility;computer scientist;hands-on computing;human factors and ergonomics;human–computer interaction;information;interactive media;iteration;microworlds;on the fly;online community;problem solving environment;requirement;software framework;structured text;tangible user interface;universal instantiation;web application;xml	Valérie Maquil;Eric Tobias;Dimitra Anastasiou;Hélène Mayer;Thibaud Latour	2017	PACMHCI	10.1145/3095808	collaborative problem solving;software framework;on the fly;structured text;end-user development;reuse;human–computer interaction;microworlds;computer science	HCI	-66.83380683242078	-41.82107815563681	71301

The aim of this study is to develop an understanding of cognitive load as a factor supporting or inhibiting students’ participation in online asynchronous discussions. We employ cognitive load theory as a theoretical perspective, applying it not only to participants’ cognitive load but also to their collaboration load. Through an experimental study, we confirm that anchoring discussion leads to more task-oriented communication and less need for social and planning comments, which leaves more time and effort for the creation of elaboration and evaluation of ideas. Furthermore, anchoring discussion leads to more efficient communication as it reduces cognitive load involved in correctly interpreting messages.

The participants included one instructor and a total of 42 preservice teachers. A technology team-teaching model (TTT) was designed in this study to restructure science method courses with technology. This study used a mixed-method design, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The results revealed that there were significant differences in ''designing an appropriate science topic to be taught with technology'' and ''integrating computer activities with appropriate pedagogy in classroom instruction'' (F=5.260, p<0.05, and F=10.260, p<0.01, respectively). The results also showed that the TTT model could enhance the integration of science teaching theories and practice. Team-teaching technique facilitated the integration of technology in science lesson design and teaching practice, and enhanced friendship through interaction. The TTT model could better the science learning experience of preservice teachers and serve as useful reference for other teacher education institutes.

4ab0b2230e40f316e1b0e958276e8ccd72c6bc02	authoring of educational mobile apps for the mathematics-learning analysis		The incorporation of mobile applications in educational environments generates a large amount of information resulting from the interaction of students with these applications. The analysis of this information can be of significant importance. The teacher may find it useful, as it can help them to make decisions or to assess the process of teaching/learning that it is applying within its teaching activities, allowing to improve the results or to detect certain patterns. However, the development of mobile applications that are capable of incorporating these features is not trivial for a user who does not have proper programming knowledge. This paper presents the vectorialZ application to support mathematics learning. This application has been developed using VEDILS mobile application authoring environment, which is based on MIT App Inventor 2. Finally, this application has been used with students to evaluate its usefulness and to obtain results about the students' learning.	app inventor for android;mobile app	Tatiana Person;José Miguel Mota;Maria del Carmen Listán;Iván Ruiz-Rube;Juan Manuel Dodero;Fernando Rambla Barreno;Concepción Muriel Patino;Ankit Servan;Juan Manuel Vidal Pérez	2018		10.1145/3284179.3284234		HCI	-67.93787085398219	-42.1594458498834	71609

Technologies in learning games can engage students and make the learning contents interesting to them. However, technologies themselves are seldom the subject of learning in the game they support. In addition, learning activities in a gaming context usually engage students temporarily in the subject. As soon as the game is over, students’ desire for learning may cease. The framework tries to achieve the transition of students’ interests from the initial interest motivated by the game to the later-developed cognitive and personal interests in the subject. Based on the framework, this study designs and experiments a practice to evaluate the proposed framework. Participants’ subjective responses show their satisfaction about the practice of learning and developing interest of the subject matter. This study not only provides a dual aspect of game technology adoption for motivating students, but also proposes a pedagogical framework for students’ lasting learning. It is expected to provide a new and valuable idea about the use of technologies and games in education.	cognition;experiment;subject matter expert turing test;wii	Yu-Liang Ting	2010	Educational Technology & Society		psychology;game design;games;vocational education;educational technology;simulation;cognition;emotion;game mechanics;teaching method;game developer;multimedia;game design document;game testing;pedagogy	HCI	-71.64727658627697	-42.00468094494728	71663

Therefore, we examined undergraduate students' personal external representations of matter. Fourteen undergraduates enrolled in general chemistry courses were interviewed about their drawings of matter in the solid, liquid, and gas phases. Data indicated that students spontaneously drew four different types of representations. We have developed rubrics for our classifications of students' representations based on their drawings. Implications of visual representations in teaching will also be discussed.		Jessica K. Weller;Mary B.

While the use of web-based technologies has increased rapidly in higher education, the different factors impacting on actual learning outcomes remain poorly understood in such e-learning environments. This paper presents the development of a theoretical model for e-learning effectiveness. The authors look through Webster and Hackley’s (1997) four dimensional lens, the Interaction-Based Model of elearning (Anderson, 2003), the Task-Technology-Fit (TTF) Model (Goodhue and Thompson, 1995), and the Integrated Model for Perceived e-Learner Satisfaction (Sun et al., 2008) in order to refine their concise theoretical model. This research concludes with both an outline of the empirical section of this research as well as a broader research agenda.	test template framework;theory;world wide web	Farhad Daneshgar;Christine Van Toorn;Daniel Schlagwein	2012			knowledge management;experiential learning;machine learning	AI	-76.03360326187116	-40.127991393993746	72443

7b62b2cb0b84d5b6d0344487417b722772bd4fcf	the right content at the right time: contextual examples for just-in-time creative learning		People often run into barriers when doing creative tasks with software because it is difficult to translate goals into concrete actions. While expert-made tutorials, examples, and documentation abound online, finding the most relevant content and adapting it to one's own situation and task is a challenge. My research introduces techniques for exposing relevant examples to novices in the context of their own workflows. These techniques are embodied in three systems. The first, RePlay, helps people find solutions when stuck by automatically locating relevant moments from expert-made videos. The second, DiscoverySpace, helps novices get started by mining and recommending expert-made software macros. The third, CritiqueKit, helps novices improve their work by providing ambient guidance and recommendations. Preliminary experiments with RePlay suggest that contextual video clips help people complete targeted tasks. Controlled experiments with DiscoverySpace and CritiqueKit demonstrate that software macros prevent novices from losing confidence, and ambient guidance improves novice output. My research illustrates the power of user communities to support creative learning.	documentation;experiment;just-in-time compilation;replay attack;video clip	C.

4f694ec92e2fe86ccb6f045126786bcfa17382b8	social networking as a tool for lifelong learning with orthopedically impaired learners		This paper discusses how Turkish Cypriot orthopedically impaired learners who are living in North Cyprus use social networking as a tool for leisure and education, and to what extent they satisfy their personal development needs by means of these digital platforms. The case study described, conducted in North Cyprus in 2015 followed a qualitative research methodology: semi-structured interviews and document analysis were used for data collection. The study sample of 20 orthopedically impaired participants was selected from among members of the Cyprus Turkish Association for the Orthopedically Disabled which asked for volunteers. The study concluded that impaired learners typically satisfy their social and learning needs, or their need for excitement and relaxation, through social media. It is clear that the use of social networking only satisfies individual needs and does not contribute to group interdependence: if orthopedically impaired learners actively directed themselves to communicating more effectively among themselves and creating groups, they could solve personal problems through group solidarity. Social networks contribute to orthopedically impaired learners’ lifelong education process: in addition to providing them with positive gratification, they also “informally” contribute to their personal education. Although the individuals who participated in this study do use social networks, more effort needs to be made within the context of North Cyprus to make use of social networks for formal education purposes.	group cohesiveness;interdependence;linear programming relaxation;semiconductor industry;social media;social network	Metin Ersoy;Ahmet Güneyli	2016	Educational Technology & Society		active learning;adult education;knowledge management;social learning;pedagogy;open learning;personal development;experiential learning;competence (human resources);lifelong learning;psychology	HCI	-74.2089631327203	-39.354531032238924	72889

Outcome expectation is an intrapersonal factor which influences individuals' motivation. In the present study, we examined outcome expectation beliefs with regard to integrating technology into teaching practice. Findings revealed that outcome expectation is a multifaceted construct consisting of three components (performance, self-evaluative and social outcome expectations), and that the ITOE scale shows good validity and psychometric properties. Use of the scale can help teacher educators and inservice providers more efficiently and effectively address outcome expectations as they help teachers integrate technology into their practice.

Cognitive biases heavily influence the decision making process, often against interests of those who make them. Therefore technological solutions that would support metacognitive scaffolding of learners may be very helpful. Our approach is based on Personal Learning Environments that provide both reflection and recommendation facilities. Preliminary results suggest that it can be a promising solution. Nevertheless, there are still challenges to be addressed, especially regarding the evaluation of this type of learning and supporting tools.	control flow	Milos Kravcik;Ralf Klamma	2014			knowledge management;decision-making;psychology;cognitive bias;metacognition;nudge theory;self-regulated learning	AI	-75.44150645830301	-44.03687039641402	73204

Computer-generated entities could expand the range and complexity of scenarios used in live training and could offer instructors a new means of manipulating the training environment. These new capabilities might help aircrew boost their proficiency beyond what is currently achieved in live training. On the other hand, computer-generated entities add artificiality to the live training environment, reducing its similarity to real combat. As part of a research program conducted to examine how the introduction of Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) training technology may change air combat training, we identified strategies to support learning and the acceleration of proficiency development. In this paper, we present these new possibilities for live training and discuss their implications for the fidelity of the training experience, related research, and research needs.	emergent;lvcmos;ripple	Kelly J.

The case is an online distance education program for training in-service teachers in special education in the 3D virtual world Second Life (SL). The “box,” a specific building block in the SL environment became a multipurpose tool for EUD in the study. The professor of the course designed the learning environment by creating and combining 3D boxes and then used boxes as containers to share course materials to the class. Some of the in-service teachers created boxes to personalize their learning activity. The conceptual framework for analysis integrates EUD concepts and concepts from sociocultural and constructivist learning theories (duality of learning; adaptation). We present an analysis of the participants’ spoken utterances and turn taking around the use of the boxes through the lens of two different EUD and learning situations (technology-adaptation and knowledge-adaptation). We show how participants take up these features to become engaged in the activity. One of the situations required the learners to adopt EUD techniques (technology-adaptation), and the professor used EUD techniques to enable knowledge-adaptation.	end-user development;second life	Anders I.

A new course for non-science undergraduates provided an opportunity for a constructivist design using the World Wide Web, email, and video. The design of the course, its implementation and evaluation are described. Authentic assessment was critical. Web forms and e-mail supported some necessary personal interactions, but collaborative work was problematical.	social constructivism	Stephen Bostock	1998	BJET	10.1111/1467-8535.00066	psychology;cooperative learning;educational technology;interaction;the internet;social science;simulation;self-assessment;constructivist teaching methods;computer science;teaching method;instructional design;multimedia;higher education;management;world wide web;pedagogy;collaboration	NLP	-75.62900127637	-38.84240575473224	73932

This stresses the delays of commercial launches, as it is necessary to be quickly able to position on the market.  Simplicity and utilisability evaluations of products or services is crucial to bring fast answers to decision-makers. Good assesment's scores will allow to minimize the risks.  To answer this problem, I describe in this article a test methodology that integrates on-line questionnaire sending to users' large number, and proposes the System Usability Scale's questionnaire to produce a utilisability final score directly understandable by the decision-makers.  The aim of this paper is to argue about the SUS choice, and give an example of implementation in this context.	crash reporter;incidence matrix;linear algebra;online and offline;system usability scale	Vanessa Larue	2009		10.1145/1629826.1629850	usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;web usability;component-based usability testing;cognitive walkthrough;simulation;usability;engineering;system usability scale;operations management;usability engineering;data mining;heuristic evaluation;usability lab;usability inspection	Web+IR	-63.99380943126029	-48.84348945677153	74420

Previous research suggests that multiple graphical representations (MGRs) may promote learning of fractions. Specifically, we hypothesized that providing students with MGRs of fractions, in addition to the conventional symbolic notation, leads to better learning outcomes as compared to instruction incorporating only one graphical representation. We anticipated, however, that MGRs would make the students’ task more challenging, since they must link the representations and distill from them a common concept or principle. Therefore, we hypothesized further that selfexplanation prompts would help students benefit from working with MGRs. To investigate these hypotheses, we conducted a classroom study in which 112 6grade students used intelligent tutors for fraction conversion and fraction addition. The results of the study show that students learned more with MGRs of fractions than with a single representation, but only when prompted to self-explain how the graphics relate to the symbolic fraction representations.	graphical user interface;graphics	Martina A.

We emphasize two main characteristics: a real-time full simulation of the technical domain, which works with a tutoring multi-agent architecture, ASITS. ASITS is supplied with reactive and cognitive agents to track the learner's performance, to detect inherent negative effects (the learner's cognitive gaps), and as a feedback issue, to identify some deficiencies that current training simulator lacks. Therefore, as the measuring of gap values with quantitative rules keeps sometimes hazardous, the concept of simulation has to be extended to a Qualitative Simulation approach.	intelligent agent;simulation	Guy Gouardères;Anton Minko;Luc Richard	2000		10.1007/3-540-45331-8_15	embedded system;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;machine learning;graphical user interface;distributed computing;reason;algorithm	ML	-74.34162264470162	-50.325911397537155	74526

By using new innovations teaching and learning has become technically very strong. Learning is becoming tech learning or e-learning. Educators and students are getting very smart and hence study and learning is also becoming smart. Maximum available learning systems don’t involve pen and paper based learning. Due to the emergence of ICTs in the learning atmosphere it doesn’t indicate that our traditional education methodologies have become outdated. Smart study is such a stage which allows students continue to learn in smart way by using smart pens and papers. Using smart paper and pen the contents written on the paper can be converted into digital format. Smart study using pen and paper is helpful for practicing handwriting in same traditional manner. This paper presents a smart study platform which combines work with printed and digital contents.

c27d236c8e91d15a0082006ea795073f23c45ac1	bringing computational thinking to teachers' training: a workshop review		In recent years, several visual programming languages and tools are emerging, which allow young students to easily program applications. Particularly, the block-based language used by Scratch has been the standard in most school initiatives to introduce Computational thinking (CT) in courses unrelated to computing. However, CT competences are not specifically included in the curricula of many Higher Education degrees that future teachers of Primary and Secondary Education have to complete. This paper describes a workshop for teachersu0027 training on CT. It is based on the block-based common language of Scratch, but focused on enhancing teachersu0027 skills to develop mobile applications with a tool based on the MITu0027s AppInventor. This workshop provided some insights on the capabilities of future teachers in the use of programming tools1.	app inventor for android;augmented reality;ct scan;computation;computational thinking;mobile app;mobile device;scratch (programming language);visual programming language	Juan Manuel Dodero;José Miguel Mota;Iván Ruiz-Rube	2017		10.1145/3144826.3145352	curriculum;pedagogy;scratch;knowledge management;higher education;visual programming language;cognitively guided instruction;computational thinking;computer science;competence (human resources)	HCI	-71.14064263471884	-38.35470983577916	74773
69d4bdbfb58fae8b67c15b502c13c8273a01312e	enhancing agile team collaboration through the use of large digital multi-touch cardwalls		Agile software development has become mainstream, and with it many tools have been developed to support Agile software development. Nonetheless, studies show, that most Agile software teams still also use physical cardboards for their daily work. This is error prone and causes a lot of extra effort to keep both in sync. In our research project we conducted an interview study about the reasons for this media break. Based on the findings we developed visualization and interaction concepts for an Agile cardwall using an extra-large multi-touch wall display which provides Agile teams the lightweight collaboration workspace for their Agile meetings. We implemented the concepts in the software prototype aWall, and evaluated the usability of aWall in a user study. The evaluation indicates that aWall enables and encourages team work due to the large size of the wall, the easy accessibility and visibility of the needed information, and the integration with existing issue tracking tools. This suggests that augmenting digital cardwalls with large interactive touch technology and integration with task tracking systems is a useful way to support effective collaborative Agile software development processes.	accessibility;agile software development;cognitive dimensions of notations;information access;issue tracking system;multi-touch;prototype;requirement;software prototyping;usability testing;workspace	Martin Kropp;Craig Anslow;Magdalena Mateescu;Roger Burkhard;Dario Vischi;Carmen G.

Some usability professionals argue that these usability tests simply reflect the preferences of the participants and should not be used in place of objective performance measures. In an attempt to strengthen the validity of the user-centered approach, the present study examined the association between subjective preference measures and objective performance measures in relation to the user’s hardware and software use and familiarity. The results suggest that not only do the subjective ratings of enduser evaluators often ditTer from objective performance measures, but also that this relationship is dependent on the user’s past computer experience. INTRODUCTION One activity in a user-centered approach to software usability testing involves the evaluation of the product software by end-users. However, the testing methods used in this approach vary. Some usability professionals use subjective ratings, while others use objective measures, and still others use a combination. Several studies have examined the extent of agreement between both types of measures [3, 4, 5]. The results of these studies have been mixed suggesting the iniluence of other factors. It is possible that hardware and software familiarity of end-user evaluators could strongly influence their subjective ratings of a software interfacehystem. Such an effect might explain the lack of correspondence between subjective ratings and objective measures.

CHI’ Companion 95, Denver, Colorado, USA @ 1995 ACM 0-89791 -755-3/95/0005...$3.50 Thus, a better understanding of this relationship would help usability professionals recruit an appropriate distribution of end-users for the evaluation process. Information regarding the potential relationship between subjective and objective usability measures may also be helpfid when only subjective ratings of systems are available. METHOD Participants Volunteer participants (N=12) stated that they had experience using a computer keyboard and mouse. The participants received course credit for participating. Survey information The computer experience survey was designed to show individual differences between evaluators. The survey addressed participants’ years of experience with computers, experience with different types of systems, hardware and software familiarity and use, and demographic information. Measures of preference, perceived ease-of-use, and expectation of high performance were collected using a 7-point Likert scale with left and right anchors of not at all and very much, respectively. Task A simple data retrieval task was used to assure that participants with varying levels of computer experience would be able to understand and evaluate the processes involved. The three interfaces used in the data retrieval task were 1) a command line, 2) a 2-level menu, and 3) a listbox. All three interfaces accessed the same database. The difference between interfaces was related to the method used to access the information. The command line interface had participants type in a customer name in order to retrieve the customer’s account number. The 2-level menu had participants access information by first categorizing the customer name within alphabetical ranges (i.e., A-E, F-H, etc.) by clicking on the appropriate button, then the participant searches a list of customer names from within the alphabetical range chosen and clicks on the appropriate	categorization;command-line interface;computer keyboard;data retrieval;database;game controller;information;international bank account number;software design and development;usability testing;user-centered design	George V.

Students, acting on their efficacy beliefs, make decisions regarding technology’s influence in improving their education. We construct a theoretical model in which internal and external factors affect a student’s self-efficacy which in turn affects the extent of adoption of a device for educational purposes. Through qualitative survey responses of university students who were given an Apple iPad to keep for the duration of a university course we find high levels of self-efficacy leading to positive views of the technology’s learning enhancement capabilities. Student observations on the practicality of the technology, off-topic use and its effects, communication, content, and perceived market advantage of using a tablet are also explored.	hands-on computing;interaction;off topic;tablet computer;theory;ipad;ipod	Leslie J.

Collaborative learning techniques are widely used in business schools. There is research evidence to suggest that collaborative learning leads to positive outcomes. Specifically, the interaction that occurs among students in completing the group task provides both educational and social benefits. The easy availability of communication technology has changed the modality of interaction among students. This change has been furthered by an increase in the number of students who work full-time and also enroll in business schools. Such students tend to interact more using communication technologies, such as electronic mail and not necessarily face-to-face. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of these changes in communication modalities on the outcomes of group work. The results indicate that while students have a preference for using traditional face-to-face interaction, there seems to be no significant correlation between communication modality and measures of group outcomes.	email;modality (human–computer interaction)	Radhika Santhanam	2001	Information Technology and Management	10.1023/A:1011498500959	collaborative learning;information and communications technology;knowledge management;multimedia;empirical research	HCI	-74.43921509315113	-41.037342895339776	76543

Each type of learners learns primarily through one of the main receiving senses, visual, listening, or by doing. Learner style has an effect on the learning process and learner’s achievement. It is better to select suitable learning tool for the learner according to his learning style. In this work, a fuzzy model for predicting learner style depending on characteristics of the learner is proposed. The system was tested on a group of students and compared to their results from the online VARK questionnaire which is a tool that is used to give the students information on how to maximize their learning. The new proposed fuzzy inference system gave 48 % similar classification compared with the VARK.	fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;inference engine;interactivity;read-write memory;test case	Marwah Alian;Adnan Shaout	2016	Education and Information Technologies	10.1007/s10639-016-9543-4	fuzzy logic;kinesthetic learning;auditory learning;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;communication	HCI	-76.40453702877322	-43.70551152660066	76550

Additionally, the growth of mobile communications industry has led to the development of a new approach to Language Learning called Mobile Assisted Language Learning (MALL). On the other hand, digital educational resources and activities are typically organized as Learning Objects and supported by Educational Metadata, they are stored in Learning Objects Repositories (LORs) facilitating efficient search, retrieval and re-use among different educational communities. Although the IEEE LOM Standard is used for describing educational resources with metadata, it is beyond its scope to directly support the description of characteristics related with MALL. In this paper we target addressing this issue, that is, to propose an IEEE LOM Application Profile that can be used for tagging educational resources suitable for Language Learning and supported by Mobile and Wireless Devices.

Participants of the study (N=76) engaged with the tool after first completing an assigned learning task related to geography or history using learning materials from the Didactalia platform for approximately 30 minutes and afterwards freely exploring the platform for 30-45 minutes. The related behavior data was tracked and analyzed by the AFEL learning tool. After completing the two tasks, participants received an introduction to the tool and explored them as well. The results suggest a satisfactory experience with the tool and provide insights on the potential benefits, as well as aspects to be improved for further development.

c69a0e563025cc62c31bb94eca5132be2a3cd514	international standards and usability measurement	internal standard	The current trend of increased web usage has recognized the need of usable websites. A site containing relevant information may not gain user acceptance if the user finds it difficult to use. A quantifiable measure of usability can provide a measurable estimate of improvement required in the website. It can also help in comparing different websites. This measure would gain wider acceptability, if obtained, by applying the international standards of measurement. This paper measures usability quantitatively using the international standard ISO/IEC TR 9126-2. Metrics specified in the standards are used to measure the four sub-characteristics of usability, “Learnability”, “Operability”, “Understandability” and “Attractiveness” for an academic website. It was found that the “Learnability” level of the website was very low, as compared to the Understandability level. This is not in conformation with the standards, which mention the latter to be an indicator of the former. The significance and relevance of each metric to usability of the website was then examined in this light. The study also highlight the long due need of standardizing the process of usability measurement.	criticality matrix;learnability;operability;relevance;usability;usability testing	Hema Banati;P. S.

This study was conducted to examine the effects of handheld technology instructional approaches on performance of students of different achievement levels in Probability at a private higher learning institution in Malaysia. A quasi-experimental study with non-equivalent control group design with pre-test and post-test design was conducted on a sample of 65 students. The sample was divided into the experimental group and control group. The handheld technology instructional approaches, i.e. teaching and learning approaches using the graphing calculator (GC) as a teaching and learning tool and the GC instructional worksheets, were employed in the teaching and learning of probability in the experimental group. The conventional teaching approach was adopted in the control group. Quantitative and qualitative methods were employed to collect and analyse data. Quantitative data was collected using the Probability Achievement Test (PAT). PAT was administered to both groups at the beginning and end of the study. Qualitative data was collected using students' journals. The results show that students, the high, average and low achievers, gained benefits when the handheld technology instructional approaches were used in learning Probability, particularly random variable, poisson distribution, binomial distribution and normal distribution. Significantly improved achievement in Probability when students use GC in Probability learning.GC benefits students of all levels, i.e. high, average and low mathematics achievers.The low achievers benefited the most from this approach.Students' Probability performance increases, especially low achievers.	handheld game console;performance	Choo-Kim Tan;Choo-Peng Tan	2015	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2014.11.011	psychology;mathematics education;simulation;computer science;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-75.81056241341481	-42.73554670214685	77194

The software comprises modules for visualization and simulative manipulation. Differences in learning performance of using the learning software either with or without the simulative manipulation module were investigated in 49 college sophomores. The learning performance was higher for learning software utilizing simulative manipulation and visualization yields than for that lacking simulative manipulation, which suggests that learning performance can be enhanced if visualized learning can appropriately integrate simulative manipulation activities. An analysis of the learning process revealed that the use of simulative manipulation activities to verify and clarify the existing knowledge is crucial to improving the learning performance.	norm (social);simulation	Yu-Lung Chen;Yu-Ru Hong;Yao-Ting Sung;Kuo-En Chang	2011	Educational Technology & Society		computer simulation;educational technology;electronics;simulation;visualization;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-70.57221216198035	-43.161607241452394	77227

In e-Education environments, especially in the case of distance learning, giving feedback becomes more challenging because there are often no opportunities for face-to-face interaction. Typically, a supervisor provides comments to learners in written form via email; however, the use of recorded audio feedback (RAF) in e-Education environments has become a viable alternative. This work in progress reports on learners' perceptions of RAF in a multi-cultural higher e-Education context. Our observations indicate that learners tend to have positive feelings toward RAF and that RAF potentially moderates cultural effects. The observations are discussed in light of the relevant literature, and future research questions are proposed.	audio feedback;email	Anneli Heimbürger;Ville Isomöttönen	2017	2017 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2017.8190646	knowledge management;cultural diversity;sociology;feeling;perception;nonverbal communication;information technology;supervisor;distance education;schedule	HCI	-72.5182374169583	-45.62081304271121	77450

Despite the advantages of the wiki technology, a number of questions concerning design of appropriate activities and their learning effectiveness remain open. In this paper, we present the results of three activities involving first-year university students using wikis to learn basic concepts related to information technology. Three activities of different classes were designed and delivered to the students using the framework proposed by West and West (2009). In all studies, a one-group pretest–posttest design was adopted. Results illustrated significant improvement in learning outcomes, particularly for students with low initial performance. The average students’ questionnaire score jumped from 39.0/100 to 57.3/100. No significant effect of both students’ role in the activity and their school stream on learning gain was observed. Finally, regardless of the activity’s class and learning goal, a persistent pattern of high learning gain was observed.	web 2.0;wiki	Panagiota Altanopoulou;Nikolaos K.

Such reflection aids the building of a productive online community of practice. In addition, by encouraging participants to reflect on later stages of their online training experiences, a reflection–on–action record can be built up. Participants' reflective processes can be captured through analysis of their on screen text messages and so be available for research purposes. Examples of conference text message reflections are given throughout the paper, drawn from the on screen reflections of Open University Business School (OUBS) Associate Lecturers who were working online through the medium of computer mediated conferencing for the first time. The conclusion is that reflection–on–practice in the online environment is beneficial for helping the participants to learn from online conferencing and can provide an excellent tool for qualitative research. Opportunities for reflection need to be built into the design of online conferences and facilitated by a trained e–moderator.	amiga reflections	Gilly Salmon	2002	BJET	10.1111/1467-8535.00275	professional development;psychology;the internet;social science;simulation;teleconference;human–computer interaction;computer science;qualitative research;multimedia;sociology;higher education;management;law;world wide web;pedagogy;computer-mediated communication	Theory	-75.2127687424242	-38.738261698965836	77922

Yet these variables may influence students' instructional outcomes. In this paper, we introduce the Spatial Classroom Log Explorer (SPACLE): a prototype tool that facilitates the rapid discovery of relationships between within-software and out-of-software events. Unlike previous tools for retrospective analysis, SPACLE replays moment-by-moment analytics about student and teacher behaviors in their original spatial context. We present a data analysis workflow using SPACLE and demonstrate how this workflow can support causal discovery. We share the results of our initial replay analyses using SPACLE, which highlight the importance of considering spatial factors in the classroom when analyzing ITS log data. We also present the results of an investigation into the effects of student-teacher interactions on student learning in K-12 blended classrooms, using our workflow, which combines replay analysis with SPACLE and causal modeling. Our findings suggest that students' awareness of being monitored by their teachers may promote learning, and that """"gaming the system"""" behaviors may extend outside of educational software use."""	causal filter;experiment;interaction;prototype;replay value	Kenneth Holstein;Bruce M.

The goal is helping in finding evidence about a particular research topic and mapping a research area, respectively. Their steps are laborious and a computational support is essential to improve the quality of their conduction. Aiming to offer computational support to these types of reviews, the StArt (State of the Art through Systematic Review) tool was developed. Besides the expected functionalities, StArt generates studies score, uses information visualization and text mining techniques to facilitate the research area mapping and to identify the studies relevance. StArt has been developed through an incremental process by academics who adopt SR and SM. As the expectation is to have a tool that really aids the conduction of these types of reviews, new ideas are always investigated and make StArt different from other alternatives. Visualization and text mining techniques seems to be a powerful resource for facilitating data abstraction in the context of SRs and SMs, allowing the improvement of the review and the conclusions about it.	abstraction (software engineering);computation;information visualization;relevance;scientific literature;systematic review;text mining	Sandra Camargo Pinto Ferraz Fabbri;Elis Montoro Hernandes;André Di Thommazo;Anderson Belgamo;Augusto Zamboni;Cleiton Silva	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-40654-6_15	computer science;data science;data mining;information retrieval	HCI	-63.84213351801426	-49.6572711673724	78120

The existing literature tends to focus on computer-based scaffolding by itself rather than integrating it with teacher support. This study examined students’ inquiry learning skills and content knowledge when they utilized a virtual learning environment called Supervolcano: Kikai Caldera. The present study specifically explored how the timing of teacher-based metacognitive scaffolding in combination with different types of computer-based procedural scaffolding affected students’ science inquiry learning. To answer this question, a 2 2 factorial design was conducted. One factor examined continuous and faded computer-based procedural scaffolds, and the other factor investigated early and late teacher-based metacognitive scaffolds. Students who received both continuous computer-based procedural scaffolding and early teacher-based metacognitive scaffolding performed best in acquiring scientific inquiry skills. Students using both faded computer-based procedural and early teacher-based metacognitive scaffolding had the worst performance in learning scientific inquiry skills. However, although we applied different types of scaffolding, the results showed no statistically significant difference among the groups’ science learning knowledge. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we investigate the impact of automatically generated hints on educational outcomes in a robust experiment that shows that hints help students persist in deductive logic courses. Three instructors taught two semester-long courses, each teaching one semester using a logic tutor with hints, and one semester using the tutor without hints, controlling for the impact of different instructors on course outcomes. Our results show that students in the courses using a logic tutor augmented with automatically generated hints attempted and completed significantly more logic proof problems, were less likely to abandon the tutor, and performed significantly better on a post-test implemented within the tutor.

The purpose of this study was to conduct an evaluation of this implementation. The research methodology included qualitative field observation and quantitative analysis of students’ responses to surveys. The results indicated that: a) Overall, the devices had a strong positive impact on student ratings; b) All instructors used the devices actively, and encouraged collaboration; though they differed in quizzing and collaborative practices; c) Though all instructors’ student ratings were high, there were significant differences that may have been mediated by these differences in practices.	embedded system;emoticon;real-time transcription	Joshua Maib;Richard Hall;Harvest Collier;Marcie Thomas	2006			simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-74.79345769952168	-40.257651010304144	78314

Conventional usability testing methodologies, such as formal user testing, can be expensive, time consuming and labour intensive; less resource-demanding alternatives can yield unreliable results. Automating aspects of usability testing would improve its efficiency and make it more practical to perform throughout development. An automated usability testing tool should capture as input the properties of an application’s graphical user interface, the sequence of user actions as they use the application to achieve particular tasks, their behaviour and comments, as well as a description of these tasks. The tool should evaluate both the static and dynamic properties of the interface, examine navigational burden and suggest modifications or templates that would improve usability. Results should be quick and easy to interpret, and be understandable by personnel other than specialised testers. Several existing tools that are typical of the tools available today meet some but not all of these requirements. In this paper we describe the design of the HUIA testing framework, in which we have to meet as many of these requirements as possible.	graphical user interface;mobile device;requirement;test automation;usability testing	Fiora Au;Simon Baker;Ian Warren;Gillian Dobbie	2008			usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;think aloud protocol;web usability;component-based usability testing;cognitive walkthrough;simulation;usability;human–computer interaction;white-box testing;computer science;operating system;usability engineering;mobile device;software testing;system testing;heuristic evaluation;usability inspection	SE	-63.628033880415195	-47.59336109356477	78715

Experiments have revealed that the technical environment is not as important as we had expected beforehand.

Through controlled usability tests of two websites with disabled users (N=7) and a control group (N=6) we found that only 27% of the identified website accessibility problems could have been identified through the use of WCAG. We conclude from this that in its current version, the application of WCAG alone is not sufficient to guarantee website accessibility. WCAG has a large potential for improvement, and our data point to some problem areas that we suggest should be included. We recommend that future versions of accessibility guidelines should be based on empirical data and validated empirically.	data point;heuristic;usability testing;web accessibility initiative;web content accessibility guidelines	Dagfinn Rømen;Dag Svanæs	2008		10.1145/1463160.1463238	web usability;usability;human–computer interaction;computer science;data mining;world wide web	HCI	-63.55452306959597	-47.28220368222947	79194

The benefit of collaborating with each other is certainly undeniable, such tools, however, can be a distraction from the actual tasks for learners. The paper presents a study on social media tools supported by various eLearning systems to understand the impact on students learning activities. A survey questionnaire is designed for this purpose. The data is collected from students who have had experience using different massive open online course (MOOC) eLearning platforms and LMS from various universities. The results of the survey indicate that more than 95 % of the participants use at least one of the social tools in their daily life activities, and almost 84 % of them have used these tools in connection with the eLearning systems. It is also interesting to note that 92 % of the participants intend to use social tools for study purposes. The results indicate that there is a need to integrate more of these social media tools into eLearning systems.	social collaboration	Ali Shariq Imran;Krenare Pireva;Fisnik Dalipi;Zenun Kastrati	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-39483-1_31	human–computer interaction;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-73.74351350508415	-39.997866528655685	79224

However, due to the distributed nature of such systems, conventional educational research methods, such as surveys and observations, provide only limited snapshots. In addition, educational data mining, as an emergent research approach, has seldom been used to explore teachers’ online behaviors when using digital libraries. Building upon results from a preliminary study, this article presents results from a clustering study of teachers’ usage patterns while using an educational digital library tool, called the Instructional Architect. The clustering approach employed a robust statistical model called latent class analysis. In addition, frequent itemsets mining was used to clean and extract common patterns from the clusters initially generated. The final clusters identified three groups of teachers in the IA: key brokers, insular classroom practitioners, and inactive islanders. Identified clusters were triangulated with data collected in teachers’ registration profiles. Results showed that increased teaching experience and comfort with technology were related to teachers’ effectiveness in using the IA.	algorithm;cluster analysis;digital library;educational data mining;emergence;experience;horizontal situation indicator;k-means clustering;latent class model;library (computing);polygon triangulation;snapshot (computer storage);statistical model;sticky bit;sticky keys;triangulation (geometry);unicom system architect;usage data;web resource;word lists by frequency	Beijie Xu;Mimi Recker	2012	Educational Technology & Society		pedagogy;multimethodology;computer science;triangulation (social science);data science;instructional design;digital library;cluster analysis;analytics;educational research;educational data mining	HCI	-76.35466780523966	-38.338616965709775	79582

25f946d2a7c0942456e188c42564b67a0ec4f074	subgoal labeled worked examples improve k-12 teacher performance in computer programming training		Technology has become integrated into many facets of our lives. Due to the rapid onset of this integration, many current K-12 teachers do not have the skills required to supply the sudden demand for technical training. This deficit, in turn, has created a demand for professional development programs that allow working teachers to learn computer science so that they might become qualified to teach this increasingly important field. Subgoal labeled worked examples have been found to improve the performance of learners in highly procedural domains. The present study tested subgoal labeled worked examples in an online learning program for teachers. Teachers who received the subgoal labels solved novel problems more accurately than teachers who received the same worked examples without the subgoal labels.

The program seeks to promote students’ divergent thinking to aid in the process of problem solving. The participants consisted of 72 11 grade high school students who were assigned to one of three conditions: 1) information-based (ISCinfo), 2) game-based (ISCgame) and 3) game-based with peer-like intelligent agent (ISCgame-agent) conditions. The results revealed that the ISCgame and the ISCgame-agent facilitated diversified ideas in problem solving and were considered beneficial for brainstorming. Although the divergent thinking process may not transfer to problem solving results immediately, it is our hope that the empirical result can shed some lights on the development of game-based systems for collaborative learning and problem solving support.	cube;intelligent agent;problem solving;software agent	Chun-Chieh Huang;Ting-Kuang Yeh;Tsai-Yen Li;Chun-Yen Chang	2010	Educational Technology & Society		psychology;computer simulation;mathematics education;divergent thinking;games;social science;simulation;motivation;brainstorming;science education;computer science;engineering;mathematics;statistical significance;cognitive load;game design document;management;social psychology;formative assessment;correlation;effect size;statistics;pedagogy	AI	-72.74784215825807	-42.636470601793256	79724

While there are many techniques and tools for memorizing such information, sustaining motivation remains a major barrier towards progress in these subjects. In order to help fill this gap, we brainstormed, experimented, and paper-prototyped to create Picard, a Facebook game that intertwines creative and social elements to turn rote learning into a creative, engaging experience. Picard, inspired by Pictionary, encourages players to come up with creative stories and images to help remember a particular card. Players compete and cooperate with their friends on Facebook to create the most memorable and funny mnemonics, called Picards, gaining points when they help themselves or others remember flashcards. Players use these Picards to learn and prove knowledge of the material at spaced intervals, which research has shown to be maximally effective for learning. Our game is the novel combination of an established learning methodology with player creativity and social support for learning. Picard increases player investment in the process of learning by allowing players to create and share useful visual mnemonics, while at the same time motivating and structuring their study habits through spaced-repetition quizzes.	mnemonics (keyboard);musicbrainz picard;social network game;social support;vocabulary	Kathleen Tuite;Timothy Pavlik;Sandra B.

The majority of the enrolled high school students failed to pass algebra in the previous semester. Students were randomly assigned in approximately equal proportions to work with the Carnegie Learning Algebra Cognitive Tutor or the ALEKS Algebra Course. Using the tutoring system exclusively, the students completed a 4-h-a-day, 14-day summer school high school algebra class for credit. The results revealed that both tutoring systems produced statistically and practically meaningful learning gains on measures of arithmetic and algebra knowledge.		Kent E. Sabo;Robert K.

A common hurdle for healthcare students and practitioners is the sheer amount of information that they have to make sense of. Another challenge is where this information is captured and stored, with people utilising personal, as well as institutionally owned devices. A potential solution to these problems is the use of social bookmarking applications such as “delicious”, where users can create a centralised repository of online resources, share them with other users, and view what others are bookmarking. This paper describes research conducted at the University of Greenwich involving 160 participants across three Schools and 5 modules, including Health and Social Care who were encouraged to integrate social bookmarking into their learning and teaching. Participants were instructed to tag their resources with an appropriate module code tag e.g. NURS1297 so that a repository of module specific bookmarks was created. Over a 4 month period, 160 users created 1430 bookmarks with 5032 tags. Further analysis of the bookmarking behaviour is discussed along with reflections on the suitability of social bookmarking to create digitally literate health care communities of practice.	amiga reflections;bookmark (world wide web);centralisation	Ed de Quincey;Avril Hocking;Josephine O'Gorman;Simon Walker;Liz Bacon	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-29262-0_21	database;multimedia;management;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-66.81712027537456	-38.470875945667025	80236

As it has been previously reported, we developed an agent system, which is based on an electronic educational instance for a learning module to incorporate information from the environment as well as non-verbal reactions of a user. The system is then capable of proactively reacting to this additional information, establishing a natural user interface as it might be expected by any user.

To this end, they have to exchange and discuss their individual knowledge, which is usually gained through individual exploration of different learning materials. Based on the psycholinguistic concept of lexical alignment, the following study analyzes whether providing learners with different technical terms in their respective learning materials has a positive impact on information exchange, term understanding, and learning. Results showed that dyads whose materials contained different terminology exchanged more information and performed better in a subsequent knowledge test than did dyads whose materials contained the same terminology. The inclusion of illustrations containing different terminology enhanced these effects. Implications for the selection and design of learning materials as well as perspectives for further research are discussed.		Elisabeth Paus;Gisela M.

8b370d3f62fe6dff2eab767e927ce90bf2cc50e7	designing pronunciation learning tools: the case for interactivity against over-engineering		Paired role-play is a common collaborative activity in language learning classrooms, adding meaning and cultural context to the learning process. This is complemented by teachersu0027 immediate and explicit feedback. Interactive tools that provide explicit feedback during collaborative learning are scarce, however. More commonly, supporting dialogue practice takes the form of computer-aided single-student read-and-record activities. This limitation is partly due to the complexity of processing language learnersu0027 speech in unconstrained tasks. In this paper, we assess the value of pronunciation error detection algorithms within a realistic, software-aided, paired role-playing task with beginning learners of French. We found that studentsu0027 pronunciations improve regardless of the type of error detector employed -- even for those using simple heuristics. We suggest that speech technologies for language learning have been too focused on engineering goals. Instead, new interactive designs supporting collaboration may be used to overcome engineering limitations and properly support studentsu0027 engagement.	algorithm;ecology;error detection and correction;feedback;heuristic (computer science);human–computer interaction;interactivity;natural language processing;problem solving	Sean Robertson;Cosmin Munteanu;Gerald Penn	2018		10.1145/3173574.3173930	interactivity;multimedia;language acquisition;human–computer interaction;error detection and correction;processing;computer science;pronunciation;collaborative learning;heuristics	HCI	-72.47632007505659	-45.67594649354479	80418

The combined approach, which has not been tried before, is suited for adding tutoring capabilities to an existing problem-solving environment, for example an off-the-shelf simulator. Connecting the components (i.e., the simulator and CTAT) requires programming but once that is done, “Pseudo Tutors” are created “by demonstration. Following this approach, we created plug-in Pseudo Tutor agents for a thermodynamics simulator, CyclePad [1], which were tried out in a classroom experiment involving 92 college students. The experiment demonstrates that the Pseudo Tutor technology is viable in a complex domain and that Ritter and Koedinger’s protocol for the tool-tutor communication is suited for use in an authoring environment.	computer architecture simulator;plug-in (computing);problem solving environment;simulation	Vincent Aleven;Carolyn Penstein Rosé	2005			simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-67.5432703237667	-42.498211066991566	80496

Educators and museum curators recognise the value of interactivity, but the optimum level of interactivity in informal learning remains unclear. We developed an informal learning activity with quiz questions about art theory, which we integrated in a between-groups experimental design with three groups of high-school students at an art gallery. Each of the three groups received a different treatment: (a) an interactive mobile-based learning activity, (b) a paper-based version of the same learning activity, and (c) a self-guided museum tour. Students who enrolled with the interactive version showed higher performance in the postassessment test when compared to the paper-based version. Notably, the benefits of the interactive version are attributed to the immediate feedback of the quiz application during the visit. Further research should perform similar controlled experiments in order to assess the learning benefit of more immersive interactive systems, such as three-dimensional graphics and augmented reality.

This paper presents a reflective analysis of a variant of the “Usability and Accessibility” course for MSc students, developed and delivered by the author over five successive semesters at the IT University of Copenhagen. The aim is to examine whether this course provided an effective and useful method for raising the issues around Universal Access with the designers of the future. This paper examines the results and conclusions from the students over five semesters of this course and provides an overview of the success of the different design and evaluation methods.

56d0daab6089812cf1d2a0c419c4738f79f12370	modeling student engagement and attrition in bjcx, a cs principles mooc: (abstract only)		One method of increasing accessibility to computer science education is through massive open online courses (MOOCs). The Beauty and Joy of Computing MOOC (BJCx) on edX is an introductory computer science course aimed to reach a broad audience of learners and designed to fulfill the AP CS Principles curriculum. However, like most MOOCs, BJCx faces high rates of student attrition. Some of this can be attributed to variance in student intentions; there are students who enroll only to browse the material with no plan of completing the course. On the other hand, the attrition of those students who intend to finish but drop out along the way is a point of concern. It could be reduced if course staff could predict it using the students' behavior and intervene. In this project, I explore how patterns of student engagement with course material can predict attrition. Using a recurrent neural network, I model student behavior over time. I am then able to analyze the behavioral patterns which are likely to precede dropping out. Furthermore, I explore which topics in the course curriculum most often immediately precede students dropping out. I visualize the time-series trends overlaid with the curriculum in order to gain insights into correlations between introductory computer science topics and student attrition. This information, along with the predictive student engagement model, can potentially allow teachers to design interventions at MOOC scale, something that is otherwise lacking in comparison to traditional classroom settings where the teacher can directly gauge student behavior.	ap computer science principles;accessibility;artificial neural network;attrition (website);behavioral pattern;browsing;cs games;massive open online course;recurrent neural network;time series;edx	Yifat Amir	2018		10.1145/3159450.3162310	curriculum;attrition;knowledge management;computer science;behavioral pattern;psychological intervention;student engagement	AI	-75.40968153269195	-44.70853445310922	80918
32b51132db2331899136056b3185d137745789da	evaluation of a hybrid mathematics methods course for novice teachers		This paper reports the evaluation of a hybrid mathematics methods course for novice teachers. During a fifteen-week semester, participants met face-to-face for approximately 60% of the semester and took advantage of an online format for the other 40% of the semester. Online activities included asynchronous discussion board postings, synchronous chats as an entire class, synchronous chats in small groups, evaluation of technology tools, and electronic surveys. The researcher used participants’ feedback to evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid format. In addition, the researcher reflected upon his own experiences as instructor to inform future course structure decisions. Within the context of the Rich Environments for Active Learning (REAL) framework, results suggest that cooperative support was a key component of the effectiveness of the experience. Further, participants emphasized one particular generative learning activity as an effective component of this course. Finally, this paper discusses implications for mathematics professional development facilitators.	experience	Christopher J.

Many of these communities provide an essential social function by enabling people with medical or personal problems to discuss their concerns with others. Physicians can provide the facts, but other patients can tell you what it really feels like and what to expect next, in a way that only someone with personal experience can. A study of the messages from an on-line medical support group shows that empathy is an essential ingredient in participants’ discussions. Better tools are needed to empower patients to help themselves by finding information and contacting other patients in bulletin board communities. Suggestions about the nature of these tools are discussed. In particular, supporting a balance between empathic and factual communication is stressed. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

380fdb98d66241e3769143d9c6564f23c053ec89	the continuous hint factory - providing hints in vast and sparsely populated edit distance spaces		Intelligent tutoring systems can support students in solving multistep tasks by providing hints regarding what to do next. However, engineering such next-step hints manually or via an expert model becomes infeasible if the space of possible states is too large. Therefore, several approaches have emerged to infer next-step hints automatically, relying on past students’ data. In particular, the Hint Factory (Barnes and Stamper, 2008) recommends edits that are most likely to guide students from their current state towards a correct solution, based on what successful students in the past have done in the same situation. Still, the Hint Factory relies on student data being available for any state a student might visit while solving the task, which 1 ar X iv :1 70 8. 06 56 4v 2 [ cs .A I] 3 0 Ju n 20 18 Preprint as provided by the authors. 2 is not the case for some learning tasks, such as open-ended programming tasks. In this contribution we provide a mathematical framework for edit-based hint policies and, based on this theory, propose a novel hint policy to provide edit hints in vast and sparsely populated state spaces. In particular, we extend the Hint Factory by considering data of past students in all states which are similar to the student’s current state and creating hints approximating the weighted average of all these reference states. Because the space of possible weighted averages is continuous, we call this approach the Continuous Hint Factory. In our experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that the Continuous Hint Factory can predict more accurately what capable students would do compared to existing prediction schemes on two learning tasks, especially in an open-ended programming task, and that the Continuous Hint Factory is comparable to existing hint policies at reproducing tutor hints on a simple UML diagram task. keywords: next-step hints, Hint Factory, edit distances, computer science education, Gaussian Processes	chi;cognitive science;computer programming;computer science;cryptographic hash function;diagram;edit distance;educational data mining;euclidean distance;experiment;gaussian process;heart rate variability;ibm notes;nonlinear gameplay;norm (social);population;sensemaking;spaces;spatial variability;uml state machine;unified modeling language;unit testing	Benjamin Paaßen;Barbara Hammer;Thomas William Price;Tiffany Barnes;Sebastian Gross;Niels Pinkwart	2017	CoRR		computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;edit distance;theoretical computer science;factory	ML	-74.71822640281223	-51.73335517151801	81737

A key issue involves the factors motivating the adoption of the Web for learning. Drawing upon social cognitive theory (SCT) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study adopts a cognition-motivation-control view to assess learner adoption intentions for Web-based learning. The proposed model is validated by surveying 319 undergraduate students who had enrolled in Web-based courses and attended a 12-hour training program on using a Web-based system for academic learning. The empirical findings identified that efficacy control and efficacy expectations can be used to guide learner adaptation learning behaviors on the Web. The limitations of this study are discussed and future research directions suggested. 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Free play is important in any early development program, but designing activities for free play is challenging. In this paper, we investigate the use of an interactive surface, BendableSound, a fabric-based interactive surface that enables young children to play piano sounds when touching the fabric, and its potential value in early education classrooms. We conducted a 9-week exploratory study in which 22 toddlers and 5 teachers used BendableSound during free play activities inside their classroom. Our qualitative results indicate that BendableSound was successfully adopted and integrated in toddler classrooms and could positively impact cognitive, social, and physical development. These results offer implications for the design of deformable surfaces and for their integration in activities to support the early development of toddlers.	programmer	Franceli Linney Cibrian;Nadir Weibel;Monica Tentori	2016		10.1145/2971648.2971695	simulation;multimedia	HCI	-65.27739507832322	-40.610204755431646	82342

In this paper, we propose a learning scenario that enhances players’ motivation thanks to individual, collaborative and social activities and that offers a continuous experience between the virtual environment and real places (archaeological sites, museum). After describing the challenge to a rich multidisciplinary approach involving both computer scientists and archaeologists, we present two types of game: multiplayer online role-playing games and mixed reality games. We build on the specificities of these games to make the design choices described in the paper. We also present three modular features we have developed to support independently three activities of the scenario. The proposed approach aims at raising awareness among people on the scientific approach in Archaeology, by providing them information in the virtual environment and encouraging them to go on real sites. We finally discuss the issues raised by this work, such as the tensions between the perceived individual, team and community utilities, as well as the choice of the entering point in the learning scenario (real or virtual) for the players’ involvement in the game.	computer scientist;mixed reality;virtual reality	Mathieu Loiseau;Élise Lavoué;Jean-Charles Marty;Sébastien George	2014	EAI Endorsed Trans.

The environmental settings of the simulation is classified into environmental factors and emotional factors. The environmental factors consist of a number of students, class session, class duration, type of subject, and year of study, while the emotional factors include the negative emotional states of student (e.g. anger, anxiety or boredom) and the emotional states of lecturers. In this simulation, a lecturer, who might have ideas on new strategies based on their experience, is able to insert a new strategy using a proposed Strategy Specification Settings Interface.

A conceptual framework describing what effectiveness means in the context of DGBL and which are its subcomponents has hitherto been lacking however. Hence, the goal of this paper is to propose a conceptualization and operationalization of effectiveness rooted in social-cognitive theory. In order to identify desired outcomes and be able to operationalize effectiveness, focus groups were organized with three stakeholder groups following a user requirements analysis methodology. Results indicate that three categories of desired outcomes can be distinguished: learning, motivational and efficiency outcomes. For the different outcomes, different subcomponents can be extracted which can be organized hierarchically. Learning outcomes that are seen as relevant to the effectiveness of DGBL are 1) increased interest in the subject matter, 2) improvement in objective performance (e.g., in a test), and 3) transfer, referring to the player's ability to apply acquired knowledge or skills to real-world situations. Relevant motivational outcomes concern 1) enjoyment, the extent to which playing the game evoked an enjoyable experience, and 2) increased motivation to learn using DGBL. Efficiency outcomes relevant to DGBL effectiveness, finally, are related to 1) time management and 2) cost-effectiveness. Overall, it can be stated that a DGBL intervention is effective when it achieves similar or higher scores compared to other instructional methods in relation to any of the above mentioned outcomes without significantly (in the common, not the statistical sense) diminishing any of the others. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Students, especially in early ages, need motivating approaches and techniques that may attract them to educational materials. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the ability of educational games to enhance kids’ abilities to learn math skills. A programme was developed based on known cartoon characters and an experiment was conducted to assess the possible level of improvement in learning that such tools might cause. Results showed that in such math skills at this age, using multimedia programmes could be effective in getting students attention especially when cartoon characters were used. Results also showed that there was no significant difference in learning and knowledge skills and information absorption based on gender distribution where results comparison between little boys and girls showed no significant difference in their learning...

The participants were two classes of 11th graders taking the website design class in a vocational high school. The participants were assigned randomly to either an experimental group (n 1⁄4 40) learning with a WBPAS or a control group (n 1⁄4 41) learning with a paper-based portfolio. The study results revealed the following: a) the quality of goalsetting mechanisms may facilitate SRL. b) Students setting learning goals with the WBPAS demonstrated significantly better SRL than students setting learning goals with the paper-based portfolio. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper describes ongoing investigations of a formative writing tool through mining student data in order to understand how the system performs and to measure improvement in student writing. The sampled data included over 1.3M student essays written in response to approximately 200 pre-defined prompts as well as a log of all student actions and computer generated feedback. Analyses both measured and modeled changes in student performance over revisions, the effects of system responses and the amount of time students spent working on assignments. Implications are discussed for employing large-scale data analytics to improve educational outcomes, to understand the role of feedback in writing, to drive improvements in formative technology and to aid in designing better kinds of feedback and scaffolding to support students in the writing process.	feedback;iteration	Peter W.

The answer to this challenging question lies in how well we consider diverse sources for successful learning and explain audiences differentiated by individual learning differences. After years of primarily cognitive traditions, lack of strong theoretical foundations, and imperfect one-size-fits-all designs, our cognitive-rich explanations are missing the significant, higher-order impact of affective, conative, and other factors on learning. In this study the investigator introduces learning orientation (learner-difference profiles) to examine the fundamental sources for individual learning differences from an entirely new perspective. This perspective highlights the importance of intentions and emotions and describes how these dominant factors guide, manage, and sometimes override cognitive (thinking) processes. Using multiple repeated measures univariate ANOVAs, this study exhibits how learning orientation, time, and environments account for significant variance, effects, and interactions. The results demonstrate useful ways to analyze and differentiate the audience before designing solutions and environments for more successful performance.	fits;interaction;systems design	Margaret Martinez	1999		10.1145/318372.318600	cooperative learning;repeated measures design;higher-order logic;sequence learning;computer science;knowledge management;experiential learning;instructional simulation;learning sciences;instructional design;active learning;management;synchronous learning	AI	-72.58912089120763	-40.56909334327283	84184
8f3aa11b13434dd7688019bcbc9672f4cc51917d	a new architecture for cross-repository creation and sharing of educational resources		A large amount of educational resources are currently available in the Internet, covering educational needs for many school grades. However, using such wealth of material, typically dispersed in several repositories, in a simple and effective way, is rather challenging due to the difficulties encountered by teachers in learning the peculiar access and operational procedures that each repository system requires. Therefore, it is important to provide the teachers with a centralized, integrated, simple system that can address most of their needs so that every operation (search, edit, share, download) can be done from a single location. This work follows this direction by designing and presenting both an architecture to integrate different repository systems using the Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) API and an integration layer that provides a simple web interface suitable for the needs of both the content creators (teachers) and the users of the contents (learners). Results have been evaluated both quantitatively, i.e., using performance indicators such as response time, and qualitatively, on the basis of the user experience evaluated through a questionnaire. Both type of results show that the platform adequately addresses user needs therefore it has the potential to be embraced by a large user community.

The term, cooperative, is used to designate the nature of the interactions among a team of robots. However, there are many differences in how these robots interact. Some groups of robots appear, on the surfoe, to cooperate but are not actually aware of the oiher robots. Other groups share goals and objectives. Our research investigated a diverse collection of multiple-robot systems. This paper highlights eight examples. The variations of interaction that we found were used to create a robotic-interaction taxonomy. Each robotic team is measured ogoinst three dimensions for placement into the taxonomy.

A study to trial this extended method was conducted with two design teams, each involving three children with ASD, in a series of six, weekly design sessions focused on designing a math game. The findings from this study reveal that the children were able to successfully participate in the sessions and collaborate with other children. The findings also highlight the positive experience that involvement in such a process can offer this population.		Laura Benton;Hilary Johnson;Emma Ashwin;Mark J.

Students’ cognitive-affective states are studied using different populations (Philippines, USA), different methods (quantitative field observation, self-report), and different types of learning environments (dialogue tutor, problemsolving game, and problem-solving based Intelligent Tutoring System). By varying the studies along these multiple factors, we can have greater confidence that findings which generalize across studies are robust. The incidence, persistence, and impact of boredom, frustration, confusion, engaged concentration, delight, and surprise were compared. We found that boredom was very persistent across learning environments and was associated with poorer learning and problem behaviors, such as gaming the system. Despite prior hypothesis to the contrary, frustration was less persistent, less associated with poorer learning, and did not appear to be an antecedent to gaming the system. Confusion and engaged concentration were the most common states within all three learning environments. Experiences of delight and surprise were rare. These findings suggest that significant effort should be put into detecting and responding to boredom and confusion, with a particular emphasis on developing pedagogical interventions to disrupt the “vicious cycles” which occur when a student becomes bored and remains bored for long periods of time.	cognitive tutor;incidence matrix;interaction;persistence (computer science);population;problem solving;robustness (computer science);sensor	Ryan Shaun Joazeiro de Baker;Sidney K.

Therefore, the paper proposes a research problem-based learning (RPBL) model as the system structure in order to lead students through a systematic pedagogical process, but at the same time makes adaptive learning possibilities available through the customizable task list. The preliminary formative evaluation suggests minor modification of the system and provides positive feedbacks to its instructional use and development.	field research;tracing (software);world wide web	Ju-Ling Shih	2008	Fifth IEEE International Conference on Wireless, Mobile, and Ubiquitous Technology in Education (wmute 2008)	10.1109/WMUTE.2008.48	robot learning;proactive learning;cooperative learning;educational technology;error-driven learning;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;qualitative research;experiential learning;operating system;learning sciences;teaching method;multimedia;active learning;action learning;mobile computing;open learning;ubiquitous computing;synchronous learning;pedagogy	Robotics	-70.44713398059396	-39.98618999348257	85213

Our research thus aims to introduce the kind of paper-and-pen, handmade AV construction experience into a computer-based environment. We videotaped ten students constructing handmade visualizations of their chosen algorithms to determine user behaviors we need to translate into an AV system. Eight key operational behaviors are identified, which leads to further derived operational behaviors. Based on the pre-study, we propose three new lo-fi AV design requirements.

We evaluated the predictions of the model with respect to the extant literature, focusing on studies in which versions of hypertexts were compared. Consistent with our predictions, the increased demands of decisionmaking and visual processing in hypertext impaired reading performance. Individual differences in readers, such as working memory capacity and prior knowledge, mediated the impact of hypertext features. For example, readers with low working memory and low prior knowledge were usually disadvantaged in hypertext. Some benefits were observed for learners with low prior knowledge, however, if the hypertext structure was hierarchical and consistent with that of the knowledge domain. We also surveyed the effectiveness of structural features designed to reduce cognitive load, including graphical overviews, restricted access to links, and visible link types. Complex graphical overviews did not reliably enable learning and navigation, whereas navigational support from restricted access and visible link types were helpful. We identified gaps in the empirical literature and suggested future studies to investigate cognitive processes in hypertext reading. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

5d81e1c8979e343a68ec9d2a6f789cba20b0ffef	exploring the feasibility of an online contextualised animation-based questionnaire for educational survey		Introduction Traditional questionnaires are completed through the use of paper and pencil. In general cognitive theories, cognition processes the reading context with mental images and verbal systems in both associative and referential ways (Sadoski, Paivio & Goetz, 1991). The mental imagery that we experience while reading is now known to have powerful effects on comprehension, memory and appreciation for text (Sadoski, 1998). However, there exists a wide distribution in the vividness of the mental images that different individuals generate (Cui, Jeter, Yang, Montague & Eagleman, 2007). In order to dispel the doubts about the validity of the paper-based questionnaire (PBQ) in this pilot study, we try to provide specifically visual images for each questionnaire item. In our previous study, Wu, Yeh and Chang (in press) reported that animation-based test may complement the limits of traditional paper-and-pencil test in several ways; based on previous studies, the following conclusions were found: (1) animation can be seen as a depictive external presentation, and it enables the concreteness of abstract concepts; (2) animation, when used in place of reality, can be more effective in presenting realworld contextual problems; and (3) animation can motivate learners by its cosmetic appeal. Therefore, we applied multimedia technology to design an animation-based questionnaire (ABQ) in order to manifest the problem/context situation. This pilot study attempts to explore the feasibility of an online contextualised ABQ for educational survey (Figure 1).	cognition;montague grammar;theory;yang	Yu-Ta Chien;Chun-Yen Chang	2010	BJET	10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.01034.x	simulation;human–computer interaction;multimedia	HCI	-70.7605318791595	-44.92596969066032	85408

Online social engagement, operationalized through concepts such as connectivity, social presence and social space has been an important topic of research in web based education for more than a decade. An important sub-text of this research is that online social engagement supports higher levels of collaboration. Students who feel comfortable with and connected to their online learning community are much more likely to be active participants in that community, working together to develop and build knowledge systems. Much of this research refers to the more social/participatory based educational theories of John Dewey and L.S. Vygotsky. There is though a second component of collaboration that helps drive community building in this theoretical frameworks; motivation to engage in a shared, relevant, goal oriented activity. While most theories on social engagement assume natural relationships between online social engagement and motivation to participate in a community, this relationship is not often discussed and examined very often. This paper specifically compares the relationship between classroom connectedness and motivation to share knowledge between students in a hybrid, web infused class and a more traditionally oriented class with a small web component. Analysis did find a highly significant relationship between connectedness and motivation to share knowledge in the hybrid class but not in the traditional class, suggesting an important relationship, but one based at least partially in targeted experience. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years, technology has changed the way we carry out these activities. User commitment has been shown to be dependent on, among other, peer pressure. The introduction of challengeable virtual opponents broadened the spectrum of possibilities, enabling users to be motivated by either a real or virtual partner. In this paper we present an early assessment of the impact that different types of presence exerts on the users’ perceived motivation and competitiveness. In particular, we delve into how virtual entities compare to their real counterparts. We carried out an experiment in which we sought at obtaining amateur athletes perceptions on their motivation and competitiveness when exercising against real and virtual opponents. Results serve not only the purpose of showing that different types of presence counterbalance each other but they also validate a design space for physical and social partners in exertion applications in which our hypothesis are based upon.	competitive analysis (online algorithm);entity	Luís Duarte;Paulo Ribeiro;Tiago João Vieira Guerreiro;Luís Carriço	2014			simulation;engineering;multimedia;social psychology	HCI	-63.441745249760224	-42.15413143394876	85652

The results indicated that students developed more positive attitudes toward math learning through five-week computer math gaming, but there was no significant effect of computer gaming on students’ cognitive test performance or metacognitive awareness development. The in-field observation and students’ think-aloud protocol informed that not every computer math drill game would engage children in committed learning. The study findings have highlighted the value of situating learning activities within the game story, making games pleasantly challenging, scaffolding reflections, and designing suitable off-computer activities. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Do different types of pairs interact differently and remember the activity differently? These questions were addressed with a classroom experiment in which 8 year old boy/boy, boy/girl and girl/girl pairs worked through the screenpages of a CD-ROM storybook prior to completing a cued-recall comprehension test and a free-recall story writing exercise. During the storybook activity measures of computer interface use and measures of verbal interaction were recorded. Differences between pairs of children were recorded in the use of the computer interface, and verbal interactions were related to interface activity. The comprehension test delivered no differences between pairs, but the free-recall story writing exercise found superior performance for girls who had previously worked together. The measures of verbal interaction taken during the storybook activity did not predict subsequent performance, although disputes over the control of the mouse were related to free-recall story writing.	book;interaction	Geoffrey M.

This paper reports on an analysis of data that first confirms the results of recent studies by finding a relatively large number of bugs to be unstable, with stable bugs tending to be infrequent. The paper then illustrates a method for classifying students according to higher-level (and presumably more stable) knowledge deficits using a psychometric classification technique, known as rule space. A rule space analysis is performed on the same test items. The resulting diagnoses (describing attribute-mastery patterns) are shown to demonstrate within-test stability. These patterns are then discussed in the light of their potential contribution to the design of machine-delivered remediation.	attribute grammar	Menucha Birenbaum;Anthony E. Kelly;Kikumi K.

c78783129b8bf9abef2c6d7d375f2e854855bc7a	creating a context for learning: activating children's whole number knowledge prepares them to understand fraction division		When children learn about fractions, their prior knowledge of whole numbers often interferes, resulting in a whole number bias. However, many fraction concepts are generalizations of analogous whole number concepts; for example, fraction division and whole number division share a similar conceptual structure. Drawing on past studies of analogical transfer, we hypothesize that children’s whole number division knowledge will support their understanding of fraction division when their relevant prior knowledge is activated immediately before engaging with fraction division. Children in 5th and 6th grade modeled fraction division with physical objects after modeling a series of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems with whole number operands and fraction operands. In one condition, problems were blocked by operation, such that children modeled fraction problems immediately after analogous whole number problems (e.g., fraction division problems followed whole number division problems). In another condition, problems were blocked by number type, such that children modeled all four arithmetic operations with whole numbers in the first block, and then operations with fractions in the second block. Children who solved whole number division problems immediately before fraction division problems were significantly better at modeling the conceptual structure of fraction division than those who solved all of the fraction problems together. Thus, implicit analogies across shared concepts can affect children’s mathematical thinking. Moreover, specific analogies between whole number and fraction concepts can yield a positive, rather than a negative, whole number bias.		Pooja Gupta Sidney;Martha W.

b3856551ab09cebbd9e0f95444ac4c1e3ec67534	temporal analytics of workplace-based assessment data to support self-regulated learning		One of the most effective ways to develop self-regulated learning skills in higher education is to include work placements. Workplace-based assessment (WBA) provides opportunities for students to gain feedback on their practical skills, reflect on their performance, and set goals and actions for further development. This requires identifying temporal patterns, as placements usually span extended periods of time. In this paper we explore two intelligent computational methods (burst detection and process mining) to derive temporal patterns. We apply both methods on WBA data from a cohort of first-year medical students. Through this we identify interesting temporal patterns, and gather educators’ feedback on their usefulness for self-regulated learning.		Alicja Piotrkowicz;Vania Dimitrova;Trudie E.

In this work, we present a prototype of a web-based application supporting mobile clients with features of coordination through a common contacts information and calendar of tasks to support different pedagogical models based on collaborative learning. The main objective is to support online mobile clients with ongoing changes in the web-based system and thus to shorten the time-to know and time-to-response among mobile clients during the team work. Additionally, our system is meant for mutual support of members as well as to support decision taking regarding learning task accomplishment. The system is based on event definition related to workspace artefacts (contacts, tasks, etc.) that observe and inform about the changes in the system.

Similarity was assessed objectively, based on appearance and feedback style matching, and subjectively, based on participants' self-reported perceptions of similarity. Appearance similarity had few effects. Objective feedback similarity led to higher scores on a declarative knowledge test and higher liking for the trainer. Subjective feedback similarity was related to reactions, engagement, and liking for the trainer. Overall, results indicated that subjective similarity is more important in predicting training outcomes than objective similarity, and that surface-level similarity is less important than deep-level similarity. These results shed new light on the dynamics between e-learners and trainer agents, and inform the design of agent-based training.		Tara S.

A sample of ninety-six secondary school students, participated in a two-week experiment. Students were randomly paired and asked to solve several moderately structured problems concerning Newtonian mechanics. Students’ pretest and posttest performances were analyzed to see whether students’ gender and the gender pairing (mixed or single-gender) were significant factors in their problem solving learning in CSCL. Students’ online interactions were also analyzed to unravel the dynamic process of individual knowledge elaboration. The multilevel analyses revealed that a divergent pattern of knowledge elaboration was a significant predictor for students’ learning achievement, and in mixed-gender dyads students’ knowledge elaboration processes were more inclined to diverge from each other. Moreover, females in single-gender dyads significantly outperformed females in mixed-gender dyads. But this was not the case for male students. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim was to provide students with essential declarative knowledge on what to consider when evaluating the authoritativeness of Web sources, and the accuracy of their information. It also provided the opportunity to apply this declarative knowledge in a basic inquiry task on the controversial topic of the possible harm caused by mobile phones. Participants were 134 ninth graders, randomly assigned to the instruction or no-instruction condition. In both conditions the same multiple Internet sources, varying for authoritativeness and stance, were given for the basic and transfer (about GM food) inquiry tasks. Findings reveal that learners in the instruction condition outperformed the others in both the inquiry task of the instructional context and, more importantly, in the transfer inquiry task. These learners showed more appropriate navigation behavior and greater source evaluation, as well as better surface and deeper comprehension of the accessed information on GM food. In addition, prior knowledge moderated the latter. Theoretical and practical significance of the study is outlined. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

According to this idea, this study investigates the effect of providing a group with a Social Network Analysis-based feedback on communication in an on-line game where players talk to each other via textual chat. Three different situations across two different sessions were compared: an Informed Group with a correct feedback, a notInformed Group with no feedback and a mis-Informed group with an incorrect feedback. Results show that giving correct information increases the related dimensions of communication, while the absence of feedback and the incorrect feedback were not accompanied by any significant modification.	computer-mediated communication;feedback;online and offline;social network analysis	Luciano Gamberini;Francesco Martino;Fabiola Scarpetta;Andrea Spoto;Anna Spagnolli	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-73257-0_37	simulation;computer science;multimedia;peer feedback;communication	HCI	-69.74358627446728	-45.954684207144226	88198

We undertook in-depth interviews with five leading teachers, and analyzed logs of interactions in order to identify teaching practices combining social networks. One teacher considerably strengthened her traditional teaching practices to control students according to a pedagogical approach of transmission of knowledge. We found that four teachers fostered social learning, autonomy and active engagement among their students. They thereby fostered the constitution of a learning community – of inquiry, or a moral community, through the use of social network sites. Additionally, we identified the distinctive role of social networks in contributing to the students’ learning to be part of their community.	autonomy;interaction;social network	Baruch Schwarz;Galit Caduri	2016	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2016.07.002	narrative inquiry;social learning;computer science;knowledge management;teaching method;social psychology;pedagogy	HCI	-73.98293920398237	-39.36777644660927	88345

Studies have shown these systems can be effective learning tools. Many schools in the United States have adopted adaptive learning systems. Yet development of such systems is still in the early stage in China, and little empirical evidence exists on their efficacy. This paper describes an adaptive learning system, YiXue, and presents two studies that were conducted in China to establish the promise of YiXue adaptive learning platform and two comparison learning platforms used in an after-school English language arts course. The results were promising: student learning efficiency was significantly higher with YiXue than with the comparison platforms. Survey responses suggested that students in the treatment group felt more positive about their learning experience.	personalization	Haoyang Li;Wei Cui;Zhaohui Xu;Zhenyue Zhu;Mingyu Feng	2018		10.5220/0006689800450052	multimedia;knowledge management;computer science;adaptive learning	AI	-76.48414151184112	-41.7465021436963	88573

One possible solution is to specify in detail what the student should be capable of at the end of the module and allow them to decide how to arrange their studies. This study compares the accuracy of student self-assessments of capability against the learning outcomes on a binary Yes/No scale with their exam performance. Predicted marks from their responses were found to have a weak correlation to the student performance. Higher level learning outcomes and responses by female students generated lower reliability scores.	experience	Malcolm Hutchison	2017		10.1145/3059009.3073003	knowledge management;computer science;self-regulated learning;competence (human resources)	ML	-74.45847941379188	-45.49048311211313	88674

However, the effectiveness of SDILEs in classrooms has rarely been evaluated. This article describes the construction, integration, and evaluation of an interactive learning environment in two educational settings. Subsequently, it explores how undergraduate business students perceive SDILEs and SDILEs-based course approach. This research draws on data obtained from two courses in undergraduate business program, over a period of three years. Results of this study suggest that students enrolled in the SDILE-based courses do indeed perceive important learning benefits and educational value. Further more, introduction of SDILE-bases courses at higher level are more beneficial than at the lower level introductory courses. However, there is need of more resources to be developed and deployed to harness fully the benefits of experiential learning provided through SDILE-integrated course approach.	system dynamics	Hassan Qudrat-Ullah	2010	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2010.05.025	psychology;computer simulation;cooperative learning;simulation;complex dynamics;computer science;knowledge management;experiential learning;evaluation;instructional design;multimedia;active learning;system dynamics;empirical research;pedagogy	HCI	-75.42903112623007	-41.45969669207148	88772

We have developed an intelligent tutor to improve the help that peer tutors give by encouraging them to explain tutee errors and provide more conceptual help. In previous work, we have shown that adaptive support from this “tutor” tutor improves student learning more than randomly selected support. In this paper, we examine this result, looking more closely at the feedback students received, and coding it for relevance to the current situation. Surprisingly, we find that the amount of relevant support students receive is not correlated with their learning; however, there is a positive correlation with learning and students noticing relevant support, and a negative correlation with learning and students ignoring relevant support. Designers of adaptive collaborative learning systems should focus not only on making support relevant, but also engaging.	peer-to-peer;randomness;relevance	Erin Walker;Nikol Rummel;Sean Walker;Kenneth R.

SMILE provides a more holistic approach to supporting student reasoning and activities rather than the more reductionist tool-based approach we had started with. This more holistic approach focuses on the cognitive processes involved in doing design and learning from that experience, rather than focusing on activities that students are carrying out. This new emphasis has also allowed us to identify ways of integrating scaffolding for metacognitive and reflective reasoning that were not naturally integratable into the previous framework.	cognition;holism;reductionism	Roland Hübscher;Sadhana Puntambekar;Mark Guzdial;Janet L.

In the summer of 2008 our experiences with middle school teachers included three-weeks of training in Alice and guidance in the development of lesson plans. Our experiences with middle school students involved two one-week summer camps of instruction in Alice. We found both the teachers and the students strongly engaged with Alice. The teachers created lesson plans with Alice worlds to interactively teach a topic and other lesson plans in which students build an Alice world on a particular topic either from scratch or using a template world. The students in the Alice camps had both instruction in Alice and free time to develop Alice worlds of their choice. We found that the students used a large variety of basic Alice concepts and computer science concepts in the worlds they built in their free time.	alice;computer science;experience;google summer of code;interactivity;virtual world	Susan H.

Satisfaction led to student learning, competence, motivation, retention and value. It was quantitatively hypothesised that satisfaction was influenced by independent and it had corollary to the dependent variables. This configuration was completed through reviews and focus-group discussions prior to performing survey.

Learning Analytics dashboards have been used at all levels, including institutional, regional and national level [2]. In classroom use, while learning visualisations are often based on counts of activity data or interaction patterns, there is increasing recognition that learning analytics relate to learning, and should therefore provide pedagogically useful information [3]. While increasing numbers of technology-enhanced learning applications are embracing the potential of learning analytics at the classroom level, often these are aimed at teachers. However, learners can also benefit from learning analytics data (e.g. [4][5]).	big data	Susan Bull;Blandine Ginon;Judy Kay;Michael D. Kickmeier-Rust;Matthew D.

However, the resources targeted to mathematics’ teaching are in many cases very limited. During the past years in our university the reduction of mathematics’ contact hours has been significant while at the same time the study groups have grown. However, the mathematical proficiency of incoming students has not increased. Consequently, during the contact hours, the learning of basics requires more time and the need of personalized learning is increasing. In this article a method based on short video lecturing to enhance mathematics’ learning is presented. The study explored how the students experienced the mathematics’ studying from videos. In addition, it was investigated if the video lectures have an influence on students’ motivation towards mathematics’ learning. Overall, the results were encouraging and the short video lecturing seems to be worth considering while developing methods for mathematics’ learning. This paper summarizes the observations during the examination.	personalization;video clip	Hanna Kinnari-Korpela	2015	Informatics in Education		mathematics education;computer science;multimedia;pedagogy	AI	-77.10756812280354	-40.85635653688071	89352
afdf3a5309da22e712787e662b1fb0b7d4574d9e	the sisine project: developing an e-learning platform for educational role-playing games		Leonardo Program, has developed an e-learning platform and a teaching methodology with the objective of making it possible to conduct negotiation-type role-playing games at a distance. The teaching methodology exploits a specially developed technology platform allowing a small community of players to communicate, interact and play online. The current beta version supports up to twenty simultaneous players, who are represented by avatars. Communication between players is based on short text messages displayed in bubble cartoons above the avatars' heads, and special commands allow players to control the avatars' movements , gestures and facial expressions. The platform provides the normal func-tionality expected by players of Multi-player Online Role-Playing Games (MORPG), as well as additional functions that allow a trainer to set up games, intervene during game play, record specific phases of a game, annotate recordings and discuss them with the players. In June 2007, we began testing SISINE in Poland, Slovakia and Italy. In Poland the experimental group consisted of company sales representatives ; in Slovakia of managers in NGOs; in Italy of teachers. In each case, the group used a custom-designed virtual environment in which to practice specific forms of negotiation: commercial negotiation (in Poland), negotiation in human resources management (Slovakia) and intercultural negotiation (Italy). In all cases, SISINE is designed to help learners acquire the basic notions and rules of negotiation and, more importantly , practical know-how to apply this knowledge. While SISINE is inspired by role-playing games, it provides additional facilities designed for distance learning. Below we describe the most important of these functions. Teachers can write scripts for online multiplayer games or for single player exercises (so-called 'gyms'). In designing a multiplayer game they can choose the roles, goals, bodies and personalities of individual players. Once the game is in progress, they can watch what is going on from any viewpoint, intervene at any moment, send messages to players, or activate special 'events'. When it is over, they can become critics, leading a group discussion and analysing the strategies adopted by the players. As well as preparing the scripts for online games and assigning characters to users, there are two other ways in which teachers can intervene in learn-ers' interactions with SISINE. One is to take on the role of one of the characters in the simulation. The other is to act as an invisible stage director. In this second role, teachers can: a) invisibly observe the …	avatar (computing);experiment;interaction;massively multiplayer online role-playing game;simulation;software release life cycle;virtual reality	Orazio Miglino	2007	ERCIM News		video game design;multimedia;simulation;game design;computer science;game developer;virtual learning environment;video game development;game mechanics	HCI	-65.44010991628836	-39.68031785706068	89373

c19e15ea4a9392c20cf2da739fe39792a7b2146b	a forestry management game as a learning support system for increased understanding of vegetation succession - effective environmental education towards a sustainable society		At present, there are many environmental problems, and environmental education is necessary to realize a sustainable society. The most important element of education is practical application of what has been learned, as this will deepen our understanding of the topic. As a part of environmental education, field work is conducted to encourage children to learn vegetation succession. However, because vegetation successions occur over an extended period of time, it is difficult for children to observe and participate throughout an entire vegetation succession cycle even if they do field work. Thus, as a step toward effective environmental education for a sustainable society, we developed a learning support system for children to better understand vegetation successions. This learning support system enables simulated forest management over a period of hundreds of years, providing users the opportunity to observe and learn which factors encourage and hinder plant growth in forests. The system simulates a period of approximately 300 years, and regularly scores the skills of the user according to the state of the forest. The changing score encourages the user to optimize forest management. As a first step of system evaluation, college students were asked to participate as users. Consequently, the participants suggested that this system can enhance understanding of, and problem-solving skills regarding, vegetation successions.	field research;problem solving;succession;the forest	Shuya Kawaguchi;Hiroshi Mizoguchi;Ryohei Egusa;Yoshiaki Takeda;Etsuji Yamaguchi;Shigenori Inagaki;Fusako Kusunoki;Hideo Funaoi;Masanori Sugimoto	2018		10.5220/0006767303220327	knowledge management;vegetation;ecological succession;forest management;environmental education;computer science;environmental resource management	HCI	-72.37532135491934	-42.219800624406965	89541

The data consisted of 40 chat sessions with pre-screening and 34 sessions without pre-screening from the Dutch alcohol and drugs chat service. In the chat sessions with pre-screening, the participants displayed accountability with regard to the norms relevant to pre-given information, which took up space and time and frequently involved interactional misalignment. In chat sessions without pre-screening of the question, the openings followed a more fluent interactional course. We discuss how affordances of digital communication media may work as constraints when the participants orient to interactional norms known from other, offline environments.	interactional linguistics;online and offline;online chat;t-norm;text-based (computing)	Wyke Stommel;Hedwig F.

It is easy to implement. But this simplicity belies its more serious implications, especially regarding the worth which can be attached to results derived from the interpretation and analysis of anonymously collected data. A sample of eLearning implementation cases is reviewed from the point of view of anonymously collected data for evaluation of educational quality. A reiteration of an earlier analysis of levels of anonymity leads to the introduction of the Anonymity-Purpose-Worth matrix. It is contended that if the matrix is used to characterise the data collection and analysis in eLearning evaluation settings, the worth of feedback can be better appraised and acted upon. Practitioners, researchers, and students in the eLearning field will benefit as the anonymity conditions will be clearly documented in a standardised and comparable manner.	documentation;feedback;point of view (computer hardware company);the matrix	Heinz Dreher;Hermann A.

In this paper, we propose a survey for users in order to know their different actions depending on different conditions. The analysis of preliminary results for some questions of the model shows that there is a correlation between some survey questions and the real student actions, but there is a case in which there is not such correlation. For the cases where that correlation exists, this correlation leads to think that some prediction of users actions based on survey results is possible.		Pedro J.

The objective of context aware ubiquitous learning is to move e- learning and mobile learning a step further from learning at anytime anywhere to be at the right time and right place with right learning resources and right learning peers. In recent years, wireless sensor networks have become an evolving technology that has a wide range of potential applications in ubiquitous computing. We introduced an image of context- awareness in ubiquitous learning based on wireless sensor networks. We showed the architecture of context-awareness in ubiquitous learning in general, introduced the components of a sensor node and protocol stack of wireless sensor networks, and pointed out conclusions and open research issues with regard to context aware ubiquitous learning.	anytime algorithm;context awareness;open research;pervasive informatics;protocol stack;sensor node;ubiquitous computing	Mingfei Wang;Linlin Ci;Ping Zhan;Yongjun Xu	2007	Third International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2007)	10.1109/ICNC.2007.267	real-time computing;context-aware pervasive systems;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;ubiquitous robot;ubiquitous computing;synchronous learning;computer network	Mobile	-70.50983527211895	-39.67504149281901	90590

The purpose of the present study was to develop and evaluate the effects of linguistically-tailored feedback on an Internet-based expressive writing intervention. Two hundred eighty-one participants were asked to engage in 3 days of expressive writing and were randomly assigned to one of 3 feedback conditions: control (no feedback), simple (feedback about levels of emotional expression), and directive (simple feedback + suggestions for emotional processing). A Perl-based implementation of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) was developed in order to provide dynamic feedback to participants based on levels of emotional expression identified in their writing. This implementation provided near-perfect correlations with standard LIWC output, r’s = .98–1.00. Positive and total, but not negative, emotional expression increased over time for those who received simple or directive feedback. These findings suggest that linguistically-tailored feedback has the potential to alter patterns of engagement in computer-based interventions. However, additional research is needed to identify the most effective types of feedback in order to enhance immediate effects on writing and longitudinal effects on relevant outcomes. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work we propose a new approach for automatically and adaptively sequencing practice activities for a particular learner and explore its application for foreign language learning. We evaluate our system through simulation and are in the process of running an experiment. Our simulation results suggest that such an approach may be significantly better than an expert system when there is high variability in the rate of learning among the students and if mastering prerequisites before advancing is important, and is likely to be no worse than an expert system if our generated curriculum approximately describes the necessary structure of learning in students.	bus mastering;color gradient;correctness (computer science);display resolution;expert system;feedback;heart rate variability;massive open online course;personalization;simulation;usability testing;vocabulary	Tong Mu;Shuhan Wang;Erik Andersen;Emma Brunskill	2018		10.1145/3231644.3231672	curriculum;knowledge management;language acquisition;expanded access;expert system;foreign language;computer science	AI	-75.61856589782285	-47.38910704915151	90836

Evaluating usability issues allows improving the design. One popular method for detecting usability problems is the heuristic evaluation, in which evaluators employ a set of usability heuristics as a guide. Using proper heuristics is highly relevant. In this paper, we present a set of 12 cultural-oriented usability heuristics, developed iteratively, and validated, in their final step, on e-Commerce websites. The evidence supports our argument that websites which display characteristics relevant to specific issues of the four Hofstede's cultural dimensions improve their usability.	e-commerce;heuristic (computer science);usability	Jaime Díaz;Cristian Rusu;César A.

A total of 85 undergraduate students from the Autonomous Indigenous University of Mexico (UAIM) participated in the study. Each student was asked to use a mobile augmented reality (MAR) application designed to learn Mayo language (language spoken in Northwestern Mexico). Afterwards, the students responded to a survey with items concerning the use and technology acceptance and about cultural dimensions of individualism and uncertainty avoidance. Structural equationmodeling (SEM)was used to analyze the data collected from students. Results provide evidence that the individualism contributes positively to perceived ease of use of the MAR app, and uncertainty avoidance has no impact. The findings showed that the MAR system could be easily used if it includes a natural way to promote collaborative work. In addition, to gain the trust of students, the uncertainty avoidance needs to be reduced by enriching the help information offered for app use.

Undergraduate participants (nź=ź600) completed an online survey of 132 items. This article will first report on the development and validation of an instrument that attempts to reveal factors that affect user satisfaction, and then a multiple regression analysis and a path analysis help further investigate which factors can significantly predict learner satisfaction. The factor analysis identified 14 different factors. These factors were further categorized by the researchers into 6 dimensions i.e. learner dimension, instructor's dimension, course dimension, technology dimension, design dimension, and the environment dimension. The multiple regression analysis showed that e-learners satisfaction can mostly be predicted by learner interaction with others. Findings of this research will help institutions by providing them with psychometric properties that add pedagogical value to e-courses.

Since the centralized placement tests and future academic achievements are considered to be related concepts, analysis of the success factors behind placement tests may help understand and potentially improve academic achievement. In this study using a large and feature rich dataset from Secondary Education Transition System in Turkey we developed models to predict secondary education placement test results, and using sensitivity analysis on those prediction models we identified the most important predictors. The results showed that C5 decision tree algorithm is the best predictor with 95% accuracy on hold-out sample, followed by support vector machines (with an accuracy of 91%) and artificial neural networks (with an accuracy of 89%). Logistic regression models came out to be the least accurate of the four with and overall accuracy of 82%. The sensitivity analysis revealed that previous test experience, whether a student has a scholarship, student’s number of siblings, previous years’ grade point average are among the most important predictors of the placement test scores. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The audiovisual-and visual-modality training conditions displayed comparable accuracy rates, while the auditory-modality training condition revealed lower accuracy, and the no-training condition exhibited little or no learning acquisition. The process of simultaneously exposing learners to interactive dynamic visualizations and prompting them to attend to information through the pragmatic use of audio cues reduced memory load, and in turn facilitated memory recall. Findings provided constructive feedback on the efficacy and usability of three-dimensional (3D) dynamic visualizations in web-based distance education, and implementations for future development of human-computer user interfaces to optimize engineering design effectiveness.	multimodal interaction	Phuong T.

Several approaches have been used to explain how the personalization effect operates in multimedia messages. This paper aims at unifying these statements in a core concept of familiarity and its influence on social cues. By amplifying the scope of possible forms of personalization, the study explores additionally how youth slang as a new factor of conversation influences learning. Secondary school children (N=166) were randomly assigned to experimental groups and provided with materials about photosynthesis in two different experiments (audio vs. text message). Each experiment consisted of performance tests and a questionnaire concerning the newly found mechanism of familiarity. The results of each single factor between-subject design show that youth slang fosters learning. Strong effects among transfer task performance (d1=1.19; d2=1.26) confirm the personalization effect. Moreover, the outcomes deliver valid empirical evidence for the proposed familiarity mechanism. These findings are discussed as well as the confirmation of all presumptions for the familiarity mechanism as incorporated in the explanatory approach, resulting in clear theoretical implications and future directions for the field of multimedia learning research.	personalization	Sascha Schneider;Steve Nebel;Simon Pradel;Günter Daniel Rey	2015	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2014.10.052	psychology;social cue;multimedia;communication;social psychology;world wide web	AI	-73.69101377964977	-43.46877223962168	92575
ae1e2975ea27db2e38b74bd63332ae90c6aac259	identifying significant task-based predictors of emotion in learning		Emphatic computing is concerned with enabling a system to recognize a user’s current state and then providing the appropriate response to the user with the intention to support the user emotionally. However, in order to do so, the system must first identify the state of the user. Studies in computer-based tutoring are increasingly investigating ways to incorporate synthetic tutors that are equipped with computational models of empathy – in which these agents are trained to understand learners’ emotions and respond based on the detected learner state. However, cultural differences affect the way people express and detect emotions. This paper attempts to identify the task-based features that could discriminate the learner’s emotions in a Malaysian context. By studying several existing task-based features from literature, and combining them with new features, this study attempts to detect four frequent emotions that accompanies learning, namely, frustration, boredom, uncertainty and neutral. A user study is conducted with 33 students and results revealed that certain features can be used as predictors for the abovementioned emotions. Interestingly, results also showed that there is a tendency for students to choose synthetic tutors of the same race.		Najlaa Sadiq Mokhtar;Syaheerah L.

Researchers have indicated the importance and challenge of coping with insomnia using non-drug treatment, such as the cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Self-regulated learning strategies are known to be an effective approach for helping people improve their time management as well as their ability to set learning goals and adopt learning strategies. In this study, a mobile sleep-management system integrated with self-regulated learning strategies and cognitive behavioral therapy is proposed. With the assistance of this approach, students are able to plan their daily schedule by setting goals, applying strategies, monitoring their life process, and modifying strategies to cultivate good learning and healthy lifestyle habits. A total of 18 undergraduate students from a university in northern Taiwan participated in the experiment of using this management system for 2 weeks. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach was useful and easy for the students to use. The number of severe insomnia users also significantly decreased; that is, the proposed approach could help users improve their sleep quality and manage their sleep habits, which is important for them to enhance their learning efficiency in school.	cognition;expert system;feedback;logic programming;management system;system usability scale	Yi-Meng Liu;Lin Wang;Hui-Chun Chu;Chieh Yang	2017	2017 6th IIAI International Congress on Advanced Applied Informatics (IIAI-AAI)	10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2017.179	coping (psychology);insomnia;applied psychology;time management;psychology;cognitive behavioral therapy;management system;multimedia;cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia;self-regulated learning	HCI	-75.84675501916192	-44.01819900818275	92733

Many interesting ideas and applications have been proposed, but there is still limited empirical understanding of the usefulness of various kinds of social cues. The contribution of this article is twofold. Firstly, we report a detailed evaluation of the social cues available in the collaborative learning environment EDUCO. Our study is based on automated experiments, in which the real social cues were occasionally replaced with artificial ones that were specifically designed for examining particular hypotheses. The results suggest that the users attend to the social cues, but do not make navigation decisions solely on the basis of social cues. Secondly, our study demonstrates the potential of automated experiments in studying behavior in virtual environments. Specific interventions made in natural circumstances can supplement other research methodologies in useful ways.	experiment;virtual reality	Miikka Miettinen;Petri Nokelainen;Jaakko Kurhila;Henry Tirri	2005	Elektrotechnik und Informationstechnik	10.1007/BF03054383	computer vision;collaborative learning;awareness;computer science;knowledge management;virtual machine;methodology	ML	-71.49506066382087	-41.8342575435196	93013
3bbfa9c578a2a683e0c3f4fbf96174c0705bfabf	on the integration of tangible elements with multi-touch surfaces for the collaborative creation of concept maps		Collaborative creative work in small groups can significantly improve learning, particularly when supported by concept maps. Although useful in collaborative environments, most applications for the development of concept maps are designed for personal or small tablet computers, which can limit student communication in a team setting. In addition, the use of these applications usually requires training periods that may reduce the time allotted for regular learning activities. In this context, digital tabletops can effectively promote collaboration and face-to-face communication by providing a large horizontal interactive surface. However, despite its large size, a single tabletop cannot accommodate more than three or four students. Therefore, collaborative learning spaces and work groups with multiple devices become necessary. In such scenarios, the exchange of information between groups is critical. In this paper, we propose the use of tangibles, as a natural mechanism to exchange information by using a distributed collaborative concept map application.	concept map;multi-touch	Gustavo Salvador-Herranz;Jorge Camba;Ferran Naya;Manuel Contero	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-39483-1_17	human–computer interaction;engineering;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-63.83768860505356	-39.040449408239816	93100

These technologies, originally developed in the field of adaptive hypermedia, are becoming increasingly important in several adaptive Web applications, ranging from Web-based adaptive hypermedia to adaptive virtual reality. This chapter provides a brief introduction to adaptive navigation support, reviews major adaptive navigation support technologies and mechanisms, and illustrates these with a range of examples.	adaptive hypermedia;virtual reality;web application	Peter Brusilovsky	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-72079-9_8	computer vision;simulation;computer science;web navigation;multimedia;adaptive learning	Web+IR	-65.94982842827784	-42.74263133645367	93171

However, in the initial learning of the programming, many students often have faced a simple problem, like syntax-error by careless or miss typing. Therefore, they feel that the programming is too hard. The most important problem is the student can't take advantage of the error messages with displayed from the computer. These messages are difficult to understand for beginners because the message only indicates a syntactic error and where it occurred. We propose the support system for the C language programming on the UNIX by using agent technology. This system monitors the error message from the compiler. It analyzes, rewrites the acquired message, and reports to the student and the teacher on the network. The teacher can improve the teaching way by finding category of error. The student customizes these messages, and they can use the suitable one at each level. Moreover, these messages send to other students by communication line of each agent. Consequently, many students are able to use these useful messages; they can select the most preferable message from the collection of the agent. We executed the preliminary experiment; the improvement of efficiency to the complication work was able to be confirmed.	compiler;error message;experiment;syntax error;unix;user agent;user interface	Kazuhiko Nagao;Naohiro Ishii	2002		10.1109/CIE.2002.1186058	education;human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;multimedia;programming language;user interface	HCI	-68.91424784321994	-49.93437645640193	93276

After briefly describing various types of blogs and defining their purposes (Herring et al., 2005) we attempt to accommodate their position and application within language teaching (Thorne & Scott Payne, 2005), relating evidence from teachers' blogs ( Edublog.org ) and also within Second Language Acquisition (SLA) theories. In particular, we shall be concentrating on the process and post-process writing approaches (Matsuda, 2003), with particular emphasis on current cognitivist (Atkinson, 2003; Ferris & Hodgcock, 1998) and expressivist (Berlin, 1988) theories. These approaches will be discussed in terms of their effectiveness when establishing specific blog writing tasks. Whilst some researchers have advocated for a ‘lead blog’ or template for other students to follow (Stone, 2004), we have been seeking an eclectic approach based on the three approaches mentioned above. We shall describe our own blended task methodology (Abermann, 2004; Thorne, 2003) wherein language students at a Third Level Institution were set a blog writing task initially over a complete semester (12 weeks). The blog exercise employed both an early expressivist approach and later a (socio-) cognitivist one. Our findings, with examples from students' blogs (and also from students who continued their blogs over a 6 month period), will be presented as well as our recommendations for the integration of blogs into L2 virtual writing environments.	blog	Liam Murray;Tríona Hourigan	2008	ReCALL	10.1017/S0958344008000719	psychology;theoretical linguistics;computer science;teaching method;linguistics;multimedia;electronic publishing;communication;world wide web;pedagogy	NLP	-76.48355947639692	-39.361520315069676	93373

In order to understand the status quo of learning strategies of college students and effectively implement blended learning, the research adopts the LASSI to carry out the investigation into the learning strategy level of college students from regular institutions of higher education.The results indicate that (1) the overall level of the implementation of learning strategies by college students is not so optimistic, as their consciousness of using learning strategies is weak and they are generally lack of learning strategies; (2) for those subject college students, their attitudes and motivations are mainly affected by learning strategies such as time management, information processing, selecting main ideas, self testing, study aids and test strategies via the intervening variables like anxiety and concentration. In the end, specific measures of implementing blended learning are put forward based on the research results.

32cd9d2045e06999f5afac5e6f140b2d3f48e660	the effect of personality and learning styles on individual and collaborative learning: obtaining criteria for adaptation		The aim of this work is to obtain useful criteria for both individual adaptation and dynamic group formation in adaptive collaborative learning systems. We present the results obtained when analyzing data from students of Computer Science from the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid. We have considered their personality and intelligence, the way they group themselves and their results when working individually and collaboratively, in order to find out relationships between their features, the group composition and their achievements. In this context, we have found that some features related to the student personality, intelligence and learning styles (such as neuroticism, spatial abilities, openness to experience, or sensing learning style) seem to influence their performance. This information can be useful in scenarios of face-to-face learning, blended learning or e-learning. In the context of e-learning, we find this information particularly useful for two purposes. Firstly, it allows the detection of potential students or groups with risk to fail when trying to achieve academic objectives and, therefore, makes it possible to prevent them from failing, by offering them personalized assistance in advance. Secondly, specific grouping criteria can be set for dynamic group formation, trying to lead the students to successful collaborative experiences.	computer science;experience;failure;openness;personalization	Rosa M.

The guidelines are rules for the design of portal’s structures to ensure acceptable navigability. The metrics provide a set of quantitative measurements to analyse and evaluate the designs of portals so that the navigability can be judged objectively and compared precisely. These two approaches are complementary to each other, and form a set of Web engineering techniques to solve Web portal navigability problem.

Opening coding and content analysis were performed on 1306 message units and course artifacts. The results revealed that a model of social conflict evolution, that is, social conflict within the learning community evolved through five general phases including cultural initiation, social harmonization cycle, escalation of conflict, intervention and stabilization, and adjourning. The results also suggested strong relationships between social and learning interactions during these five phases of social conflict development. This study has theoretical and practical implications for designing and managing learning activities in online classes.		Kui Xie;Nicole C. Miller;Justin R.

However, there are many Physical Education teachers at elementary and junior high schools who had never taught dance before it became a required subject in 2012. There are even many teachers among them who have never studied dance. It has been reported that there are many instructors who feel anxiety about teaching dance under such conditions [Miyamoto 2012 and Matsumoto 2013]. Accordingly, the authors considered that by using motion capture and using the data of CG animation, new and exciting methods could be found to help people learn dance. Now, there have been some studies on dance using motion capture; however, the studies so far on motion capture and dance, including these previously mentioned, focus on technical system development. Watabe [2005] and Sato [2009] have made attempts to support dance learners in their practice by using motion capture focusing on the educational use it. Sato [2010] reduced the information about expression, muscle, background, etc. by using motion capture so that the points to be viewed were made clear for learners. Thus, in this study, usefulness of CG animation in learning dance through utilizing tablet computer was examined.	computer animation;motion capture;tablet computer	Yoko Usui;Katsumi Sato;Shinichi Watabe	2015		10.1145/2818498.2818507	curriculum;motion capture;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;narrative;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-69.01845932400869	-42.97422292865482	94227

Similarly, despite the importance of collaborative problem solving in both academic and non-academic settings, only a small number of studies reports on group work in domains other than programming. In our case study, we focused on the labs of an introductory algorithms course. We measured the cognitive load of the lab assignments as well as the students' emotional reaction to them. We connect these observations to self-efficacy, performance, psychological traits, and help-seeking behavior as well as to the insights gained from a comprehensive set of follow-up interviews. Even though our study is a small-scale study, the results from applying both quantitative and qualitative methods frame directions for both pedagogic interventions and further (revalidation) studies related to the connection of non-cognitive factors, learning experiences, and performance in collaborative algorithms labs.	algorithm;computer performance;experience;problem solving;report	Laura Toma;Jan Vahrenhold	2018		10.1145/3230977.3230980	knowledge management;collaborative problem solving;self-efficacy;qualitative research;group work;revalidation;algorithm;computer science;small number;cognitive load;psychological intervention	HCI	-74.27318998656837	-44.21233627261092	94517

This study presents a prototype for analysis of how knowledge emerges during distributed team decision making. Analysis of ad hoc sharing of individual knowledge during synchronous online text-based group discourse demonstrates how reciprocal knowledge construction can enable emergence of shared understanding. The difficulty of evaluating collaborative knowledge construction in a virtual environment is demonstrated by presenting an annotated discourse episode for a distributed decision making task used to acquaint learners with the nature of virtual teamwork.	emergence;hoc (programming language);prototype;text-based (computing);virtual reality	Rita M.

It is also an example of how we can apply knowledge on methodology and audience behavior collected over the past years by the research community. At the focus of this paper is (1) the design and concept phase that led to the initial idea for the exhibit, (2) the implementation phase, (3) a roll-out and early insights phase where we tested and refined the application in an iterative design process on-site, and (4) the final deployment as a permanent exhibit of the museum.

c2eb75d928f2278bd417bacd6b0ae6c66395b5e5	active learning for out-of-class activities by using interactive mobile apps		Keeping students engaged with the course content outside the classroom is a challenging task. Since learning during undergraduate years occurs not only as student engagement in class, but also during out-of-class activities, we need to redesign and reinvent such activities for this and future generation of students. Although active learning has been used widely to improve in-class student learning and engagement, its usage outside the classroom is not widespread and researched. Active learning is often not utilized for out-of-class activities and traditional unsupervised activities are used mostly to keep students engaged in the content after they leave the classroom. Although there has been tremendous research performed to improve student learning and engagement in the classroom, there are a few pieces of researches on improving out-of-class learning and student engagement. This poster will present an approach to redesign the traditional out-of-class activities with the help of mobile apps, which are interactive and adaptive, and will provide personalization to satisfy student’s needs outside the classroom so that optimal learning experience can be achieved. Keywords—Mobile learning, adaptive learning, student engagement. I. SIGNIFICANCE AND RELEVANCE Today’s college freshman students are not as prepared for college work as their predecessors [1]. This problem is exacerbated when they spend fewer hours studying outside the classroom [1]. A 2003 study performed by University of California-LA’s Graduate School of Education and Information Studies [2] shows that this trend starts well before the students show up in college. Such trends provide some insight into why students are under prepared and are less engaged in study. Another trend that started showing up [3]-[6] in the last decade or so is the gradual increase of the amount of hours student spend on their jobs. This is mainly because of rising tuition and living expenses and of other socio-cultural reasons [4]-[5]. Students spending less time studying outside the class and working more for money are the two new problems that most institutions are currently facing. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate approaches that will ensure effective usage of the time that the students have for studying outside the classroom. Regardless of the factors leading to students working more, the impact of studying less outside the classroom has been studied extensively in the recent years [5]-[6] and since the objectives of those studies are complex, a generalized conclusion on the relationship between hours employed and academic performance cannot be made. Therefore, instead of focusing on this issue, this research will focus on how students can best utilize the time that they allocate to perform out-of-class activities and how we can provide such activities in more active, adaptive and structured way that facilitates greater engagement and improved student learning. Although most college guidelines and literature [7]-[8] states that students should study at home around 2-3 hours per credit hour of class per week, students rarely follow that [3]-[4]. Our own experience also supports those findings. From the summative course evaluation survey data (Fig. 1) in one of the target course for this research, student’s self-reported hours for enrolled credit, study time outside class and employment shows that they are not spending enough time studying outside the class as suggested. Fig. 1. Student self-reported times for a target course. This poster is going to introduce a mobile-based system, being developed, called dysgu (means ‘learning’ in Welsh), which will provide students with interactive and motivating out-of-class activities. Dysgu provides personalization and adaptation to satisfy student’s specific needs to optimize the learning experience. Dysgu employs a novel approach to conduct out-of-class active learning activities enhanced with five unique factors. First, the activities are interactive [9] and smaller than traditional out-of-class activities allowing for instructional scaffolding and can be deployed more frequently and with higher expectations to promote self-fulfilling prophecy. Second, dysgu utilizes mobile technology-based learning environment to deliver and administer such activities, as current generation of students are active users of this technology. Third, it supports adaptation and personalization to address student’s lifestyle needs. Fourth, social networking is 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 Semester 1 Semester 2 Semester 3 Semester 4 H ou rs Hours enrolled Hours employed Hours studied incorporated in the learning environment, allowing students to anonymously participate in interaction and to view their own progress compared to their peers. Finally, gamification components are used to encourage students to participate and become more engaged in the activities. The goal of dysgu is to make the time that student spend on out-of-class activities more productive, so that they are more engaged (by interactive nature of dysgu), more focused (by adaptive and personalized nature of dysgu) and motivated (by social and gamified nature of dysgu); which in turn may lead to improved learning experiences. In recent years, the concept of flipped classes [10] have become very popular for its perceived benefits in student learning and engagement. However, there are concerns [11] related to this new pedagogy, especially that it might not work for every type of students, especially those who come from socially disadvantaged background. Dysgu can address those concerns by its nature of pervasive access, interactivity, adaptability and motivation-oriented environment to augment flipped classes to make it more productive for a diverse class of students.	active learning (machine learning);complexity;experience;gamification;information science;interactivity;job stream;mobile app;money;personalization;pervasive informatics;relevance;unsupervised learning;xfig	Muztaba Fuad;Monika Akbar;Lynn Zubov	2018	CoRR		active learning;personalization;knowledge management;student engagement;computer science	HCI	-75.26722839286688	-38.789756635487045	95449

The system incorporates 3D models of machinery and tools, text instructions, animations and videos with real processes to enrich the information obtained from the real world. The elements are shown when the user points the camera of a mobile device to specific parts of the machinery, where augmented reality (AR) markers are placed. The main goals of the project were (1) create an AR system that guides inexperienced users in machinery handling and (2) measure the acceptance rate and performance of the system in the school manufacturing laboratory. The guidance is provided by means of virtual information about how to operate the machinery when the trainer is not present. The system was implemented as a mobile app for Android devices and it was tested by 16 students and teachers at the university manufacturing laboratory through a survey. The results of this study revealed that students, laboratory technicians, and teachers had positive opinions and good acceptance about the use of the MAR system in the manufacturing laboratory. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However grading students’ summary writings is laborious, but given the importance of summarizing, an effective summarizing learning module is important. This study developed an automatic summary assessment and feedback system based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to provide score, concept and semantic feedback, and then investigated the effects of concept and semantic feedback on the writing of summaries by students in the sixth grade. The design involved two between-subject factors: semantic feedback (with, without) and concept feedback (with, without). 120 sixth-grade students from an elementary school were recruited for the study, and then were randomly assigned to each group. The overall results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system in improving the summary writing skills of students.

102f590038577e5b6439774016b12471ca4daf80	implementation of process-oriented feedback in a clinical reasoning tool for virtual patients		Virtual patients (VPs) offer a safe environment to teach clinical reasoning skills, but feedback is often provided in outcome-, rather than process-oriented fashion. For complex cognitive skills, such as clinical reasoning, the process itself is often more important than the end result, especially during the learning phase. We have developed a tool that can be integrated into VP systems to specifically support the clinical reasoning process and provides process- and outcome-oriented feedback. In a pilot study we explored students usage patterns and satisfaction depending on the feedback type. We did not detect any significant differences between the groups and the time on task indicates similar engagement in both groups. The responses from the satisfaction survey show areas for further development.	feedback	Inga Hege;Andrzej A.

3f58c58b109975988d40ac0e8afb3b4d6edf3dda	empowering the exercise: a body-controlled trampoline training game		Video games can empower their players beyond reality, giving them extraordinary abilities. We investigate a novel class of games that provide empowerment in both the real and the virtual world, in this case using a trampoline as part of the human-computer interface. We studied whether novice trampoline jumpers can learn trampolining skills while playing a platform jumping game implemented using computer vision and a screen placed near the trampoline. 29 participants were divided into three groups: self-training, a game with a normal jump height, and a game with an exaggerated jump height. Performance was tested in pre, post and follow-up tests. All groups improved their performance significantly. The game was considered more engaging and the mean flow questionnaire (SFSS) result with games was significantly higher than with self-training. The study shows that trampoline games can be fun, intuitive to play and basic trampolining skills can be improved while playing the game. A game is more engaging than self-training and extra empowerment, such as jump height exaggeration, enhances the experience. The exaggeration did not adversely affect jumping performance, and half of the participants did not even consciously notice it, which suggests that there is considerable design freedom for manipulating the player’s movements in trampoline games.	computer vision;consciousness;human height;human–computer interaction;jump server;semaphore flag signaling system;virtual world	Raine A.

f1fa12890621adff16ca1193877da406cce1a7f6	effects of feedback elaboration and feedback timing during computer-based practice in mathematics problem solving	mathematics practice;transfer;computer based testing;learning;feedback	This study investigated the effects of feedback on performance with pairs of isomorphic items that were embedded within consecutive mathematics web-based practice tests. Participants were randomly assigned to different experimental testing conditions: (1) feedback type: knowledge of correct response (KCR) or KCR with elaborated feedback (EF) in the form of additional explanations of the correct answer, (2) feedback timing: immediately after answering each item or delayed after completing the practice test, and (3) item format: multiple-choice or constructed response. The study specifically investigated the likelihood that participants would correctly answer the second version of the item, conditioned on their answer to the first version, across feedback type and timing conditions, and taking into account item format and participant initial ability. Results from 2445 participants showed a different pattern of results depending on initial item response correctness. With respect to feedback type, EF resulted in higher performance than KCR following incorrect first responses (suggesting initial lack of knowledge and understanding), but not following correct first responses. With respect to feedback timing, immediate feedback with additional delayed review resulted in higher performance than delayed feedback following incorrect first responses, but resulted in lower performance following correct first responses (immediate feedback without delayed review resulted in lower performance in both cases). We compared effects of feedback elaboration and timing in mathematics practice tests.We focused on learner performance on pairs of isomorphic items embedded in tests.Only for incorrect first responses, elaborated feedback was more effective.For incorrect first responses, immediate feedback was more effective than delayed.For correct first responses, delayed feedback was more effective than immediate.	problem solving	Yigal Attali;Fabienne M. van der Kleij	2017	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2017.03.012	computer science;correctness;elaboration;social psychology	HCI	-73.61168834443579	-46.06249852236855	96577
4d62583809004aa5d054c1358fb4b464ea8a82f2	implementation of learning analytics in mooc by using artificial unintelligence		Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), a web-based e-learning tool, is growing to be used by current educational institutions. To prevent high non-passing rate, instructor needs to know which learner has the potential to pass the course or not. Learner who will fail the course also need advices immediately from instructor or system to overcome it. Learning Analytics (LA) is needed to collect and analyze learners’ activity logs on MOOC and predict their passing potential. The prototype application is developed by using Rational Unified Process (RUP) software development method. Implementation of LA in MOOC is feasible and suggested to analyze learners’ success factors by consuming learners’ activity logs and visualizing it in scatter diagram and node-link diagram. Instructor can provide advices to learners based on success factors generated by LA.	massive open online course	Budi Yulianto;Harjanto Prabowo;Raymond Kosala;Manik Hapsara	2018	JCS	10.3844/jcssp.2018.317.323	machine learning;data science;artificial intelligence;diagram;computer science;software development;massive open online course;rational unified process;learning analytics	ML	-76.83245165404311	-44.82016055278033	96579

Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests that usability engineers often do not capture all necessary usability data, which limits their ability to understand and correct usability problems. We believe that the necessary usability data is the user's immediate intention, a term that we use to refer to the type of action involved (e.g., sensory, cognitive, physical) in the context of the user's interaction with the interface when the user experiences a usability problem. We discuss exploratory studies and an analogy to diagnosis in the medical field that led to the development of the concept of immediate intention. In addition, we introduce the Wizard, a tool for helping usability engineers identify immediate intention, and present the results of formative studies of the Wizard.	hoc (programming language);iteration;rex black;usability engineering;wizard (software)	Jonathan Randall Howarth	2006		10.1145/1185448.1185510	usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;think aloud protocol;web usability;component-based usability testing;cognitive walkthrough;interactive systems engineering;usability;human–computer interaction;agile usability engineering;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;usability engineering;tree testing;heuristic evaluation;usability lab;usability inspection	HCI	-63.02838499513331	-46.475846196492604	96584
0533ea59394afa98053ffe6708c1b709bf46a05e	flipped classroom patterns: controlling the pace	design patterns;educational patterns	During the execution of a flipped classroom course, chances increase students are not at the level scheduled in the initial planning with some students falling behind with their knowledge acquisition and others running ahead. In those cases, adding value during the in-class meetings is much harder for teachers, as they have to take care of all the different knowledge levels. A good way of addressing this problem is to control the learning pace of the group. As a result, the knowledge level of the group will be more homogeneous which makes it easier to add value during the in-class meetings. In previous work we described the pattern Controlling the Pace. This pattern mainly addresses the course planning, but there are more aspects that need to be taken into account. In this paper we propose five patterns based on our experience that can help teachers to control the pace of student's learning in various aspects.	accidental falls;care-of address;description;google classroom;knowledge acquisition;knowledge level;pattern language;schedule (document type);classrooms;meeting	Christian K&#246;ppe;Ralph Niels;Ren&#233; Bakker;Stijn Hoppenbrouwers	2016		10.1145/3022636.3022637	simulation;engineering;multimedia;pedagogy	AI	-74.852865340388	-46.631012713782894	96692
9af23cfd5b38f76a036eedb89427f0fe7dc4936d	theory-driven design of an it-based peer assessment to assess high cognitive levels of educational objectives in large-scale learning services	technology mediated learning;educational objectives;peer assessment;information management;design science research	Due to increasing numbers of students at German universities large-scale learning services are still a common default. These learning services lack interaction as well as feedback to assess learners’ knowledge on the cognitive levels of educational objectives. This situation is alarming, since interaction and feedback in order to assess the own learning progress are important factors for individual learning success and satisfaction. The use of an IT-based peer assessment as a learning instrument can help overcome these challenges by increasing interaction and feedback without massively increasing the workload of lecturers. In this research-in-progress paper we present a theory-driven design of an IT-based peer assessment aiming to increase interaction and feedback as well as assess learners’ knowledge on high cognitive levels of educational objectives in large-scale learning services. We follow a design science research approach and rely on insights from theory of interaction and feedback in order to gather requirements as well as derive design elements to create the IT-based peer assessment. As a next step, we will use the instrument in our large-scale learning service aiming to evaluate whether the IT-based peer assessment is useful to assess high cognitive levels of educational objectives, hence supporting learners during their learning process.	cognition;feedback;requirement	Katja Lehmann;Jan Marco Leimeister	2015			computer science;knowledge management;management science;peer feedback;peer assessment;information management	HCI	-76.53733356984554	-44.206469279025306	96716
6e6920338be721dc6b300e42533ad38750df8369	experimental case study of new usability heuristics		A widely used method to measure the level of usability of software applications is the heuristic evaluation. In this method, specialists commonly use the Nielsen’s heuristics to assess the usability of a software product. However, these principles address to general aspects and become inappropriate when they are used to evaluate new categories of software applications. For this reason, we previously proposed a new set of usability heuristics in the Web transactional domain. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of our new proposal. For this purpose, fifteen undergraduate students were asked to perform a heuristic evaluation in which the new set of heuristics were employed. A survey was taken in order to capture their perceptions about the heuristics in four dimensions: ease of use, usefulness, intention to use and completeness. The results showed that the new heuristics meet the expectations. In addition, this analysis was compared with the results of a similar study that was performed to the current proposal of Nielsen. The results from this study have allowed to reach promising results in this area.

Several commercially available distance-education authoring tools are briefly discussed and an alternative, SAIDE (Simplified Authoring for Instructors using Distance Education), is presented. The discussion focuses on how SAIDE's easy-to-use feature set is useful to authors/trainers in a non-traditional learning/training environment. The technical aspects discussed include details about the user interface and the ways that key features are linked from the interface to the server. The design includes feature interaction, clickable textures, buttons, and boxes, and the user interface paradigm shift from the current authoring methods to a simpler and more intuitive structure. The thrust is to focus on a fully developed and interactive distance education experience via a tool that is simple enough for a novice at using software applications and still powerful enough for a skillful practitioner in distance education.

A student is said to have committed a careless error when the student’s answer is wrong despite knowing the skill required to provide the correct answer. We operationalize the probability that an error is careless through the use of an automated detector, developed using educational data mining, which infers the probability that an error involves carelessness rather than not knowing the relevant skill. This detector is then applied to log data produced by high-school students in the Philippines using a Cognitive Tutor for scatterplots. We study the relationship between carelessness and affect, triangulating between the detector of carelessness and field observations of affect. Surprisingly, we find that carelessness is common among students who frequently experience engaged concentration. This finding implies that a highly engaged student may paradoxically become overconfident or impulsive, leading to more careless errors. In contrast, students displaying confusion or boredom make fewer careless errors. Further analysis over time suggests that confused and bored students have lower learning overall. Thus, their mistakes appear to stem from a genuine lack of knowledge rather than carelessness.	cognitive tutor;educational data mining	Maria Ofelia Clarissa Z.

e43cd867cc29637ac9466680d8709786572d8641	a cognitive study of learning to program in introductoryprogramming courses.	research outputs;research publications	Programming is notoriously hard for novices to learn and a substantial number of learners fail in introduction to programming courses. It is not just a UK problem: a number of multi-institutional and multi-national studies reveal that the problem is well-known and is widespread. There is no general agreement about the causes or the remedies. The major factors which can be hypothesised as a cause of this phenomenon are: learners’ psychology; teaching methods; complexity of programming. In this study, learners’ common mistakes, bugs, misconceptions, frequencies and type of errors (syntactic and semantic) in the early stages of learning programming were studied. Noticing the patterns of rationales behind novices’ mistakes swayed the study toward investigating novices’ mental ability which was found to have a great effect on their learning performance. It was observed that novices reported a recognisable set of models of program execution each of which was logically acceptable as a possible answer and it appeared that some students even used these models systematically. It was suspected that the intellectual strategies behind their reasoning could have been built up from their programming background knowledge and it was surprising when it was found that some of those novices had not even seen a program before. A diagnostic questionnaire was designed that apparently examined a student’s understanding of assignments and sequence but in fact was capturing the reasoning strategy behind their interpretation of each question, regardless of a correct or wrong answer. The questionnaire was administered in the first week of an introductory programming course, without giving any explanation of what the questions were about. A full response from most participants was received, despite the fact that the questions were unexplained. Confronted with a simple program, about half of novices seem to spontaneously invent and consistently apply a mental model of program execution.

However, there are few descriptive accounts that effectively represent a CoP in a manner that will be of use to other designers. In order to illuminate potential difficulties which may arise when attempting to design a framework to characterize or to build a CoP, this study describes the dynamics of five dualities (specific areas of tension) that were identified during the design and testing period of the Inquiry Learning Forum (ILF), a Web-based community for teachers’ professional development. During the three-year design trajectory of the ILF, these five dualities emerged from and characterized the interactions between the participating teachers and the site designers. As part of the data collection for this study, we conducted document analyses, interviews with designers, researchers, and teachers, and observations of online and face-to-face meetings. The findings of this study are intended to help future Web-designers both to better realize the full potential of online professional development environments and to avoid potential design development issues which may hamper the utility or participation rates in newly created CoPs.	emergence;interaction;naivety;programming paradigm;sociotechnical system	Eun-Ok Baek;Sasha Barab	2005	Educational Technology & Society		professional development;distance education;educational technology;leadership;design research;web design;science education;computer science;knowledge management;instructional design;multimedia;grounded theory;law;information technology;pedagogy;data collection	HCI	-75.14486167888566	-39.060873348471574	97619
c724036cc00c199b3e3466ccd840c6f5aacd1f87	an automatic and dynamic knowledge assessment module for adaptive educational systems		Adaptive Educational Systems (AES) make use of Artificial Intelligence techniques aiming at adapting themselves to the real needs of the student, and through such provide a personalized and individualized teaching. In order for this adaptation to be successful, it is important that the system knows the level of knowledge concerning the real cognitive state of the students. In this manner, this article presents an approach for predicting academic performance based on ontologies and Bayesian networks. A knowledge assessment module was developed and integrated to a Ubiquitous Learning Environment (ULE) in real and actual use. During three semesters, five graduate classes were analyzed with the intent of verifying the correlation between the grades generated by the module and the actual grades obtained by the students. It was noted that 80% of the analyzed samples obtained very high or substantial correlations. This indicates that the proposed module is adequate for identifying and predicting academic performance.	artificial intelligence;bayesian network;ontology (information science);personalization;ule scheduler;verification and validation	Hiran Nonato M.

Subsequently, in-class or online sharing and discussions on the contexts took place, which would enhance the students' understanding of the proper usage of the idioms. The learning design is grounded in seamless learning that encompasses in-class formal learning and out-of-class informal settings, and personal and social learning spaces. Our analysis of the student artifacts in both productand process-oriented aspects reveal the students’ cognitive process and learning strategies during the course of content creation.

On the other hand, the use of ebooks are becoming more and more widespread: they are portable, accessible, and offer the possibility of enriching the text with other digital content as an added advantage. In addition, such books are also being presented today as a magnificent teacher support tool. This paper aims at researching current applications that allow for the merging of these two educational resources, trying to include interactive tools in ebook format. It contains an exhaustive study of the steps for creating an ebook based on the theory of automatic control, and a wide battery of interactive tools associated with the contents of the book. We will try to show an ebook sample including interactive tools so as to facilitate the work of the teacher and student learning.	simulation	Julián Salt;Sebastián Dormido;Ángel Cuenca;Francisco Palau	2013		10.3182/20130828-3-UK-2039.00038	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia	Logic	-67.23231953672183	-42.293303190879996	98254

Hot desking is one of these new working practices that reduces office space per worker. These new office concepts however, pose new challenges and problems to solve. This paper describes the development phase of an innovative touch screen application for location based services to overcome the problematic edge effects of hot desking such as missing workspace awareness and poor communication. We followed a user-centered design (UCD) process to develop and test the interface so that it could be gradually modified and tailored to the demands and expectations of the end users. First, a methodological overview of the different phases of the UCDprocess is given. Then, the results of each phase are discussed, focusing on several interface elements.

However, there are very few practical tools for teachers that would aid reaching this complex mathematical learning goal. The aim of the present study was to test the effects of a game-based learning environment in supporting primary school studentsu0027 adaptive number knowledge and related arithmetic skills. Participants were 1168 students in grades four, five, and six. Classes were randomized in two conditions: in the experimental group regular mathematics teaching was enriched with gameplay using the Number Navigation Game (NNG), and in the control group students continued according to their regular math curriculum. An experimental design with pre- and post-test was used to measure studentsu0027 adaptive number knowledge, arithmetic fluency, and pre-algebra knowledge. Overall, results showed that the experimental group outperformed the control group on adaptive number knowledge and math fluency. Results showed varying effects of the training in different grade levels, with more pronounced improvement of studentsu0027 adaptive number knowledge in grade five. Game performance was related to the experimental groupu0027s post-test scores even after controlling for pre-test scores and grade. Results suggest that the NNG is effective in enhancing different types of arithmetic skills and knowledge in different grades of primary school education and can provide teachers with a practical and flexible tool to extend their regular classroom practice.

a9a3e28e3d061ac50af6c80ca7b8daa9a238f7ec	methods & tools: constructive interaction and collaborative work: introducing a method for testing collaborative systems	constructive interaction;collaborative work;collaborative system	This article focuses on how the constructive interaction method helps system designers determine whether the basic concepts underlying a system are well understood by users and whether its implementation, usability, and utility are satisfactory. We describe our experiences in using a form of constructive interaction to test a software package that supports a particular collaborative activity. The difference between our use of the constructive interaction method versus other models is that our test subjects use separate workstations in the same room to discuss their common tasks. Having thus adjusted the setting to the specific characteristics of computer-supported collaborative work, we asked each person to carry out separate sets of predefined tasks that were linked. Simply asking people whether they are satisfied with a newly introduced system does not suffice, because the reasons they give may not reflect their actual views or behavior [1]. To avoid the shortcomings of such a straightforward approach, the thinking aloud method has been used in order to both gain a more adequate understanding of how a person views a system and test the system’s usability [7]. In a standard thinking aloud test, a person has to work on a predefined task while continuously verbalizing his or her thoughts. This method yields a set of verbal utterances combined with actions about the task. The behavior of the person tested can be audioor videotaped, and analyzing several of those tests may reveal how people understand or misunderstand the computer system and how to reduce misunderstanding. However, this method clearly has drawbacks. First, interaction is limited because the user In trying to determine how people use	collaborative software;computer;interaction;usability;workstation	Helge Kahler;Finn Kensing;Michael Muller	2000	Interactions	10.1145/334216.334226	computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;management science	HCI	-63.13197822758447	-40.08409283856084	98973

It further requires the ability to integrate different representations of the chemical phenomena at the macroscopic, molecular, symbolic, and graphical level. Many students have trouble making logical connections among the different representations and integrating them with underlying chemical concepts and principles (Kozma and Russell, 1997). These difficulties influence their success in general chemistry and their attitudes towards the science.	knowledge space	Mare Taagepera;Ramesh D.

The study developed the Game Embedded CALL (GeCALL) system with two activities for on-line speaking practice. For the drill practice, learners get immediate scores with evaluation feedback on their utterances; in the game-based practice, they have to correctly choose and pronounce the English vocabulary from the candidate answers to pass the four-level barriers. To enable the study to confirm the factors that facilitate students’ English learning, a total of 52 learners from Taiwan participated in this experiment, divided into an experimental group (E.G.) and a control group (C.G.). The learners in the E.G learned English with both the drill and game-based practice, while the students in the C.G. learned only with the drill practice. The empirical evaluation reveals that those who learned with both drill and game-based activities performed better in terms of their English pronunciation than the learners who only participated in the drill practice, but the learners in the C.G. performed better in the delayed vocabulary retention test. Besides, the study indicates that the learners, especially the low-achievement ones, showed great involvement and were active in practicing speaking in the game-based scenario. The findings are in accordance with the previous research affirming that gameplay is the driving force that promotes learners’ educative engagement, and that learners of different levels of learning achievement are active in learning together while practicing their oral speaking in the stress-free environment. In sum, the GeCALL system is an educative aid that could reduce learners’ language speaking anxiety and to provide flexible chances for individual students to do self-speaking practice within the given limited teaching time. The findings of this study support the value of applying game strategies with ASR techniques for language learning purposes.	embedded system;experiment;online and offline;speech recognition;vocabulary	Shelley Shwu-Ching Young;Yi Hsuan Wang	2014	Educational Technology & Society		qualitative comparative analysis;questionnaire;educational technology;interaction;social science;interview;computer science;qualitative research;computational linguistics;multimedia;communication;statistics;pedagogy;vocabulary development	HCI	-74.27182402438038	-43.629575491178336	99736

The way neuroscience is taught, however, has lagged behind and still relies on direct instruction or textbooks. We argue that the spatial nature of the brain makes it an ideal candidate for hands-on activities coupled with a tangible interface. In this paper we introduce BrainExplorer, a learning environment for teaching neuroscience. BrainExplorer allows users to explore neural pathways on a custom tabletop platform. We conducted an evaluation with 28 participants comparing students who learned neuroscience content through using BrainExplorer with students who learned by reading a textbook chapter. We found that our system promotes learning along 3 dimensions: memorizing scientific terminology, understanding a dynamic system, and transferring knowledge to a new situation.	dynamical system;hands-on computing;tangible user interface	Bertrand Schneider;Jenelle Wallace;Roy D.

Yet, these same scientists turn out to be highly competent when it comes to graphs from their immediate domain of research. In this research, which is based on ethnographic studies among scientists and technicians, I show how graph interpretation in one biology laboratory initially required tool (computer)mediation. After scientists had become familiar with the phenomenon, data collection,and resulting graphs, they interpret the latter correctly without requiring prior transformation. Furthermore, in the course of their work, they established what they understood to be a one-to-one correspondence between graphs and some aspect of the natural world. As a result of scientists' embodied laboratory work, talk about the graphical representation and talk about the object represented are often indistinguishable. The process of developing competency in graph use is equivalent to that of a tool that becomes transparent to the consciousness of its user;I describe this process in terms of activity theory as a transition from tool-mediated action to operation.

The goal of this study was to use a different approach to this question by manipulating the abstractness of the information available for distinguishing pairs of items in an XAB task, and the presence or absence of a short task-filled delay between X and AB. Participants engaged in XAB trials containing a mixture of trials with and without the delay task before and after standard training to classify visual texture stimuli into two categories. Training improved discrimination of pairs differing on the category-relevant dimension whether withinor betweencategory, but not on pairs differing only on non-category relevant low level features. In addition, only successful learners in the post-training trials avoided decreased discrimination accuracy due to the delay task, suggesting that they formed more stable representations. However, this effect was not limited to pairs varying in category-relevant ways.	high- and low-level	Josh de Leeuw;Jan Andrews	2015			cognitive psychology;social psychology;categorical perception;psychology	HCI	-71.9458078436965	-46.66698958129228	100189

Game designers are using these features to create scaffolding tools to reduce player frustration. However, researchers are finding some unexpected effects of scaffolding on strategy development and problem-solving behaviors. We used a digital Sudoku game named Professor Sudoku to classify built-in critical features, frustration control and demonstration scaffolds, and to investigate their effects on player/learner behaviors. Our data indicate that scaffolding support increased the level at which puzzles could be solved, and decreased frustration resulting from excessive numbers of retries. However, it also reduced the number of unassisted placements (i.e., independently filled cells), and increased reliance on scaffolding tools, both of which are considered disadvantageous for learning. Among the three scaffold types, frustration control reduced the potential for players to feel stuck at certain levels, but also reduced the frequency of use of critical feature-making tools, which are thought to have greater heuristic value. We conclude that the simultaneous provision of critical feature and frustration control scaffolds may increase player reliance on available support, thereby reducing learning opportunities. Providing players with critical features and demonstration scaffolds at the same time increases reliance on available support for some players, but for most it encourages the development of solving strategies. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The effectiveness of MOOCs is an open question as completion rates are substantially less than traditional online education courses. The objective of this study is to identify factors that enhance an individual' intention to continue usingMOOCs, which a limited amount of research has previously explored. A research model based on the information systems continuance expectation-confirmation model is proposed and tested with data collected in a large-scale study. The researchmodel explained a substantial percentageof the variance for the intention to continue using MOOCs, which is significantly influenced by perceived reputation, perceived openness, perceived usefulness, perceived, and user satisfaction. Perceived reputation and perceived openness were the strongest predictors and have not previously been examined in the context of MOOCs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study used a within-teacher design to compare students who were assigned multi-media learning objects for learning fractions with students taught by the same teachers who were not assigned to the technology. There were two conditions: (1) teachers were asked to limit the number of assigned students to 25% of their class (N = 375 grade 7–10 students) and (2) teachers could assign as many students as they wanted (N = 149 grade 7 students). In the constrained decision setting, students assigned to the technology were more likely than students not assigned to score lower on a fractions achievement test, have dysfunctional attitudes towards mathematics learning, have low self-efficacy, exert low effort, and be male. In the unconstrained decision setting, 70% of students were assigned the technology and the only statistically significant predictor was prior achievement. Teachers’ criteria were congruent with research identifying correlates of mathematics achievement and comfort with technology.	blackwell (series);clips;kerrison predictor;lloyd's algorithm;persistence (computer science)	John A.

We find that the scale presented here is unidimensional and highly reliable. Moreover, it predicts engagement with a science documentary clip more accurately than do measures of science intelligence or education. Although more steps are needed, this provides initial evidence for the utility of our measure of science curiosity.

Whereas empirical studies on negotiation support systems (NSS) have shown that NSS generally improve negotiation performance, very few NSS exist that cater for multilingual negotiations. With multilingual support, international negotiators of different language backgrounds are expected to address communication barriers and problems. This study involves the development of an NSS prototype with multilingual support as well as a laboratory experiment to examine the efficacy of such support on six important negotiation outcome variables (individual outcome, joint outcome, equality of outcome, time to settlement, satisfaction with process and satisfaction with outcome). Findings suggested significant effects of NSS support on individual outcome and joint outcome. Multilingual support helped to improve equality of outcome (under qualified conditions), but the time taken was significantly longer. The paper underlines the possibility and significance of computer-based multilingual support to address diverse linguistic groups in global negotiation context.

This paper presents an agent framework that addresses the relationship between user's state of emotion during learning and the modification of learning pace and feedback-type in a virtual environment for learning effectiveness. The technique exploits the structure of emotion-evaluation from user's current interaction to dynamically regulate learning pace within a Virtual Learning Enviornment (VLE) via a proposed Emotion Regulation Agent (ERA) system to derive meaningful emotion information from user's interactions based on a simplified version of the Pleasure, Arousal and Dominance (PAD) emotion model. This information then regulates learning by adjusting the type of task and learning information to promote a beneficial and sustainable learning experience by optimizing learning emotion.	interaction;virtual reality	Matthias Chan Yong Shun;Miao-Chun Yan;Bo An;Cyril Leung	2015	2015 IEEE 15th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies	10.1109/ICALT.2015.117	robot learning;error-driven learning;emotion;computer science;artificial intelligence;feedback;multimedia	Robotics	-77.05622504707381	-45.45996732240772	100894

This study explores how people deceive and how they deal with deceptive information in the context of a conceptual learning task. Participants play a game in which a learner infers the location of a rectangle based on the testimony of an informant, who is either helpful or deceptive. We investigate the behavior of both informants and learners in this scenario. On the informant level, we demonstrate that people provide different information depending on whether they are helpful or deceptive. Although deceptive informants do lie outright, they more often opt to mislead. From the learner’s perspective, we show that people do choose to verify information but no more often when the informant is deceptive. Despite this, we also find that learners are capable of accurately identifying who is deceptive and who is helpful. We conclude by examining common strategies used in the two conditions and their implications in real-world settings.	inferential programming	Robert Montague;Daniel J.

This assumption has been virtually untested in applied settings. We studied the effects of work experience and instructions on the ability of 59 observers to recognize target behaviors in an observational learning paradigm similar to existing ones. Additionally, we investigated the effects of two key factors that were hypothesized to affect the recognition process in observational learning. The results indicated that only observers who had a minimum of work experience (i.e., intermediate and experienced observers in the study) were able to consistently recognize targeted behaviors. Additionally, recognition was influenced by the level of detail of instructions given to the participants. Finally, characteristics of the modeled behaviors greatly affected recognition: Overall, examples of negative behaviors were better recognized than were positive examples. Behaviors whose consequence was shown were also better recognized than those that were neither reinforced nor punished in the video. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for the design of observational learning as a training strategy in complex and applied social learning situations. The applications of this work include the design of training, and the training of evaluators and observers.	behavior;fifty nine;learning disorders;level of detail;programming paradigm;reinforcement learning;observers	Florian Jentsch;Clint A.

05b7774fb236be434e7ff0b5bacaba79cf7c94a4	share and share alike: integrating internet resource sharing into learning		Despite instructors’ concerns, students use “non-scholarly” Internet information resources to address their knowledge gaps or supplement their learning. In this research, students were encouraged to use such Internet resources to complete an individual course assignment and then share those resources to create a group submission. This allowed an investigation of perceived learning and development of social capital measured through quality and quantity. Assignments were introduced into eight courses over three semesters, providing a sample size of 210 undergraduate and graduate students. Two systems, one a social curation site and one the university’s LMS, were evaluated as suitable platforms for such learning activities. Findings suggest that these learning assignments resulted in positive perceptions of learning as well as positive perceptions of the quality and quantity of social capital shared. Student engagement as reflected by the number of resources stored differed by system, suggesting increased student engagement in the social curation system.	americas conference on information systems;digital curation;internet;rico;social capital	Regina Collins;Fadi P.

In this paper, we share an experience-based design and a pilot study to introduce music learning in preschool education. SAMI (Software for music learning in early childhood education) is a mobile application consisting of four games which main objectives are ear training, sound discrimination and music composition. The pilot study carried out in a real-life setting with third-year kindergarten children provides empirical data about music learning outcomes and compares an experimental group of children using SAMI with a control group which follows the traditional Montessori bells method. Our study results reveal a number of key findings for the design of preschool mobile games and the potential of using mobile technologies for music learning in early childhood.

The system draws on techniques from Brain Computer Interface and educational psychology to automatically adapt to  changes  in  the  learners’  mental  states  such as attention and workload using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The objective of this system is to maintain the learner in a positive mental state throughout the tutoring session by selecting the next pedagogical activity that fits the best to his current state. An experimental evaluation of our approach involving two groups of learners showed that the group who interacted with the mental state-based adaptive version of the system obtained higher learning outcomes and had a better learning experience than the group who interacted with a non-adaptive version.	brain–computer interface;electroencephalography;fits;mental state	Maher Chaouachi;Imene Jraidi;Claude Frasson	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20267-9_5	workload;intelligent tutoring system;computer science;machine learning;mental state;artificial intelligence;educational psychology	HCI	-74.58327838886407	-46.651586136580384	102130

Deaf and hard of hearing people can find it difficult to follow speech through hearing alone or to take notes while they are lip-reading or watching a sign-language interpreter. Synchronising the speech with text captions can ensure deaf students are not disadvantaged and assist all learners to search for relevant specific parts of the multimedia recording by means of the synchronised text. Automatic speech recognition has been used to provide real-time captioning directly from lecturers’ speech in classrooms but it has proved difficult to obtain accuracy comparable to stenography. This paper describes the development, testing and evaluation of a system that enables editors to correct errors in the captions as they are created by automatic speech recognition and makes suggestions for future possible improvements.	automated system recovery;real-time clock;real-time transcription;speech recognition	Mike Wald;John-Mark Bell;Philip Boulain;Karl Doody;Jim Gerrard	2007	I.

A vast amount of evidence from research in such related areas as educational psychology suggest that individual differences, such as a novice end user's learning style may effect his/her learning of a new EUC software. This paper reports the findings of a series of studies that examined the influence of a novice's learning style in learning of typical EUC tools such as spreadsheets and electronic mail. A consistent pattern of findings emerged that indicate that learning style is an important predictor of learning performance, both by itself and in interaction with training methods. The findings suggest that in the design of training, it is essential to match training methods to individual difference variables. Based on these findings, guidelines are suggested for IS professional involved in EUC training.	email;end-user computing;kerrison predictor;spreadsheet	Robert P. Bostrom;Lorne Olfman;Maung K.

Interactive tabletops have the potential to support brainstorming and, by exploiting learners’ trace data, they can provide Open Learner Models (OLMs) to support reflection on a brainstorming session. We describe our design of such OLMs to enable an individual to answer core questions: C1) how much did I contribute? C2) at what times was the group or an individual stuck? and C3) where did group members seem to ‘spark’ off each other? We conducted 24 brainstorming sessions and analysed them to create brainstorming models underlying the OLMs. Results indicate the OLM’s were effective. Our contributions are: i) the first OLMs supporting reflection on brainstorming; ii) models of brainstorming that underlie the OLMs; and iii) a user study demonstrating that learners can use the OLMs to answer core reflection questions.	interactive media	Andrew Clayphan;Roberto Martínez Maldonado;Judy Kay	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_88	human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-71.78080052250695	-43.318691735128624	103815

Our goals of this study were to determine the learning benefit of the key design elements of adaptivity and formative feedback. Results from an experiment testing 268 heterogeneous students generally show that the system: (a) significantly improves learning, and (b) is a reliable and valid assessment tool. More specifically, the system's formative feedback feature significantly enhanced student learning, but did not detract from the accuracy of the assessment.		Valerie J. Shute;Eric G.

No matter how user-friendly the software or the training manual, errors can and will occur. The current view on errors is that they can be helpful or disruptive, depending on the extent to which they are controlled in the learning process. This study examines one of the ways in which such error control can be brought about, namely by investigating the design and role of error-information in a (tutorial) manual. The error-information was designed to support the detection, diagnosis and correction of errors of novice users, and it was based on a general model of error-handling. In an experiment a manual that contained ample error-information was compared to a manual in which there was hardly any error-information. The outcomes showed that the presence of the error-information in the manual helped subjects perform better during practice as well as after practice. Among others, these subjects completed training faster and showed superior corrective knowledge and skill after practice, in addition to having acquired the same level of constructive skill.

The purpose of this study is to understand how to use Facebook as an educational tool based on college students’ current Facebook usage. A total of 200 undergraduates responded to an online questionnaire. This study shows undergraduates are willing to use Facebook in their coursework. However, students dislike the idea of blending their social and academic lives on Facebook. This study offers suggestions on how educators can integrate Facebook features into their course, to minimise students’ concerns. Furthermore, the study discusses how using Facebook as an educational tool reinforces 21st century skills and how educators can evaluate Facebook components using quality matters standards.	social media in education	Nicola L.

The study utilizes self-assessment survey approach, with the questionnaire as a tool for data collection. It surveyed undergraduate students of Sultan Qaboos University, enrolled in their final year for the academic year 2010/2011. Collected data from 550 valid questionnaires were processed using SPSS. The results indicated high rates of information literacy skills. Among the Big6 skills synthesis, including the ability of respondents in summarizing, combining and linking, using consistent style of organization, and using a variety of ways to display information was ranked first, while the skill of location and access scored the lowest. Significant statistical differences attributed to specialization, gender, English fluency, and computer skills were also indicated at minor levels. The amount of literature relating to information literacy in the Arab World is comparatively less than that in the developed countries. No empirical studies that investigate the competencies of information literacy among university students have previously been conducted in Oman.	digital data;inferential programming;information literacy;librarian;library and information science;partial template specialization;spss;scholarly communication;social network;ucl department of information studies;uncontrolled format string	Ali Al-Aufi;Hamed Al-Azri	2013	JOLIS	10.1177/0961000613486824	computer literacy;mathematics education;questionnaire;computer science;information literacy;multimedia;statistics;pedagogy	HCI	-77.21994798162892	-39.805330086720225	104735

The social constructs evaluated in this study include sense of community (SOC), social ability (SA), perceived ease of use (PEU) and usefulness (PU) of social awareness tools, and self-reported participation (SRP) in online courses. Students’ social ability is predicted by perceived ease of use of social awareness tools and self-reported participation. Satisfaction with online learning is explained by sense of community, social ability, and selfreported participation. Sense of community is shown to be a mediator of the relationships between social ability and satisfaction (SA S) and between perceived usefulness and satisfaction (PU S). Additionally, students’ social ability, perception of usefulness of social awareness tools, and self-reported participation serve as predictors for students’ sense of community. The findings from the path analysis show the value of simultaneously examining the relationships among the multiple social constructs, rather than simply examining relationships of how one construct may predict another as has been shown in previous studies.	one-class classification;online machine learning;path analysis (statistics);social engineering (security);usability	I-Chun Tsai;Bosung Kim;Pei-Ju Liu;Sean P.

According to this recent trend, various computer-based courseware or commercial software for language learning plays an indispensable role in higher educational organizations. However, not enough research has been done concerning which and how courseware can be adapted to the particular students' needs and skills. Even the instructor is often unaware of what methodological approaches work well for students' needs. The present study aims at understanding how Japanese students view certain courseware when they use it and determine how the courseware should be incorporated into the hybrid language learning environment. The study focuses on a hybrid English learning course offered to improve students' scores in The Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC®). The results of this study provide instructors with many insights into how to facilitate hybrid learning for students using courseware. The results also suggest some significant implications concerning how to maximize the effectiveness of hybrid learning for future language learning.

To realize these aims, we are developing and implementing a mobile app with two parts: (1) a front-end virtual scientist called Dr. Discovery (Dr. D) for use by museum visitors that doubles as an unobtrusive data-gatherer and (2) a back-end analytics portal to be mined by museum staff, evaluators, and researchers. With the aid of our museum partners, we are developing this app to function as a platform for STEM informal education, research, and data-driven decision-making by museum staff. The Dr. D app has been designed to engage museum visitors, while connecting with an analytic system to make sense, in real time, of the large amounts of data produced by visitors’ use of the app. The analytic system helps museum staff access and interpret ongoing evaluation data, regardless of experience or museum resources, informing the practice of professionals at the front lines of informal STEM education in diverse communities. The design of the Dr. D app incorporates open-source analytic tools that make the gathering and interpretation of contextual information from visitors’ app use accessible to museum staff and educators, building their capacity for using data in their day-to-day work. The same tools are being used by our research team to probe questions about informal learning and motivation, effective application of large datasets for museum evaluation, and ways to encourage and understand use of mobile virtual experiences. In this paper, we describe our theory-based design of the Dr. D app and data analytics and describe findings from initial user testing with our museum partners.	data mining;ibm notes;mined;mobile app;open-source software;real-time data;usability testing	Brian C.

This applies to learning web sites and materials that must now undergo ''reasonable adjustments'', in order not to disadvantage students with learning disabilities as well as non-disabled students. This paper discusses how e-learning and the inherent use of online learning activities raises problems for students with dyslexia far beyond accessibility and web design. This paper aims at proposing that the so widely proclaimed advantages of e-learning to bridge distances, different learning paces and cognitive styles, is at the same time producing close to insurmountable barriers to students with cognitive disabilities in general, and dyslexia specifically. It presents the results of a research project aiming at uncovering evidence that students with dyslexia are in fact less likely to thrive in a synchronous e-learning environment. The paper reports on a set of experiments undertaken with students when engaged in online authentic synchronous learning activities. The paper focuses on text-based synchronous activities, since it is the widest and most commonly used synchronous technology, and provides clear evidence that it can marginalise, demotivate and disappoint students with dyslexia with difficulties in reading, spelling, word order and argumentation.	text-based (computing)	B.

The main objective of our study is to (1) empirically investigate the factors that affect the acceptance and use of e-learning in Lebanon, and (2) investigate the role of a set of individual differences as moderators (e.g., age, gender, experience, educational level) in an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). A quantitative methodology approach was adopted in this study. To test the hypothesized research model, data was collected from 569 undergraduate and postgraduate students studying in Lebanon via questionnaire. The collected data were analysed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique based on AMOS methods in conjunction with multi-group analysis. The result revealed that perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), subjective norms (SN) and Quality of Work Life (QWL) positively affect students' behavioural intention (BI). We also found that experience moderates the relationship between PEOU, PU and SN on e-learning use intention, and that age difference moderates the effects of PEOU, SN and QWL on BI. In addition, educational level moderates the effects of PEOU, SN on BI, and gender moderates the effects of PU, SN and QWL on BI. Contrary to expectations, a moderating role of age on the relationship between PU and BI was not found. Similarly, gender was not found to affect the relationship between PEOU and BI, and educational level did not moderate the relationship between PU or QWL and BI. In light of these findings, implications to both theory and practice are discussed.	structural equation modeling	Ali Tarhini;Kate S.

8354ab0a65accc3c2c96aed793d0a99fc1bd3e57	web accessibility evaluation in a crowdsourcing-based system with expertise-based decision strategy		The rising awareness of accessibility increases the demand for Web accessibility evaluation projects to verify the implementation of Web accessibility guidelines and identify accessibility barriers in websites. However, the complexity of accessibility evaluation tasks and the lack of experts limits their scope and reduces their significance. Due to this complexity, they could not directly rely on a technique called crowdsourcing, which made great contributions in many fields by dividing a problem into many tedious micro-tasks and solving tasks in parallel. Addressing this issue, we develop a new crowdsourcing-based Web accessibility evaluation system with two novel decision strategies, golden set strategy and time-based golden set strategy. These strategies enable the generation of task results with high accuracy synthesized from micro-tasks solved by workers with heterogeneous expertise. An accessibility evaluation of 98 websites by 55 workers with varying experience verifies that our system can complete the evaluation in half the time with a 7.2% improvement on accuracy than the current approach.	crowdsourcing;decision theory;heterogeneous computing;web accessibility	Shuyi Song;Jiajun Bu;Ye Wang;Zhi Yu;Andreas Artmeier;Lianjun Dai;Can Wang	2018		10.1145/3192714.3192827	management science;web accessibility;crowdsourcing;computer science;web accessibility initiative	HCI	-63.98334494690593	-47.113772977839986	106119

However, to grasp studentsu0027 engagement is too difficult in the situation where there are so many students. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to grasp the studentsu0027 engagement by a chair with a pressure mat, not by teachers. We recorded studentsu0027 upper body pressure distribution while they were taking e-learning lectures. We recorded 145 lectures in total. Then we extracted 56 features for each lecture, selected proper features and trained classifiers to determine whether he or she was engaged in the lecture. As a result, the average accuracy was 75.2% for student-dependent. This result shows it is possible to predict studentu0027s engagement automatically, and it will help teachers to give lectures more effective.

Mobile learning (m-learning) is an extension of distance education, supported by mobile devices equipped with wireless technologies. It is an emerging learning model and process that requires new forms of teaching, learning, contents, and dynamics between actors. In order to ascertain the current state of knowledge and research, an extensive review of the literature in m-learning has been undertaken to identify and harness potential factors and gaps in implementation. This article provides a critical analysis of m-learning projects and related literature, presenting the findings of this aforementioned analysis. It seeks to facilitate the inquiry into the following question: “What is possible in m-learning using recent technologies?” The analysis will be divided into two main parts: applications from the recent online mobile stores and operating system standalone applications.	mobile device;operating system	Orlando R.

This study examines the effects of discretionary Internet-based behavior of 270 instructors using e-resources on satisfaction with the teaching service of 15,367 students at a Spanish university. The argument developed is that these voluntary Internet-based behaviors, operationalized as ‘cybercivism’ (i.e., care and help for university’s information system and its student-users), comprise contextual activities that ameliorate some of the recognized deficits in virtual contexts, support the teaching-learning process across the Internet and, hence, increase student satisfaction. Previously, the paper argues on the uniqueness of cybercivism as compared with conventional citizenship behavior by contrasting the experiential differences between face-to-face and virtual interactions. Confirmatory factor analysis results supported the distinctiveness of cybercivism. Unlike conventional citizenship behavior, individual cybercivism was also found to be positively associated with student satisfaction with teaching service as rated in each university center. Since this positive impact mainly occurred in a virtual environment, the results suggest that discretionary Internet-based behavior may contribute to student satisfaction ‘on the other side of the Web.’ DOI: 10.4018/ijcbpl.2013010105 International Journal of Cyber Behavior, Psychology and Learning, 3(1), 50-66, January-March 2013 51 Copyright © 2013, IGI Global.

These behaviors that do not fall specifically within the instructors’ assigned activity constitute a very important part of the overall instructor’s performance at work. Borman and Motowidlo (1993) study this issue when, based on how the technical core of the university is supported, they divide the instructor’s overall performance into either task or contextual performance. Task performance would comprise activities that support the technical core itself. Contextual performance is also able to support the technical core, but does so across the technological, social, and psychological environment of the university. Van Dyne et al. (1995) have also discussed this instructor behavioral dichotomy. They suggested using the terms in-role versus extra-role behavior to differentiate between these two patterns depending whether instructor performance follows or not an expected role. There are many types of discretionary behaviors of instructors, but organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) is by far the one that has received the most attention in the educational literature in the past decade (Bogler & Somech, 2004, 2005; Somech & DrachZahavy, 2000; Somech & Ron, 2007). Dennis Organ (1988) provided the seminal definition of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) stating that it is “individual behavior that is discretionary, not directly or explicitly recognized by the formal reward system, and that in the aggregate promotes the effective functioning of the organization” (p. 4). Consistent with the Borman and Motowidlo’s (1993) concept of contextual performance, Organ (1997) later modified this definition and stated that OCB is “performance that supports the social and psychological environment in which task performance takes place” (p.95). Instructors’ OCB comprises prevalent and beneficial behaviors such as defending the university organization (OCB-O) when other colleagues criticize it and, when directed at individuals (OCB-I), assisting others with their duties. Previous OCB empirical studies have confirmed the relationship between OCB and organizational performance (Dunlop & Lee, 2004; Ehrhart et al., 2006; Koys, 2001; Podsakoff et al., 1997; Podsakoff & MacKenzie, 1994; Walz & Niehoff, 2000). Smith et al. (1983) contend that OCB “lubricates the social machinery of the organization” and “provides the flexibility needed to work through many unforeseen contingencies” (p.654). Also prior research in educational settings provides evidence that OCB could be beneficial (e.g., Somech & Drach-Zahavy, 2000), reducing troubles and increasing performance. In this respect, teacher OCB in university settings contributes to the whole university be positively perceived and valued, and plays a role in the achievement of university effectiveness. Despite previous research has indicated that OCB impacts on positive measures of university effectiveness, little is known about whether these behaviors involved in environments supported by information and communication technologies (ICTs) can contribute, as conventional OCB, in promoting university effectiveness. The increasingly presence of e-teaching in universities, which provides instructors with a dominant culture in the use of e-resources, causes that the majority of these tasks to include online activities. Virtual activity of instructors, therefore, constitutes an alternative way to instructors to carry out their tasks, thus exhibiting discretionary behaviors across information and communication technologies (ICTs). However, online interactions have important limitations (such as the social distance that virtual contexts create and other limitations inherent to computer-mediated communication) that are not present in face-to-face environments, and performance suffers as a consequence. Those recognized deficits of virtual contexts question the impact on performance of these behaviors over the Internet. In other words, there is little empirical evidence about whether these behaviors involved in environments supported by information and communication technologies 15 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/does-discretionary-internet-basedbehavior/76276?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Communications and Social Science.

Automated early warning systems are therefore highly desirable. In this paper, we use unsupervised clustering techniques to predict the graduation status of declared majors in five departments at California State University Northridge (CSUN), based on a minimal number of lower division courses in each major. In addition, we use the detected clusters to identify hidden bottleneck courses.	attrition (website);cluster analysis;gene regulatory network;unsupervised learning	Seyed Sajjadi;Bruce Shapiro;Christopher J D Mckinlay;Allen Sarkisyan;Carol Shubin;Efunwande Osoba	2017	2017 Intelligent Systems Conference (IntelliSys)		simulation;artificial intelligence;data science;machine learning	AI	-76.82237342134339	-51.9241600410453	107121

It presents an architecture that links a parametric model of aetiology to verbal and non verbal behaviour which can be manipulated in realtime. We believe that this design has the potential to consolidate understanding by allowing learners to systematically explore variations in clinical presentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Intelligent Virtual Agent (IVA) that uses a parameterised behaviour model to provide an interactive examination and diagnosis of a stroke patient.	intelligent agent;parametric model;real-time computing	Harry Brenton;Peter Woodward;Marco Gillies;Jonathan Birns;Diane Ames;Fernando Bello	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-21996-7_27	psychiatry;communication;social psychology	HCI	-66.01614448803315	-51.27557644731041	107160

This study focuses on supporting scientific argumentation in the classroom through a personally-seeded online discussion system. Students use an online interface to build principles to describe data they have collected. These principles become the seed comments for the online discussions. The software sorts students into discussion groups with students who have built different principles so that each discussion group can consider and critique multiple perspectives. We outline a methodology for (a) coding the individual comments in terms of epistemic operation, grounds, and content normativity and (b) parsing and assessing overall argumentation structure of the oppositional episodes. This study therefore contributes to the research literature both in terms of scaffolding and assessing student argumentation in online asynchronous forums.	personally identifiable information	Douglas B.

While such simulations represent an effective paradigm in surgical education, there is an opportunity to add a layer of cognitive exercises to these basic simulations that can facilitate robust skill learning in residents. This paper describes a controlled methodology, inspired by neuropsychological assessment tasks and embodied cognition, to develop cognitive simulators for laparoscopic surgery. These simulators provide psychomotor skill training and offer the additional challenge of accomplishing cognitive tasks in realistic environments. A generic framework for design, development and evaluation of such simulators is described. The presented framework is generalizable and can be applied to different task domains. It is independent of the types of sensors, simulation environment and feedback mechanisms that the simulators use. A proof of concept of the framework is provided through developing a simulator that includes cognitive variations to a basic psychomotor task. The results of two pilot studies are presented that show the validity of the methodology in providing an effective evaluation and learning environments for surgeons.

After systematically searching online bibliographic databases, 34 relevant articles were located and included in the study. Following the categorization scheme proposed by [Dempsey, J., Rasmussen, K., & Lucassen, B. (1996). The instructional gaming literature: Implications and 99 sources. University of South Alabama, College of Education, Technical Report No. 96-1], those articles were grouped into the following four categories: (a) research, (b) development, (c) discussion and (d) theory. The overviewed articles suggest that electronic games present many potential benefits as educational tools for HE and PE, and that those games may improve young people's knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours in relation to health and physical exercise. Furthermore, the newly emerged physically interactive electronic games can potentially enhance young people's physical fitness, motor skills and motivation for physical exercise. The empirical evidence to support the educational effectiveness of electronic games in HE and PE is still rather limited, but the findings present a positive picture overall. The outcomes of the literature review are discussed in terms of their implications for future research, and can provide useful guidance to educators, practitioners and researchers in the areas of HE and PE, and to electronic game designers.

Research approach -- A serious game was made to train players in performing the primary triage procedure in a large scale crisis situation. With this game, a number of game design decisions are systematically varied and the subsequent corresponding effects on learning gains, mental model construction and perceived engagement empirically tested.  Findings -- While the game has been successful in training the triage procedure, the use of auditory guidance cues has led to worse mental model construction.  Research limitations/Implications -- A triage consists of mostly procedural information, and the empirically tested guidelines are only tested in one game, making the possibility of generalization to other games and game types unclear. In addition, only the effects with relatively short play times are measured.  Originality/Value -- Many serious games struggle to effectively convey their instructional material to the player. Conventional game design practice may even harm serious games; we seek to measure what works and what doesn't.  Take away message -- When designing a serious game, pay careful attention to how much you task the player, subtle changes can make a big difference.	code red (computer worm);cognition;game theory;mental model;status message (instant messaging);video game design	Erik D.

9ebe5d78163a91239f10c453d76082dfa329851d	teacher's perception in the classroom		The ability for a teacher to engage all students in active learning processes in classroom constitutes a crucial prerequisite for enhancing students achievement. Teachers’ attentional processes provide important insights into teachers’ ability to focus their attention on relevant information in the complexity of classroom interaction and distribute their attention across students in order to recognize the relevant needs for learning. In this context, mobile eye tracking is an innovative approach within teaching effectiveness research to capture teachers’ attentional processes while teaching. However, analyzing mobile eye-tracking data by hand is time consuming and still limited. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to enhance the impact of mobile eye tracking by connecting it with computer vision. In mobile eye tracking videos from an educational study using a standardized small group situation, we apply a state-ofthe-art face detector, create face tracklets, and introduce a novel method to cluster faces into the number of identity. Subsequently, teachers’ attentional focus is calculated per student during a teaching unit by associating eye tracking fixations and face tracklets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to combine computer vision and mobile eye tracking to model teachers’ attention while instructing.	cluster analysis;computer vision;eye tracking;face detection;map;powered speakers;process (computing)	Ömer Sümer;Patricia Goldberg;Kathleen Stürmer;Tina Seidel;Peter Gerjets;Ulrich Trautwein;Enkelejda Kasneci	2018	CoRR		artificial intelligence;machine learning;active learning;perception;human–computer interaction;fixation (psychology);eye tracking;computer science	AI	-70.93475024578966	-42.19998782334489	108085

Reliability tests, exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were used to analyze the data collected. The results show that the 5i design framework has a high level of reliability and validity. The study confirms the significance of this design framework in that the use of the five “i” elements is shown to be a critical and useful approach for teachers and course designers when designing a hybrid course structure. The results show that the effectiveness of both teaching and learning could be enhanced if the five “i” elements are incorporated when designing activities for students and when monitoring how the students participate, interact and are motivated when learning independently and how aware they are of their improved performance.

This study aimed to model the influence of teacher behaviors on learners’ self-directed technology use. A conceptual model of three types of teacher support (affection support, capacity support and behavior support) that were reported to influence students’ self-directed technology use for learning outside the classroom was generated based on interviews with 15 undergraduate foreign language learners. One hundred and sixty undergraduate foreign language learners were then surveyed to test the conceptual model. The path analysis of the survey data suggested that affection support influenced learner self-directed technology use through strengthened perceived usefulness, and that capacity support and behavior support influenced learner self-directed technology use through enhanced facilitating conditions and computer self-efficacy. The research findings highlight the importance of raising teachers’ awareness of the different roles they can play and of enhancing their abilities to perform a combination of the roles to promote learner self-directed use of technology for learning outside the classroom.	natural language processing;path analysis (statistics)	Chun Lai	2015	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2014.11.005	psychology;knowledge management;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-74.77863245670389	-40.74932386503274	108364

Advances in the application of information technology have lead to analysis systems for sports being integrated with match video allowing interactive video feedback to be provided in an efficient and flexible manner. Commercial video analysis packages are not only useful for analysing player behaviour in sport, but can also be used to analyse coach behaviour. The purpose of the current exercise was to implement a coach behaviour analysis system using the Dartfish package to allow a netball coach’s behaviour to be analysed so that the quantitative breakdown of the coach’s behaviour could be supported by video sequences of examples of behaviours of interest within a process of reflective practice. A split screen video displaying a close up view of the coach as well as a wider view of the coaching session was analysed. The coach found the video sequence feedback to be more useful than the quantitative information produced. The specific phases of reflective practice where the system could provide the most benefit are issue identification, experimentation and evaluation.	experiment;split screen (computer graphics);video content analysis	E.

An understanding of the factors that influence student satisfaction with online learning in a particular context can be used as an input to the appropriate design of learning environments, and for the provision of targeted support to students, with an aim to positively influence the student online learning experience. Following the mandatory inclusion of at least one wholly online unit of study in all undergraduate programs at Deakin University, a large ‘experiences of learning online’ (ELO) survey was undertaken to gauge students’ perceptions of studying in wholly online mode. A multivariate linear regression of all the questionnaire items was performed against an overall satisfaction item. Five items were found to significantly contribute to a model that explained approximately 70 % of reported student satisfaction. Factors that were found to positively influence student satisfaction with studying a wholly online unit primarily related to how confident they felt about their ability to communicate and learn online, having a clear understanding of what was required to succeed in the unit and how well they thought they were performing in the unit. Other results are also reported.	experience;general linear model;online machine learning	Stuart R. Palmer;Dale M. Holt	2009	J. Comp.

However, most educational apps are generic, off-the-shelf pieces of software that do not take into consideration the unique needs of nursing students. The proposed study will apply a user-centred design process to create a tailored mobile app for nursing students to learn and apply clinical skills in practice. The app will be piloted and evaluated to understand how nursing students use mobile technology in clinical settings to support their learning and educational needs.

More importantly, based on the recorded learning behaviors, this work discusses the significant correlation and cause-effect relation among science inquiry ability, learning time, and learning performance, and to explore the remarkable shift and difference in the learning behaviors of learners with different learning performance and inquiry abilities by using sequential pattern mining and lag sequential analysis. The research results show that inquiry ability, total learning time, and inquiry simulation experiment learning time present notably positive correlations with learning performance, with linear regression, showing the predictability of learning performance, on which inquiry simulation experiment learning time appears the most significant effect. Moreover, based on sequential pattern mining, learners with different learning performance do not show significant differences on the learning sequence of the entire inquiry learning course, but follow the inquiry learning process sequence in the curriculum design. Also, based on lag sequential analysis, learners with high learning performance and high inquiry ability would re-adjust the previous hypotheses after proceeding the simulation experiment of buoyancy, while learners with low learning performance and low inquiry ability are lack of such a key inquiry learning behavior.	boolean algebra;computer simulation;correlation does not imply causation;data mining;embedded system;experiment;sequential pattern mining;top-down and bottom-up design	Fang-Chun Lin;Chih-Ming Chen;Wen-Fang Wang	2017	2017 6th IIAI International Congress on Advanced Applied Informatics (IIAI-AAI)	10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2017.57	curriculum;web application;application programming interface;predictability;sequential pattern mining;lag;machine learning;computer science;artificial intelligence	ML	-76.26201131912319	-48.73063658110099	108741

These cases of mobile seamless learning have been drawn from diverse contexts including children’s STEM education, medical training, corporate orientation, and defense training. While each case is unique, there are underlying commonalities, including high levels of student engagement and satisfaction, and challenges to sustained deployment and replication by secondary instructional designers.	amiga reflections;seamless3d	David Metcalf;Max Jackson;David Rogers	2016		10.1007/978-981-287-113-8_6	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;artificial intelligence	HCI	-67.17192176082766	-38.50118149163343	108818

We propose new heuristics  for design that provide ways to explore the problem space of potential designs, and often lead to the generation of creative  solutions. We test whether Design Heuristics can be taught to novices, and whether doing so will improve the creativity of  their resulting designs.      In the present empirical study, we evaluate a set of six instructional heuristics, and validate their effectiveness with product  concepts generated by novice designers. Six hundred and seventy three drawings were created by 120 first-year college students  under four instructional conditions. Drawings were coded according to the use of heuristics, and scored for creativity. The  results showed that the most creative concepts emerged from the experimental conditions where heuristics were introduced.  Heuristics appeared to help the participants “jump” into a new problem space, resulting in more varied designs, and a greater  number of designs judged as more creative.

It has been shown that students find programming to be a difficult and complex cognitive task. Program visualizations have been shown to improve students' understanding, but most studies have been conducted in resource equipped classrooms, for example, in which students have personalized access to laptops. In this paper, we report findings from a two-group experimental study (N=60) in a resource constrained classroom with a single computer and mounted LCD. One group was taught with an interactive program visualization tool and the other with traditional chalk and blackboard approach. Analysis showed a statistically significant higher performance on a post-test for the program visualization group compared to the traditional group. This difference was seen regardless of students' visual/verbal learning style, leading to the conclusion that use of program visualization in large resource constrained classroom is an effective strategy to teach computer programming.	computer programming;computer science;experiment;interactive computing;laptop;personalization	Dipali D.

The exte nt to which the tools have benefited learning has remained unclear, as well as th e ways through which the benefit has been achieved. In our research, we ha ve c osen to vary type of students’ engagement and representation of the visualizatio n tool in a series of experiments, in order to investigate the phenomena taking place during individual viewing of visualizations. In the current experiment, we varied student engagement using two dif ferent tasks to perform during viewing; data flow task (D) and control flow task (C). R epresentation of visualization was varied by using two versions of the program a nimator; one with special images and animation, and one without. The results s how that while the distribution of visual attention of the participants performing task D was steady throughout the time, the participants performing task C focuse d their visual attention at the beginning almost solely on the code, and increased th eir visual attention to the other parts of the visualization on the second half of the viewing. The participants performing task D also benefited most from the to ol, at least regarding programming knowledge.	computer science;control flow;dataflow;experiment;program animation;terminal emulator	Seppo Nevalainen;Jorma Sajaniemi	2007			multimedia;perception;program animation;computer science	HCI	-71.56825781508662	-45.93691788730706	109355

This working paper considers the usefulness of Information Ecologies (Nardi & O’Day, 1999) as a conceptual lens with which to view mobile learning in the wild. The research project was conducted using an ethnographic approach and considers the learning processes and challenges that postgraduates students faced while collecting data during a geographic information systems field trip. Finding a suitable approach from which to examine the issues that arose and audiovisual data created has been challenging. Several approaches have been considered but none allowed the flexibility required. However information ecologies seems to fits this setting’s needs and this approach is currently being used for analysis to see what it can elucidate about the setting and processes within it. This paper will briefly outline the challenges faced in selecting a suitable conceptual framework for this novel setting, which observes learning with mobile devices. It summarizes the reasons why both constructivist and cognitive approaches were ill suited to this setting. The concept of information ecologies is explained and its limitations discussed. The paper concludes with a proposed route to harness this approach for this setting, and hence how it might benefit work in this area.

The article describes a blended learning solution that is based on face-to-face teaching and the use of streaming lecture videos as it has developed in connection with master studies in mathematical information technology. The particular focus of this article is on the use of lecture videos and the impacts of blended learning on participation in education and on learning outcomes. According to the results, lecture videos have become very popular among students. Moreover the use of lecture videos increases participation activeness, and the increase in participation has a positive impact on completion of courses. However, the use of lecture videos does not seem to have any clear-cut effect on grades obtained.

With the use of professors-friendly e-learning applications, NTU managed to achieve mass buy-in by the professors when the e-learning take-up rate is near 90% of the existing NTU course curriculum. As NTU moves on to celebrate the 3 year anniversary of e-learning experience, revolutionary measures were taken to come up with careful design considerations that aim to “humanize” elearning, i.e. make e-learning interactive and fun with active human collaborations. This includes the proliferation use of video talking head that synchronizes with the lecture presentation, and live audio-video delivery, text chat and document annotations of a lecture delivery.

It is used in several areas such as fraud detection, predicting client behavior, money market behavior, bankruptcy prediction. It can also help in establishing an educational ecosystem, which discovers useful knowledge, and assist educators to take proactive decisions to boost student performance and employability. This paper presents an empirical study that compares varied classification algorithms on two datasets of MCA (Masters in Computer Applications) students collected from various affiliated colleges of a reputed state university in India. One dataset includes only primary attributes, whereas other dataset is feeded with secondary psychometric attributes in it. The results showcase that solely primary academic attributes don’t lead to smart prediction accuracy of students’ employability, once they square measure within the initial year of their education. The study analyzes and stresses the role of secondary psychometric attributes for better prediction accuracy and analysis of students’ performance. Timely prediction and analysis of students’ performance can help Management, Teachers and Students to work on their gray areas for better results and employment opportunities.

A quantitative experiment was conducted to verify if social competition increases cognitive load, engagement, interest, and subsequently learning. The 115 students played an educational videogame, specifically designed for this experiment using Minecraft, in single, one-versus-one, small group, or classroom settings. The results show significantly higher cognitive load induced through social competition; lowered focused attention, instructional efficiency; and no higher situational interest. Additionally, increased learning in the solo condition could be observed. In contrast to these results, analysis of the actual perceived challenge resulted in positive correlations with engagement, situational interest, and retention knowledge. After the analysis, a detailed discussion of the impacts of social competition and various implications and future directions are provided. For example, it is argued that it is important to distinguish between the added gameplay mechanic of social competition and the perceived intrapersonal challenge this induces. Whereas the first might increase cognitive load due to the monitoring of additional game states, the latter might foster motivation and interest. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Engaging people in volunteer cloud computing is an obstacle which requires novel motivational methods, ideally online. Gamification is a method for increasing people motivation and changing their behaviour towards certain tasks in a non-game context. This position paper advocates that gamification is potentially a means to increase people engagement and retention in volunteer cloud computing projects. As an initial step to reach a systematic application of gamification in such projects, we study the relationship between game mechanics and different categories of volunteers and propose a preliminary mapping that relates these two aspects.	cloud computing;game mechanics;gamification;programming paradigm	Alimohammad Shahri;Mahmood Hosseini;Raian Ali;Fabiano Dalpiaz	2014	2014 IEEE/ACM 7th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing	10.1109/UCC.2014.97	planning;games;simulation;cloud computing;computer science;utility computing;multimedia;world wide web;collaboration	HPC	-65.26551265299186	-41.88624199940711	110039

The data from their participation were recorded, quantified and compared with their resulting grades on exams to ascertain to what degree measures of student participation were related to student learning. These measures of student participation were augmented by data from the university's student information system, which provided background information. Data was also collected from a number of surveys administered over the semester. Analyses of the data revealed some strong relationships between grades and the degree and quality of student participation. Moreover the behavior of students varied significantly when stratified by their incoming GPA. The empirical relationships reported here provide evidence-based affirmation that student participation is related to learning and suggests that the strength of GPA as a predictor of grades may be due more to a lack the study skills and/or motivation rather than cognitive ability.	cognition;kerrison predictor;online and offline;student information system;web application	Perry J.

Such methods traditionally involve the use of videotape, protocol analysis, critical incident analysis, etc. These methods require time consuming analyses and may be invasive. In addition, the data obtained through such methods represent a relatively small portion of the use of a system. An alternative approach is to record all user input and system output (i.e., log the user session), Such transcripts can be collected automatically and noninvasively over a long period of time. Unfortunately this produces voluminous amounts of data. There is therefore a need for tools and techniques that allow an evaluator to identify potential performance and usability problems from such data. It is hypothesized that repetition of user actions is an important indicator of potential user interface problems. This research reports on the use of the repetition indicator as a means of studying user session transcripts in the evaluation of user interfaces. The paper discusses the interactive tool constructed, the results of an extensive application of the technique in the evaluation of a large image-processing system, and extensions and refinements to the technique. Evidence suggests that the hypothesis is justified and that such a technique is convincingly useful.	experiment;human factors and ergonomics;image processing;input/output;interpreter (computing);usability;user experience;user interface	Antonio C.

The challenges of formative assessment are the requirements for regular feedback and more student engagement in the learning process. This paper suggests integrating peer-to-peer assessment in mathematics education, using mobile tablet technology. The students are engaged in providing feedback to each other and the technology allows for fast and regular feedback provision. The paper presents the results of experiments with undergraduate engineering students, using iPad tablets and a learning management system. It is shown that mobile tablet technology can greatly contribute to the integration of peer-to-peer assessment into mathematics education; and providing peer-feedback is a practical approach to formative assessment.	experiment;feedback;learnability;least mean squares filter;peer-to-peer;requirement;software portability;tablet computer;ipad	Ghislain Maurice Norbert Isabwe;Frank Reichert;Svein Olav Nyberg	2012			simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-71.99177127959622	-39.67369657801506	110413

This study examined the role of mental rotation (MR) and verbal ability, together with that of cognitive styles in map learning. As regards cognitive styles, the traditional distinction between verbalizers and visualizers has been taken into account, together with a more recent distinction between two styles of visualization: spatial and object. One hundred and seven participants filled in two questionnaires on cognitive styles: the Verbalizer–Visualizer Questionnaire (Richardson in J Ment Imag 1:109–125, 1977) and the Object-Spatial Imagery Questionnaire (Blajenkova et al. in Appl Cogn Psych 20:239–263, 2006), performed MR and verbal tests, learned two maps, and were then tested for their recall. It was found that MR ability and cognitive styles played a role in predicting map learning, with some distinctions within cognitive styles: verbal style favoured learning of one of the two maps (the one rich in verbal labels), which in turn was disadvantaged by the adoption of spatial style. Conversely, spatial style predicted learning of the other map, rich in visual features. The discussion focuses on implications for cognitive psychology and everyday cognition.	cognition;fill;imagery;map;mental disorders	Francesca Pazzaglia;Angelica Moè	2013	Cognitive Processing	10.1007/s10339-013-0572-2	psychology;cognitive psychology;developmental psychology;cognitive style;social psychology	HCI	-71.37067092520458	-46.23430584626944	110440

To accommodate with the characteristic of portable devices, the system was designed for low power consumption and low learning cost. With the help of the system, a teacher can receive instant feedback from the students and check students' performance at any time. The students can actively participate in the class and answer the teacher's questions in an easier way. The system architecture, security issues, and key techniques on establishing the communication between cell phones and computers using Bluetooth on Java 2 platform were also explained in the paper.	bluetooth;computer;java;mobile device;mobile phone;systems architecture	Yanhui Zhang;Wu Li;Yingzi Fu	2007	Third International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2007)	10.1109/ICNC.2007.64	embedded system;real-time computing;mobile search;object exchange;computer science;distributed computing;mobile computing	Robotics	-69.40549468395147	-40.40442938787521	110604

With the support of technology, innovative methodologies that are more effective and enjoyable can be implemented into vocabulary teaching. In this particular context, there seems to be a lack of technology integration in vocabulary teaching because of teachers being untrained and/or not provided with the necessary technology. The aim of this study was to foster vocabulary development through the implementation of Vine vocabulary videos in English vocabulary learning. An embedded mixed methods design was employed to collect necessary data for analysis. The results of the post-test revealed that the practice of Vine vocabulary videos was effective and improved participants’ vocabulary. The content analysis of the semi-structured interviews carried out with participants indicated that they had enjoyed the whole process and found it very motivating and effective. This study claims that adopting smartphones into a vocabulary course will enable English as a foreign language learners to expand and consolidate their vocabulary learning outside the classroom, engage them in a collaborative learning environment, practice and use the language being learnt and share their knowledge and experiences with their peers.	embedded system;enlightenment foundation libraries;experience;semiconductor industry;smartphone;vocabulary	M.

In each game, the concepts were presented in the form of tangible puzzles, customized to a difficulty level based on student capability. The games were integrated into a single virtual game world, and a fantasy story was used to help build a compelling experience. Five Year 6 classes were used to evaluate the game over four weeks. Three of the classes were provided with the games, and two served as a control. Both the intervention and control groups also covered fractions in class as part of the regular teaching program, consisting of instructor led content combined with access to online resources and activities. Participants completed a diagnostic test before the trial, and again at the end, designed to assess competence in the fractions concepts targeted by the game. Results show that on average students who had access to the game in addition to the regular teaching scored higher than control group students. In particular, looking at just students who started with a lower level of fractions skills, greater improvement was seen in those that had access to the game.	alpha compositing	Martin Masek;J.

This study is aimed at gaining further insights into the daily support practices of e-tutors. Seventy-six e-tutors from 17 different European countries were invited to fill in an online questionnaire to evaluate collaborative activities, and to answer yes/no-questions regarding their intervention to support these collaborative activities. A cluster analysis identified two profiles of e-tutors according to the importance ascribed to collaborative activities, and to the number of times they intervened to foster such activities. The cluster validation revealed a difference between experienced and inexperienced European e-tutors in their support of online collaboration: e-tutors with experience considered specific cognitive activities to be more important for effective online collaboration, and they seemed to be more familiar in detecting and adequately intervening to avoid dysfunctional social phenomena. Thus, experience in supporting online collaboration seems to be a useful precondition for successfully intervening to stimulate necessary learning activities and to avoid dysfunctional collaborative activities. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, how can sensors be integrated into classrooms to help instructors find out students' reading concentration rates and thus better increase learning effectiveness? The aim of the current study was to develop a reading concentration monitoring system for use with e-books in an intelligent classroom and to help instructors find out the students' reading concentration rates. The proposed system uses three types of sensor technologies, namely a webcam, heartbeat sensor, and blood oxygen sensor to detect the learning behaviors of students by capturing various physiological signals. An artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization approach is applied to the data gathered from these sensors to help instructors understand their students' reading concentration rates in a classroom learning environment.

The system facilitates a structured on-line negotiation process. It is written in JAVA language and can be accessed easily through the Web. The system has been tested in comparison with face-to-face meetings in simulated labour union-management negotiations. The test shows that CBSS was viewed as a valid alternative to face-to-face negotiation, although bargaining processes supported by CBSS were perceived to be slower than face-to-face negotiation.	java;online and offline;world wide web	Yufei Yuan;Joseph B.

That is to say, students often handle contents transmitted from far side in front of computer by themselves. In the meanwhile students have to determine """"what to learn"""" and """"where to go"""" in each learning unit (or learning node), so, it relatively consumes mental and physical efforts during learning that results in cognitive overload, therefore, students are easy to feel anxious about e-learning content due to said cognitive overload. Purpose of this paper is to collect the learning behavior trace during e-learning activity, and then use decision tree ID 3 to discover strenuous place in the hyperlink of elearning in order to avoid anxiety of e-learning.

An experimental teaching is carried out to prove the feasibility and effectiveness of a new way of vocabulary teaching-the integrated approach. The higher scores of the experimental class on the immediate tests and the smaller loss of retention on the delayed test appear to indicate that the integrated approach leads to a more solid embedding, better long term retention and active use of the words.	experiment;vocabulary	Guoqiang Zhang	2009	JCIT		computer science	ML	-74.31736182396142	-45.815333452308074	111251

The proposed method stems from the need of interactivity and the desire of cooperation in cooperative learning. Based on the social networks of students, PS provides members of the groups to learn from or mimic learners who have good relationships with them. As such, the learning achievement can be raised. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can provide a better learning result, especially when compared to grouping at random, because it enables low achievers to find more appropriate collaborators. More precisely, the experimental results show that the learning achievement of approximately 17.64% of the students is increased. The average score is increased from 79 to 91.9 while the standard deviation is decreased from 16.9 to 13.6.	advice (programming);complexity;experiment;high-level programming language;interactivity;social network;dialog	Po-Jen Chuang;Ming-Chao Chiang;Chu-Sing Yang;Chun-Wei Tsai	2012	Educational Technology & Society		psychology;mathematics education;questionnaire;programming;cooperative learning;social science;network analysis;social influence;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;teaching method;sociology;management;world wide web;statistics;pedagogy;social network	AI	-75.63952026910746	-42.51308011323501	111448

Mobile learning is among the many computerized activities that can be performed using mobile devices. As the volume of accessible important information on university websites continues to increase, students may face difficulties in accessing important information from a large dataset. This study introduces an algorithmic framework for data reduction that is built on optimized-memory map–reduce algorithm for mobile learning. The goal of this method is to generate meaningful recommendations to a collection of students in the easiest and fastest way by using a recommender system. Through an experi‐ ment, the proposed method has demonstrated significant improvements in data size reduction up to 77 %. Such improvements are greater than those that are achieved using alternate methods.	accessibility;algorithm;fastest;memory map;mobile device;recommender system;smartphone;tablet computer	Mamo M.

The query is done through the integrated use of an adaptive search engine (ASE) and QR codes. The QR-Code are used to label objects in real environments of cultural matter (eg: museums, art galleries, archaeological sites, etc.). These objects can then be analyzed in more detail during a real learning activity (situated learning and authentic learning). The knowledge base of the virtual learning environment (VLE), is interrogated through a mobile device (smartphone or tablet) which, through an appropriate decoder software, interprets the instructions contained in a QR label previously positioned on the object actually observed by the learner (eg, during a visit to a museum). ASE combines to the data contained in the QR-Code those relating to the user who performs the query (previously recognized via the log-in on the e-Learning platform), therefore, extracts information about the observed object, adapting to the profile of the user-learner. With the help of these tools the learner can expand his real learning experience, while interacting with a virtual learning environment. In this way, situated and authentic learning activities can be upgraded and virtualized, maturing a significative educational experience with the use of intuitive and user friendly digital tools.

66ae6519afde8f47be650fd0eea79fdb5be0df47	on active sharing and responses to joint attention bids by children with autism in a loosely coupled collaborative play environment		Social reputation management is essential in social interactions and believed to be mediated by the intrinsic motive to preserve and improve one's social reputation. Moreover, these activities are often only loosely structured. Prior studies revealed that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are less sensitive to social reputation than their typically developing (TD) peers, which might explain their lack of reciprocity and desire to engage in social activities, despite that their brain functions that underpin social interaction remain intact with delayed development. Little is known about their reciprocity in loosely coupled collaboration environment where Free Play (FP, rather than Enforced Collaboration, or EC) is imposed. Our study in the long run aims at addressing this issue by engaging ASD children in a collaborative puzzle game where each child has a private work-space. The present study focuses on the design and development of such an application unfolded through a series of small-scale pilot studies with Chinese children at three different autism centers in the city. Preliminary qualitative and in-game quantitative results showed that their skills in reciprocity, active sharing aiming to completing their own task, (selective) initiating and responding to joint attention bids have satisfying been remedied and optimized in such a loosely structured play environment. There are two uniqueness of our study; one lies in the design of a loosely coupled collaborative play environment; another is to quantitatively measure some joint attention skills through children's behavioral actions.	interaction;loose coupling;reputation management;virtual world	Tiffany Ya Tang;Pinata Winoto;Aonan Guan	2017		10.1145/3078072.3091988	uniqueness;reciprocity (social psychology);autism;social relation;joint attention;autism spectrum disorder;reputation;psychology;social psychology	HCI	-63.653366913517154	-41.74285170076481	112575

Students were able to self-select their favored method of instruction by using principles of observation research: full participant (on a computer at home); participant-observer (on laptop in class); and observer-participant (in class observing and participating, no laptop). Davis (1986) Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Rogers' (1995) Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) were used to guide the creation of a survey instrument utilizing Google Drive s Form tool. Several of the TAM model s constructs were used: perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU), behavioral intention to use, and attitude towards use of the software (Wimba). It was determined real-time, synchronous instruction within a self-selection of augmented reality seems to offer much for the student.	augmented reality;collaborative software;computer-mediated reality;google drive;ibm systems network architecture;ibm tivoli access manager;laptop;real-time transcription;usability	Martin Sivula	2013	eLearn Magazine	10.1145/2524222.2524588	psychology;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;sociology;management;world wide web;li;synchronous learning;pedagogy	HCI	-75.71022619752463	-39.55833294741909	112700

In this paper, we present two different approaches solving this task. Both approaches are validated on 138 courses which were offered to students of the Faculty of Informatics of Masaryk University between the years of 2010 and 2013. The first approach is based on classification and regression algorithms that search for patterns in study-related data and also data about students' social behavior. We prove that students’ social behavior characteristics improve prediction for a quarter of courses. The second approach is based on collaborative filtering techniques. We predict the final grades based on previous achievements of similar students. The results show that both approaches reached similar average results and can be beneficially utilized for student final grade prediction. The first approach reaches significantly better results for courses with a small number of students. In contrary, the second approach achieves significantly better results for mathematical courses. We also identified groups of courses for which we are not able to predict the grades reliably. Finally, we are able to correctly identify half of all failures (that constitute less than a quarter of all grades) and predict the final grades only with the error of one degree in the grade scale.	algorithm;collaborative filtering;data mining;informatics;statistical classification	Hana Bydzovská	2016			simulation;regression;biological classification;computer science;data science;collaborative filtering;data mining	ML	-76.5751253476575	-51.25063482180315	113605

Therefore, the students should study the learning materials by themselves. Our previous work suggested an interactive learning process in order to improve the students learning motivation and the self-learning time. To improve the progress speed of a lecture and the efficiency of the self-learning, we proposed an active learning system (ALS) using mobile devices. Moreover, we performed experimental evaluation of our ALS and showed that the proposed ALS can improve student self-learning and concentration. However, the proposed ALS could not increase the examination pass rate of the students even if the self-learning time was increased. To solve this problem, we propose to improve the group discussion system of ALS. In this paper, we performed experimental evaluation of the improved group discussion system of ALS.

b867773e243dc91cc6e254cfbffb09e2c369c3fa	an overview of the amuse social gaming platform		This paper presents an overview of the novel platform AMUSE (Agent-based Multi-User Social Environment), an agent-based social gaming platform that leverages the power of industrial-strength agent technologies. The core need that motivated the initial work on AMUSE was to provide game developers with a solid tool targeting common horizontal issues in social gaming, like user management and game state management, for games with synchronous and asynchronous interactions. AMUSE fulfills such a need by means of industrial-strength agent technology. Actually, AMUSE is not only a development framework that can be effectively used to implement prototypes and small-scale games with just a few concurrent players. Rather, it is thought as a PaaS (Platform as a Service) tool that enables service provides, like game portals and community portals, to relief game factories from the burden of implementing horizontal functionality that are common to a large set of games. This paper is a first presentation of the work on AMUSE and it starts framing AMUSE into the scope of social gaming.

Extensive attention has been given in literature to the success and effectiveness of online learning programs. Value theory suggests that human perceived value is a critical construct in investigating what is important to individuals. However, very limited attention has been given in literature to the role of users’ perceived value of learning activities in educational settings. Scholars suggest that additional studies on learning activities are needed in order to progress the current knowledge of the use of information systems in education. Therefore, this study investigated issues related to learners’ perceived value by uncovering the critical value factors (CVFs) of online learning activities. Participants in this study included 209 graduate students attending an online learning program. This study extended the first phase done in a prior research to uncover the CVFs of online learning activities. Results of this research study produced five reliable CVFs: (a) collaborative, social, and passive learning activities; (b) formal communication activities; (c) formal learning activities; (d) logistic activities; and (e) printing activities. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

c4e6b2049bf037bf7079e26e85df0c9abd499262	automatic detection of learning styles: state of the art	learning styles;educational systems;user model	A learning style describes the attitudes and behaviors, which determine an individual’s preferred way of learning. Learning styles are particularly important in educational settings since they may help students and tutors become more self-aware of their strengths and weaknesses as learners. The traditional way to identify learning styles is using a test or questionnaire. Despite being reliable, these instruments present some problems that hinder the learning style identification. Some of these problems include students’ lack of motivation to fill out a questionnaire and lack of self-awareness of their learning preferences. Thus, over the last years, several approaches have been proposed for automatically detecting learning styles, which aim to solve these problems. In this work, we review and analyze current trends in the field of automatic detection of learning styles. We present the results of our analysis and discuss some limitations, implications and research gaps that can be helpful to researchers working in the field of learning styles.	enumerated type;experiment;self-awareness;sensor	Juan Feldman;Ariel Monteserin;Analía Amandi	2014	Artificial Intelligence Review	10.1007/s10462-014-9422-6	collaborative learning;cooperative learning;user modeling;computer science;knowledge management;machine learning;learning sciences;active learning;open learning;synchronous learning	AI	-76.46033897640793	-43.07381610626848	115177

Students’ Web browsing on these laptops (including: URLs, dates, and times) was recorded 24 hours/day, 7 days/week in a log file by a proxy server during most of a semester (about 15 weeks). For each student, browsing behavior was quantified and then correlated with academic performance. The emergence of statistically significant results suggests that quantitative characteristics of browsing behavior—even prior to examining browsing content—can be useful predictors of meaningful behavioral outcomes. Variables such as Number of browsing sessions and Length of browsing sessions were found to correlate with students’ final grades; the valence and magnitude of these correlations were found to interact with Course (i.e., whether student was enrolled in the Communication or Computer Science course), Browsing Context (i.e., setting in which browsing took place: during class, on the wireless network between classes , or at home) and Gender. The implications of these findings in relation to previous studies of laptop use in education settings are discussed.	access network;browsing;computer science;emergence;internet;laptop;level of measurement;mobile computing;proxy server;server (computing)	Michael Grace-Martin;Geri Gay	2001	Educational Technology & Society		simulation;computer science;operating system;wireless network;statistical significance;multimedia;mobile computing;world wide web	Security	-67.14363463953016	-49.56670787720266	115368

bf54379542e1c5ea3c8b775e8225f0e4ef970c80	evaluation of physical education multimedia teaching for data assimilation		The evaluation of physical education (PE) multimedia teaching refers to the prediction of physical education multimedia teaching quality in the absence of initial multimedia teaching information. Therefore, the evaluation method of PE multimedia teaching based on unsupervised feature learning has achieved good performance. But, its quality prediction accuracy decreases significantly with the reduction of the feature dimension. In order to overcome this defect, the author combines the active learning strategy with the unsupervised feature learning and proposes a kind of data assimilation framework to improve the discriminability of the representation of teaching features. The results show that the proposed method can enhance the accuracy of teaching quality prediction by 8%. Experiments show that, when feature dimension is relatively low, the proposed method can improve the teaching quality prediction accuracy by 8% compared with the method based on unsupervised feature learning. At the same time, the performance of the proposed method is superior to that of the other physical education multimedia teaching evaluation methods at present.	data assimilation	Piyaporn Pitaktunsakul	2018	iJOE		engineering;active learning;multimedia;physical education;data assimilation;feature dimension;feature learning	DB	-75.7563014759354	-50.64476469196348	115571

Instructional design usually begins with the specification of behavioural objectives or intended learning outcomes. The field of educational psychology has long been sensitive to the desirability of establishing learning objectives for instruction. Computer-processable learning outcomes in the motor skill domain, however, seem to have remained the silent partner of learning outcomes in both the cognitive and affective domains. This paper presents a conceptual model of learning outcomes in the motor skill domain for the implementation of CBST. The heart of this model is to treat athlete's skill as a contextualized space of capability either actual or potential. Rowing is the sport chosen as the study domain.	computer;humans	Yulita Hanum P.

4e45ce39d96a25cc81de95e06ed9e8a7c2597ac4	some thoughts on using computers to teach argumentation.		Argumentation has become a “hot topic” of AI research – especially outside the United States. The last year or two have seen AI Journal special issues devoting more than 300 pages to argumentation in AI, a new series of conferences on Computational Models of Argument, and a recent Dagstuhl Perspectives Seminar on Theory and Practice of Argumentation Systems, focusing on the future of argumentation research for the semantic web, multiagent systems, social networks, and decision support in application areas. For some time before this, however, a small group of researchers has focused on using computer technology to teach humans argumentation skills, either in general or in application areas such as law, ethics, and the sciences. This research has yielded intellectual products including computational models of argumentation, techniques for integrating argumentation into human computer interfaces via argument diagrams or by engaging students in argument-making, techniques for assessing how well students learn argumentation skills, and many interesting questions. This talk surveys selected argumentation tutoring research and addresses the following questions: (1) Why teach argumentation? Why use computers to teach argumentation? (2) For purposes of teaching argumentation, what argument features or patterns should be represented and at what grain-sizes? (3) How can intelligent tutoring systems adapt to teaching argumentation in ill-defined domains/tasks where there often is no one right answer? What kind of feedback can they provide? (4) How useful are argumentation diagrams as teaching aids or as diagnostic tools? (5) How successfully have computers engaged students in making and responding to arguments? (6) How can the learning of argumentation skills be assessed objectively? (7) How successful have intelligent tutoring systems been in teaching humans argumentation skills? How can they do better? Answers to these questions have ramifications not only for the teaching of argumentation with computers but for the future direction and impact of AI research on argumentation. 17 Proceedings of the Twenty-First International FLAIRS Conference (2008)	agent-based model;argument map;argumentation framework;artificial intelligence;computation;computational model;decision support system;diagram;feedback;human computer;multi-agent system;semantic web;social network	Kevin D.

Eighty-three (N = 83) undergraduate students were randomly assigned to either a control or prompt and feedback condition and engaged in a 1-h learning session with MetaTutor to learn about the human circulatory system. Process and product data were collected from all participants prior to, during, and following the session. MANCOVA analyses revealed that students in the prompt and feedback condition deployed more SRL strategies and spent more time viewing relevant science material compared to students in the control condition. Results also revealed a significant interaction between achievement goals and condition on achievement outcomes, such that learners adopting a dominant performance-approach demonstrated higher achievement in the prompt and feedback condition. Findings are discussed in relation to the role of motivation in self-regulated learning within computer-based learning environments. Implications for the design of pedagogical agents are also discussed. ! 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study first defines learning characteristics of problem-solving digital games and their corresponding cognitive levels, then designs and develops a problem-solving game in accordance to the criteria. Tasks in the game context are inter-related to each other so that players need to critically and creatively think about problem solutions. Learners' task analyses are performed to observe four elementary learners' gaming paths, behaviors and cognitive activities, individually and collaboratively. System documentation, video recording, researcher observation, and interviews are conducted to analyze learners' learning strategies and their cognitive performance during the gaming process. The research results show that different collaboration models, strategies, as well as atmospheres can greatly influence the performances of its members. In collaboration, each individual can have better learning effectiveness. Participants in positive and favorable collaborative relationships, regardless of the members' individual temperaments, can have much better cognitive performances. While group members are inter-dependent and have positive interactions, even slow-achievers have the possibility and opportunity to take the lead.	problem solving	Ju-Ling Shih;Bai-Jiun Shih;Chun-Chao Shih;Hui-Yu Su;Chien-Wen Chuang	2010	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2010.04.009	psychology;collaborative learning;cooperative learning;educational technology;error-driven learning;simulation;effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance;experiential learning;learning sciences;multimedia;active learning;communication;pedagogy	HCI	-73.8339334846879	-42.456792501490625	116505

The following two research questions were postulated to address the research purpose: i) What are the conditions that engage children with mobile apps? ii) How does learning take place during children’s engagement with mobile apps? The study was carried out using a qualitative approach by observing young children’s interactions when using mobile apps. A total of 18 pre-schoolers aged 4-6 years participated in the study. The observation sessions were video-recorded to unobtrusively observe the participants’ interactions with 20 selected mobile apps. The data were analysed using a thematic approach to examining children’s emergent behaviours when engaging with mobile apps to identify, generate code, and produce themes. The findings demonstrated three prominent conditions of children’s learning engagement: collective sensory experience, emotional expression, and verbal expression. It is evident from the study that learning in this environment takes place through cognitive, psychomotor-based, and affective means. This study provides significant insight on how young children engage with mobile apps to articulate their design implications as well as general guidelines for selecting quality mobile apps to encourage engagement in home, classroom, and library use.	cognition;emergence;interaction;mobile app;web literacy	Abdullah Noorhidawati;S.

In order to address these difficulties, a series of learning activities called Computer Science Unplugged was developed by Bell et al. [3]. These activities expose young people to central concepts in CS in an entertaining way, without requiring a computer. Using questionnaires and interviews, we examined the effect of the activities on middle-school students' views of CS, specifically, on their views of: (a) the nature of CS; (b) the characteristics of computer scientists and work in CS; (c) the variety of employment in CS. The results indicate that 'although the students generally understood what CS is' they perceived the computer as the essence of CS and not primarily as a tool, contrary to the intention of the CS Unplugged activities. We suggest additions to the activities intended to increase the change in the views of CS that students have.	cs games;cs-cipher;computer science;computer scientist;emoticon	Rivka Taub;Mordechai Ben-Ari;Michal Armoni	2009		10.1145/1562877.1562912	attitude;computer science;multimedia;view	HCI	-71.6670775710961	-43.74285868367439	116681

The study aimed to understand student and teacher experiences and changes in behavior while engaged in the digital media-making process. Data was collected at a pen-based digital media-making summer program held at Pepperdine University’s Los Angeles and Ventura County campuses. After transcribing and coding raw data using grounded theory, the authors generated causal loop maps. The study indicated that the production of videos depends on both the students’ and teachers’ engagement in the digital media-making process. Active engagement of teachers and students improved the quality of the learning environment. The use of system dynamics allowed us to see the flaws and unique aspects within the digital making process.	digital media;system dynamics	Moses Okumu;Hiroo Kato;Nishesh Chalise	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-31193-7_14	systems engineering;knowledge management;process management	SE	-73.8021264668611	-38.236579804372774	116708

In this study, we have developed a personalized ubiquitous multi-device certification tutoring system (PUMDCTS) based on “Bloom’s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives,” and applied it to help students obtain HTML certificates. The system can help students learn more effectively and acquire certificates more successfully through the mechanism of personalized strengthening practice and the function of the learning diagnostic light table. The experimental results show that, compared with the control group, the experimental group has significantly better cognitive test scores. Meanwhile, from the interviews, it was also found that the students generally believed that the multi-device design makes it more convenient for them to use the system, and the learning diagnostic light table can make them more aware of their learning status.	bloom;bloom's taxonomy;experiment;html;light table;national supercomputer centre in sweden;personalization;public key certificate;web design	Gwo-Haur Hwang;Beyin Chen;Cin-Wei Huang	2016	Educational Technology & Society		educational technology;pedagogy;computer science;knowledge management;certification;professional certification;the internet;professional certification (computer technology);usability;instructional design;bloom's taxonomy	HCI	-77.15863002554151	-43.09806862326272	116717

Analysis of the test data of twenty-seven participants showed that learning was greatest in the Sound version. Results of the interviews indicated that those working with sound could focus their attention on the critical information needed to make successful interpretations. Participants working in the Text and Sound/Text versions of the system, however did not learn as much and stated their displeasure with reading so much text from the screen, despite the presence of three graphical browsers. Recommendations for revisions to the materials and test items arc suggested. 0 I997 Elsevier Science Ltd BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Hypermedia is a relatively recent philosophy of representative and information access [l]. ‘l$e information stored by a hypermedia system can be made to encompass one or more conventional media including text, graphics and sound. Evaluations of hyper(visual)media augmented with auditory prompting has become common in the literature. Austin [2] for example recently compared thiee interactive media formats in an RTV/DVI computer-mediated lesson with twelve military personael. Davidson [3] evaluated versions of a reading program in primary-school classrooms. Schmidt 141 compared two versions of an interactive hypermedia system. Torgesen [5] evaluated three versions of a computer program to improve sight-word recognition in seventeen learning disabled children. Mann [6] evaluated three versions of a structured tutorial that used temporal sound, and Bridgman [7] evaluated versions of interactive voice in a Computer-Based Training unit. Despite this capability and researbh, inappropriate presentation methods can still exacerbate or compound the problem of forgetting or ignoring critical information from a computer interface. This pilot study compared three versions of a hypermedia system to determine the effects of the presentation modality (Text, Sound/Text, Sound) on attention to critical information, and to make recommendations for revisions to the hypermedia system. This system embodied the integration of elements from both structural and functional learning models [8-121. The structural model emphasiged the storage and retrieval of information from human memory, and the functional model required the participant’s personal involvement in knowledge creation.	auditory processing disorder;computer program;digital visual interface;function model;graphical user interface;graphics;hypermedia;information access;interactive media;modality (human–computer interaction);recommender system;schmidt decomposition;test data	Bruce L.

In the context of developing materials well-suited for users with reading disorders, one solution has been to develop materials especially targeted at dyslexic users. However, how are the attitudes among users with dyslexia towards adaptation? In this paper, we report the findings from qualitative interviews with 20 adults with dyslexia. The main finding was that they were sceptical towards adapted products, among others because it made them “feel stupid” and because the adapted format affected the reading experience negatively. In this paper we argue to instead work within the universal design paradigm, trying to develop products and services usable by all people, thus reducing the need for particular user groups to utilise “special solutions”.

Participants came from various science departments in a national university in Taiwan, of which tenwere earth-science majors (ES) and the other 11 were assigned to the non-earth-science group (NES). Eye movement indicators, such as total time spent on the interest zone, fixation count, total fixation duration, percent time spent in zone, etc., were abstracted to indicate their visual attention. One-way ANOVA as well as t-test analysis was applied to find the associations between the eye movement data and the students’ background as well as different formats of PPT slides. The results showed that the students attended significantly more to the text zones on the PPT slides and the narrations delivered by the instruction. Nevertheless, the average fixation duration, indicating the average information processing time, was longer on the picture zones. In general, the ES students displayed higher visual attention than the NES students to the text zones, but few differences were found for the picture zones. When the students viewed those slides containing scientific hypotheses, the difference in attention distributions between the text and pictures reduced. Further analyses of fixation densities and saccade paths showed that the ES students were better at information decoding and integration. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Optimal learning effects in such an environment require a high quality of students reasoning activities. It is not straightforward, however, which type of modeling tool will be most helpful to students' reasoning. In order to identify the effects of different tools, students working with two common types of tools were compared to a normative description of the modeling process. Also the influence of reasoning activities on the achieved modeling result was examined. Different modeling tools did induce significantly different reasoning activities. Students working with a graphical representation designed more experiments with their own model, formulated more qualitative hypotheses, and spent more time evaluating their own model than students working with a textual representation. Results also indicate that many students have serious difficulties performing this task in a systematic manner. The paper concludes with suggestions for support students might need.

cca47916420ff0a3800bb32ef216586f46f9252e	a 3d serious game for dental learning in higher education		Natural User Interfaces and advanced displays can be combined to provide rich learning experiences. In this paper, we present the development and validation of a serious game that combines autostereoscopy and Natural User Interfaces for dental learning in higher education. The game includes two modes: neutral and real-world background. A comparative study to check different aspects was carried out. A total of 33 dentistry students participated in the study. From the results, the students increased significantly their knowledge about teeth morphology. Most of the students preferred the neutral background for dental learning. The real-world background was identified as being more suitable for leisure activities.	autostereoscopy;galaxy morphological classification;gesture recognition;interaction;mathematical morphology;natural user interface;stereopsis;stereoscopy;user experience	David Rodríguez-Andrés;Maria del Carmen Juan Lizandra;Ramón Mollá Vayá;Magdalena Méndez-López	2017	2017 IEEE 17th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)	10.1109/ICALT.2017.29	autostereoscopy;multimedia;visualization;computer science;higher education;user interface	HCI	-69.1527959576174	-42.91013915770707	117728

However, due to the great amount and diversity of users, some kind of adaptation is needed. In this paper we will present a user model constructed from users' interaction data and specially designed to provide a general framework for adaptation tasks in an open web-based adaptive collaborative environment. The user model proposed should be explicit and flexible and to this end we claim that a combination of knowledge based and machine learning techniques is adequate. Finally we will briefly present the adaptation tasks proposed up to now and the results obtained from a first preliminary empirical evaluation.

7af0cd9d0a64b7ca1560c6880a152eb97aaa4867	towards the development of a generalized intelligent framework for tutoring (gift)		Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have been shown to be effective tools for one-to-one tutoring in a variety of well-defined domains (e.g., mathematics, physics) and offer distinct advantages over traditional classroom teaching/training. In examining the barriers to the widespread use of ITS, the time and cost for designing and author-ing ITS have been widely cited as the primary obstacles. Contributing factors to time and cost include a lack of standards and minimal opportunities for reuse. This paper explores motivations for the development of a Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT). GIFT was conceived to meet challenges to: author ITS and ITS components, offer best instructional practices across a variety of training tasks (e.g., cognitive, affective, and psychomotor), and provide a testbed for analyzing the effect of tutoring technologies (tools and methods).	intelligent systems for molecular biology;one-to-one (data model);testbed	Robert A.

47f5fb81984273fed433da6573898ecc8edd4a47	can we get better assessment from a tutoring system compared to traditional paper testing? can we have our cake (better assessment) and eat it too (student learning during the test)?	assessment in learning system;dynamic assessment;learning system;student learning;tutoring system;student performance	Dynamic assessment (DA) has been advocated as an interactive approach to conduct assessments to students in the learning systems as it can differentiate student proficiency at a finer grained level. Sternberg and others have been pursuing an alternative to IQ tests. They proposed to give students tests to see how much assistance it takes a student to learn a topic; and to use as a measure of their learning gain. They referred to this as dynamic assessment. It was suggested that this assisting-while-testing procedure could be done well by computer. To researchers in the intelligent tutoring system community, it comes as no surprise that measuring how much assistance a student needs to complete a task successfully is probably a good indicator of this lack of knowledge. However, a cautionary note is that conducting DA takes more time than simply administering regular test items to students. In this paper, we report a study analyzing 40-minutes data of 1,392 students from two school years using educational data mining techniques. We compare two conditions: one contains only practice items without intervention while the other condition allows students to seek for help when they encounter difficulties. The result suggests that for the purpose of assessing student performance, it is more efficient for students to take DA than just having practice items.	blended threat;educational data mining;word lists by frequency	Mingyu Feng;Neil T.

af991775573fb3ca4f10ec94fd35a48d871ae12d	engagement and retention in vet moocs and online courses: a systematic review of literature from 2013 to 2017		Building stronger structures that encourage deeper levels of learner engagement and retention in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is of significant interest to teachers of Vocational Education and Training (VET). Previous literature on MOOCs is predominately occupied with university sector developments and alternative educational contexts such as VET are neglected. This systematic review of literature from 2013 to 2017 evaluated learner engagement and retention in university MOOCs and VET online courses to identify functional approaches that could be implemented into VET MOOCs. Ten databases were searched, eliciting 1950 papers, which were then screened. Data from 30 university MOOCs and 8 VET online delivery articles that met the inclusion and quality assurance criteria were analysed. Four key themes and eleven component categories emerged repeatedly across the literature. Analysis revealed six functional approaches relevant to VET MOOCs. The findings suggested that coupling these functional approaches into VET MOOCs can improve learner retention and promote engagement. The implications for practice and further research are presented.	massive open online course;systematic review	Rachael M. Paton;Andrew E.

However, these tools focus mostly on high-level aspects and requirements and do not help understand how such high-level requirements can be concretely satisfied. In this paper, we present a conceptual model, called Activity Theory-based Model of Serious Games (ATMSG), that aims to fill this gap. ATMSG supports a systematic and detailed representation of educational serious games, depicting the ways that game elements are connected to each other throughout the game, and how these elements contribute to the achievement of the desired pedagogical goals. Three evaluation studies indicate that ATMSG helped participants, particularly those with gaming experience, identify and understand the roles of each component in the game and recognize the game’s educational objectives.	archive;diagram;high- and low-level;retain;requirement;social structure;software repository;theory	Maira B.

The review shows that there is a growing tendency to include developmentally diverse children in the design process. Compared to other groups of developmentally diverse children, children with high-functioning autism between 8 and 12 years old are the ones that are most often actively involved in the design process. Other groups of children often have a more passive role, being observed, both in the requirements, design and evaluation phase. Working with mixed groups of children, either children with different disabilities, or typically developing children together with developmentally diverse children, also occurs more seldom. Compared to design with typically developing children, adults are involved more intensively in the design, either as users, proxies, experts and/or facilitators. Specific guidelines for how to prepare and perform design sessions with developmentally diverse children often emphasize the need for a coherence of activities, a clear structure in the sessions, verbal as well as textual explanations, and the active participation of caregivers, teachers and therapists. Based on these findings we give several suggestions for further research.	proxy server;requirement;systematic review	Peter Börjesson;Wolmet Barendregt;Eva Eriksson;Olof Torgersson	2015		10.1145/2771839.2771848	psychology;developmental psychology;communication;clinical psychology	HCI	-71.08729302457408	-42.62150185771356	118866
3fd4b4e8bfe4e6ad7e1425cf97ddb98e7c2fd51a	linguistic reflections of student engagement in massive open online courses	massive open online courses;mooc	While data from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) offers the potential to gain new insights into the ways in which online communities can contribute to student learning, much of the richness of the data trace is still yet to be mined. In particular, very little work has attempted fine-grained content analyses of the student interactions in MOOCs. Survey research indicates the importance of student goals and intentions in keeping them involved in a MOOC over time. Automated fine-grained content analyses offer the potential to detect and monitor evidence of student engagement and how it relates to other aspects of their behavior. Ultimately these indicators reflect their commitment to remaining in the course. As a methodological contribution, in this paper we investigate using computational linguistic models to measure learner motivation and cognitive engagement from the text of forum posts. We validate our techniques using survival models that evaluate the predictive validity of these variables in connection with attrition over time. We conduct this evaluation in three MOOCs focusing on very different types of learning materials. Prior work demonstrates that participation in the discussion forums at all is a strong indicator of student commitment. Our methodology allows us to differentiate better among these students, and to identify danger signs that a struggling student is in need of support within a population whose interaction with the course offers the opportunity for effective support to be administered. Theoretical and practical implications will be discussed.	amiga reflections;attrition (website);categorization;causality;clickstream;dropout (neural networks);interaction;massive open online course;mined;online community;population;surround sound;word lists by frequency	Miaomiao Wen;Diyi Yang;Carolyn Penstein Rosé	2014			simulation;computer science;knowledge management;student engagement;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-73.60556194472181	-41.84125292858978	119478
ce7b0911090b312d2351c2cb70f0434ed02ac8bb	requirements for a seamless collaborative and cooperative mlearning system		There is need for mobile learning (mLearning) systems that are capable of spurring seamless collaborative and cooperative learning. Such systems would be instrumental in redefining the way academic and administrative student support services are extended to students who might find themselves situated in different learning spaces and with multiple societal roles. In this chapter, the Mobile Learning Object Deployment and Utilisation Framework (MoLODUF) was used to underpin a study from which requirements necessary for the development of a seamless collaborative and cooperative mLearning system were instantiated. The adduced requirements include the need for communication cost subsidies and putting in place mechanisms for harnessing positive mLearning policy elements. Other requirements relate to human, financial and infrastructural resources for spurring mLearning. The system also requires an authentication protocol to prevent unauthorised use and unsolicited communication. It also requires GSM and GPRS mobile network connectivity so as to embrace low- and high-end mobile phones and mobile and PC interoperability. The system needs to be designed for learners who are located in multiple contexts and with multiple roles. Text and audio media types are ideal for learning objects that are seamlessly interoperable on low- to high-end mobile phones and PCs. The system as well should be cognisant of the need for learning comfort and learning object delivery feedback. These system requirements have been used to develop a prototype seamless collaborative and cooperative mLearning systems using SMS technology.	requirement;seamless3d	Paul Birevu Muyinda;Godfrey Mayende;Jonathan Kizito	2016		10.1007/978-981-287-113-8_11	learning object;multimedia;interoperability;cooperative learning;mobile phone;collaborative learning;mobile device;system requirements;computer science;cellular network	HCI	-70.4539611382439	-39.27043681808041	119523

These theories were examined within the context of a laboratory study using two divergent thinking prompts. Participants generated alternative/creative uses for a brick and for a glass bottle (separately) for two minutes and responses were time-stamped using a Matlab GUI. Semantic distances between responses and conceptual representations of the DT prompts were computed using latent semantic analysis. Results showed that semantic distance increased as responding progressed, with significant differences between the two tasks, and intraparticipant variation. Results have implications for theories of creative thinking and represent methodological and analytic advances in the study of divergent thinking.	graphical user interface;latent semantic analysis;matlab;theory	Richard W.

8e6cecae1f69da63858e606ab25d1e2467d6ac61	understanding time-based trends in stakeholders’ choice of learning activity type using predictive models		The learning analytics communities, as well as most learning analytics research, have not frequently focused on time-based trends in the same virtual learning environment over different years of deployment, or on temporal trends in the selection of different activity types over a typical day. This paper contributes to this debate and provides a novel approach to learning analytics using a multinomial logit model for modeling the probabilities of students’ choice of learning activities during the hours of the day over several academic years. An abstraction called activity is introduced, which categorizes individual student’s log accesses to the virtual learning environment into more semantically meaningful categories. Consequently, the activity represents a sequence of semantically meaningful Web accesses related to a particular activity or task that a student of the virtual learning environment performs. This paper includes a comprehensive explanation of the model and an evaluation of the model. This paper introduces a case study, which shows that the multinomial logit model can give useful insight into the course schedule, as it shows what the peak times are for different types of activities. This paper also discusses the possible implications of the results in the context of virtual learning environment management and content improvement at the institutional level.

380cb3dbc54ae6ba6071a67c95455706b357d40a	m-learning: a new paradigm of learning ict in nigeria		Abstract—Mobile learning (m-learning) is the study and practice of using mobile devices, such as smart phones, mobile phones, tablets, PDAs, MP3s and pocket PCs in order to support learning for anyone, anytime and anywhere. M-learning has become paramount for developing countries such as Nigeria, as many of these countries have the required infrastructure and a rapidly increasing amount of mobile device users. In addition, the mobile devices are able to support a variety of learning activities and students are also ready to use the devices for learning. In this article, we have enumerated the possibilities and challenges of implementing m-learning in developing countries, specifically in Nigeria, and identified potential m-learning solutions to support learning of ICT in Nigeria. We administrated a questionnaire in order to find out primary school students readiness in Nigeria to adopt m-learning, their preferences to use specific features of m-learning devices in learning situations, as well as their opinions regarding the suitability of m-learning for ICT-related subjects. We also propose a cloud-based m-learning model for learning ICT topics in Nigeria.

We investigate how forum design affects student activity and learning outcomes through a field experiment with 1101 participants on the edX platform. We introduce a reputation system, which gives students points for making useful posts. We show that, as in other settings, use of forums in MOOCs is correlated with better grades and higher retention. Reputation systems additionally produce faster response times and larger numbers of responses per post, as well as differences in how students ask questions. However, reputation systems have no significant impact on grades, retention, or the students' subjective sense of community. This suggests that forums are essential for MOOCs, and reputation systems can improve the forum experience, but other techniques are needed to improve student outcomes and community formation. We also contribute a set of guidelines for running field experiments on MOOCs.	experiment;massive open online course;reputation system;edx	Derrick Coetzee;Armando Fox;Marti A.

As various characteristics of mobile devices influence their usability, users select a device to fit specific needs. This article discusses student teachers’ preferences of the use of mobile devices in the light of boundary objects theory (Star, Griesemer, 1989; Star 2010). Although they use mobile phones mainly for communication and orientation in both contexts, the funcionalities are different. For example, they use phone calls outside the university versus sms in-campus, city public-transport website versus weekly schedule. The device turns out to be so flexible that allows for a selective use of its functionality depending on the context.

Extending this research, this study examines whether sequences of socially regulated learning differ across low, medium or high performing groups. Scaffolded by a computer avatar, 54 primary school students (working in 18 groups of 3) discussed writing a report about a foreign country for 51,338 turns. Statistical discourse analysis (SDA) of these sequences of talk showed that in high performing groups, high cognition was preceded more often by high cognition and less often by denials or low cognition. In medium performing groups, high cognition was preceded more often by high cognition or planning. As these results indicate that different sequences among students' cognitive, metacognitive and relational activities are linked to levels of performance, they can inform a micro-temporal theory of socially shared regulation.	avatar (computing);cognition;planning	Inge Molenaar;Ming Ming Chiu	2015		10.1145/2723576.2723586	psychology;developmental psychology;communication;social psychology	HCI	-73.65861970876611	-43.67170314820628	121718

Dialogue strategies are expressed as constraints on how to move through a student model that is composed of linked nodes. By orienting the dialogue to a linked model of the student’s likely beliefs and expressing the dialogue strategies as constraints on movement within the model, the approach facilitates adaptation of the dialogue strategy as the student model changes.	dialog system	Pamela W.

In this paper, the authors examine students’ attitudes toward active learning when using an unrestricted blog in an academic context and whether this can be used to support reflective and critical discussion, leading to knowledge construction. The authors collected data using an online survey with questions on student perceptions of the type, frequency and effectiveness of their strategy. Analysis of the data was conducted using Bloom’s revised taxonomy. The research indicates that students must have prior familiarity with this form of communication technology to construct knowledge in an academic context. The authors conclude that effective learning will only emerge if informed by the student experience and perspective.

We discuss some complementary methods that we have used to understand how tutoring time is spent, such as analyzing sample videotaped sessions by hand, and querying a database generated from session logs. We identify issues, methods, and lessons that may be relevant to other tutors. One theme is that iterative design of non-tutoring components can enhance a tutors effectiveness, not by improved teaching, but by reducing the time wasted on non-learning activities. Another is that it is possible to relate students time allocation to improvements in various outcome measures.	iteration;iterative design;linear algebra	Jack Mostow;Gregory Aist;Joseph E.

An unsupervised learning algorithm was integrated with an audience response system called SIDRA in order to generate states that collect some commonality in responses to questions and add diagnostic feedback for guided learning. A total of 89 pharmacy students enrolled on a Human Anatomy course were taught using two different teaching methods. Forty-four students employed intelligent SIDRA (i-SIDRA), whereas 45 students received the same training but without using i-SIDRA. A statistically significant difference was found between the experimental group (i-SIDRA) and the control group (traditional learning methodology), with T (87) = 6.598, p < 0.001. In four MCQs tests, the difference between the number of correct answers in the first attempt and in the last attempt was also studied. A global effect size of 0.644 was achieved in the meta-analysis carried out. The students expressed satisfaction with the content provided by i-SIDRA and the methodology used during the process of learning anatomy (M = 4.59). The new empirical contribution presented in this paper allows instructors to perform post hoc analyses of each particular student’s progress to ensure appropriate training.	algorithm;anatomic structures;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;computational anatomy;experiment;feedback;final exam;grade;hoc (programming language);knowledge level;learning disorders;teaching method;unsupervised learning	José Luis Fernández Alemán;Laura López-González;Ofelia González-Sequeros;Chrisina Jayne;Juan José López-Jiménez;Juan Manuel Carrillo-de-Gea;José Ambrosio Toval Álvarez	2016	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-016-0440-6	experiment;text mining;human body;medicine;computer science;artificial intelligence;data science;machine learning;data mining;multimedia;management;artificial neural network;statistics	HCI	-75.61365502644907	-50.74190848184327	122225

Generally, information seeking and retrieval is regarded as an individual and isolated process in IR research. We assume that an IS&R situation is not merely an individual effort, but inherently involves various collaborative activities. We present empirical results from a real-life and information-intensive setting within the patent domain, showing that the patent task performance process involves highly collaborative aspects throughout the stages of the information seeking and retrieval process. Furthermore, we show that these activities may be categorized and related to different stages in an information seeking and retrieval process. Therefore, the assumption that information retrieval performance is purely individual needs to be reconsidered. Finally, we also propose a refined IR framework involving collaborative aspects.	baseline (configuration management);categorization;committed information rate;complexity;conjunctive query;holism;information retrieval;information seeking;information source;multi-user;real life;relevance;security technical implementation guide;subject-matter expert;task analysis;theory	Preben Hansen;Kalervo Järvelin	2005	Inf.

1048984e8abd60dea067b7fc8f50eb5f01a94b7b	the role of spatial immersion for tasks based on the use of egocentric frames of reference		The focus of the current study was to understand which aspects of 3D immersive virtual reality are particularly useful for tasks based on the use of egocentric frames of reference. Twenty-two undergraduate students learned relative motion concepts in an interactive virtual reality simulation, either in an immersive virtual environment (IVE) or non-immersive desktop virtual environment (DVE). Our results show that the IVE group improved more significantly than the DVE group on solving relative motion problems after training in the simulations. The students’ improvement from the pre- to post- problem solving test revealed that, through correlation analysis and rating different scales of presence, only spatial immersion scale showed a significant correlation which favored the IVE. This result supports our hypothesis that egocentric encoding of the scene in IVE is beneficial for tasks based on the use of egocentric frames of reference.	immersion (virtual reality)	Michael Kozhevnikov;Dana Hayes;Maria Kozhevnikov	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39476-8_142	computer vision;multimedia	Vision	-70.52065665658847	-46.692764125065644	122537

As they build a virtual model of a problem situation, students figure out technical principles for assuring the model's fidelity to the situation. These construction heuristics, we find, are precisely the conceptual foundations of algebra, such as tinkering with the model to assure that the variable quantity is of consistent size throughout the model. We articulated these principles as situated intermediary learning objectives (SILOs). At each interaction level, the student discovers a SILO, and then the technology takes over by automatizing that SILO, thus freeing the student for further discovery. We call this architecture reverse scaffolding, because the cultural mediator thus relieves learners from performing what they know to do, not from what they do not know to do. In a quasi-experimental evaluation study (Grades 4 & 9; n=40), reverse-scaffolding students outperformed direct-scaffolding students, for whom the technical features were pre-automatized. We speculate on the architecture's generalizability.	3d modeling;bricolage;heuristic (computer science);silo;situated	Kiera Chase;Dor Abrahamson	2015		10.1145/2771839.2771859	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence	HCI	-75.54071555709993	-45.68791948139603	122543
5571a04df01d089857eba39e054953753ab99259	learning novel mathematical concepts in a computer-enriched environment		Abstract#R##N##R##N#There is widespread belief that computers should be used for the teaching and learning of mathematics. Research indicates that computers are primarily used in mathematics classes: (1) to reinforce previously taught concepts, (2) to allow students to construct computer programs to simulate mathematical techniques known to the student and (3) to explore mathematical microworlds encompassing mathematical ideas and concepts normally known to the student. Furthermore, it is said that pre-service teachers should experience the learning of mathematical ideas and concepts of which they had no prior experience in environments in which computers are just one of the resources available for exploring and experimenting with these ideas and concepts. How should these learning environments be constructed so that pre-service teachers are sensitised to the value of doing mathematics in such environments? Is a student's understanding of novel mathematical concepts enhanced when s/he explores it in a computer-enriched environment? An experiment with pre-service teachers was carried out in a college of education for blacks in South Africa. This article describes the insights gained from this experiment.

Here, an iterative, participatory design process of robot assisted Pivotal Response Training (PRT) for autism therapy is presented. The scenarios for the robot assisted PRT intervention were created using a scenario based design approach through intensive collaboration between robot engineer and therapist. The developed scenarios were then represented in a hierarchical model using Activity Theory. Based on that model, the PRT intervention was implemented by the end-user programming software and evaluated with a child with autism. The scenario based design and the use of Activity Theory framework considerably speeded up the scenario creation process and the redesign time needed between the pilots compared to our previous experiments.	end-user development;experiment;hierarchical database model;interaction design;iteration;precomputed radiance transfer;programma 101;programming tool;robot;robotics	Min-Gyu Kim;Iris Oosterling;Tino Lourens;Wouter Staal;Jan K.

1ed4ad034afd280f8dc9cf1a52ee95de682a0669	group optimization to maximize peer assessment accuracy using item response theory		As an assessment method based on a social constructivist approach, peer assessment has become popular in recent years. When the number of learners increases as in MOOCs, peer assessment is often conducted by dividing learners into multiple groups to reduce the learner’s assessment workload. However, in this case, a difficulty remains that the assessment accuracies of learners in each group depends on the assigned rater. To solve that problem, this study proposes a group optimization method to maximize peer assessment accuracy based on item response theory using integer programming. Experimental results, however, showed that the proposed method does not necessarily present higher accuracy than a random group formation. Therefore, we further propose an external rater selection method that assigns a few outside-group raters to each learner. Simulation and actual data experiments demonstrate that introduction of external raters using the proposed method improves the peer assessment accuracy considerably.	item response theory	Masaki Uto;Nguyen Duc Thien;Maomi Ueno	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-61425-0_33	artificial intelligence;workload;machine learning;item response theory;random group;computer science;integer programming;peer assessment	HCI	-75.83423206379459	-48.26284182800837	122908

This has been problematic in a number of ways and resulted in fragmented literature and inconsistent referencing patterns between different sub-disciplines and countries. This is mainly because no distinct single-disciplinary perspective has emerged because of: the cross-disciplinary nature of educational games, a reliance on single-disciplinary contexts for studies, changing terminologies in different contexts and the use of multi-methodological approaches. Distinct perspectives from education science, game science, neuroscience and information science have deepened our understanding of play and games. This research has become more quantitative, rigorous and nuanced as a result of more studies focused upon therapeutic health applications of games, the serious games research movement and more efficacy and comparative studies that examine and quantify utility.	fragmented object;hoc (programming language);information science	Sara de Freitas	2018	Educational Technology & Society		educational technology;computer science;knowledge management;mathematics education;computer-mediated communication;grounded theory;teaching method;information science	HCI	-72.55654645789046	-40.265011918669934	122986

We investigated how limited education appears to impact the ability to navigate a hierarchical UI, even when it has no text. We scored 60 participants from low-income communities in India using tests of textual literacy and Raven's Progressive Matrices. These were used as proxies for educational level and a subset of cognitive abilities. We then evaluated participants' performance on a UI task involving hierarchical navigation. First, our results confirm that textual literacy is correlated with scores on the Raven's test. In addition, we found that performance on both instruments are predictive of performance in navigating UI hierarchies, even when the UI is text-free. This provides statistically significant confirmation of previous anecdotal hypotheses. We conclude with design recommendations for UI hierarchies for people with limited education.	cognition;proxy server;user interface	Indrani Medhi-Thies;Meera Lakshmanan;Kentaro Toyama;Edward Cutrell	2013		10.1145/2470654.2481390	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;abstraction;multimedia;management;world wide web	HCI	-71.29466541959904	-48.62241006797462	123066

We focus on education and analyze whether encouraging social interaction among students improves learning outcomes in massive open online courses (MOOCs), which are a new service delivery channel with universal access at reduced, if not zero, cost. We analyze three randomized experiments in a MOOC with more than 30,317 students from 183 countries. Two experiments study large-group interaction by encouraging a random subset of students to visit the course discussion board. The majority of students treated in these experiments had higher social engagement, higher quiz completion rates, and higher course grades. Using these treatments as instrumental variables, we estimate that one additional board visit causally increases the probability that a student finishes the quiz in the subsequent week by up to 4.3%.

This paper analyzes the challenges faced by MOOC in the process of rapid growth, and the learning process of students in a cell cycle, and offers learning behavior evaluation model to provide the basic data for individualized learning. In addition, according to the individual differences of learners, it designs genetic algorithm to realize online auto generating test paper system. And the verification experimental results indicate that the design of genetic algorithm has a good convergence and the generated test paper is related to the individual learners.

Although learning game design is often understood on a one-fits-all level, the actual motivational strength of an educational game strongly depends on the individual learners, their very specific goals, preferences, abilities, strength and weakness, personality, and experiences with gaming. Considering motivation being a fragile and constantly changing state, it is important to continuously assess learning and gaming processes and the oscillations of motivation and immersion within a game. With this premise in mind, the authors developed a psycho-pedagogical approach to a non-invasive embedded assessment of motivational states and learning progress, feeding into a dynamic, ontology-driven learner (and gamer) model. To evaluate the approach, the demonstrator games were subject to intensive quantitative and qualitative experimental research. Results show that a meaningful personalization and an individual support are key factors of the success of learning games.	embedded system;experience;experiment;fits;immersion (virtual reality);personalization	Michael D.

This paper asks whether Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are ‘robust’ enough to support, sustain and address industry, employer and government calls for greater attention to group skills development in university graduates. Data features an examination of respondent feedback (n = 171) in an ‘ICT-rich’ group work setting, and the subsequent ratings of group skills development over a 13-week period. This discussion offers an account of learner outcomes by adopting Kirkpatrick’s (1996) four levels of evaluation of learning as a classification scheme for determining learner satisfaction (Level One), the effectiveness of learning transfer (Level Two), its impact on practice (Level Three) and the appropriation of learning behaviours by participants (Level Four). The contrasting patterns of ICT use between female and male users in the data are discussed in relation to building social presence and producing social categories online. Differences reported here indicate that ICT group work is moving forward, but opportunities to challenge rather than reproduce existing learning relations and differences, remain largely unresolved. 20 British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 36 No 1 2005 © British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, 2005. Introduction—group skills development in the era of online learning Much has been said of the growing emphasis on ‘generic graduate skills’ in Australian higher education. One driver is the increasing evidence of demand from business and employer organisations for graduates to possess a set of generic employability skills (B-HERT, 2002). There is also a subset of economic, technological and educational arguments that have brought generic skills to wider attention, indicating that the generic skills agenda is really part of a bigger, and as yet unresolved, debate about the vocational purpose of university education and the ‘employability gap’ for some graduates. When asked about desirable graduate attributes, industry is quick to respond with assertions of the need for graduate employees to ‘work cooperatively’ (B-HERT 2002; Bormann-Young & Henquinet, 2000; Kolb, 1984). The rationale for ‘cooperative interaction’ is simple: as organisations continue to decentralise decision-making and to deal with today’s complex and changing environment, there is a greater reliance on workplace teams to ‘carry the load’ (Falk, 1997). Johnson and Johnson (1997) refer to the importance of ‘cooperative interaction’ as a condition for demonstrating graduate skills ‘in context’. However, working together (like any other graduate skill) needs to be developed and learned. Understanding small group formation, its dynamics, processes and outputs are foundational elements in the provision of effective learning environments. Though few university courses focus on ‘working collaboratively’, the use of groups as a learning technology is common to many university subjects for obvious reasons. For the benefits of efficiency and productivity, groups accomplish tasks that cannot be done by individuals alone; they bring multiple perspectives to bear on a single problem; they capture the dynamic of real world complexity; they provide a vehicle for decision-making and taking, and they impose an efficient means of organisational control over individual behaviours (Harrison, 1999). For socialisation purposes, groups form a key element in the broader educational process. They are instrumental in the formation of personality; are agents of both socialisation and control, and act as a motivational tool within a continuous cycle of learning. In order to link educational and workplace experiences at university, the use of group work has mapped onto wider debates about more institutional notions of ‘learning’. Learning has become a key interface for processing the acceptance of new values through change processes (Mezirow, 1991). In higher education this is captured in a range of terms designed to convey the dynamic of the new learning agendas: ‘actionlearning’, ‘collaborative learning’, ‘lifelong learning’, ‘self-paced learning’, ‘situated learning’, ‘distributed learning’, ‘flexible learning’ and more recently ‘practitionerbased learning’. In moving towards what Lemke (1996) terms the ‘interactive learning paradigm’, higher education has adopted two key principles consistent with group learning technologies: • learning is always mediated by and occurs through language (Falk, 1997; Gee, 1997); and • learning is distributed across a range of other people, sites, objects, technologies and time (Gee, 1997). Does group skills development also go out the window? 21 © British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, 2005. A third and relatively recent principle to emerge on the higher education scene that seems to ‘contradict’ accepted views of group learning technologies is that: • many universities now choose to offer ‘learning resources’ online. Defining the problem—the limitations of ICTs Social presence theory (Short, Williams & Christie, 1976) has marked the online, computer-mediated or ICT (information and communication technology) rich world as largely impersonal. This assertion is based on the belief that different media convey different degrees of perceived substance to an interaction, with the quality of connection based on the amount of non-verbal communication made available to the receiver in a given exchange. As a low presence, and low cue media, social presence theory suggests that the ICT environment will be ‘stretched’ in its attempts to facilitate the ‘cooperative interaction’ of students in a group work setting. Sproull and Kiesler (1986) extend this contention to include social context cues, which serve as indicators of appropriate ‘contextualised’ behaviour. Social context cues in a face-to-face setting govern the norms and practices of contact, social desirability, conversational turn taking (try that with a chat group), standards of disclosure, and a host of situational and context variables. However, social context cues are embedded in non-verbal communications. Given the absence of non-verbal cues in an ICT setting, it follows that where ICTs are involved we are less able to make subtle differentiations among communication stimuli, and therefore less able to exert control over ourselves in order to meet group expectations and to perform important group roles. As Sproull and Kiesler (1986) contend, this is more likely to lead to role-ambiguity, increased anonymity, reduced self-regulation, and reduced self-awareness. This is hardly the kind of credentialism universities are seeking to develop in the new-aged graduate, and a worst case scenario could see ICTs as counterproductive to the development of generic graduate skills. Despite these limitations, ICTs are now uniformly and seamlessly integrated into contemporary curricula in higher education in the form of distributed learning management systems (LMS) and embedded ‘learning objects’. ICTs have effectively become an organising frame in the rhythm of contemporary educational discourse, but often in a context ‘where information technology rather than “pedagogy” drives curriculum reform’ (Celsi & Wolfinbarger, 2001, p. 308). At risk in these new learning environments is the ‘fabric’ of critical education, as students move away from active learner participation to browse through a ‘stockpile’ of just-in-time information made available online (Blasi & Heinecke, 2000, p. 83). On top of this, as Lambier (2002, p. 113) puts it, ICTs seem to ‘feed off the limitations teachers often have to face’ in the process of teaching. The emphases placed on time management, class management and efficiency, individualisation and autonomy, information processing and problem solving in an ICT rich environment promote a pedagogy that understates the value of collaborative learning processes and relations at a time where industry calls for greater attention to group skills development. This paper questions whether ICT mediated group work is robust enough as a technology to meet the challenge of the ‘generic skills’ agenda? Will ICTs 22 British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 36 No 1 2005 © British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, 2005. be able to support, sustain and address industry, employer and government calls for greater attention to group skills development? About face-2-face real-time group work Group work has been widely adopted by Australian academics to facilitate acquisition of industry relevant ‘team’ skills in student learners. The depth of academic engagement with ‘group work’ as a learning technology is evidenced in the conceptual model developed by Bormann-Young & Henquinet (2000), whose conceptual framework for designing group projects is based on the constructive alignment of three design factors: (a) the pedagogical (read andragogical) purposes for utilising groups, (b) what should be evaluated in group work and by whom, and (c) the critical factors related to effective group project design. This framework defines a group project as ‘an assignment that requires two or more individuals, interacting and interdependent, (that) come together to achieve specific objectives’ (Bormann-Young & Henquinet, 2000, p. 56).

We observe that most 3D software visualizations are displayed on a standard computer screen, and hypothesize that displaying them in immersive augmented reality can help to (i) overcome usability issues of 3D visualizations, and (ii) increase their effectiveness to support software concerns. We investigate our hypothesis via a controlled experiment. In it, nine participants use 3D city visualizations displayed on a Microsoft HoloLens device to complete a set of software comprehension tasks. We further investigate our conjectures through an observational user study, in which the same participants of the experiment use a space-time cube visualization to analyze program executions. We collect data to (1) quantitatively analyze the effectiveness of visualizations in terms of user performance (i.e., completion time, correctness, and recollection), and user experience (i.e., difficulty, and emotions); and (2) qualitatively analyze how immersive augmented reality helps to overcome the limitations of 3D visualizations. We found that immersive augmented reality facilitates navigation and reduces occlusion, while performance is adequate, and developers obtain an outstanding experience. Selection and text readability still remain open issues.	augmented reality;baseline (configuration management);computer monitor;correctness (computer science);microsoft hololens;software engineering;software system;software visualization;usability testing;user experience	Leonel Merino;Alexandre Bergel;Oscar Nierstrasz	2018	2018 IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization (VISSOFT)	10.1109/VISSOFT.2018.00014	human–computer interaction;software visualization;task analysis;visualization;immersion (virtual reality);computer science;user experience design;augmented reality;usability;software	Visualization	-63.00145027252337	-47.49982732986204	123610

The new mobile landscape shifts the educational ground demanding for innovative ways to create games for educational purposes. Location-based games provide new opportunities for effective learning in authentic environments. On the other hand, this game genre poses new challenges to educational practitioners that are closely related to technological advances and established pedagogical practices. The aim of this study is to investigate on the limitations and challenges of authoring tools regarding the support of new trends and standards. In the first place, we explore educational scenarios implemented in the form of location-based games and a general conceptual model that comprises common game elements is formulated. Secondly, two typical authoring tools that actively support location-based experiences and games are presented with a critical view with regard to the model presented. Finally, we draw conclusions in order to inform the design of next generation authoring tools. The platforms have been used successfully in educational settings by non-technical educational practitioners, however they miss the opportunity arising from integrating current trends and emerging standards focused on increasing learning technologies interoperability. Such trends afford game-learning analytics as the next generation move and new ways of integrating authoring and analytics tools need to be explored in order to make educational games even more impactful.	aris express;abstraction layer;augmented reality;experience;floor and ceiling functions;holism;human–computer interaction;interoperability;location-based game;location-based service;microsoft lumia;mobile game;personalization;vocabulary	Spyridon Xanthopoulos;Stelios Xinogalos	2018	2018 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)	10.1109/EDUCON.2018.8363452	multimedia;conceptual model;data science;mobile technology;engineering;interoperability;analytics	HCI	-68.67206458811417	-38.637312632100155	123996

BACKGROUND To be effective, an auditory warning must be audible, identifiable, interpretable, and heeded. Warnings consisting of familiar environmental sounds, or auditory icons, have potential to facilitate identification and interpretation. The ease with which pairings between auditory icons and warning events can be learned and retained is likely to depend on the type and strength of the preexisting icon/event association.   METHOD Sixty-three participants each learned eight auditory-icon/denotative-referent pairings and attempted to recall them 4 weeks later. Three icon/denotative-referent association types (direct, related, and unrelated) were employed. Participants rated the strength of the association for each pairing on a 7-point scale.   RESULTS The number of errors made while learning pairings was greater for unrelated than for either related or direct associations, whereas the number of errors made while attempting to recall pairings 4 weeks later was greater for unrelated than for related associations and for related than for direct associations. Irrespective of association type, both learning and retention performance remained at very high levels, provided the strength of the association was rated greater than 5.   CONCLUSION This suggests that strong preexisting associations are used to facilitate learning and retention of icon/denotative-referent pairings.   APPLICATION The practical implication of this study is that auditory icons having either direct or strong, indirect associations with warning events should be preferred.		Karen L. Stephan;Sean E.

The study group consisted of students in the Department of Languages and Translation at Taibah University who registered for the Writing Two course in the first semester of the 2012 - 2013 academic year. Fourty subjects were divided into two sections: section one was assigned as an experimental group (supported by Facebook and Skype) and section two was assigned as a control group and was asked to write their essays with paper and pencil. Facebook and Skype accounts were created for every student in the experimental group. Data was analyzed from pre-test and post-test results to evaluate the question posed by the study: Does the use of online text chat assisted with word processors help undergraduate students develop their writing skills more than traditional methods of teaching? The results revealed that students who worked with Facebook and Skype showed a significant improvement in their writing skills when compared to the control group. In light of these findings, it is recommended that online discussions via Facebook, Skype, and other social media sites should be utilized when teaching writing and the other language skills.	online chat	Ahmad Mosa Batianeh	2014	iJET		speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;world wide web;pedagogy	NLP	-76.89883429785552	-42.0914158372132	124246
784f88da0835b0dd163e2d241dca049fe38b4163	exploring the effect of avatar trust on learners' perceived participation intentions in an e-learning environment		With continued advancements in Web technology, e-learning systems have emerged as an effective venue in which learners can interact with online contents and they are often equipped with avatar instructors in lieu of human instructors. In this case, avatar trust, the learners’ perceived trust in the avatar instructor, plays an important role in learners’ perceived intentions to participate in the e-learning activities. We assumed that social presence positively affects participation intention (PI) through avatar trust. The main purpose of this study is to empirically validate this hypothesis. Using two types of avatars as a moderating factor, our hypothesis was tested against 200 valid questionnaires. We found that social presence had a statistically significant influence on perceived PI through avatar trust, and that an attractive avatar type sheds stronger moderating effect on paths between social presence and avatar trust, and path between trust and participation than does an expert avatar type.

Within this paper three barriers are identified which make it challenging to include users within this early design activity: knowledge gap, user journey, and complex requirements. These three barriers are often exacerbated when working with young people (children and teenagers). This paper explores a design technique (Primed Design Activities) which is intended to help lower these barriers and enable young people to be more effectively involved in early envisioning and concept generation stages. The technique bases the designs around a scenario of use and collects context appropriate screen designs.

One method gives a more comprehensive access to educational resources, through multiple pathways of information access, including browsing and information visualization. The second method is to access personalized information through social navigation support. This paper presents the details of the Knowledge Sea II system for comprehensive personalized access to educational resources and also presents the results of a classroom study. The study delivered a convincing argument for the importance of providing multiple information presentations modes, showing that only about 10% of all resource accesses were made through the traditional search interface. We have also collected some solid evidence in favor of the social navigation support.	digital library;information access;information visualization;library (computing);personalization	Peter Brusilovsky;Rosta Farzan;Jae-wook Ahn	2005	Proceedings of the 5th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL '05)	10.1145/1065385.1065388	acceleration;navigation;digital library;visualization;computer science;solid;multimedia;data analysis;world wide web;information retrieval	HCI	-69.57733022295015	-50.69734687289544	125281
4b5cc8ce067555040fbedcb98527f653e60c48d2	brailleapp - educational mobile application to assist in the learning of braille language		Aiming to facilitate the learning process of the Braille System, we developed an educational application to assist people for learning this system. We developed the application initially in Portuguese, it was named as BrailleApp, and it was designed for mobile devices, which uses the Android Platform. All accessibility standards were implemented to make it as accessible as possible to all people, helping visually impaired people and not visually impaired in the learning process of this language. In this first version, the help to learning Braille is specifically to not blind people, although, with some difficulties, it is possible a blind person use the application. In future versions we hope to improve and facilitate the use of this application by blind people too. It is important to emphasize we do not intend to replace the conventional methods which assist in this task, but to be an application to complement the already existing techniques. In an empirical analysis, the results show that the application was positive in the sense of system requirements, functionalities, and accessibility. We expect BrailleApp will be another option to assist users in the teaching-learning process and contribute to the social integration of visually impaired with technologies.	accessibility;android;interaction;mobile app;mobile device;requirement;system requirements;touchscreen;winsock	Raul Benites Paradeda;Ailton Francisco de Luna e Silva;Jones Granatyr;Alberto Signoretti	2015			natural language processing;speech recognition;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-64.29163981853941	-43.49953736912869	125292

Social media sites provide open and accessible communication platforms for families, caregivers, and individuals with autism to share, connect, and exchange information with others. We systematically analyze these interactions on blogs and Twitter among families and autism communities to extract knowledge and develop practical and useful learning tools. The study found that the autism community provides significant social support to its members. Social support facilitated by community members can help caregivers surmount challenges and be effective in reducing psychological stress and enhancing the quality of life for individuals diagnosed with ASD.	blog;interaction;social media;social support;the quality of life	Amit Saha;Nitin Agarwal	2015	2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)	10.1145/2808797.2809364	community;asd;media;autism;computer science;multimedia;writing;world wide web;sentiment analysis	HCI	-68.03596898697538	-39.84952552905722	125677

The aim was to determine if there would be an effect of word recall on English vocabulary learning after the participants had studied 160 English-Korean word pairs using the computer. Participants were assigned to three different learning conditions (Control, Recall, Encode) and they learned lists of word pairs across multiple study trials and were given an immediate recall test. A final delayed recall test was also given 1 week after learning. The results from the delayed recall test indicated that the learning conditions (Control, Recall) which required the participants to actively recall the words resulted in a better recall of words 1 week after the initial learning period. In addition, the results from the survey which investigated the participants’ preferred strategy when studying, demonstrated that 63.5% of the participants preferred to engage in self-testing or retrieval practice while studying. However, participants did not regard retrieval practice via self-testing alone as an effective learning strategy for studying.	encode;microsoft word for mac;vocabulary	Yeonji Baik;Jiyoun Choi;Taewon Chung;Kichun Nam	2010	2010 International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications	10.1109/ICCSA.2010.75	serial position effect;natural language processing;speech recognition;free recall;recall test;computer science;automatic frequency control;feedback;natural language;encoding;time	HCI	-74.00086299804568	-44.108907320745224	125952

Most guides to World Wide Web (Web) design derived from artistic or usability principles feature no empirical validation, while empirical studies of Web use typically rely on observer ratings. Several sources of unobtrusive usage data are available to Web designers, including Web server logs, client-side logs, and other data. The naturally-occurring traces recorded in these logs offer a rich data source, amenable to normative use assessments and to experimental research comparing alternative Web designs. Identification of types of Web server logs, client logs, types and uses of log data, and issues associated with the validity these data, are enumerated. Finally, frameworks that outline how sources of use-based data can be triangulated to assess Web design are illustrated, and an approach to experimentation that overcomes many log data validity issues is presented.	client-side;experiment;server (computing);server log;tracing (software);usability;usage data;web design;web server;world wide web	Mary C.

The principal aim of the study was to identify the implications of asynchronous e-learning to: (a) students’ and teachers’ overall satisfaction and perceived performance, (b) the organisation and management of learning and (c) social interaction and collaboration between/among students and teachers. The results provide insights for important interaction design and development issues in e-learning such as: notes-taking and annotations on e-learning content, student comprehension and satisfaction, skipping courses, cost-effective educational and time management, social awareness, collaboration, ‘flaming’ and ‘border-crossing’. The study reports on issues that need to be considered by HCI researchers, interaction design practitioners, and usability professionals and are complementary to usability and accessibility work in e-learning evaluation studies.	accessibility;emoticon;human–computer interaction;interaction design;perceived performance;usability;web application	Panayiotis Koutsabasis;Modestos Stavrakis;Thomas Spyrou;John Darzentas	2011	Int.

That was after only a few sessions using the Interactive Fruit Panel presented in this article. The interactive application described in this paper is a way to digitize one of the games commonly used by CDIAT therapists to help children to associate real objects (fruits in this case) with their graphical representation (pictogram) in a therapeutic activity using real objects as the interactive basis. This article summarizes the description of the proposed system, as well as the results obtained from a pilot test with real participants in collaboration with professionals from CDIAT. The preliminary results show how children with special needs achieved learning goals faster with the interactive panel, and how the children's attention improved.	graphical user interface;pictogram	Iván Durango;Alicia Carrascosa;Victor M.

e7ae2cc6593fbe099157fa83218610d5f951b902	rapid prototyping internet of things applications for augmented objects: the tiles toolkit approach		Designing and prototyping for IoT have historically required a diverse range of skills and a set of tools that individually supported only a fraction of the whole process, not being designed to work together. These tools usually require a certain level of proficiency in design methods, programming or electronics, depending on the phase addressed. Previous works on the Tiles Ideation toolkit and the RapIoT software framework demonstrated how the design phase can be democratized and how a simple programming paradigm can make coding for IoT a task accessible to non-experts. With this work we present and evaluate the process and the technologies involved in the programming and prototyping phase of an IoT application. The Tiles Square and the Tiles Temp are introduced, these two electronic devices complement and support IoT prototyping. They are designed to work in conjunction with the Tiles Ideation toolkit and are supported by the RapIoT software framework, allowing non-experts to augment and program everyday objects. We illustrate the potential of this approach by presenting the results obtained after workshops with 44 students. We conclude by discussing strengths and limitations of our approach, highlighting the lessons learned and possible improvements.	internet of things;rapid prototyping	Francesco Gianni;Simone Mora;Monica Divitini	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-03062-9_16	software framework;multimedia;computer science;software engineering;coding (social sciences);ideation;design methods;electronics;programming paradigm;rapid prototyping;internet of things	HCI	-67.91773946441282	-38.07058860787098	126553

In this paper, we describe a Group Decision Support System developed at the University of Mississippi that supports meetings of groups speaking English, German, French, Malay, or any other language which uses the Roman alphabet (including accent marks). A pilot study was conducted comparing American students using English with Malaysian students using alternatively English and Malay. All groups used a Group Decision Support System to exchange comments or solutions regarding the assigned problem. In general, there were no significant differences between the groups interms of production blocking (ease of communication), evaluation apprehension (fear of peer criticism), and overall meeting satisfaction in either language. These results support our hypothesis that Group Decision Support Systems can be used effectively regardless of a group's nationality or language.	decision support system	Milam W.

The purpose of this study was to access the relative weights of these sociability factors which the authors garnered from the literature on educational MMORPGs. Design/methodology/approach – The authors used fuzzy-AHP approach to access the relative weights of these sociability factors they garnered from the literature on educational MMORPGs. To do this, a questionnaire using a pair-wise comparison data input format was administered to 242 school teachers to gather assessments for the factors. Findings – The authors found five most important factors affecting sociability – cooperation, teambased reward, discussion of strategy, reputation, and social navigation. Originality/value – Although prior studies have identified various factors that facilitate sociability in educational MMORPGs, the relative importance of these factors has not been determined. The results can not only be used to help educational MMORPG developers focus on the most important sociability factors and propose specific guidelines for designing educational MMORPGs, but can also identify the best design strategy for promoting sociability of educational MMORPGs.

However, questions have been raised whether such data representations are adequate to inform reflection, planning and monitoring of students' learning strategies. In this poster we present an investigation of how students interpret feedback delivered via learning analytics dashboards. The findings indicated that most students were able to articulate an interpretation of the feedback presented through the dashboard to identify gaps between their expected and actual performance to inform changes to their study strategies. However, there was also evidence of uncertain interpretation both in terms of the format of the visualization of the feedback and their inability to understand the connection between the feedback and their current strategies. The findings have been used to inform recommendations for ways to enhance the effectiveness of the delivery of feedback through dashboards to provide value to students in developing effective learning strategies to meet their educational goals.	dashboard (business);feedback;interpretation (logic)	Linda Corrin;Paula de Barba	2015		10.1145/2723576.2723662	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-76.02455616630851	-45.11411317676858	127032

We used eye tracking to capture visual attention to the PAs, and our results reveal specific visual attention-related metrics (e.g., fixation rate, longest fixations) that are significantly influenced by learning depending on student achievement goals. Specifically, performance-oriented students learned more with a long longest fixation and a high fixation rate on the PAs, whereas mastery-oriented students learned less with a high fixation rate on the PAs. Our findings contribute to understanding how to design PAs that can better adapt to student achievement goals and visual attention to the PA.	pedagogical agent	Sébastien Lallé;Michelle Taub;Nicholas V.

Previous studies using the TPB to explain teachers’ intentions to use technology have resulted in inconsistent findings. This inconsistency might be due to overly broad definitions of the target behavior. To investigate this potential weakness, we defined a specific target behavior, using computers only to create and deliver lessons, and then used the TPB to investigate teachers’ decisions. An elicitation study was used to identify teachers’ salient beliefs and develop a closed-ended questionnaire. Results of the closed-ended questionnaire revealed that AB, SN, and PBC all were significant predictors of teachers’ intentions. However, AB had twice the influence of SN and three times that of PBC. This finding suggests that teachers must have positive attitudes about using computers to create and deliver lessons. They are less concerned about what others think of this practice, and far less bothered by internal or external constraints. Results provide specific information that can be used to design effective teacher development programs and remind TPB researchers of the importance of using specific definitions of the target behavior.	computer;periodic boundary conditions;premier boxing champions;t-norm	Jung Jae Lee;Frank A.

This training should be provided under guidance from a professor in controlled settings that mimic real-life situations as closely as possible, but in the initial stages the interaction with real patients should be avoided. Precisely, the objective of this study was to develop a system constructed with artificial intelligence and 3D design applications that creates an environment in which the trainee can interact with a group of simulated patients. These virtual patients are realistic objects that can interact in real-time with the user using a series of parameters that define their verbal, emotional and motor responses.

A good model must be sensitive to improvements in skill decomposition. We validate the Recent-Performance Factors Analysis model of student performance by checking its sensitivity to the skill decomposition. We use a dataset from a tutoring system where the skill model has been improved by the Learning Factors Analysis algorithm for skill model refinement and by expert validation. We find that R-PFA reflects improvements in the skill model, providing evidence of convergent validity of R-PFA. We argue that R-PFA may be sensible as a predictive model in Learning Factors Analysis because of its convergent validity and because the R predictor of R-PFA represents mastery-aligned learning curves.	algorithm;cross-validation (statistics);decomposition (computer science);kerrison predictor;predictive failure analysis;refinement (computing)	Ilya M.

In this paper, we extend an embedded training methodology using learning science principles in which phishing education is made part of a primary task for users. The goal is to motivate users to pay attention to the training materials. In embedded training, users are sent simulated phishing attacks and trained after they fall for the attacks. Prior studies tested users immediately after training and demonstrated that embedded training improved users' ability to identify phishing emails and websites. In the present study, we tested users to determine how well they retained knowledge gained through embedded training and how well they transferred this knowledge to identify other types of phishing emails. We also compared the effectiveness of the same training materials delivered via embedded training and delivered as regular email messages. In our experiments, we found that: (a) users learn more effectively when the training materials are presented after users fall for the attack (embedded) than when the same training materials are sent by email (non-embedded); (b) users retain and transfer more knowledge after embedded training than after non-embedded training; and (c) users with higher Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) scores are more likely than users with lower CRT scores to click on the links in the phishing emails from companies with which they have no account.	cathode ray tube;email;embedded system;emoticon;experiment;phishing	Ponnurangam Kumaraguru;Yong Rhee;Steve Sheng;Sharique Hasan;Alessandro Acquisti;Lorrie Faith Cranor;Jason I.

During the lecture, the professor poses surprise questions in the form of a quiz on an overhead screen at unexpected moments, and students submit their answers through a smartphone response system using Twitter. Since points are awarded on a first-come-first-served basis to only a limited number of the students who submit correct answers, students are required to concentrate on the lecture if they want to score. The proposed method solves both the problem of decreased concentration arising from frequent use of smartphones for nonlearning purposes in lectures and of inefficient interaction that occurs in large university classrooms. Evaluation through analysis of exam results and a post-course survey confirm that the proposed solution produces better results in terms of both students' academic achievement and their concentration during lectures.	overhead (computing);seamless3d;smartphone;social network	Yeong-Jun Kim;Soonmook Jeong;Yongwoon Ji;Sangeun Lee;Key Ho Kwon;Jae Wook Jeon	2015	IEEE Transactions on Education	10.1109/TE.2014.2329651	simulation;wireless sensor network;mobile telephony;computer science;electrical engineering;atmosphere;multimedia;world wide web;wireless	Visualization	-67.81505421392986	-40.24441273641265	127743

Although the native Scratch environment allows users to create a program by arranging graphical blocks logically, such visual languages are completely dependent on the use of a mouse and keyboard. This modality of interaction limits users based on physical abilities. Our solution is a tool, called Myna, which is a voice-driven Java application executed parallel to Scratch. Myna processes voice commands from the user, interprets those commands according to a pre-defined grammar, and simulates synonymous actions of a mouse and keyboard within Scratch. The resulting environment assists those with a motor disability (particularly young children) in learning the joy of programming. This extended abstract describes the motivation behind the project, a technical description of Myna, and defines the current work in progress.	graphical user interface;java;modality (human–computer interaction);scratch (programming language)	Amber Wagner;Ramaraju Rudraraju;Srinivasa Datla;Avishek Banerjee;Mandar Sudame;Jeffrey G.

bf6ff8f93a166f68ef72699540162bb51b99fa17	supporting handoff in asynchronous collaborative sensemaking using knowledge-transfer graphs		During asynchronous collaborative analysis, handoff of partial findings is challenging because externalizations produced by analysts may not adequately communicate their investigative process. To address this challenge, we developed techniques to automatically capture and help encode tacit aspects of the investigative process based on an analyst's interactions, and streamline explicit authoring of handoff annotations. We designed our techniques to mediate awareness of analysis coverage, support explicit communication of progress and uncertainty with annotation, and implicit communication through playback of investigation histories. To evaluate our techniques, we developed an interactive visual analysis system, KTGraph, that supports an asynchronous investigative document analysis task. We conducted a two-phase user study to characterize a set of handoff strategies and to compare investigative performance with and without our techniques. The results suggest that our techniques promote the use of more effective handoff strategies, help increase an awareness of prior investigative process and insights, as well as improve final investigative outcomes.	adobe streamline;encode;graph - visual representation;interaction;interactive visual analysis;sensemaking;two-phase commit protocol;usability testing	Jian Zhao;Michael Glueck;Petra Isenberg;Fanny Chevalier;Azam Khan	2018	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics	10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745279	sensemaking;data visualization;interactive visual analysis;handover;visual analytics;computer science;knowledge management;asynchronous communication;annotation;knowledge transfer	Visualization	-67.34010235755497	-47.40796919613359	128180

The semi-synchronous communicative interaction within these learning environments is typically text-based Internet relay chat (IRC). IRC data is stored in the form of chatlogs and can generate a large volume of data, posing a difficulty for researchers looking to evaluate learning in the interaction by analyzing and interpreting the patterns of communication structure and related content. This paper describes procedures for the measurement and visualization of chat-based communicative interaction in MUVEs. Methods are offered for structural analysis via social networks, and content analysis via semantic networks. Measuring and visualizing social and semantic networks allows for a window into the structure of learning communities, and also provides for a large cache of analytics to explore individual learning outcomes and group interaction in any virtual interaction. A case study on a learning based MUVE, SRI's Tapped-In community, is used to elaborate analytic methods.	internet relay chat;multi-user;semantic network;semiconductor industry;social network analysis;structural analysis;text-based (computing);virtual reality;virtual world	Devan Rosen;Victor Miagkikh;Daniel D.

2f1b7c75a3cc2f33fc34575bbe77eeb1f336debc	solving parsons problems versus fixing and writing code		Prior research has shown that Parsons problems are an engaging type of code completion problem that can be used to teach syntactic and semantic language constructs. They can also be used in summative assessments to reduce marking time and grading variability compared to code writing problems. In a Parsons problem the correct code is provided, but is broken into mixed-up code blocks that must be assembled in the correct order. Two-dimensional Parsons problems also require the code blocks to be indented correctly. Parsons problems can contain extra code blocks, called distractors, which are not needed in a correct solution. We present a study that compared the efficiency, effectiveness, and cognitive load of learning from solving two-dimensional Parsons problems with distractors, versus fixing code with the same errors as the distractors, versus writing the equivalent code. We found that solving two-dimensional Parsons problems with distractors took significantly less time than fixing code with errors or than writing the equivalent code. Additionally, there was no statistically significant difference in the learning performance, or in student retention of the knowledge one week later.	code::blocks;heart rate variability;item unique identification;speech synthesis	Barbara Ericson;Lauren E.

The purpose of this study was to develop visual design guidelines for improving learning from dynamic and interactive digital text and to validate them by controlled testing. Two structure design guidelines (for enhancing text structure comprehension) and two selective-attention design guidelines (for maintaining the learners' attention on the essential contents) were developed based on the psychological and instructional, technological foundations that can affect the visual design of digital text. In this study, a 2 x 2 factorial design with 141 university students was used to examine the effectiveness of the visual design guidelines. The university students had 20 min to study a piece of digital text with the structure design guidelines, selective-attention design guidelines, both, or no design guidelines applied. Both the structure and selective-attention design guidelines had a positive influence on text structure understanding, essential contents comprehension and usability of digital text. The suggested visual design guidelines were found to be useful for enhancing text comprehension.

More negative comments were made concerning the non-goal version and the children mentioned the lack of a goal as negative aspect of the non-goal version. One improvement they suggested for the non-goal version was to add a goal and to include more sensory stimulation. They overwhelmingly preferred the goal version compared to the non-goal version and when asked by far the most popular reason was the presence of a goal. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

To decrease cost, training can take place in a virtual environment instead of in a real one. It is non-trivial to build and evaluate a virtual environment for training complex command. To understand the method-resources required for evaluating a training simulator for crisis response, this paper presents a case study of applying several resources. Method-resources were analysed for usability problems and Mechanics of Collaboration (MOC). The results show that the Group Observational Technique and the MOC analysis are appropriate for analysing factors of collaboration and communication. The think-aloud technique, observers, experts in the domain and advanced task scenario were important resources. In only a few cases sound and video were necessary to analyse issues.

This problem motivates the use of mobile augmented reality in this research. The objective of this research is to design and develop a mobile augmented reality application that can enhance the student's perception of the selected materials in computer organization and operating system course. The application was developed using three levels of knowledge (understand, apply, analyze) and involved the integration of video, audio, graphic and text information. The evaluation of the application using responses from 13 second year university students shows that this application can be used to enhance the students understanding and engage them in a group discussion for solving the given exercises. This application is expected to be a good start for learning complex materials in the selected course and can be extended to cover different levels of knowledge and subjects.	augmented reality;computer science	Nazatul Aini Abd.

Besides being an efficient and engaging educational tool, virtual environment also collects a lot of behavior data which can be used with Educational Data Mining (EDM) techniques to assess students' learning competencies. In this paper, we propose an assessment system that seamlessly integrates EDM techniques with functionality and affordance of a virtual environment to assess students’ learning competency through analyzing their behavioral data and patterns. The virtual environment can record not only students’ learning outcome, but also their detailed learning process information, which has the potential to depict the full set of students’ learning activity. We also propose a set of metrics which can be used for judging students’ Self-Directed Learning skills and how these metrics can be evaluated computationally by capturing students’ behavioral data in a virtual environment. The field study, which is conducted in Xinmin Secondary School in Singapore, preliminarily illustrates the effectiveness of our approach.	dbpedia;educational data mining;field research;virtual reality;virtual world	Ailiya;Chunyan Miao;Zhiqi Shen;Zhiwei Zeng	2015			simulation;computer science	HCI	-70.29110227264496	-42.45690887108925	130124
455b98bb4db3d83acdf60a31dbd1af299e175941	learning and assessment with images: a view of cognitive load through the lens of cerebral blood flow		Understanding the relationship between cognitive processing and learner performance on tasks using digital media has become increasingly important as the transition towards online learning programs increases. Determining the impact of implementation of instructional resources is often limited to performance outcomes and comparisons to the status quo. This study measured changes in cerebral blood velocity (CBV) of the right middle cerebral artery during visual learning tasks using static images. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was used to compare the changes in CBV during learning of individuals with high and low spatial ability. Our results show that there is a slight increase from baseline values of CBV in individuals with high spatial ability during the learning task for the present study. In contrast, individuals with low spatial ability experience a decrement from baseline during the learning task. These results suggest spatial ability mitigates cognitive load and potentially has an impact on learner performance on visual learning tasks. Introduction The often-used adage that a picture is worth a thousand words may have some scientific validity when one considers the prevalent use of images for learning, and how images may impact the learner. The use of media and specifically images for learning has been studied considerably in recent years (Ozcinar, 2009). Studies related to the use of images for learning have produced various design principles (Mayer, 2002, 2008, 2010; Mayer, Hegarty, Mayer and Campbell, 2005). These principles are based on a learner’s limited capacity to hold information in short-term memory (Reed, 2006; Sweller, 2003). For example, Mayer et al. (2005) recommend that the use of images and accompanying text should remain in close proximity to one another to reduce extraneous load in something they termed the spatial contiguity effect. It is speculated that these design principles can directly affect learner cognitive load and thus student performance (Ayres and VC 2016 British Educational Research Association British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 00 No 0	a picture is worth a thousand words;baseline (configuration management);cognition;digital media;experiment;image;increment and decrement operators;long short-term memory;medical ultrasound;review board;velocity (software development);visual learning;word lists by frequency	Jay J.

Yet few classroom experiments have been conducted to empirically evaluate whether and how an OLM can enhance students’ domain level learning outcomes through the scaffolding of SRL processes in an ITS. In two classroom experiments with a total of 302 7th- and 8th-grade students, we investigated the effect of (a) an OLM that supports students’ self-assessment of their equation-solving skills and (b) shared control over problem selection, on students’ equation-solving abilities, enjoyment of learning with the tutor, self-assessment accuracy, and problem selection decisions. In the first, smaller experiment, the hypothesized main effect of the OLM on students’ learning outcomes was confirmed; we found no main effect of shared control of problem selection, nor an interaction. In the second, larger experiment, the hypothesized main effects were not confirmed, but we found an interaction such that the students who had access to the OLM learned significantly better equation-solving skills than their counterparts when shared control over problem selection was offered in the system. Thus, the two experiments support the notion that an OLM can enhance students’ domain-level learning outcomes through scaffolding of SRL processes, and are among the first in-vivo classroom experiments to do so. They suggest that an OLM is especially effective if it is designed to support multiple SRL processes.	emoticon;equation solving;experiment;video-in video-out	Yanjin Long;Vincent Aleven	2016	User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction	10.1007/s11257-016-9186-6	simulation;computer science	AI	-75.08987060618402	-43.318183054145535	130308

In case-based reosoning, a new problem is solved in a way that is anologous to a previous similar problem. Case-bosed reasoning can improve problem-solving behavior In several ways: by providing reasoning shortcuts, by worning of the potential for error, and by suggesting a focus for reasoning. The MEDIATOR was one of the earliest case-based, problem-solving programs. Its domain is dispute resolution, and it uses case-based reasoning for 10 different tasks involved in its problem solving. Whilssome of the MEDIATOR's processes have been elaborated and improved on in later case-based problem solvers, there remain many lessons that con be learned about case-based reasoning by analyzing the MEDIATOR's behavior. This article provides a short description of the MEDIATOR ond its domain , presents its successes and shortcomings, and analyzes the reasons why it behaves the way it does. As part of the onalysis, the differences and similarities between the MEDIATOR and later case-based reasoners ore also described, as well as the implications of those differences. MECH projects.

Its primary purpose is to provide an online communication platform for users to make new friends and interact with them. It may be an ideal platform for online learning community with great potential to facilitate student guidance and counseling work. In this paper, we present findings from a small scale study exploring the potential benefits of Facebook on personal, social, academic and career development. Data were collected from interviews and messages written by the students on Facebook. The results indicated that both students and teachers would benefit from this new approach. The potential benefits of Facebook for students are not only limited to academic development but also in personal/social development and career development.

A basic requirement for enabling such systems to consider students’ individual characteristics is to know these characteristics first. This paper focuses on the consideration of learning styles and introduces a dynamic student modelling approach that monitors students’ behaviour over time and uses these data to build an accurate student model by frequently refining the information in the student model as well as by responding to changes in students’ learning styles over time. The proposed approach is especially useful for LMSs, which are commonly used by educational institutions for whole programs of study and therefore can monitor students’ behaviour over time, in different courses. The paper demonstrates how this approach can be integrated in an adaptive mechanism that enables LMSs to automatically generate courses that fit students’ learning styles and discusses how dynamic student modelling can help in identifying students’ learning styles more accurately, which enables the LMS to provide more accurate adaptivity and therefore support students’ learning processes more effectively.

However, LMSs typically do not consider individual differences of learners and treat all learners equally regardless of their needs and characteristics. In this paper, we focus on the consideration of students’ learning styles. Research about considering learning styles in technology enhanced learning is motivated by educational and psychological theories, which argue that learners have different ways in which they prefer to learn. Furthermore, literature suggests, for example, that learners with a strong preference for a specific learning style may have difficulties in learning if the teaching style does not match with learners’ learning style (Felder & Silverman, 1988; Felder & Soloman, 1997). From a theoretical point of view, conclusion can be drawn that incorporating learners’ learning styles in the learning environment makes learning easier for the learners and increases their learning efficiency. On the other hand, learners whose learning styles are not supported by the learning environment may experience problems in the learning process. Based on these theoretical arguments, several adaptive learning systems have been developed over the last years. Examples of such systems include CS383 (Carver, Howard, & Lane, 1999), IDEAL (Shang, Shi, & Chen, 2001), and LSAS (Bajraktarevic, Hall, & Fullick, 2003), TSAL (Tseng, Chu, Hwang, & Tsai, 2008), and WELSA (Popescu, 2009). Evaluations of these systems demonstrated the possible benefits of considering learning styles in educational systems, showing that learners’ effort can be decreased in terms of time required for learning and the overall learner satisfaction can be increased. Although these adaptive systems seem to support learners very well and therefore demonstrate that considering learning styles can help learners in learning, the systems which are currently used by most educational institutions, namely LMSs, typically do not consider individual differences and in particular do not consider learning styles. A crucial issue for considering individual differences and providing adaptivity is to know the respective characteristics of students first. With respect to learning styles, a lot of adaptive systems use a collaborative student modelling approach, where students are explicitly asked about their learning style preference, for example, by using a questionnaire which students need to fill out before they start to learn in the course. Recently, more and more research has been done on developing automatic student modelling approaches where information about students’ learning styles is identified based on their behaviour and actions in an online course (Cha, Kim, Park, Yoon, Jung, & Lee, 2006; García, Amandi, Schiaffino, & Campo, 2007; Graf, Kinshuk, & Liu, 2009). Such automatic approaches have several advantages over the learning style questionnaires. Since they gather information automatically from students’ behaviour and actions, no additional effort from students is required, such as answering questions of the questionnaire. Furthermore, through using data about students’ behaviour and actions, these approaches are based on data reflecting what students are really doing in an online course rather than on information about what students think they do in a course. Another advantage of automatic approaches is that they use data from a time span rather than from a specific point of time as in questionnaires. This makes automatic approaches more accurate and less error-prone. Most of the automatic student modelling approaches developed for identifying learning styles are static, meaning that learning styles are calculated only once from a certain amount of data (Cha et al., 2006; García et al., 2007; Graf et al., 2009). Since LMSs are typically used for teaching whole programs of study and therefore students learn within such systems for several years, the incorporation of dynamic aspects in student modelling has high potential to develop more accurate student models and therefore make adaptivity more accurate as well. On one hand, dynamic student modelling allows for considering changes in students’ learning styles over years and therefore enables an adaptive LMS to provide students with more accurate adaptivity, leading to courses that reflect the 14 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/dynamic-student-modellinglearning-styles/75537?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Communications and Social Science, InfoSciSelect, InfoSci-Select, InfoSci-Technology Adoption, Ethics, and Human Computer Interaction eJournal Collection.

However, research suggests that students are rather dysregulated in their learning. One major source of dysregulation is based on inaccurate metacognitive judgments made during learning. This study investigated learners’ accuracy and confidence in metacognitive judgments made in the context of learning about the human circulatory system with MetaTutor, a multiagent intelligent hypermedia learning system. 83 college students took part in this study, and their interactions within MetaTutor in the two-hour learning session provided data for this study. In general, the results revealed that learners were overconfident to differing degrees in ratings of their judgments of learning (JOLs) and feelings of knowing (FOKs). It was also found that receiving timely prompts and adaptive feedback from the artificial agent in MetaTutor improved the accuracy of metacognitive judgments. Learners in the Prompt and Feedback condition (PF) were overconfident to a lesser degree than those in other conditions (Prompt Only [PO] and Control). Finally, one-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc results indicated that learners who received prompts and feedback attained significantly (p < .05) better learning efficiency scores than learners in Control and Prompt Only conditions.	agent-based model;command-line interface;eye tracking;hoc (programming language);hypermedia;intelligent agent;interaction;mike lesser;multi-agent system;nelson–aalen estimator;one-way function;online and offline;pedagogical agent	Reza Feyzi-Behnagh;Zohreh Khezri;Roger Azevedo	2011			active learning;overconfidence effect;social psychology;cognitive psychology;psychology;hypermedia;learning environment;experiential learning;cognition;self-regulated learning;metacognition	AI	-74.19232100004021	-46.4217800207285	130497

This makes it a widespread tool for communication and exchange of ideas. Notable to that is an active research in determining the utility of Facebook as a complementary tool in teaching and learning. The uses of the social networking sites especially, Facebook has been reported in a wide variety of results with respect to factors, such as students’ learning performance, involvement, and acceptance, have been reported in the literature. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent studies that employ Facebook as a tool for teaching and learning in institutions of higher education. We analyze the use of Facebook as a teaching and learning tool for various courses. Thereafter, its impacts on enhancing student learning outcomes as well as its negative impact on students’ performance are evaluated. We also highlight the main limitations of the existing and previous studies. Future research directions for incorporating Facebook into the teaching and learning at institutions of higher education are suggested. This review is helpful to educators who plan to integrate Facebook into their teaching as well as to the researchers for further exploration of Facebook as a tool in teaching and learning.

Findings from a recent pilot study, conducted at a MAD training facility, show that the elicitation of canine stakeholder needs while in training is highly dependent on employee interpretation. This paper promotes the use of technology in support of meeting canine user needs, as suggested by the emerging field of Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI), by enabling trainers and employees to accurately elicit and interpret canine stakeholder requirements.	list of toolkits;mad;requirement;requirements elicitation;requirements engineering	Luisa Ruge;Clara Mancini;Rachael Luck	2018			systems engineering;requirements engineering;computer science	HCI	-62.904747595392216	-49.78217202120928	130582
2cda4c3321489182cd9f043b2341f5d655bea9dd	estimating student knowledge from paired interaction data		Estimating students’ knowledge based on their interactions with computer-based tutors has the potential to improve learning by decreasing time taking assessments and facilitating personalized interventions. Although there exist good student models for relatively structured topics and tutors, less progress has been made with more open-ended activities. Further, students often complete activities in pairs rather than individually, with no coding to indicate who performed each action. We investigate whether pair interactions with an open-ended chemistry tutor can be used to predict individual student post test performance. Using L1-regularized regression, we show that student interactions with the tutor are predictive both of the average post-test score for the pair and of individual scores. Towards better understanding pair dynamics in this setting, we also find that for pairs composed of students with similar pre-test scores, we can predict the difference in students’ post-test scores.	existential quantification;interaction;nonlinear gameplay;personalization	Anna N.

Most studies of individual difference have focused on demographic variables, such as: age, gender, education and individual experience. However, this study is concerned with the individual cognitive difference and the adoption of e-learning/m-learning management systems, focusing on the interplay between users' perceptions of behavioural intention and learning styles. The research sample comprises 212 undergraduate students enrolled in a semester-long blended learning class and was used to investigate the effects of learning style on individual beliefs, attitudes, willingness and usage behaviours toward adopting a web-based learning system. This study classifies students into different groups by hierarchical cluster analysis of learning styles. A path analytic model and correlation analysis suggest that learning style influences perceptions of ease of use, usefulness, willingness and usage behaviour.

In contrast to our hypothesis, results showed that children in the gesturing condition performed worse on the posttest than children in the non-gesturing, control condition. A more detailed analysis of the data revealed an expertise reversal effect, indicating that this negative effect on posttest performance materialized for children with lower levels of general language skills, but not for children with higher levels of general language skills. The finding that for children with lower language ability, cognitive load did not decrease as they saw more animations provided additional support for this expertise reversal effect. These findings suggest that the combination of observing and making gestures may have imposed extraneous cognitive load on the lower ability children, which they could not accommodate together with the relatively high intrinsic load imposed by the learning task.

There are two different groups in this study. The first one consists of 14 instructors serving in the Computer Education and Instructional Technology (CEIT) Department of Firat University (FU). This group has supplied expert view in ranking the importance of the matters in the Presentation Evaluation Scale (PES) and in forming the rule base that sets ground for the operation of fuzzy logic mechanism. The second group consists of 41 juniors having the Operating Systems and Applications Course in the CEIT Department of FU. The students in this group make a presentation associated with the units of this course, PES are applied on them and the study is conducted by the data obtained from this scale. Frequencies and percentages and Wilcoxon test is used to analyze the data sets. It is found that there is a significant difference between the PES obtained student scores and those scores that passes through fuzzy logic mechanism. The scores of some students have decreased, those of some have increased while there is no significant change in some of them. Fuzzy logic can be used as an alternative assessment of students' scores.Fuzzy logic utilizes various experts' decisions to create final grades.There is a difference between the traditional scores and fuzzy logic scores.

This study proposes a paradigm model for designers, engineers and scientists, using three barriers to separate the professions. We then report on an empirical study that attempted to validate the understand/transform world barrier in the paradigm model using an online questionnaire. We conclude that the used ‘Attitude About Reality’ scale was unsuitable for measuring this barrier, whereas information about the educational background of the participants was a good predictor for the self-reported profession (designer, engineer or scientist). Interestingly, among the three professions, engineers appear to be the cohesive element, since they often have dual backgrounds, whereas very few participants had dual science/design backgrounds. Engineers could, therefore, build a bridge between designers and scientists, and through their integrative role, could guide the HCI community to realizing its full potential. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

237fd74090535203bbaef4ae8a341dee3d2d0151	scaling short-answer grading by combining peer assessment with algorithmic scoring	automated assessment;peer learning;online learning;assessment	Peer assessment helps students reflect and exposes them to different ideas. It scales assessment and allows large online classes to use open-ended assignments. However, it requires students to spend significant time grading. How can we lower this grading burden while maintaining quality? This paper integrates peer and machine grading to preserve the robustness of peer assessment and lower grading burden. In the identify-verify pattern, a grading algorithm first predicts a student grade and estimates confidence, which is used to estimate the number of peer raters required. Peers then identify key features of the answer using a rubric. Finally, other peers verify whether these feature labels were accurately applied. This pattern adjusts the number of peers that evaluate an answer based on algorithmic confidence and peer agreement. We evaluated this pattern with 1370 students in a large, online design class. With only 54% of the student grading time, the identify-verify pattern yields 80-90% of the accuracy obtained by taking the median of three peer scores, and provides more detailed feedback. A second experiment found that verification dramatically improves accuracy with more raters, with a 20% gain over the peer-median with four raters. However, verification also leads to lower initial trust in the grading system. The identify-verify pattern provides an example of how peer work and machine learning can combine to improve the learning experience.	algorithm;feedback;machine learning;nonlinear gameplay;peer-to-peer	Chinmay Kulkarni;Richard Socher;Michael S.

In this study, collaborative problem based learning (CPBL) supported by flipped learning, a blended learning design, was integrated into a high school bridge computer aided design curriculum. Ninety-one 17-year-old students from two K11 classes were assigned randomly to an experimental group and a control group for the study, respectively. To assess the students' achievements and learning attitudes in the different groups, an 8-week (16 h in total) pre- and post-test quasi-experimental study was designed. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the flipped learning approach. Significant differences were found between the experimental and control group in terms of students' achievements. In the experimental group, students' learning attitudes, motivation and self-evaluation were enhanced. In conclusion, the results show that the flipped learning approach has a positive effect on the transfer of learning. Based on the findings obtained, recommendations for the improvement of future K12 engineering education instruction using the flipped learning approach are provided. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

f794310f117ad67bf32199ecd2bb05e2ba8c5047	strategic interaction 2.0: instructed intercultural pragmatics in an efl context		The potential of web-based 2.0 technology for teaching and assessing intercultural pragmatics has become an area of focus for language educators (Cohen, 2008; Belz, 2005, 2006). Research has highlighted that second and foreign language learners show significant differences from native speakers in language use, in particular, with the execution and comprehension of certain speech acts (Bardovi-Harlig & Mahan-Taylor, 2003). Without effective instruction, differences in pragmatics are evident in the English of learners regardless of their first language background or language proficiency. In EFL contexts, such as Japan, where learners have limited exposure to native speaker norms, teaching and learning pragmatic competence can be particularly challenging. The authors describe an ongoing curriculum development project in a Japanese university context, where the goal is to design and implement an effective approach to teaching interlanguage pragmatics. Digitally enhanced Strategic Interaction (SI) sequences (Di Pietro, 1987) provide opportunities for learners to engage in realistic interactive situations that are mediated by use of model conversations, an online wiki space, and digital video technologies. The online space provides opportunities for learner reflection, peer assisted feedback, and detailed intervention from the instructor. Data analysis from preand postwritten discourse completion tasks suggests that learners are able to use language in more context sensitive ways having engaged with the teaching/learning cycle design.

Indeed, Kasper (1997) famously posed the question as to whether intercultural pragmatics could in fact be taught at all? Specifically, we are interested here in detailing the research design, initial data collection, and analysis aspects of one approach to teaching intercultural pragmatics through an ongoing teaching/ research program. These aspects of the approach are important at this initial stage of implementation, to help establish the learning outcomes and overall efficacy of this process.	digital video;enlightenment foundation libraries;web application;wiki	Neil H.

The Digital MediaWorks team (www.dmw.ca) has evolved the original basic classroom concept over a number of iterations to form the ClinicaVR Suite containing the Classroom-CPT as one of its components. The present study has three aims: investigate certain validity and reliability aspects of the tool; examine the relationship between performance in the virtual test and the attendant sense of presence and cybersickness experienced by participants; assess potential effects of gender and age on performance in the test. The study was conducted with 102 children and adolescents from Grade 2 to Grade 10. All participants were enrolled in a regular school program. Results support both concurrent and construct validity as well as temporal stability of ClinicaVR: Classroom-Continuous Performance Test (CPT). Gender exerted no effect on performance, while age did. The test did not cause much cybersickness.

We present an authoring tool that allows not-technically skilled persons to design mobile learning tasks and deploy them as a web-based mobile application. Since the presented approach is based exclusively on web-technologies, the deployed mobile application can be executed via a mobile browser and therefore is platform independent. Despite previous research efforts carried out in this domain, few of the projects have addressed this course of actions from a purely web-based perspective. Through the latest development of web technologies, mobile applications have access to internal sensors like camera, microphone and GPS and therefore allow data collection within web-applications. In order to validate whether the proposed framework can be applied in educational settings, we conducted a pilot study with experienced teachers and present the results of these efforts in this paper.	global positioning system;microphone;mobile app;sensor;software deployment;web application	Janosch Zbick;Isabella Nake;Marc Jansen;Marcelo Milrad	2014		10.1145/2677972.2678007	web service;application software;web development;web modeling;mobile search;simulation;mobile web;web design;human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;web navigation;multimedia;mobile business development;mobile computing;world wide web	Mobile	-64.92497855921802	-44.03571723113857	132340

The primary characteristic of this approach is that it utilizes video games as observational materials. The underlying idea is that by observing the computational behavior of a wide variety of video games, learners will easily grasp the fundamental architecture, theory, and technology of computers.  The results of a case study conducted indicate that the method enhances the motivation of students for deeper learning of computer science concepts.	computer science;teaching method	Hiroyuki Nagataki	2014		10.1145/2670757.2670770	simulation;human–computer interaction;turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games;computer science;emergent gameplay;game mechanics;multimedia	AI	-70.2907159681855	-42.57460632431872	132388

SitPed is built on the assertion that authoring tools should use the learner’s perspective to the greatest extent possible. SitPed provides tools for creating tasks lists, authoring assessment knowledge, and creating tutor messages. We present preliminary findings of a two-phase study comparing authoring in SitPed to an ablated version of the same system and a spreadsheet-based control. Findings suggest modest advantages for SitPed in terms of the quality of the authored content and student learning.	assertion (software development);pedagogical agent;programming by demonstration;situated;spreadsheet;two-phase locking	H.

The study investigates the patterns of interaction between tutors and students in both platforms, including the manner in which tutors and students engage during the tutoring sessions. The students' experiences and perceptions of e-tutoring interventions are also explored. The findings reveal that although the two modes of tutoring were equally effective (both groups showed improvement in their grammar performance, with no discernible difference between the two groups), the F2F group members overcame their negative feelings toward English to a greater extent than the TB group members. Interestingly, although the findings reveal that the TB tutors engaged in more tutoring strategies than the F2F tutors, the F2F students perceived more self-improvement in their English performance and were more likely to evaluate the tutors and the e-tutoring program positively than the TB group. The paper concludes by offering some recommendations for future studies on different tutoring modes using computer conferencing.	experiment;text-based (computing)	Ejean Wu;Wen-Chuan Lin;Shu Ching Yang	2013	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2012.11.018	mathematics education;computer science;english;grammar;multimedia;videoconferencing;pedagogy	NLP	-73.92467639931459	-43.1531557805278	132519

To address this question, we used a mixed-method approach to study 74 first-year university students who were randomly assigned to work in dyads on an ill-defined problem of biodiversity collapse in tropical forests within a computer-supported collaborative learning setting. The quantitative analysis revealed that neither temporal synchronicity nor transactivity was related to the quality of group products. The qualitative analysis of chat transcripts revealed that the variability between the groups could be explained by group dynamics, students’ prior knowledge, confidence in managing the learning task, collaborative strategy and communication skills. The study findings could be used to optimize collaboration by informing students directly of their activities or the teachers that scaffold these activities.	high- and low-level;mechatronics;randomness;spatial variability;synchronicity	Vitaliy Popov;Anouschka van Leeuwen;S.

However, giving advice and evaluating each discussion takes long time. This paper introduces the overview of a discussion analysis tool. It helps instructors to analyze the discussion records by observing topic flow of the discussion and by comparing it with that of another record. This system translates the discussion records into a form of a time-sequenced speech acts and an argumentation diagram, and then calculates several features of the discussion record which are used to evaluate such a record. The overview of the system and its evaluation are introduced here.	diagram	Shumpei Kubosawa;Kei Nishina;Masaki Sugimoto;Shogo Okada;Katsumi Nitta	2013		10.1145/2514601.2514626	simulation;co-occurrence;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence	Web+IR	-76.28453469286575	-44.33317284078673	133103

Technologies play a central role in mediating the multi-level, intertwined processes. Emergent technologies should be designed to support this mediation. Collaboration environments should be designed to prepare groups, individuals and communities to take advantage of the technical functionality and to promote learning at all levels.

The study also investigated potential gender differences in the gameu0027s learning effectiveness and motivational appeal. The sample was 88 students, who were randomly assigned to two groups, one of which used the gaming application (Group A, N=47) and the other one the non-gaming one (Group B, N=41). A Computer Memory Knowledge Test (CMKT) was used as the pretest and posttest. Students were also observed during the interventions. Furthermore, after the interventions, studentsu0027 views on the application they had used were elicited through a feedback questionnaire. Data analyses showed that the gaming approach was both more effective in promoting studentsu0027 knowledge of computer memory concepts and more motivational than the non-gaming approach. Despite boysu0027 greater involvement with, liking of and experience in computer gaming, and their greater initial computer memory knowledge, the learning gains that boys and girls achieved through the use of the game did not differ significantly, and the game was found to be equally motivational for boys and girls. The results suggest that within high school CS, educational computer games can be exploited as effective and motivational learning environments, regardless of studentsu0027 gender.

It reports a study located in a novel multi-surface environment, configured to support small teams who are designing for other people’s learning. Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers’ work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.

We propose conventions for describing agent actions and interactions, and offer advice for effective use of boundary objects in a group process of building ABMs. We found that 1) an early boundary object was helpful for teaching stakeholders basic ABM concepts, 2) physical correspondence between boundary objects and model interfaces improved participant engagement, 3) group ownership of the model was threatened when the modeling team failed to capture needed model elements through the boundary object, 4) adherence to boundary object conventions improved when participants were given specific charges, 5) with hands-on exposure, the model graphical user interface became an effective boundary object.	agent-based model;graphical user interface;hands-on computing;interaction	Johnie Rose;Laura Homa;Peter Hovmand;Alison Kraus;Kelly Burgess;Anindita Biswas;Heide Aungst;Sarah T Cherng;Rick Riolo;Kurt C.

The major goal is to raise the standard of education. The factors that affect university students' behavioral intention (BI) to use e-learning for educational purposes in Azerbaijan are worthy of study. This is an empirical study of the use of the General Extended Technology Acceptance Model for E-learning (GETAMEL) developed by Abdullah and Ward (2016) in order to determine the factors that affect undergraduate students' BI to use an e-learning system. The data was collected from 714 undergraduate and masters students using a convenient sampling technique and the responses were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). It is seen that the Subjective norm (SN), Experience (EXP) and Enjoyment (ENJOY) positively and significantly influence students' perceived usefulness (PU) of e-learning, while Computer anxiety (CA) has a negatively effect. EXP, ENJOY and Self-efficacy (SE) positively and significantly affect their perceived ease of use (PEOU) of e-learning. It is also seen that SN has a positive and significant impact on BI to use e-learning, while Technological innovation (TI) significantly moderates the relationship between SN and PU, PU and BI to use e-learning. This study is the first to determine a negative and significant relationship between CA and PU, in the context of students’ e-learning. This study is also one of the very few that uses the GETAMEL model for e-learning settings. The results have significant practical implications for educational institutions and decision-makers, in terms of the design of the e-learning system in universities.

The tool is based on a general model in which the instructor maintains a library of mini-games that are easily produced by customizing generic game patterns (e.g. a simple jigsaw puzzle). The authors can then compile a working set of mini-games and distribute it to the students so that they can play using their own portable game devices. Moreover, the game packs produced with e-Training DS can track the students’ activity and send the results to the back-end e-learning environment. In this manner instructors can evaluate the students’ performance using the facilities provided by the elearning system. While -Training DS is focused on the Computer Science field and the Nintendo DSTM game console, the approach proposed can be repurposed for other knowledge areas and devices.	compiler;computer science;nintendo ds and 3ds storage devices;portable computer;working set	Roberto Tornero;Javier Torrente;Pablo Moreno-Ger;Baltasar Fernández-Manjón	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-17407-0_27	game design;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;database;game developer;multimedia;video game development;world wide web	AI	-67.15548141349677	-41.090107444985854	133888

In order to get reliable usability problems, it is necessary for the evaluators to establish a supportive relationship and communicate effectively with the users. This study investigated the relation and communication between the evaluators and test users in Chinese usability testing sessions. Field observations and interviews were conducted in five companies in Beijing. This research was based mainly on Nisbett's cultural theory and Boren and Ramey's thinking aloud model. The results of the study showed that Chinese users focused mainly on tasks, while evaluators focused on both users and tasks. Further, Chinese users did not think aloud actively; thus, in order to encourage users to speak out, effective communication skills were required for Chinese evaluators. Retrospective thinking aloud and explanation were also used in the tests. Finally, it discussed that communication was appropriate for the formative evaluations, but not for the summative evaluations.	field research;usability testing	Qingxin Shi	2008		10.1145/1463160.1463198	pluralistic walkthrough;think aloud protocol;web usability;cognitive walkthrough;usability;human–computer interaction;computer science;usability engineering;multimedia;heuristic evaluation;usability lab;culture;field research;partial concurrent thinking aloud	HCI	-71.33424273594554	-43.34713383067747	133919

We provide descriptive properties of the network, demonstrating that the coenrollment networks evaluated follow power-law degree distributions similar to many other large-scale networks; that they reveal strong performance-based assortativity; and that network-based features can significantly improve GPA-based student performance predictors. We then implement a network-based, multi-view classification model to predict students' final course grades. In particular, we adapt a structural modeling approach from [19, 34], whereby we model the university-wide undergraduate coenrollment network as an undirected graph. We compare the performance of our predictor to traditional methods used for grade prediction in undergraduate university courses, and demonstrate that a multi-view ensembling approach outperforms both prior """"flat"""" and network-based models for grade prediction across several classification metrics. These findings demonstrate the usefulness of combining diverse approaches in models of student success, and demonstrate specific network-based modeling strategies which are likely to be most effective for grade prediction."""	assortativity;class diagram;graph (discrete mathematics);kerrison predictor;performance tuning;semantic network	Josh Gardner;Christopher Brooks	2018		10.1145/3170358.3170373	data science;grading (education);computer science;assortativity;learning analytics;graph	Web+IR	-76.58868318843551	-51.27154901424157	134030

Adoption of cloud computing in education has the potential to enhance the management of knowledge. This study aims to investigate the antecedents and consequences of cloud computing adoption in education to achieve knowledge management. Thereby, this study implemented the cloud computing in an authentic learning environment to support knowledge management practices and provided participants with training and education. Pre-tests and post-tests were administered on the first and last week of the 14-week intervention. This study examined the causal relationship between the expectations for knowledge management practices and the perceived usefulness of cloud computing services. Further, the causal relationships among innovativeness, training and education, and perceived ease of use were examined in the study. Survey data collected from 221 undergraduate students were analyzed by using structural equation modeling to validate the research model. The results indicate that the perceived usefulness is significantly associated with the expectations for knowledge creation and discovery, storage, and sharing. Amongst others, the expectations for knowledge storage and sharing have a stronger relationship with the perceived usefulness. Further, innovativeness and training & education are significantly associated with the ease of use perceptions. The findings suggested that educational institutions may promote adoption of cloud computing in education by increasing the awareness of knowledge management practices.	causality;cloud computing;knowledge management;structural equation modeling;usability	Ibrahim Arpaci	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.01.024	cloud computing;computer science;knowledge management;management science;personal knowledge management	HCI	-75.83069802236074	-40.64986370730124	134062

Web search engine/directory. It investigated these users’ cognitive, affective, and physical behaviors as they sought the answer for a factfinding task. It analyzed and compared the overall patterns of children’s and graduate students’ Web activities, including searching moves, browsing moves, backtracking moves, looping moves, screen scrolling, target location and deviation moves, and the time they took to complete the task. The authors applied Bilal’s Web Traversal Measure to quantify these users’ effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of moves they made. Results were based on 14 children’s Web sessions and nine graduate students’ sessions. Both groups’ Web activities were captured online using Lotus ScreenCam, a software package that records and replays online activities in Web browsers. Children’s affective states were captured via exit interviews. Graduate students’ affective states were extracted from the journal writings they kept during the traversal process. The study findings reveal that 89% of the graduate students found the correct answer to the search task as opposed to 50% of the children. Based on the Measure, graduate students’ weighted effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of the Web moves they made were much higher than those of the children. Regardless of success and weighted scores, however, similarities and differences in information seeking were found between the two groups. Yahooligans! poor structure of keyword searching was a major factor that contributed to the ‘‘breakdowns’’ children and graduate students experienced. Unlike children, graduate students were able to recover from ‘‘breakdowns’’ quickly and effectively. Three main factors influenced these users’ performance: ability to recover from ‘‘breakdowns’’, navigational style, and focus on task. Children and graduate students made recommendations for improving Yahooligans! interface design. Implications for Web user training and system design improvements are made. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This belief is not unfounded as the majority of online computer science teaching materials require modern technology and Internet connectivity, making these tools inaccessible to the low-tech classroom. As a solution, we developed SAS® CodeSnaps, a free tool that provides an engaging coding experience with minimal technology. One iPad and one robot (www.sphero.com) are all that is needed for every student in a classroom to code. With CodeSnaps, students program together using printable coding blocks. When their program is ready, they """"snap"""" a picture using the CodeSnaps app which digitizes their code and executes it on a robot, allowing students to see their program execute in the real world. In this poster we present lesson plans for both a single engagement with students as well as week-long introduction to CS fundamentals centered around the CodeSnaps app. We also discuss results from two pilot studies designed to measure student engagement during these lessons."""	computer science;laptop;robot;sas;tablet computer;ipad	Jennifer Sabourin;Lucy Kosturko;Scott W.

97bf94b0707c0257a80004c96b7b71fc7106e0fd	traceit: an air tracing reading tool for children with dyslexia		In this paper, we explore how assistive technology can be used to support the learning development of children with dyslexia. Dyslexia is the most common learning disability. Existing strategies employed to help dyslexic children to read include multi-sensory methods such as tracing letters in the air. New technologies could help them learn by utilising all senses. In this paper, we present TraceIt, an interactive learning tool to teach children with dyslexia how to read through multi-sensory methods to include visual, auditory and kinaesthetic movement. Building upon prior work on tangible interaction, it allows students to air trace alphabets using physical objects of a specific colour to interact with the reading program. Based on evaluations conducted at the Dyslexia Association of Malaysia, this paper contributes towards understanding the opportunities as well as challenges involved in applying such interaction technique to support the learning development of children with dyslexia.

To achieve this, we conducted an empirical study, where we compared the intelligent system with a non-intelligent version of it. The results of the study revealed that the students of the intelligent version of the Web-based CALL had gained more knowledge of the domain and had been able to interact with the system more effectively as compared to the students that had used the non-intelligent version of the system.	artificial intelligence;world wide web	Victoria Tsiriga;Maria Virvou	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-45226-3_38	natural language processing;computer science;machine learning;multimedia	AI	-76.11848683228223	-46.74101764229128	134735

This paper addresses this issue by exploring the experiences of couples that play World of Warcraft together. Learning outcomes were identified (involving the management of ludic, social and material resources) along with learning processes, which followed Wenger’s model of participation in Communities of Practice. Comparing this with existing literature suggests that productive comparisons can be drawn with the experiences of distance education students and the social pressures that affect their participation.	experience;ludic interface;virtual world;world of warcraft	Martin Oliver;Diane Carr	2009	BJET	10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.00948.x	psychology;computer simulation;games;educational technology;social learning;simulation;computer science;instructional simulation;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-72.0473559608094	-40.99016413176584	134748

Through the heuristic evaluation the researchers wanted to ensure that the preferred game attributes are present and accounted for in the first Episode of the mobile serious game for statistics. This enabled the researchers to: (i) assess whether the conceptual features of the educational game pose potential problems to prospective first year student users, and (ii) to incorporate participants' contributions into game design realities. Three game attributes formed part of the heuristic evaluation: (i) character-based inquiry; (ii) gameplay-related inquiry; and (iii) user-interface design. The results indicated that the students were satisfied with the elements conceptualised for the game and contributed greatly in terms of gameplay and character enquiry.	heuristic evaluation;prospective search;text-based (computing);user interface design;video game design	Lance Bunt;Verona Leendertz;Seugnet Blignaut	2017		10.1145/3136907.3136940	simulation;game testing;heuristic evaluation;algorithmic game theory;statistics;simulations and games in economics education;game developer;game design;game mechanics;computer science;game design document	HCI	-64.59920958483495	-45.19433803831553	134943

The human factors that were taken into consideration in the personalization process were cognitive style, visual working memory span, control/speed of processing and anxiety. With the exception of control/speed of processing, matching the instructional style to users’ characteristics was revealed to be statistically significant in optimizing their performance (n=219). On the basis of this empirical assessment, this paper argues that individual differences at this intrinsic level are important, and their main effect can be manipulated by taking advantage of adaptive technologies.	experiment;human factors and ergonomics;personalization	Nikos Tsianos;Zacharias Lekkas;Panagiotis Germanakos;Costas Mourlas;George Samaras	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-70987-9_24	psychology;cognitive psychology;developmental psychology;cognitive style;cognitive load;social psychology	HCI	-73.62482904249734	-45.03295531403285	135006

While this syntax barrier is known to exist, whether and how it varies across programming languages has not been carefully investigated. For this article, we conducted four empirical studies on programming language syntax as part of a larger analysis into the, so called, programming language wars. We first present two surveys conducted with students on the intuitiveness of syntax, which we used to garner formative clues on what words and symbols might be easy for novices to understand. We followed up with two studies on the accuracy rates of novices using a total of six programming languages: Ruby, Java, Perl, Python, Randomo, and Quorum. Randomo was designed by randomly choosing some keywords from the ASCII table (a metaphorical placebo). To our surprise, we found that languages using a more traditional C-style syntax (both Perl and Java) did not afford accuracy rates significantly higher than a language with randomly generated keywords, but that languages which deviate (Quorum, Python, and Ruby) did. These results, including the specifics of syntax that are particularly problematic for novices, may help teachers of introductory programming courses in choosing appropriate first languages and in helping students to overcome the challenges they face with syntax.	computer science;java;perl;procedural generation;programming language;python;randomness;ruby	Andreas Stefik;Susanna Siebert	2013	TOCE	10.1145/2534973	natural language processing;fourth-generation programming language;this;computer science;third-generation programming language;programming paradigm;fifth-generation programming language;programming language theory;visual programming language;programming language;homoiconicity;second-generation programming language;high-level programming language;comparison of multi-paradigm programming languages;syntax error	HCI	-72.94808759543652	-46.30657048640682	135088

The key to overcoming this challenge is to approach design from the perspective that active video games are a unique combination of traditional video games and sports. By combining models of engagement - or flow - in both video games and sports a novel model of active video games is proposed. The proposed model highlights the element of institutionalization as absent from existing models of active games while it is ubiquitous in sports. From the proposed model stems the hypothesis that a successful active video game will support styles of play that vary along dimensions of physicality, competition, and institutionalization.	massively multiplayer online role-playing game;nist hash function competition	Robin Langerait;Monica Zaczynski;Anthony D.

With a focus on narrative-centered learning environments, this paper presents an inductive framework for inferring users’ psychological characteristics from observations of their interactions with virtual agents. Trained on traces of users’ interactions with virtual agents in the environment, psychological user models are induced from the interactions to accurately infer different aspects of a user’s personality. Further, analyses of timing data suggest that these induced models are also able to converge on correct predictions after a relatively small number of interactions with virtual agents.	converge;intelligent agent;interaction;tracing (software)	Jennifer L.

26305427778f77f6e01ed027803075181e25297d	a mobile instructional pervasive game method for language learning		In this paper, a mobile instructional pervasive game (M-IPG) learning method is proposed for improving students’ learning achievements with respect to vocabulary, grammar, reading, and writing. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in an EFL course at a university school. A total of 137 university students participated in the experiment, 67 of whom were assigned to the experimental group and followed with the M-IPG approach, whilst 70 students were in the control group and was taught with the mobile inquiry-based instruction. From the empirical obtained, it was found that the proposed approach could effectively promote students’ learning achievement, as well as decrease their cognitive load of learning and perceptions of the use of M-IPG learning. It was found from the interviews that most of the participants perceived the M-IPG learning method to be a stimulating though challenging learning task that facilitated them in improving their location-based learning in the aspects of language learning and practice, learning contents recall, and confidence in using the language.	competitive analysis (online algorithm);compiler;enlightenment foundation libraries;experiment;formal language;location-based service;logic programming;mass effect trilogy;mobile game;multimodal interaction;natural language processing;pervasive informatics;vocabulary;while	Ching Chang;Ju-Ling Shih;Chih-Kai Chang	2016	Universal Access in the Information Society	10.1007/s10209-016-0496-6	kinesthetic learning;cooperative learning;educational technology;team learning;blended learning;computer science;knowledge management;experiential learning;teaching method;multimedia;active learning;rote learning;open learning;synchronous learning	HCI	-72.85261692880151	-39.984277537003926	135772

While flipped classrooms typically provide students with opportunities for social interaction that feature active learning, online learners are not typically afforded these opportunities. Cooperative learning techniques like Lightweight Teams provide social, collaborative learning opportunities to students in flipped classrooms but extending these techniques to distance learning settings is not straightforward. In this paper, we present our experiences with online, distributed Lightweight Teams. We present an in-the-wild study that compares learning outcomes and student preferences between co-located and distributed Lightweight Teams against the base case of individual learning. Our results show that while there are no significant learning differences between the two team conditions and the individual condition, students significantly prefer the team conditions.	recursion	Stephen MacNeil;Celine Latulipe;N.

By visualising learning design decisions, this article highlights the need to capture educators' “tacit” knowledge relating to course material, activity types and workload, through employing learning analytics methods in order to analyse the learning designs of courses taken by 60,000+ students, common pedagogical patterns are identified. When analysing 157 learning designs using a taxonomy of seven different learning activities, we found that the majority of educators used two types of learning activities most widely, namely assimilative activities (reading, watching videos and listening to audio) and assessment activities. Surprisingly, educators do not choose different activity types based upon function (eg, replace one type of student-activating activity by another), but patterns can be seen where educators combine assimilative, productive and assessment activities or assimilative, finding and handling information and communication tasks. While educators rely heavily on assimilative and assessment activities, no positive correlation was found between any of the seven learning design activity types and student outcomes. Our initial findings suggest that student outcomes are negatively correlated with a high proportion of assimilative activities. Further studies are needed to establish whether particular learning design decisions are related to student outcomes and whether these findings can be replicated in different research settings.	pedagogical agent;word lists by frequency	Lisette Toetenel;Bart Rienties	2016	BJET	10.1111/bjet.12423	psychology;simulation;visualization;computer science;knowledge management;experiential learning;teaching method;instructional design;multimedia;management;correlation;reading;taxonomy;pedagogy	HCI	-74.24046128120418	-44.9658641672008	135807

Starting from emotion frameworks in affective computing and education, we considered a larger set of emotions than in related research. For emotion labeling, we started from a standard methodology that relies on trained judges to report emotions over 20-s intervals, however, we asked judges to report all observed emotions in each interval, as opposed to only choosing one, as is standard practice. This variation allows us to discuss the appropriateness of this interval for emotion labeling. We present a detailed analysis of interrater reliability, both aggregated and over individual students, that considers not only labeling agreement among judges in terms of emotion type, but also with respect to the number of emotions detected. We also provide an analysis based on in-depth one-to-one interviews with judges, to gain insights on the challenges they encountered in labeling emotions.	affective computing;emotion markup language;inter-rater reliability;norm (social);one-to-one (data model)	Cristina Conati;Mirela Gutica	2015	International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education	10.1007/s40593-015-0081-9	psychology;emotion;interview;artificial intelligence;inter-rater reliability;social psychology;observation;clinical psychology;statistics;pedagogy	HCI	-74.49263391527803	-44.88984834116907	135906

Heuristic evaluation is a widely known and popular method within the area of human-computer interaction and the information visualization community now also recognizes its usefulness. However, in this area it is not applied to the same extent. In its original form the method has limitations that need to be considered in order for it to be optimal for information visualization. The aim with this paper is to provide the reader with knowledge about the method and awareness of what issues that call for refined or supplemental actions and resources in order for it to generate as valid and useful results as possible. The paper also discusses the research challenges for future work in how to further improve the method.	heuristic evaluation;human–computer interaction;information visualization	Camilla Forsell	2012	2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation	10.1109/IV.2012.33	visual analytics;information visualization;human–computer interaction;computer science;data science;data mining;heuristic evaluation	Visualization	-63.78547207219379	-46.14741190862585	136043

However, finding optimal model parameters is usually a difficult non-convex optimization problem when considering latent variable models. Prior work has reported that latent variable models obtained from educational data vary in their predictive performance, plausibility, and consistency. Unfortunately, there are still no unified quantitative measurements of these properties. This paper suggests a general unified framework (that we call Polygon) for multifaceted evaluation of student models. The framework takes all three dimensions mentioned above into consideration and offers novel metrics for the quantitative comparison of different student models. These properties affect the effectiveness of the tutoring experience in a way that traditional predictive performance metrics fall short. The present work demonstrates our methodology of comparing Knowledge Tracing with a recent model called FeatureAware Student Knowledge Tracing (FAST) on datasets from different tutoring systems. Our analysis suggests that FAST generally improves on Knowledge Tracing along all dimensions studied.	convex optimization;latent variable;mathematical optimization;mechatronics;optimization problem;personalization;plausibility structure;unified framework	Yun Huang;José P.

Pace in a session is defined as the number of logged actions divided by session length (in minutes). Log files of 6,112 students were collected, and datasets were constructed for examining pace rank consistency in three main situations: day/night sessions, beginning/end (for both situations, sessions of the same learning mode were taken), and a comparison between sessions from different learning modes. For each dataset, students were ranked twice, according to their pace in the two sub-groups, and these ranks were correlated. Results obtained with this study's data suggest that pace is sometimes not consistent, hence might not be considered as a characterizing measure for the whole learning period. A discussion of this study and further research is provided.

Self-determination theory (SDT) is used as a lens for understanding the mechanism by which these traits might lead to enjoyment. Specifically, the argument is that feedback, rules, and social elements of games will fulfill the dimensions of SDT - competence autonomy, and relatedness. Then, the dimensions of SDT will predict enjoyment. Participants were presented with a game that emphasized feedback, rules, or social elements. Games that emphasized flexible rules led to feelings of competence while games that emphasized social elements led to feelings of relatedness. Competence and elatedness then led to feelings of enjoyment. In doing so, this study identifies key elements of video games while illuminating ways to understand video game enjoyment.

4467ae1d41a0498a3ed1424dffe0d58baa2ede32	boosting engagement with educational software using near wins		Boosting engagement with educational software has been promoted as a means of improving student performance. We examine two promising and relatively understudied manipulations from the realm of gambling: the near-win effect and anticipation. The near-win effect occurs when an individual comes close to achieving a goal, while anticipation refers to the build-up of suspense as an outcome is revealed (e.g., losing early vs. late). Gambling psychologists have long studied how near-wins affect engagement in pure-chance games but it is difficult to do the same in an educational context where outcomes are based on skill. We manipulate the display of outcomes such that artificial near-wins are introduced largely independent of a student’s performance. In a study involving thousands of students using an online math tutor, we examine how this manipulation affects a behavioral measure of engagement. We find a near-win effect on engagement when the ‘win’ indicates to the student that they may continue to the next lesson. Nonetheless, when we experimentally induce near wins in a randomized controlled trial, we do not obtain a reliable effect of the near win. We conclude by describing manipulations that might increase the effect of near wins on engagement.	boosting (machine learning);experiment;randomized algorithm	Mohammad M. Khajah;Michael C.

We followed a User-Centered Design (UCD) process to develop the game. During the design process, older adults tested the game and it was refined based on their feedback and the research team’s observation of their play. We found that incorporating older adults into the design process significantly improved the design, as they provided insights that would not have been available otherwise. We also concluded that the older adults’ involvement in the design process could make the game better tailored to their needs. The game is currently being field-tested.	usability testing	Amir Doroudian;Simone Hausknecht;David Kaufman	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-92037-5_36	engineering design process;human–computer interaction;usability;design process;user-centered design;computer science;needs assessment	HCI	-62.9216103266557	-43.15805131417946	136659

After a discussion of distributed cognition and the role of mediating artefacts in real world cognitions, the ‘Copy and Paste’ function is redesigned to embed an effective interaction strategy, based on encoding strategies, into the interface. The current affordances of the ‘Copy and Paste’ interaction derived from its business heritage (speed and accuracy of reproduction) are contrasted with those needed for a learning interaction (the meaningful processing of content for understanding). An empirical study was conducted to test the efficacy of the redesigned function through an experimental treatment. The study examined the impact of an experimental treatment based on changes to the ‘Copy and Paste’ function in terms of: (a) changes to interaction strategies employed by learners; (b) changes in learner familiarity with note taking and summarisation interaction strategies; (c) changes to the features of the text produced by learners. The experimental task consisted of participants completing three short written assessment tasks based on multiple text resources using either: (i) Control treatment: standard notepad tools supplemented by a text-based resource outlining notetaking and summarisation strategies; or (ii) Experimental treatment: the modified notepad. The results of the study showed that participants in the experimental group spent significantly more time engaged in activities that indicated higher levels of cognitive processing and produced notes that contained text features that also indicated significantly higher levels of cognitive processing. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to conduct such an investigation, I recorded ten meetings of graduate student designers charged with redesigning documents for the United States Postal Service. I then used discourse analysis techniques to determine how the designers used findings from research phases as evidence to support proposed design decisions in meetings concerning prototype alterations. Results show that these designers overwhelmingly do not support their design decisions with specific evidence from usability studies. This neglect of research-based evidence may indicate that these novice UCD designers may resort to designer-centric design behaviors in decision-making periods. My analysis will focus on the rhetorical reasons why designers may avoid research-based evidence.	document;iteration;postal;prototype;usability testing;user-centered design	Erin Friess	2007		10.1145/1240866.1240873	human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;empirical research;management;world wide web	HCI	-70.89826734373663	-44.00484337838622	136781

While information-seeking activities are necessary for collaborating actors to acquire new information, the activities involved in information seeking are often performed by varying subgroups of actors. Consequently, collaborative grounding is necessary to share information among collaborating actors and, thereby, establish and maintain the common ground necessary for their collaborative work. By focusing on the collaborative level, collaborative information seeking aims to avoid both individual reductionism and group reductionism, while at the same time recognizing that only some information and understanding need be shared.	collaborative information seeking;reductionism	Morten Hertzum	2008	Inf.

We investigate a novel real-time feedback system that enables a subtle and unobtrusive interaction between learners and trainers in the context of debates. Novices to structured debates practiced in debate clubs need to learn fundamental rhetorical skills. The argumentation follows a well-defined structure: claim, explanation and example. Learners receive feedback about their rhetorical performance in the end of debates which complicates the immediate adaptation. We introduce a real-time feedback system enabling an unobtrusive teacher-student dialog. Teachers virtually communicate their assessment about the presented performance using a smart phone; students adapt the structure of their debate according to the visual feedback that is presented on a tablet. We tested our prototype in the field and applied it to two debates. We found that participants that used our feedback system valued the immediate feedback and stated high satisfaction about their own performance.	feedback;prototype;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;smartphone;tablet computer;dialog	Bernd Huber;Sarah Tausch;Heinrich Hußmann	2014		10.1145/2559206.2581281	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;feedback;multimedia;peer feedback	HCI	-67.4530750018377	-44.98709918724571	136907

The proposal is based on the premise that the technology used in AR, such as mobile devices, is familiar to the student. When used in a collaborative manner, the technology is able to achieve a greater level of direct engagement with the proposed content, thereby improving academic outcomes. The objective was to assess the feasibility of using AR on mobile devices in educational environments and to investigate the relationship between the usability of the tool, student participation, and the improvement in academic performance after using AR. The validation was performed through a case study in which students were able to experience a virtual construction process overlapped onto real environments. Results were obtained by students' pre-tests and post-tests. In line with our assumptions, the use of mobile devices in the classroom is highly correlated with motivation, and there is a significant correlation with academic achievement. However, the difficulty of using and generating content is a complex factor that suggests difficulty when implementing more complicated models.	augmented reality	David Fonseca;Nuria Martí;Ernest Redondo;Isidro Navarro;Albert Sánchez Riera	2014	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2013.03.006	cognitive psychology;design;augmented reality;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;virtual reality;multimedia;interactivity;world wide web	HCI	-69.51924166721648	-42.56891295398063	137074
18cfc811d515ae37623f7b8dbb6c4b831011e275	development and evaluation of a personalized computer-aided question generation for english learners to improve proficiency and correct mistakes		In the last several years, the field of computer–assisted language learning has increasingly focused on computer– aided question generation. However, this approach often provides examinees with an exhaustive amount of questions that are not designed for any specific testing purpose. In this work, we present a personalized computer-aided question generation that generates multiple–choice questions at various difficulty levels and types, including vocabulary, grammar and reading comprehension. In order to improve the weaknesses of examinees, it selects questions depending on a student’s estimated proficiency level and unclear concepts behind incorrect responses. This study’s results show that the students with the personalized automatic quiz generation corrected their mistakes more frequently than ones only with computer–aided question generation. Moreover, students demonstrated the most progress between the pre–test and post–test and correctly answered more difficult questions. Finally, we investigated the personalizing strategy and found that a student could make a significant progress if the proposed system offered the vocabulary questions at the same level of a student’s proficiency level, and if the grammar and reading comprehension questions were at a level lower than the student’s.	anytime algorithm;book;deployment environment;list comprehension;natural language processing;open reading frame;personalization;test case;turing test;vocabulary	Yi-Ting Huang;Meng Chang Chen;Yeali S.

(1)Contest related content (2) Value-adding content (3). Designand technology related entertainment. These types arose in an empirical study, a usability evaluation, conducted on twenty test persons. Methods used were usage of general forms, think-aloud protocol with task analysis in combination with a more 'free surf' approach. The level of intervention of the evaluators were also changed between tests. Finally, interviews, both about the web page and the experiment in itself were conducted. The tests were done with both single users as well as pair of users. The main purpose of the tests were to find guidelines in how to evaluate entertainment web sites. The findings show that there are actually guidance to give from out of the three categories of entertainment. Intervention could actually be a good thing sometimes, working together is both good and bad, depending on which of the above mentioned category we are striving to say something about and finally traditional task analysis is not all bad for testing entertainment after all.

The work is then extended to examine how student interaction and student learning styles affect the learning outcomes. Different responses to the media combinations are observed and significant differences occur between learners classified as Sensing and Reflective learners. The experiment also identified some important differences in performance with the different media combinations by students registered as Dyslexic. The experiment was therefore repeated with a much larger sample of Dyslexic learners and the earlier effects were found to be significant. The results were surprising and may provide useful guidance for the design of material for Dyslexic students.	diagram;digital media;experiment;reflection (computer programming)	James L. Alty;A.

26460d37f75e65ebdf4e2b015b3cefa7c31c855e	diagram-based support for collaborative learning in mathematical exercise	collaborative learning;support function;rule based	This paper focuses on the collaborative learning of mathematics in which learners effectively acquire knowledge of common exercises through discussion with other learners. During collaborative learning, learners sometimes cannot solve exercises successfully, because they cannot derive answers by themselves or they hesitate to propose answers through discussion. To cope with such situations, this paper proposes two support functions using diagrams to encourage active discussion, since diagrams are often used to graphically illustrate mathematical concepts. One function indicates the differences between learner diagrams and the group diagram in order to encourage participation in discussions. To compare the characteristics of diagrams drawn by different learners, internal representation of the diagram, which consists of types of figures and remarkable relations to other figures, is introduced. The other function provides hints in the group diagram so that all learners can consider their answers collaboratively through discussions. Since preparing hints for all exercises is difficult, rules for drawing supplementary figures, which are general methods for drawing supplementary figures that correspond to individual answering methods/formulas, are also developed. By applying available rules to current group diagram, appropriate supplementary figures that can solve current learning situations may be generated. The experimental results showed that the generated hints successfully increased the number of utterances in the groups. Moreover, learners were also able to derive answers by themselves and tended to propose more opinions in discussions when the uniqueness of their diagrams was indicated. key words: collaborative learning, problem-based learning, knowledge acquisition, rule-based processing, diagram support, predicate-formed representation	diagram;knowledge acquisition;logic programming	Tomoko Kojiri;Yosuke Murase;Toyohide Watanabe	2009	IEICE Transactions		support function;collaborative learning;speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;programming language;expert system;algorithm	ML	-77.0858645195185	-46.791172033851005	138351

We used four approaches in implementing the CAL tools for user visualization that is, that is, 2-D, 3-D, coach environment and desktop virtual reality. The designed CAL tools have been enhanced to enable the integration and investigation of visualization in various engineering problems for undergraduates with particular weak learners. Each problem was designed using different authoring tool. More significantly, we have enhanced some of the CAL tools to the degree where the user can interact and be coached independently. This dramatically increases the quality of the tools i.e. patterns of interactions, 2-D and 3-D views of synthetic models. In general the result shows that the CAL tools could alleviate the user interacting and instill a sense of learning and the user understand the engineering problem better.	cal;desktop computer;interaction;synthetic intelligence;virtual reality	Manjit Singh Sidhu;N.

Increasingly, academic computing service groups find themselves trying to decide when and how quickly to deploy new online services. As new forms of commercial and open source web-based applications become available at a quickening pace, for instance, questions arise as to whether a significant number of local users would actually use them. Moreover, the widespread use of XML and stylesheets as underlying presentation technologies in these web applications present academic support groups with even more deployment decisions, such as whether or not to invest time and resources in refining a particular web application's user interface. As described in this paper, these kinds of challenges can sometimes be met in a fairly easy and affordable way by drawing upon 1) recent developments in web survey technology along with 2) any of several models and constructs developed over the past two decades to help predict users' technology choices. Specifically, this paper describes a work-in-progress to develop an approach towards combining web survey systems together with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), in order to anticipate the usability and usefulness ratings among several candidate iterations of e-Portfolio templates under consideration for deployment in one university setting.	e-services;ibm tivoli access manager;internet protocol suite;iteration;open-source software;software deployment;usability;user interface;web application;xml	Owen G.

Communication is frequently off-line, particularly if individuals are geographically separated. Group members have diffcrent backgrounds (e.g., in focus groups, mixed customer and company groups) and do not necessarily share the same information or values. Tasks can have significant visual and auditory components, as for instance in product development. While these characteristics are by no means exclusive, they represent important factors which now can be addressed by multimedia supported group decision systems. The article discusses these and related aspects of group decision making and explains design alternatives to handle them.

We observed teachers planning lessons and searching an archive of videotaped Holocaust survivor testimonies; the archive was created by the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation who interviewed 52,000 survivors and systematically cataloged the resulting testimonies. The teachers used a collaborative process to design lesson plans and search for appropriate testimony passages; they employed an array of relevance criteria that pertain specifically to teaching. The objectives implied in their criteria correspond to the teaching objectives described in lesson plans and teacher interviews, including connecting with students, representing diversity, and teaching tolerance. Our findings suggest user-oriented design approaches that support retrieval of instructional materials and collaboration in line with the needs and knowledge of teachers.	archive;relevance;user-centered design	Katy Newton Lawley;Dagobert Soergel;Xiaoli Huang	2005		10.1002/meet.14504201197	social science;simulation;relevance;computer science;evaluation;multimedia;law;world wide web;information retrieval	HCI	-75.16855168252086	-42.70476348820207	138669

Adults tend to utilize the diversity principle of induction (DP), but evidence regarding children’s ability to do so is mixed. The two experiments reported here examined whether the method by which evidence is presented would have an influence on children’s tendency to obey the DP. These experiments with undergraduates (N = 66, Mage = 21.12 years) and preschoolers (N = 62, Mage = 5.27 years) revealed that whether sample items were presented sequentially or simultaneously influenced diversity-based reasoning in children, and in some cases, adults. Specifically, sequential presentation facilitated diversity-based reasoning, and simultaneous presentation did not. Together these results indicate that processes elicited during the presentation of evidence have an important influence on how children and adults use evidence to make inductive generalizations.	experiment;inductive reasoning;mathematical induction	Chris Lawson	2014				AI	-73.11945008676946	-47.76298183628321	138713

In this paper, we study this problem by using discussion forum posts derived from large open online courses. We find that posts identified as encoding confusion are actually manifestations of different learner affects pertaining to their informational needs– primarily seeking factual answers. We quantitatively demonstrate that the use of content-related linguistic features and communityrelated features derived from a post serve as reliable detectors of confusion while widely outperforming currently available algorithms of confusion detection. We also point out that several prediction tasks in this domain (e.g., confusion and urgency detection) can be correlated, and that a model trained for one task can effectively be used for making predictions on the other task without requiring labeled examples. Finally, we highlight a very significant problem of adapting the classifier to unseen courses.	algorithm;glass;sensor	Ziheng Zeng;Snigdha Chaturvedi;Suma Bhat	2017			computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;natural language processing;confusion	Web+IR	-73.49098172268693	-47.796259687261575	138805

Understanding proportions is a time-intensive process that does not come cheap during late childhood and early adolescence. It is fostered by learning experiences in which students have opportunities to explore, discuss and experiment with situations involving proportions. Children must undergo many informal learning opportunities before they can gain from direct instruction on proportional reasoning. In this study, we aimed to determine whether physics curricula focusing on the concept of density prepares students for learning from a curriculum on proportional reasoning. A 2x2 design with the factors “physics curricula” (with, without) and “concept used to introduce proportional reasoning” (speed, density) was applied to 253 children from 12 classrooms at the beginning of grade 5. We expected the “density, with physics curriculum” group to outperform the other three groups. However, only the students who scored in the highest quartile on an intelligence measure gained from the prior knowledge they had acquired through the physics curricula. The results show that curricula on proportional reasoning are worthwhile for all students in early adolescence. However, more capable students can boost their proportional reasoning if they have the chance to acquire prior knowledge through a physics curriculum.	experience;natural language understanding	Daniela Nussbaumer;Christian Thurn;Ralph Schumacher;Elsbeth Stern	2017				HCI	-73.14920394362267	-47.44244603637472	138824
2735964baaf45e007628d31a087c980aadd00704	how feedback provided by voluntary electronic quizzes affects learning outcomes of university students in large classes		Abstract In view of the increasing number of university students attending large statistics classes as a requirement for their degree courses, the use of an online learning environment is indispensable for delivering immediate and frequent feedback. However, results of research on the value of technological tools and blended courses in various academic disciplines are not consistent and only point to minimal effects on academic achievement. To fill this gap, in this study, participation in optional electronic quizzes and its effects on exam grades in large statistics classes depending on gender and previous statistics- and mathematics-related abilities are investigated. Overall, participation in the electronic quizzes yielded a positive effect on final grades. However, particularly the groups who participated less in the electronic quizzes – i.e. poor performing students and males - benefitted more from quiz participation than high performing and female students. The large variability in effect sizes of feedback on performance suggests that additional moderators such as specific situation- and task-related characteristics and individual affective preconditions such as effort, motivation, and self-esteem should be analyzed in future research.

In this paper, we believe that policy management service is an efficient and flexible solution to the management of resource interactive scenarios and access control scenarios in SIoT. This paper firstly provides a survey on several general policy languages and evaluates them with three key requirements for the performance evaluation under the SIoT scene. Then, we select Ponder as our policy language and design a policy editing syntax for our typical SIoT scene to avoid complex Ponder syntax training for users without professional knowledge in policy field. Finally, we implement an IoT policy editor and conduct an experiment to compare our policy editing syntax and Ponder syntax. Test shows that editing through our policy editor can decrease error-rate considerably comparing with that by using Ponder syntax.	access control;authorization;performance evaluation;requirement	Lijuan He;Xiaofeng Qiu;Yi Wang;Teng Gao	2013	2013 22nd Wireless and Optical Communication Conference	10.1109/WOCC.2013.6676386	computer science;knowledge management;access control;multimedia;world wide web;internet of things	HCI	-65.09964818245051	-51.54464608528566	138992

Using features extracted from students' interaction logs, a centroid based clustering algorithm derived two well-separated groups describing two types of students, Cluster 1 which is characterized by the more persistent students and Cluster 0 which is characterized by the less persistent students. The more persistent students demonstrated effective help-seeking behavior, and greater level of task engagement and resourcefulness compared to the less persistent students.	algorithm;cluster analysis;design of the fat file system;persistence (computer science);problem solving	Cristina E.

Students’ scores on a multiplechoice pretest, inventory of metacognitive self-regulation, and solution forms were analyzed. Results indicated that while students with lower regulation of cognition and objectivity benefited more from the domain-general scaffolds than the domain-specific ones, students with lower prior knowledge, knowledge of cognition, and problem representation took advantage of both domain-general and domain-specific conditions. Moreover, while students with lower prior knowledge, regulation of cognition, and problem representation took advantage of both continuous and faded domain-general scaffolds, students with lower knowledge of cognition and objectivity benefited more from the domain-general continuous conditions. In addition, students with lower prior knowledge, knowledge of cognition, and objectivity might have difficulties when the domain-specific conditions are faded. On the other hand, results of the study suggested that scaffolds did not substantially benefit the students with higher prior knowledge and higher metacognitive skills. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To explain this, researchers have been suggested to investigate the interaction process occurring in the course of collaboration. Research on face-to-face (FTF) groups have provided clues as to what types of interaction are productive for learning, both at the individual and group level. However, the extent to which these findings apply to online groups is not yet clear. This paper reports a conceptual systematic review of recent studies of online synchronous learning groups. There is little evidence that the types of online interaction deemed favorable are actually associated with individual conceptual learning. These findings challenge the implicit assumption held by many educational technology designers. Implications for future research are discussed.	systematic review	Anindito Aditomo;Peter Reimann	2007			psychology;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;communication;social psychology;synchronous learning;pedagogy	HCI	-74.11332744204239	-40.937074849559544	139347

Motivated by research in human sequential learning, we develop a system that learns by observation to predict the information a user desires in different contexts. The model decides when the display should be updated, which is akin to the problem of scene segmentation, and then selects the situationally relevant information display. The model reduces the cognitive burden of selecting situation-relevant displays. We evaluate the system in a tank video game environment and find that the system boosts user performance. The fit of the model to user data provides a quantitative assessment of user behavior, which is useful in assessing individual differences and the progression from novice- to expert-level proficiency. We discuss the relative benefits of adopting a learning approach to predicting information preferences and possible avenues to reduce the negative consequences of automation.	color gradient;display device;information needs	Bradley C.

In particular, the paper will focus on the effect of the levels of guidance on students with a low degree of experience in informatics and educational technology. The first stage of this study was to identify the common misconceptions about density, starting from a literature review. Forty eight students (25 M and 23 F) from two high schools in Vanuatu were then involved in the study. These students were divided into three groups according to the different levels of guidance they received (Unguided; Minimum guidance, Maximum guidance). A pre and post activity questionnaire was designed containing 12 questions. The students underwent a training session with computer simulation about density. Using a descriptive and an inferential statistics method, scores obtained from the three different groups were compared during pre-test and post-test analyses. From the analyses it was found that the construction of knowledge from discovery learning activities occurs with or without guidance, however the amount of guidance received has an influence on the depth of conceptual understanding.	computer simulation;horner's method;inferential programming;informatics	Lemuel Moli;Alice Pedregosa Delserieys;Maria Antonietta Impedovo;Jeremy Castera	2016	Education and Information Technologies	10.1007/s10639-016-9527-4	computer simulation;mathematics education;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;pedagogy	HCI	-75.82443997189856	-43.12864447643997	139976

The computational method developed in this study approximates the posterior distribution of the student’s ability obtained from the conventional Bayes Modal Estimation (BME) approach to a simple Gaussian function in order to reduce the amount of computations required in the subsequent ability update processes. To verify the correctness and usefulness of this method, the abilities of 407 college students who solved 61 physics problems in a Web-based learning environment were estimated from the log files of the learning environment. The reduced chi-squared statistic and Pearson’s chi-square test for the goodness of fit indicate that the estimated abilities were able to successfully explain the observed problem solving performance of students within error. The educational implications of estimating the ability of students in Web-based learning environments were also discussed. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

a680e987919ffdde3a147b8806e5c883c6901148	a proposal of an interactive broadcasting system for audience-driven live tv on the internet		Traditional video services on the Internet are of a broadcasting service nature such as streaming and video-on-demand (VoD). Recent services incorporate more of the interactive nature of network applications such as easy video sharing and those with a chat function. Meanwhile, we have been conducting experimental Internet broadcasting in practice and found it difficult for non-professional broadcasters to provide audiences with satisfactory contents since they do not have a large budget or the technical knowledge to produce broadcasting contents compared to the professional ones. In this paper, we propose an audience-driven broadcast service model in which audiences can send their wish to a broadcaster such that they would like to see some specific objects while broadcasting; the broadcaster can reply back to the request as well. We implemented a prototype system for audience-driven live broadcasting and studied its effects and problems based on the results from the experimental broadcast at our university graduation ceremony and our campus festival.

I hypothesize that an important barrier that still needs to be overcome is the lack of support for nurturing end-user programmers' ideas about how a program should be written or about how to solve programming difficulties. To test this hypothesis, I conducted two qualitative empirical investigations, and triangulated their results with theories from problem-solving, creativity, and design, to explore design opportunities and a design space for idea gardening. Idea gardening is a concept for designing end-user programming environments with a focus on nurturing end-user programmers' ideas to help them gradually gain expertise as they overcome barriers.	end-user development;gardening (cryptanalysis);problem solving;programmer;programming language;theory	Jill Cao	2011	2011 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC)	10.1109/VLHCC.2011.6070405	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;management science	HCI	-65.37485728813525	-40.59557429527701	140266

From this perspective, Educational Data Mining (EDM) research has focused on modeling and comprehending various dimensions of learning in computer based learning environments (CBLE). Researchers and designers are actively attempting to improve learning systems by incorporating adaptive mechanisms that respond to the varying needs of learners. Recent advances in data mining techniques provide new possibilities and exciting opportunities for developing adaptive systems to better support learners. This study is situated in the context of clinical reasoning in an Intelligent Tutoring System called BioWorld and it aims to examine the relationship between the lab-tests ordered and misconceptions held by learners. Toward this end, we employ an EDM technique called subgroup discovery to unpack the rules that embody the hypothesized link. Examining such links may have implications for identifying the points along learning trajectories where learners should be provided the requisite scaffolding. This study represents our efforts to evaluate and derive empirically based design prescriptions for improving Intelligent Tutoring Systems. Implications for practice and future research directions are also discussed.	adaptive system;educational data mining;scaffold (programming);situated	Eric Poitras;Susanne P.

Issues in usability can drastically impact user experience and thus the learning outcomes associated with serious games. The goal of this paper is to provide serious game developers with an approach to efficiently and effectively apply usability testing into their development process. We propose a three-tiered approach to the assessment of game usability with the addition of assessments playability and learning to traditional usability. Learning or training is the main objective of a serious game and enjoyment is often required when trying to elicit the necessary usage to achieve this goal. Step-by-step procedures and associated measures are provided to assess usability, playability, and learning outcomes concurrently with game development, while taking into account the unique goals and limitations of time, personnel, and budget that small development companies often encounter.	usability testing;user experience;video game development	Tanner Olsen;Katelyn Procci;Clint A.

A class of 36 students participated in this study, which lasted one school year of two semesters. Participants were divided into three groups according to their English writing abilities at the beginning of the study. They attended regular synchronous classes and took writing assignments home. The feature of this experiment is that their writings were submitted for peers’ reviews from another group. At the end of each semester, an online writing contest was organized and all the participants took part in order to examine learning outcomes. A survey at the end of the study was also conducted to obtain students’ perceptions of the process. The result of the study shows that all the participants obtained satisfactory results, but the students with lower writing ability made more progress than those with higher ability. The finding also indicates that students with higher writing ability tend to become discouraged if they are grouped with lower-ability students for too long.		Zi-gang Ge	2011	I. J.

6c5ac1f792561d5d2199b9c8af5b2309e06f950c	influence of accuracy of simulations to the physics education		Regular discussion in the LLL (Life Long Learning) courses for the teachers in primary and secondary education gives us insight into their opinion. We discovered that teachers of primary and secondary education in our country believe that the highest retention of knowledge and understanding of mechanics can be achieved in the real world environment (in lab and outdoor) observing the natural physics phenomena and repeating the experiments that led to the physics laws. We know that this is just partially true. It is our belief that simulations using as supplement to real laboratory experiments increase students' understanding of mechanics. Physical processes are often beyond the capability of humans to observe them in schools. Teaching students we have seen that adequate understanding using lab experiments is difficult even in the simplest mechanic phenomena (ball roling on the slope). Students were unable to comprehand the full concept of the physics phenomena from the experiment unless we teach them theory first. In this article, we explain how we used simulations that allow students to adjust the experiments to their comprehantion abilities. We compared the accuracy of three different freeware simulations to the highly accurate proprietary one. We have also analyzed the the observed simulation software to be customized to the accurate transformation of 3D world experiment to the 2D simulated presentation (e.g. the sphere and the cylinder cross-section look equal in 2D screen but the physics background is different).	cylinder seal;experiment;lenstra–lenstra–lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm;simulation software	Robert Repnik;G.

Some of these agents perform actions, interact with multimedia, hold conversations with humans in natural language, and adaptively respond to a person’s actions, verbal contributions, and emotions. Data are logged throughout the interactions in order to assess the individual’s mastery of subject matters, skills, and proficiencies on both cognitive and noncognitive characteristics. There are different agent-based designs that focus on learning and assessment. Dialogues occur between one agent and one human, as in the case of intelligent tutoring systems. Three-party conversations, called trialogues, involve two agents interacting with a human. The two agents can take on different roles (such as tutors and peers), model actions and social interactions, stage arguments, solicit help from the human, and collaboratively solve problems. Examples of assessment with these agent-based environments are presented in the context of intelligent tutoring, educational games, and interventions to help struggling adult readers. Most of these involve assessment at varying grain sizes to guide the intelligent interaction, but conversation-based assessment with agents is also currently being used in high stakes assessments.

It enables collaboration, but the specific choice of technology also imposes constraints on how projects are conducted. Over the past decade, we have engaged in an action research programme to develop an Open-Ended Group Project situated in an educational framework in which international collaboration, including interaction with a real world client, is an essential component. This paper investigates the manner in which students reflected on their patterns of CT use within the collaborative setting. In general, these reflections were found to be superficial and descriptive, exhibiting a reductive view of CT as a set of technological features, which acted as a neutral medium for communication and participation. One consequence of this was a lack of awareness of the ways in which the technology influenced the behaviour of individual students or the collaborative nature of the group. We explore some potential causes for this and reflect on some difficulties faced by the students. These have important pedagogical implications for courses in which the learning objectives include the development of suitable competencies for working in a global collaborative environment.	amiga reflections;nonlinear gameplay;situated;the open group;the superficial	Roger McDermott;Mats Daniels;Åsa Cajander;Mats Cullhed;Tony Clear;Cary Laxer	2012	2012 Frontiers in Education Conference Proceedings	10.1109/FIE.2012.6462410	collaborative learning;human–computer interaction;engineering;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-74.44093668666157	-38.1467229705972	140533

However, especially in large lectures students rarely receive feedback on their writing product. Thus, computer-based feedback could be an alternative to provide formative feedback to students. However, it is less clear, how computer-based feedback should be designed to help students writing cohesive texts. For that purpose, we implemented three different computer-based feedback methods within an authentic large lecture class. We investigated effects of the format (outline versus concept map) and the specificity (specific versus general) of the feedback on studentsu0027 perceived difficulty and the generation of cohesive texts. We found that specific concept map feedback was perceived as less difficult as compared to the general feedback or the specific outline feedback. Additionally, students who received specific feedback wrote explanatory texts that were more cohesive as compared to students with the general feedback. However, the format of the feedback (concept map versus outline) did not account for improvements of cohesion. Evidently, specific concept map feedback can be regarded as an efficient scaffold to provide cohesive explanations.	concept map	Andreas Lachner;Christian Burkhart;Matthias Nückles	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.008	concept map;peer feedback;mathematics education;formative assessment;knowledge management;cohesion (chemistry);scaffold;multimedia;computer science	HCI	-74.17178735121783	-43.13513025081521	140551

Both aspects are well addressed by using different Authoring Tools including the vector-based Flash technology. Although it has improved since its release, Flash still encourages superfluous animation and thus increases the likely hood of poor design. This paper is the result of practical experiences within two large projects (VMC-Graz, iVISiCE) in different domains (Medicine, Civil Engineering) where Flash amongst several other tools – was used as a tool for creating interactive content. The work is interesting due to the match of experiences of both domains resulting from Usability studies. It is essential that we include the perspective of human-computer interaction as early as possible to enhance design, an approach that is still rarely included in the solutions of traditional programmers and technologically oriented content developers.	adobe flash;computer simulation;experience;hood method;human–computer interaction;interaction design;programmer;usability;variational monte carlo	Andreas Holzinger;Martin Ebner	2003			human–computer interaction;heuristic evaluation;multimedia;usability;interaction design;computer science;user experience design;usability engineering;component-based usability testing;agile usability engineering;interactive systems engineering	HCI	-67.7078090161405	-42.99451396421987	140702

The Living Stories project is the first alternate reality game in the UK, which addresses environmental issues. Living Stories combines social networking sites such as Face book and Twitter with Second Life, to create a platform, which allows social networking to feed into content creation within a virtual world, and facilitate and encourage real-world behaviour through virtual rewards. The project is funded by Interactive Digital Media IDM, as part of an ongoing collaboration with the Eden Project, Coventry University Serious Games Institute and PlayGen Ltd. The aim of this project is twofold: firstly to engage new visitors and to extend the Eden experience beyond the actual visits, and secondly to increase user participation amongst groups that do not traditionally visit Eden Project. In this paper we describe the unique technical and pedagogic challenges addressed when creating this platform and consider how the state-of-the-art in alternate reality gaming can be applied in an educational ('serious') context.	alternate reality game;digital media;second life;virtual world	Panagiotis Petridis;Ian Dunwell;Sylvester Arnab;Simon Scarle;Adam Qureshi;Sara de Freitas;Aristidis Protopsaltis;Kam Star	2011	2011 Third International Conference on Games and Virtual Worlds for Serious Applications	10.1109/VS-GAMES.2011.17	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-68.52189509843527	-39.35813556438209	140760

c086026219ca897df1f1c3d68acac91acefa5ebd	visualization techniques to empower communities of volunteers in emergency management.		Information and communication technologies might help to emergency communities of volunteers to both empower community participation and improve their capacity to respond to unexpected events. However, designing technology to support these benefits places unique visualization challenges that go beyond the current state of research on public participation tools and related technologies. Empowering these communities requires developing representations that enable collaborative reflection, promote mutual visibility of volunteers’ efforts and sustain a shared view of the community. Similarly, it is necessary to create visualization methods that facilitate sense making of large, simultaneous and distributed pieces of heterogeneous information of different priority levels and with different levels of credibility. Accordingly, this paper analyzes these challenges and proposes a multi-view, multi-abstraction-level visualization approach to address them. In particular, it combines timeoriented visualizations, space-filling visualization techniques, interaction mechanisms and coordinated maps to support community participation as well as collaborative and individual sense making. The application of these visualization techniques is discussed through the development of a set of design prototypes.

Kock and colleagues reported that enhanced memorization capacity can be used in computer interfaces to exploit knowledge communication. They evaluated the impact of an evolutionary adaptive web-simulated threat (simulated web-based snake attack) on the effectiveness of knowledge communication and reported positive and significant outcomes. This research extends their study by using a technology-related web-simulated threat and measuring its impact on knowledge communication effectiveness. This research showed that the subjects in the treatment condition performed approximately 34% better than those in the control condition, which, provides empirical support to the original study and shows how to exploit automatic brain mechanisms to enhance knowledge communication effectiveness throughout the design of computer interfaces.

In order to find a way to solve this problem, we have used a system called SCROLL System for Capturing and Reminding of Learning Log. Two evaluations were conducted to examine whether our system could boost up outside-class learning time. The result of Evaluation 2 showed that outside-class learning time dramatically increased only when they read an e-book together with the System though no statistically significant difference was detected since individual differences were so large. Though we expected that interesting outside-class learning materials would motivated them to learn more outside-class, it was the System that motivated them to study outside-class. It was assumed that SCROLL quiz function was a major contributor. We believe that it will lead to compensation of a lack of learning time.	vocabulary	Noriko Uosaki;Hiroaki Ogata;Kousuke Mouri	2015	IJMLO	10.1504/IJMLO.2015.070703	multi-task learning;instance-based learning;cooperative learning;error-driven learning;speech recognition;computer science;experiential learning;inductive transfer;multimedia;active learning;rote learning;synchronous learning	ML	-72.68451785317713	-43.94532654526307	141206

Hence, it proposes a process called cognitive mapping to acquire and describe objects of a domain of study, and set fuzzy-causal relationships among them. Objects are characterized as linguistic variables that are instantiated by linguistic terms; whereas relations are outlined by means of fuzzyrule bases. So objects and relations are statements of qualitative knowledge that are measured in terms of nature and degrees of bias to reveal uncertainty. The representation of multiple perspectives of the learner is sketched through the topology of a cognitive map and the qualitative measures attached to objects and relationships. This approach was tested in an E-learning trial, its outcomes show the effectiveness of the learner model to enhance the apprenticeship of volunteers due to the successfully handle of uncertainty and multiple perspectives.	causality;cognitive map	Alejandro Peña Ayala	2009		10.3233/978-1-60750-028-5-283	cognitive map;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;machine learning;social psychology;statistics	AI	-75.51946288534636	-45.799239776892826	141445

Current studies follow individual methodologies and typically assesses individual and custom-made web pages, whose construction requires expert knowledge in web technologies. Further, a range of native, non-web applications cannot be easily modified for delay studies. Thus, a generalized methodology for assessing delay impacts for a broad range of applications that is accessible to researchers without (web) development expertise is still missing. This paper contributes to this open problem by i) presenting a new methodology for reproducible delay assessments in a broad class of systems and ii) presenting an open-source implementation to be used by the community. This methodology particularly aims at making delay assessment available to a broad range of researchers by avoiding programming skills and thus by lowering the barrier for setting-up delay assessments.	crowdsourcing;erp;enterprise integration;enterprise system;open-source software;persistence (computer science);screenshot;software deployment;system under test;test case;user interface;visual editor;web application;web development;web page;web server	Thomas Zinner;Matthias Hirth;Valentin Fischer;Oliver Hohlfeld	2016	2016 Eighth International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)	10.1109/QoMEX.2016.7498938	web modeling;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;knowledge engineering;web page;multimedia;world wide web;crowdsourcing	EDA	-66.82316924844395	-43.06346757704262	141571

In the fall of 2001 freshmen at a medium sized research-one institution completed a survey and in spring 2005 a random sample of graduating seniors completed a similar survey. The surveys measured the student's self-reported proficiency in basic information technology knowledge and skills such as word processing and presentation software as well as more complex applications such as digital audio. We found a significant increase in perception of skills in presentation software and browsers and although both groups reported low skill levels, a significant decrease in perception of skills in database, web animation, programming, desktop publishing, digital video, and video audio. Although one might assume an undergraduate would indicate an increase in information and communication technology skills, this study found that often student's perceptions of ability decline. However this decrease may be due to their increased awareness of the skills needed in the workforce.

Since these systems are often structured as a hypertext, they pose additional problems to the user due to the complexity of navigable paths. In these cases the user has to learn both the structure of the hypertext and the provided contents. Three studies have been conducted to test the hypothesis that the level of usability of a system can affect the learning performance. The first two studies were aimed at evaluating the level of usability of a system developed as a multimedia distance learning course. An experiment was then conducted to compare the learning performance of students using this system to that of other students using different educational tools. Results lend a preliminary support to the hypothesis that a difficult to use hypermedia system can negatively affect learning performance. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The newly added communication skills prove to be an important addition since they have an independent effect on beneficial Internet use. The group of independent Internet users benefited more from Internet use than formal help seekers and much more than social support seekers. Internet communication skills hold the potential for achieving a high degree of independence in using the Internet by compensating for information skills so as to attain beneficial Internet outcomes.	internet;social support	Alexander van Deursen;Cédric Courtois;Jan van Dijk	2014	Int.

While the cognitive processes that cause these impacts are starting to be understood and the evidence that they occur in real learning contexts is mounting, the mechanics and extent of students’ task switching and multitasking during learning activities is neither well documented or understood. This study seeks to redress this gap by defining and describing key task switching and multitasking behaviours adopted by students. It employs computer-based task switching and self-directed learning as the technology and learning frameworks within which these behaviours are explored. A custom monitoring system was used to capture and analyse 3372 computer session logs of students undertaking self-directed study within an open-access computer laboratory. Each session was broken down into a sequence of tasks within a series of time segments. Segments and sessions were then analysed and classified as conforming to one of three core behaviours – little or no task switching (focused), task switching without multitasking (sequential) and multitasking. Multitasking was much more common than focused or sequential behaviours. Multitasking was present in more than 70%, was most frequent in over 50% and occurred exclusively in around 35% of all sessions. By comparison, less than 10% of sessions were exclusively focused and only 7% were exclusively sequential. Once initiated, focused and multitasking behaviours appear to be quite stable. Students were much more likely to continue with them than to switch to an alternate behaviour. Sequential behaviour is far less stable and appears to represent a transitional state between multitasking and focused behaviours. The importance of personal, social and learning contexts in setting and influencing multitasking behaviours are discussed, as are some of the potential effects of these behaviours on learning practises and outcomes. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

250a3751ea965b46c3a17d576fc12051c34a76b3	a framework for user interaction for adaptive web-based information systems		Information systems (IS) are a fundamental part of the curricula of today’s higher education institutes (HEI) – especially in fields of business informatics, economics and computing sciences. But the current methods used to teach IS in HEI are not sufficient when compared to the capabilities of today’s learning technologies. The learning material which is provided by software vendors or teachers itself, is neither technologically-enhanced nor adapted to the individual knowledge background and learning preferences of thr ingle, individual learner. Adaptive learning environments (ALE) offer a sufficient way to teach (and learn) IS. They can track the user interaction and adapt the learning material to the learner’s performance. Thus, the lacking integration of an ALE with the IS is a major issue. In this contribution, we are presenting a user interactionframework for web-based IS which allows the generation of individual excercises for each learner depending on her/his specific performance in the future.	business informatics;computer science;information system;reflow soldering;web application	Dirk Peters;Marc Petersen;Jorge Marx Gómez	2013			knowledge management;user modeling;web application;computer science;information system;human–computer interaction;user interface;interactive systems engineering	Web+IR	-76.50587554209787	-38.07176529626057	143299

Twenty-six participants belonging to a cross section of eight states located across different geographical regions of India, were subject to group discussions deliberating on a short film clipping presented to them during the test. The analysis based on study of video recording examined the different hand gestures involuntarily used by the participants to communicate during their discussions. These were identified, grouped and classified based on taxonomy of gestures outlined by McNeill. The communicative aspects of the gestures involved were analyzed to gain insights of regional similarities and differences specific to each region. Based on the findings the paper discusses the scope of these findings in the development of an inventory of gestures and their relevance in the design and development of gesture based interactive products. Considering the increasing move towards gesture based interaction modes for man–product interactions the paper outlines the scope for culture based variations in the design of gestures that meet the needs of culturally diverse communities in the rapidly growing domain of ICE based communication technologies.	interactivity	Ravi Mokashi Punekar;Sarath Paliyath	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-58509-3_4	cross-cultural;cultural diversity;communication;multimedia;computer science;gesture	HCI	-63.70304688307775	-40.398142811793925	143461

We conducted a survey of incoming first-year students at Quinnipiac University to learn not only their skill level with a representative range of technology tasks, but also from whom they learned these tasks. Results provide a profile of students who report learning many technology tasks primarily on their own. We propose a taxonomy according to which native technology tasks are learned with family support, social and educational technology task categories are supported by friends and teachers, respectively, and optional technology tasks are learned with little support. Our results will help in the design of appropriate computer literacy courses.	personal computer;taxonomy (general)	Mark E. Hoffman;David R.

7484ba2d9118f6043b45670e3ec7bbc265728f5f	flipped gaming - testing three simulation games		At the Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences “flipped gaming” has been tested with two student groups (in 2017). This paper will present a newer version of the “flipping” and also how a total of eight groups utilized tree different types of simulators to play the scenarios. The scenarios were developed by the student themselves as this was their mandatory assignment. The mandatory assignment was handed out in January. The assignment was about making a playable script for an incident, in addition to conduct the planning, execution and evaluation of a complete exercise in crisis management. They were given feedback once before the workshop where they presented and played the script. The tools that were used was Rayvn (https://rayvn.global/), Microsoft HoloLens (https://www.microsoft.com/nb-no/hololens) and a simulator based on a platform from Bohemia Interactive Solutions (https://bisimulations.com/) - the same platform as Virtual Battle Space 3 uses. Rayvn is an incident management tool, mainly for communication. The written messages can then be logged and stored for later reflections. Microsoft HoloLens is a tool for 3D vision, a tool that can show environments in 3D and allow the player to carry out operations using movements that are recorded and executed. This was a prototype. The game based simulator is computer based. The different views are 2D maps and 3D environments. The players use the keyboard and mouse to move the vehicles and avatars around. This in a “disaster town”, called “Lyngvik”, a very poor planned city centre with a large accident/crisis potential. The study is based on the previous study of the learning outcome from assignment that is based on student input. The mandatory assignment was to develop a playable scenario and they could choose in which of the three different simulation tools they were to play their scenario. Two by two, the groups are to play each other’s scenario. They have received some supervision and the lecturers have remarked on that the students may lack insight in what a “playable scenario” require. One of the groups operates as the exercise management staff(the ones that makes the incidents happen and “play out”) and the other group is the ones who man the different roles in handling the scenario e.g., —- different call out services. This group is also calledmain training audience (MTA). The students are in their 6th and last semester in their Bachelor in Crisis Management. The students have been subjected to diverse teaching methods, but this is the first time they have a simulation tool to work with in order to enhance their learning outcome. The preliminary reports from the reflections after the simulating are very positive. The students report on a learning outcome, both from making the scenarios and from simulating. There is also a final report to be written where the students are to reflect on their learning outcome from the simulation and the work on the assignment. The paper shows the results from the whole undertaking and presents further details from the different phases. We also present the theoretical backdrop and the methodological reasoning behind the data collection and analysis.	amiga reflections;assignment (computer science);backdrop cms;computer keyboard;feedback;game controller;incident management;map;microsoft hololens;nvidia 3d vision;prototype;reflection (computer graphics);simulation;teaching method	Tone Vold;Hanne Haave;Ole Jorgen S.

Students were asked to provide feedback on what they perceive the benefits and the drawbacks of lecture capture to be. The results show that the students consider lecture capture an effective tool to help them succeed in the course. The videos are available to them 24 hours a day, seven days a week thus allowing students to bridge the gap between what they have understood in the formal class setting and what they are able to better understand after reviewing the videos in a more informal, relaxed environment. In addition, most of the students indicated that the availability of the videos did not encourage them to skip or miss any classes. The main drawback was associated with technical difficulties which resulted in some wasted time.	bridging (networking);lecture recording;np (complexity);rectifier	Hasan Al-Nashash;Cindy Gunn	2013	Educational Technology & Society			HCI	-76.89793765651689	-39.05938507963302	144130

Experimental schools used a digital formative assessment tool whereas control schools used their regular teaching methods and materials. The tool provides student feedback, feedback to teachers, and adaptive assignments. Data included standardized achievement pre-posttest data, student motivation survey data, classroom observation data, and student log files. Multilevel analysis revealed positive effects on student achievement and motivation. Students’ intensity of use measurements support the effects found on student achievement and motivation. Furthermore, achievement effects were higher for high-performing students.	randomized algorithm	Janke M. Faber;Hans Luyten;Adrie J.

8b524766115ee49f60a29e27f9fe84eabdaf945a	transfer-learning methods in programming course outcome prediction		The computing education research literature contains a wide variety of methods that can be used to identify students who are either at risk of failing their studies or who could benefit from additional challenges. Many of these are based on machine-learning models that learn to make predictions based on previously observed data. However, in educational contexts, differences between courses set huge challenges for the generalizability of these methods. For example, traditional machine-learning methods assume identical distribution in all data—in our terms, traditional machine-learning methods assume that all teaching contexts are alike. In practice, data collected from different courses can be very different as a variety of factors may change, including grading, materials, teaching approach, and the students.rnrnTransfer-learning methodologies have been created to address this challenge. They relax the strict assumption of identical distribution for training and test data. Some similarity between the contexts is still needed for efficient learning. In this work, we review the concept of transfer learning especially for the purpose of predicting the outcome of an introductory programming course and contrast the results with those from traditional machine-learning methods. The methods are evaluated using data collected in situ from two separate introductory programming courses.rnrnWe empirically show that transfer-learning methods are able to improve the predictions, especially in cases with limited amount of training data, for example, when making early predictions for a new context. The difference in predictive power is, however, rather subtle, and traditional machine-learning models can be sufficiently accurate assuming the contexts are closely related and the features describing the student activity are carefully chosen to be insensitive to the fine differences.

The objective of this research is to make a prototype system based on a learning process model to guide a human to achieve continuous learning. The main problem is how to keep supplying new goals to a learner for achieving continuous learning. To encourage the sense of continuous awareness toward goal discovery, we propose an idea to provide a human learner with invisible goals. This paper formalizes the continuous learning by a simple maze model with invisible goals and designs the maze sweeping task which involves multiple solutions and goals.	human computer;human–computer interaction	Kouki Takemori;Tomohiro Yamaguchi;Kazuki Sasaji;Keiki Takadama	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39209-2_62	error-driven learning;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;active learning	Vision	-66.94622850324073	-44.704606166781204	145459

The problem is that often people with disabilities are not able to overcome the barriers that exist in obtaining postsecondary education. When they do enroll in postsecondary education they often experience difficulty staying in, and completing their programs. The purpose of this research was to determine if assistive technology, in the form of voice recognition software, could assist in overcoming some of the barriers that exist for people with learning disabilities. The study sought to determine if voice recognition software was an effective compensatory strategy for students with learning disabilities in postsecondary education and the experiences of these students in relationship to their use of the software. Follow-up data will be collected to determine if the software is an effective compensatory strategy for the participants in their future employment.	assistive technology;experience;speech recognition	Kelly D.

2d88abfdf8f636eddbbb51839ee75392c6cc51ba	exploring parents' perceptions towards educational robots: gender and socio-economic differences		Introduction An important recent trend in education has been towards the integration of different technologies, such as digital games (Chen, Chen & Liu, 2010; Chiang, Lin, Cheng & Liu, 2011; Lee & Chen, 2009; Lin & Liu, 2009; Liu & Lin, 2009) and educational robots (Chang, Lee, Chao, Wang & Chen, 2010a; Chang, Lee, Wang & Chen, 2010b; Wei, Hung, Lee & Chen, 2011), and the learning and teaching about design and implementation of educational robots (Liu, Lin & Chang, 2010). The development of educational robots, such as Topobo and LEGO Mindstorms NXT, gives students more chances to learning to build their own robots (Feng, Lin & Liu, 2011; Liu, 2010). Liu (2010) found that students perceived that educational robots were a useful learning technology and considered that learning to construct robots could help them develop important technological skills. Many researchers investigated the effect of integrating educational robots into educational fields, and they found that educational robots not only can enhance students’ learning motivation (Chang et al, 2010a; Liu et al, 2010) but also can improve students’ learning (Chang et al, 2010b). The findings from past studies showed that educational robots have become an important learning technology and a subject for students to study. The support and confidence of parents to help their children to learn with or learn to build robots are important for promoting the use of educational robots. The previous study (Liu, 2010) explored the students’ perceptions of educational robots, but the further investigation of parents’ perceptions towards educational robots has been lacking.	chao (sonic);chow–liu tree;entity–relationship model;lego mindstorms;local interconnect network;nxt;robot	Chun-Hung Lin;Eric Zhi-Feng Liu;Yuan Yen Huang	2012	BJET	10.1111/j.1467-8535.2011.01258.x	applied psychology;social psychology;pedagogy	AI	-74.27596443061418	-40.50437095091563	146286

Using an activity system as a unit of analysis, the research examined learner behaviours, conflicting factors and facilitating factors while students engaged in collaborative work via asynchronous computer-mediated communication. The online postings from the two highest and lowest performing groups of students during one semester were analysed, coded and reorganised. The coded postings of these four groups were then compared using an activity system to identify the difference in patterns of learner behaviours. The conflicting and facilitating factors that students encountered were identified as well. The findings provide implications for online collaborative learning environment design and mediating strategies. The study also addresses some of the challenges in using an activity system to analyse collaborative learning activities and provides suggestions for future research.

An experiment was conducted in a course of ‘Applied Information Technology: Office Software’ with 100 students as the subjects; students were interviewed, and data on learning effects was collected and analyzed. Facebook was used as the platform for online academic help-seeking for the students. In addition, the researchers designed an APP for the purpose of helping students to learn through content presented on their mobile phones. Based on the findings in this study, the online academic help-seeking is helpful in developing students’ computing skills. However, contrary to expectations, the APP did not result in better development of students’ computing skills in this study.

In an effort to explain this variability, we revisited the classical theoretical construct of transparency. Transparency is the perceptual and conceptual accessibility of the mechanism, logic, and application of a tool. Corroborating earlier literature, it appears that participants saw only what they had built---transparency is a subjective achievement of a learner rather than an inherent feature of a device. Our first design prompted students with an algebraic proposition, for example """"3x+2=4x-1"""". The two equivalent expressions were to be interpreted by students as alternative quantifications of a single linear spatial interval; namely, the path that a giant took on two separate occasions to bury and recover treasure. Problem solving required manually adjusting the modeling media to coordinate two types of equivalence: (a) the total length represented by each expression; and (b) the length represented by the variable and known units. The researchers found that successful coordination was predicated on the subjective transparency of the models' perceptual. Therefore, in redesigning the activity as a computer-based application we will have learners first construct tools and only then automatize them."""	accessibility;emoticon;logic synthesis;problem solving;spatial variability;theoretical definition;transparency (graphic);turing completeness	Kiera Chase;Dor Abrahamson	2013		10.1145/2485760.2485834	computer science;artificial intelligence;algorithm	AI	-71.85218665958946	-47.92893018957693	146437

Teachers may not have sufficient knowledge to support such interactions, so support needs to be designed into learning modules for this purpose. This study investigates to what extent an online module for teaching nutrition in secondary school science, using a wiki for CPS, enables interactions, and social and cognitive processes. The module was implemented with 31 volunteer participants. Data collected from the online communications was analyzed for the types of interactions and processes based on the Community of Inquiry Framework. This was triangulated using transcripts of interviews with students. In addition, pretests and posttests were conducted to determine whether the learning outcomes were achieved. Analysis of the online communications showed that the interactions were mainly between learner and content (64.4%), with a large portion of cognitive processes (69.3%) but little social (4.0%), attitudes (9.9%), teaching processes (12.9%) and noise (5.9%). The findings suggest that the module could be used to improve outcomes of learning and encourage interactions for cognitive processes and online presences. The findings may provide insights in encouraging CPS for learning science online.	cognition;interaction;polygon triangulation;problem solving;science online;wiki	Dorothy DeWitt;Norlidah Alias;Saedah Siraj;Jonathan Michael Spector	2017	Educational Technology & Society		psychology;social science;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;electrical engineering;multimedia;management;world wide web;pedagogy	HCI	-74.37391820772572	-41.16639973135763	146747
b53deacaccec58bfa1c0b99a9a6c5431debb58b8	trends on the application of serious games to neuropsychological evaluation: a scoping review	serious games;virtual reality;neuropsychological assessment;scoping review	BACKGROUND The dramatic technological advances witnessed in recent years have resulted in a great opportunity for changing the way neuropsychological evaluations may be performed in clinical practice. Particularly, serious games have been posed as the cornerstone of this still incipient paradigm-shift, as they have characteristics that make them especially advantageous in trying to overcome limitations associated with traditional pen-and-paper based neuropsychological tests: they can be easily administered and they can feature complex environments for the evaluation of neuropsychological constructs that are difficult to evaluate through traditional tests. The objective of this study was to conduct a scoping literature review in order to map rapidly the key concepts underpinning this research area during the last 25years on the use of serious games for neuropsychological evaluation.   METHODS MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus and IEEE Xplore databases were systematically searched. The main eligibility criteria were to select studies published in a peer-reviewed journal; written in English; published in the last 25years; focused on the human population, and classified in the neuropsychological field. Moreover, to avoid risk of bias, studies were selected by consensus of experts, focusing primarily in psychometric properties. Therefore, selected studies were analyzed in accordance with a set of dimensions of analysis commonly used for evaluating neuropsychological tests.   RESULTS After applying the selected search strategy, 57 studies -including 54 serious games- met our selection criteria. The selected studies deal with visuospatial capabilities, memory, attention, executive functions, and complex neuropsychological constructs such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Results show that the implementation of serious games for neuropsychological evaluation is tackled in several different ways in the selected studies, and that studies have so far been mainly exploratory, just aiming at testing the feasibility of the proposed approaches.   DISCUSSION It may be argued that the limited number of databases used might compromise this study. However, we think that the finally included sample is representative, in spite of how difficult is to achieve an optimum and maximum scope. Indeed, this review identifies other research issues related to the development of serious games beyond their reliability and validity. The main conclusion of this review is that there is a great interest in the research community in the use of serious games for neuropsychological evaluation. This scoping review is pertinent, in accordance with the increasing number of studies published in the last three years, they demonstrate its potential as a serious alternative to classic neuropsychological tests. Nevertheless, more research is needed in order to implement serious games that are reliable, valid, and ready to be used in the everyday clinical practice.

To meet this challenge, the design and implementation of the ‘SR-INSPIREus-Learning Framework’ applying aspects of self-regulated learning (SRL) theory for modelling learning strategies that match various learning preferences and exploit the adaptive functionalities of INSPIREus, is proposed. A preliminary quasi-experimental study with comparison groups in pre/post tests and experimental and control groups was conducted in order to examine aspects of SRL (cognitive and affective domain) and learners’ performance. The findings provide evidence about the potential of the framework in increasing specific aspects of SRL and students’ performance.	experiment;sampling (signal processing)	Aikaterini-Maria Souki;Fotini Paraskeva;Aikaterini Alexiou;Kyparisia A.

3ea289fd1b3b5a1c727406c76de508526cc14bcd	rasch gsp toolbox for assessing academic achievement		The main purpose of this research is to computerize GSP chart and Rasch GSP methods. GSP chart and Rasch GSP are effective and useful methods which used for analyzing and evaluating academic achievement. GSP chart provides information for diagnosing the learning status of students and the quality of questions while Rasch GSP provides information for assessing the quality of classes and test quality. Therefore, this research has constructed Rasch GSP toolbox that is a support tool for teachers and researchers in using and studying GSP chart and Rasch GSP methods. The research has also proposed a number of improvements in Rasch GSP method and made supplements in order to increase the application range of the toolbox. Through specific examples, the ways of using this toolbox and applying Rasch GSP method are explained in detail in this paper. Rasch GSP toolbox can quickly calculate and give exact results for users, beside, GSP graphs and Rasch GSP graphs are also presented clearly. Hence, it helps users easily view the visual image of assessment result. In addition, a graphical user interface (GUI) is also designed to be easy for use. In practice, many researches that applied Rasch GSP toolbox have showed that it is a useful evaluation tool. It not only can supply big support to researchers in their research process but also can provide feedbacks about teaching and learning to teachers and students. So students can make reasonable adjustments for learning activity and teachers have an effective reference for learning guidance.	fault coverage;graphical user interface;guardian service processor;rasch model	Wei T.

d8c807b388de24a43c5f221c17fb54e6e5aef745	from 3d modeling to 3d printing: development of a differentiated spatial ability teaching model	3d printing;pedagogical issues;improving classroom teaching;cdio;differentiated spatial ability teaching model	3D modeling technologies and related techniques are emerging core competencies due to the increasing popularity of 3D printers. Traditional methods of teaching 3D modeling mostly depend on the use of three-view diagrams to guide students in the construction of a spatial cognition. However, a lack of three-dimensional and spatial ability on the part of the learners limits the effectiveness of this type of teaching material, and instructional effectiveness is also restricted by the existing spatial ability among students. In traditional approaches to technical education, students assume a largely passive role, while instruction adopts methods that emphasize rote learning, but these approaches are in the process of being transformed. Accordingly, the present study attempts to combine the Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate (CDIO) educational framework and 3D printing-tangible teaching materials for college students to explore potential improvements in learning outcomes. Experimental results indicate that different teaching materials (three-view diagrams and 3D printed solid models) result in the development of different spatial abilities (specifically, mental rotation and spatial visualization) and learning outcomes. In addition, the use of solid models results in 3D model learning outcomes better than those achieved using traditional three-view diagrams. Inspired by theories of perception and motivation and dual coding theory, this study developed a set of differentiated spatial ability teaching models to improve learning effectiveness for 3D modeling. The results provide guidance for the development of teaching materials and models appropriate to learners’ spatial abilities.	3d modeling;3d printing;coding theory;cognition;diagram	Tien-Chi Huang;Chun-Yu Lin	2017	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2016.10.005	simulation;3d printing;computer science;artificial intelligence;teaching method;multimedia;management	HCI	-70.28099320945533	-43.08328736684957	148340
f46d08bbe6664bfe5278974c98ea2067cd82809f	lasad: flexible representations for computer-based collaborative argumentation	argumentation;visualization;cscl	Teaching argumentation is challenging, and the factors of how to effectively support the acquisition of argumentation skills through technology are not fully explored yet. One of the key reasons for that is the lack of comparability between studies. In this article, we describe LASAD, a collaborative argumentation framework that can be flexibly parameterized. We illustrate the flexibility of the framework with respect to visualization, structural definitions and kind of cooperation. Using this framework, this paper presents an evaluation of the impact of using an argumentation system with different argument representations and with collaborative vs. individual use on the outcomes of scientific argumentation. We investigate which combinations of these factors produces the best results concerning argument production and learning outcomes. The results of this controlled lab study with 36 participants showed that the use of simple representational formats is superior compared to highly structured ones. Even though the latter encouraged the provision of additional non-given material, the former is less error-prone. A hypothesized structural guidance provided by more complex formats could not be confirmed. With respect to collaboration, the results highlight that arguing in groups lead to more cluttered argumentation maps, including a higher amount of duplicate elements. An expected peer-reviewing between group members did not occur. Yet, groups also tended to include more points-of-view in their arguments, leading to more elaborated argument maps.

We suggest that thinking aloud, log files and eye tracking are promising candidates. These methods enable researchers to study interaction in more detail than other methods. All these methods have strengths and weaknesses. A combination of two or three of these methods might help to overcome the weaknesses.	data logger;eye tracking;information retrieval;information visualization;interaction	Margit Pohl;Florian Scholz	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-54894-9_3	human–computer interaction;computer science;data mining;multimedia	HCI	-63.90627346260432	-46.07216549517598	148423

TE-ext enables students to visualize a problem situation. Users of TE-ext can implement changes in the situation and see the result as an animation. Experimental use of TE-ext identified three barriers to conducting an effective thought experiment (TE). First, participants tended not to change the situation from the original one; second, incorrect or inappropriate knowledge was applied to the situation; third, the participants did not apply the results of their TE to other situations. These factors prevented participants from rejecting their initial incorrect model and finding a new one through TEs.	experiment;ext js javascript framework;problem solving;schrödinger's cat;test engineer	Miki Matsumuro;Kazuhisa Miwa	2016			cognitive psychology;psychology;thought experiment	HCI	-73.00671172157195	-47.041988662924325	148492

Thereafter the various schemes based on BKT are proposed to model student knowledge state and learning process. However, these schemes seldom consider the situation when a student first encounters a knowledge component KC. That is, the existing models cannot be applied directly to predict student performance on a first-encounter KC. To solve this issue, combined user-based collaborative filtering and BKT model, a novel student performance prediction scheme PSFK is proposed in this paper. The PSFK scheme contains three major steps: first, building BKT models for each student and each KC he or she has encountered; then, finding the top-k similar students for a specified student S; finally, predicting S's response on first-encounter KC. We evaluate our scheme on a real-world data set which contains 4883 students and 177 KCs. The experiments show that the student performance prediction results of the proposed PSFK are acceptable the RMSE can be decreased to 0.403.	performance prediction	Yonghao Song;Yan Jin;Xiaohui Zheng;Haiyan Han;Yunqin Zhong;Xiaofang Zhao	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-25159-2_58	simulation;user modeling;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;collaborative filtering;machine learning;multimedia	AI	-76.3244777718005	-48.89925169769115	148586

This study examines how gender shapes (a) introductory computing students' perceptions of their leadership, including measures of both general self-rated leadership ability and perceived capacity for leadership in computing, (b) how these perceptions change during the introductory computing course, and (c) the experiences that are related to change in leadership outcomes. Findings reveal gender differences in how incoming introductory course students report both their general leadership abilities and their perceived capacity for leadership in computing. Additionally, both women and men experienced a decline in their perceived capacity for leadership in computing during the introductory course. These and other findings are discussed, with attention given to the implications for both researchers and instructors seeking to broaden women's participation in computing.	emoticon;experience	Jennifer M.

We developed a computerized scaffolding system that uses an attention management system to support metacognitive activities in small groups. We previously found that the scaffolding stimulates the group’ metacognitive activities and enhances individual metacognitive knowledge. Moreover different forms of scaffolds have differential effects on learning that cannot be explained by quantitative differences in the groups’ metacognitive activities. Therefore, we investigate to qualitative differences in the groups’ collaborative discourse in this study. We found that groups receiving scaffolding had significantly less ignored metacognitive episodes. Groups receiving problematizing scaffolds had significantly less ignored metacognitive episodes and more co-constructed metacognitive episodes compared to groups receiving structuring scaffolds. These findings indicate that scaffolding indeed positively influenced collaborative discourse and intensive collaborative discourse seems to explain the differential learning effects of different forms of scaffolds.	the european library		2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23985-4	computer science	Vision	-74.30868937325916	-41.80298441067258	148858

By migrating to cloud services, Saudi universities will be moving data and programs from local servers to the internet, thereby providing users with the ability to access and share information at any time from multiple devices. The migration to cloud-based IT resources is not yet widespread in Saudi universities due to several challenges including security, legal policies and implementation. At present, there is lack of research and guidance for Saudi universities on how to overcome these challenges and how contextual factors can influence the successful migration to the educational clouds. This research presents a framework for the successful migration to cloud technology in the Saudi Arabian universities. In this research, a set of key critical success factors (CSFs) were identified by synthesizing components from studies concerned with the migration of cloud for higher education and factors identified from the successful implementation of WBL (Web Based Learning) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) on higher education in Saudi Arabia. Based on this knowledge, the proposed framework was evaluated via expert review and a survey by IT specialists from the Saudi universities. The initial CSFs were updated based on the expert reviews and the results were analysed. Based on the findings at this stage, additional CSFs were added to the framework as suggested by the experts. Subsequently, in order to confirm the reviewed CSFs, additional investigation via a structured online questionnaire was conducted and the outcome was analysed via one-sample t-test with the data integrity analysed via Cronbach’s alpha. The outcome indicated the majority of CSFs to be statistically significant except the Physical Location CSF. Potential future study and contributions are discussed. * Corresponding author at: School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.

ebf51ef8d58db6e30668fcc272e299c33d337c10	an android application for animated lecture retrieval in e-learning		The use of mobile devices in content delivery has made instructional learning more compact and convenient for learners and tutors. This is due to recent development in mobile technology and its use in supporting educational and instructional activities. The efficacy of creating instructional contents still serves as a major confrontation for educators at all institutions in all spheres of education. The main objective of this project is to integrate the use of mobile technology with instructional content retrieval to improve teaching and learning. In this paper, we have developed a mobile application for content retrieval in mobile learning. This application is linked to a repository where instructional contents reside. This approach would help students access instructional contents anywhere away from their regular learning environment using their mobile device. Students would also have access to an E-learning website whose database would also serve as a repository to the mobile application. The effectiveness of this work is to provide an ease of learning for students by offering a tool that would help access course materials from anywhere. Students in the scientific domain would also have the opportunity to understand abstract concepts on their own by having access scientific animated contents on their mobile devices as well as on the E-learning website.	android;digital distribution;focal (programming language);interrupt;mobile app;mobile device;mobile phone;portable document format;seamless3d	Damilola Osikoya;Adeleke Oluwalani	2013	ICST Trans. e-Education e-Learning	10.4108/el.1.3.e4	human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-68.50358978018987	-39.40731515252413	149487

Based on task analysis and the analysis of method of knowledge elicitation, ten cognitive abilities have been identified. Experimental data indicate that the cognitive abilities of experts affect significantly the effectiveness of the elicited data and the percentage of total knowledge acquired.	cognition	Chin-Jung Chao;Gavriel Salvendy	1995	Behaviour & IT	10.1080/01449299508914644	psychology;cognition;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;social psychology;expert system	AI	-73.58162173138419	-49.99197681915059	149541

One of them is the employment of eye movement measurement technique which takes into account a more natural setting and actual user involvement. While previous studies have explained the definition of eye movement and in the usability of a design, this preliminary research was study the eye movement characteristics through the theory of eye tracking on product label that was choose by student, before the research will be further on expert validation on product label through interview. It combining several aspects in eye movement measurements comprises fixation count, fixation duration, cumulative proportion of respondent fixation count and cumulative proportion of respondents for fixation duration on area of interest (AOI) of product label design. The findings reveal that AOI for text design has the highest cumulative proportion of respondent in fixation count and fixation duration. However, AOI for text design also indicates that there was a lack of attention in eye movement. In conclusion, the characteristics of the design elements for each AOI can be determined by the proportion results of eye movement.	eye tracking	Mohd Hafiz Faizal Mohamad Kamil;Azizah Jaafar	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-02958-0_69	simulation;engineering;communication;engineering drawing	HCI	-73.86055679720157	-47.725044497497876	149645

About 55 pairs discussed in chat and wrote about genetically modified organisms in a groupware environment, supported by a text-outline or an argumentative diagram. The expectation was that students who were constructing a diagram would argue in a more thorough way, which is called the broadening and deepening in the space of debate. The expectations were partially confirmed. Diagrams help students to argue in a more thorough way, but only in the diagrams itself and not, as expected, in the discussion. This article shows the difficulties of supporting interactive argumentation with representational tools, because of the great amount of other variables in task and learning environment that effect the way students broaden and deepen an argument. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Conventional recommendation methods consider user preferences and/or levels, but they do not directly consider the learning efficiency. With our method, the learning efficiency is quantified by the expected improvement in the test score, and materials are recommended so as to maximize this expected improvement. The expected improvement is calculated with logistic regression models that employ the user’s test result obtained before learning as input. Experimental results using fill-in-the-blank exercises for English learning show that our method yields major improvements in performance compared with random material recommendation.	algorithm;logistic regression;user (computing)	Tomoharu Iwata;Tomoko Kojiri;Takeshi Yamada;Toyohide Watanabe	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-89197-0_92	simulation;computer science;machine learning;data mining;logistic regression;generalization error	AI	-75.72215567223304	-48.00455667339653	149821

However, the problem of these robots is that a user loses his/her interest in them. To solve this problem, some studies which focus on emotional expression models have been reported in Human-Agent-Interaction. The model of emotional expressions is defined as the agent expressing its emotions autonomously. Although these models have been shown to be beneficial for effective interaction between an agent and a human, no reports have addressed the educational-support robots using these models. Thus, this paper studies how much learning effect with a robot which expresses the emotion by using the model of emotional expression can be prompted for learners in a collaborative learning.	autonomous robot;human–computer interaction;robot	Felix Jimenez;Tomohiro Yoshikawa;Takeshi Furuhashi;Masayoshi Kanoh	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/SMC.2015.94	robot;robot learning;collaborative learning;error-driven learning;team learning;simulation;analysis of variance;cybernetics;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Robotics	-69.51393701105079	-46.064726648896894	149903

A contextually relevant problem (determining the maximum height an """"egg-drop contraption"""" could be dropped without breaking) was described to the students who were then asked 1) to come up with the most efficient solution they could to the problem while describing their thinking for the interviewer; and 2) to determine, from a choice of three solutions proposed by the interviewer, which is the most efficient.  Students were found to have varying degrees of success in solving the problem or picking the most efficient solution. The most successful recognized the salient features of the problem and used them to generate possible solutions. The least successful were unable to understand the abstractions inherent in the problem. Students recognized that the most efficient of three proposed solutions may depend on the instance of the problem (where the contraption actually failed). They also understood that there was a """"best"""" solution in general, and chose the solution that had the best worst-case scenario.  Compared to college students studied previously using similar algorithmic reasoning problems, middle school girls appeared to perform similarly. They were able to demonstrate sophisticated computational thinking skills while suffering from some of the same algorithmic thinking limitations as older students."""	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;computational thinking;worst-case complexity;worst-case scenario	Michèlle Friend;Robert Cutler	2013		10.1145/2493394.2493413	psychology;mathematics education;simulation;developmental psychology;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;algorithmic efficiency;management;social psychology;pedagogy	AI	-72.55744874739314	-47.67094487628471	150327

We asked a sample of sixty teachers from the same schools their views of pupils' use and competence in using the internet. We found large differences between student and teacher perceptions of students' skill and use of the internet. This suggests that teachers' perceptions and knowledge of computing may be a signifi cant, in discouraging girls from studying computing subjects.	internet access	Eleanor Wombwell;Dan J.

In a university course teaching ethnography and design students were out in the field making observations and collecting data. We gave them access to a wiki, which they used to upload field notes and material as a support for collaboration. In this paper we present three tools we built and deployed to aid the students when in field and when collaborating. The first is a mobile tool used to gather data: a program running on the students' mobile phones let them take photos, record video and audio, and write simple text notes, which are automatically uploaded to the wiki. The second is an awareness tool that enables the students to quickly see what the others have done in the wiki. The third is a novel browser for the uploaded data, which relates objects by both time and location. We also talk about the experience from having students using the tools live during the course.	field research;mobile phone;simpletext;upload;wiki	Mattias Rost;Lars Erik Holmquist	2008	Fifth IEEE International Conference on Wireless, Mobile, and Ubiquitous Technology in Education (wmute 2008)	10.1109/WMUTE.2008.14	simulation;awareness;human–computer interaction;computer science;mobile technology;computer-supported cooperative work;multimedia;ethnography	HCI	-67.93900602647994	-40.239407720620214	150944

A class blog was utilized as a means for PE students to reflect on and showcase their performances of four specific basketball skills, through creating multimedia posts on these skills and receiving comments from their instructors, peers and an external expert. The effectiveness of multimedia blogging was evaluated, in terms of the acquisition of knowledge of the specific basketball skills and the self-efficacy in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), as compared to that of an equivalent multimedia website which lacked the blogging component. Students' responses to the blogging activity were also investigated. The sample were 70 undergraduate PE students who were assigned to two groups, one of which used the class blog (Group A, N = 35) and the other one the website (Group B, N = 35), both for 11 weeks. The study followed a pretest/posttest experimental design, taking before and after measurements of each group through written questionnaires. Participation in the blogging activity did have a positive impact on students' ICT self-efficacy, given that Group A students exhibited significant gains in Internet self-efficacy as well as in multimedia processing and blogging self-efficacy, whereas those of Group B did not. Students' responses to the blogging activity were also positive. However, within both groups no significant increase was found in students' knowledge of the basketball skills. The implications of the findings for higher education and future research are discussed.	blog	Marina Papastergiou;Vassilis Gerodimos;Panagiotis Antoniou	2011	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2011.05.006	psychology;learning community;self-efficacy;qualitative comparative analysis;questionnaire;physical education;social science;simulation;multimedia;electronic publishing;communication;social psychology;world wide web;statistics;pedagogy	HCI	-75.78774230888384	-40.864227864128395	151002

Its main goal is to enable each of the collaborating group members to bring and to contribute ideas and knowledge to the group and then to share it with them in order to combine it into a final result. In engineering education, concepts taught through lectures are often complemented by lab experimentation, through which students can observe phenomena that are often difficult to explain by written material. This contribution presents a collaborative working environment for remote experimentation, which allows two students or more to conduct remote experiments at the same time as a team. The lab can be accessed via Internet from any place and at any time, and enables the students to obtain an automated help by either a human tutor or a rule-based e-tutor.

Twenty staff members, for whom a wiki was built, were surveyed, while records of their activities on the wiki over a 6month period were retrieved and analyzed. Findings reveal that though most of these staff members have positive views towards the wiki as a space that can effectively promote information sharing and collaboration, they are not quite as enthusiastic about engaging the wiki as a medium for their daily collaborative work activities. The possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed together with recommendations on the strategies similar organizations can adopt to help encourage and maximize wiki usage in the workplace.

Taking four universities, the research: (1) identifies the distinction between the students’ current usage of social software; (2) reports on the students’ experience on opportunities and challenges of learning with social software; and (3) introduces principles as a guideline in using social software for learning. Quantitative research methods (web-based questionnaires) were incorporated to investigate the pattern of learners’ usage. Qualitative methods (student interviews) were adopted to clarify and further inform this relationship and their attitudes towards social software for learning. The results demonstrate a massive use of educational technology with distinct divide between the learning space and personal space. Student voices reveal that the central problem of such divide is due to the contrast perception and experience of ‘learning/studying and social life’. We argue that online learning and social personas may overlap but that learning needs to be designed so that it addresses the individual preferences to combine or separate the two domains. The paper concludes with a few principles of learning with social software grounded in students’ experience and Vygotsky’s paradigm. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Elimination testing that uses the same set of multiple-choice items rewards examinees with partial knowledge over those who are simply guessing. This study provides a computer-based test and item analysis system to reduce the difficulty of grading and item analysis following elimination tests. The Rasch model, based on item response theory for dichotomous scoring, and the partial credit model, based on graded item response for elimination testing, are the kernel of the test-diagnosis subsystem to estimate examinee ability and itemdifficulty parameters. This study draws the following conclusions: (1) examinees taking computer-based tests (CBTs) have the same performance as those taking paper-and-pencil tests (PPTs); (2) conventional scoring does not measure the same knowledge as partial scoring; (3) the partial scoring of multiple choice lowers the number of unexpected responses from examinees; and (4) the different question topics and types do not influence the performance of examinees in either PPTs or CBTs.	item response theory;rasch model	Shao-Hua Chang;Pei-Chun Lin;Zih-Chuan Lin	2007	Educational Technology & Society		econometrics;multiple choice;computer science;item response theory;grading (education);item analysis;statistics;rasch model;polytomous rasch model	AI	-74.86795263757135	-46.62269660366837	151426

d456dd3214d12804ce8f89d2ac3a4df60fb94c02	collaborative learning using social media tools in a blended learning course		The concept of collaboration is rooted in social constructivist theo- ries. With social theories as the theoretical base, collaborative learning is extended to online collaborative learning with the support of new technologies. In blended learning, students learn in collaborative situations using online tools to support inquiry and discovery learning. The Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework is a popular framework for blended learning from a socio-con- structivist perspective where teaching, cognitive and social presence are required in collaborative constructivist learning. With the continued advances in tech- nology, online collaborative learning via social media initiates new learning experiences. The purpose of this paper is to explore the student experience in collaborative learning using social media tools in a blended learning course. In this study, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted in a blended learning course. The results show the students engaged in learning through use of WhatsApp, Skype and Facebook to transfer, share and construct knowledge among peers in asynchronous and synchronous modes. Relationships of the collaboration with learning outcomes, engagement and other influential factors were also found. The collaboration was found to be initiated independently by the students and was a non-prescribed activity as it was not designed in the course nor instructed by the teachers. This study asserts that the element of autonomy could be considered in the Community of Inquiry in reflecting the learning experience without a teaching presence in blended learning.	social media	Jeanne Lam	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20621-9_15	professional learning community;collaborative learning;cooperative learning;educational technology;team learning;blended learning;constructivist teaching methods;computer science;knowledge management;experiential learning;learning sciences;teaching and learning center;teaching method;multimedia;active learning;action learning;open learning;synchronous learning;pedagogy	ML	-74.46649672088472	-40.436832559333645	151644

Developed at Carnegie Mellon University, CLS is a combination of electronic books, social networks, and analytic tools. With CLS, instructors can upload documents, create social groups, and monitor student activities. Students can annotate documents, answer questions, and communicate in a social networks context. Students learn through participation in social networks while instructors use the tools built into CLS to easily and effectively analyze their participation. The workshop covers extant social networks, introduces CLS web-based software (nothing to install) and demonstrates the use of CLS to help students master critical skills such as code review, debugging, and reading documentation. Participants will create Salons, learn how to use them in their courses, and learn how to use the built-in tools to analyze student activities.

We discuss work carried out in developing AudioQuake (an adaption of Quake for blind gamers); specifically the techniques used for rendering information and the nature of this work in contrast to other accessible games (both research and commercial). Based on user feedback regarding the effectiveness of the methods employed in AudioQuake, techniques for not only imparting but allowing vision-impaired users to edit 3D structures are proposed. Taking into account the progress made so far, we make the case for future research work, which could benefit many different types of users and help increase accessibility in other areas such as education.	accessibility;definition;pc game	Matthew T.

To investigate the potential for data-driven worked examples to achieve similar results, we generated worked examples for the Deep Thought logic tutor, and conducted an experiment to assess their impact on performance. Students who received data-driven worked examples were much more likely to complete the tutor, and completed the tutor in less time. This study demonstrates that worked examples, automatically generated from student data, can be used to improve student learning in tutoring systems.	deep thought (chess computer);download	Behrooz Mostafavi;Guojing Zhou;Collin Lynch;Min Chi;Tiffany Barnes	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-19773-9_102	mathematics education;computer science;artificial intelligence;pedagogy	AI	-75.43311596236538	-46.808463702098194	152248

The tool implements the adaptive self-consistent learning object SET (ASCLO-S) visual language, a special case of flow diagrams, to be used by instructional designers to define classes of learners through stereotypes and to specify the more suited adaptive learning process for each class of learners. The usability study is based on the combined use of two techniques: a questionnaire-based survey and an empirical analysis. The survey has been used to achieve feedbacks from the subjects' point of view. In particular, it has been useful to capture the perceived usability of the subjects. The outcomes show that both the proposed visual notation and the system prototype are suitable for instructional designers with or without experience on the computer usage and on tools for defining e-learning processes. This result is further confirmed by the empirical analysis we carried out by analysing the correlation between the effort to develop adaptive e-learning processes and some measures suitable defined for those processes. Indeed, the empirical analysis revealed that the effort required to model e-learning processes is not influenced by the experience of the instructional designer with the use of e-learning tools, but it only depends on the size of the developed process.	usability	Gennaro Costagliola;Andrea De Lucia;Filomena Ferrucci;Carmine Gravino;Giuseppe Scanniello	2008	J.

We describe the results of a study that investigated learners’ help-seeking behavior using two feedback options implemented in an ITS for Java programming. The 25 students had the choice between asking for feedback on errors in their programs and feedback on possible next steps in the solution process. We hypothesized that learners’ choices would depend on correctness of their programs and their progress in problemsolving. Surprisingly, this hypothesis was not confirmed.	correctness (computer science);java	Sebastian Gross;Niels Pinkwart	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-19773-9_71	knowledge management;computer science;intelligent tutoring system;correctness;help-seeking;java	AI	-73.34149527852787	-46.12106616153985	152721

It describes an experiment which compares an animationand a text-based interface in terms of how the students perceived the alerting system. Relationships between the number of interactions, performance, and perceived social presence are examined. The results indicate that the animation-based interface group interact more than the text-based interface group and perceptions of social presence might be stronger for those students who post more messages. In addition, the results suggest that those students who perceived a stronger social presence also performed better. These findings have implications for designing online course environments where the design of the interface should be considered as a variable that enhances social presence.	anomalous experiences;interaction;interactivity;online machine learning;social presence theory;text-based (computing);text-based user interface;webmail	Luciane Maria Fadel;Mary C.

Divided into three groups, they conducted some tasks in three different learning environments (video/audio, audio and face-to-face) during an academic semester. Before each oral task, all the participants had to conduct the same task in synchronous text chat. The participants’ interview transcriptions, learning journals and the instructor’s observation journal provided information about the impacts of each environment on their perception of social presence. The results of the study suggested that the differences in the environments are reflected in the learners’ perception of social presence.	online chat;social presence theory;the final fantasy legend	Chao-Jung Ko	2012	ReCALL	10.1017/S0958344011000292	psychology;social science;french;computer science;linguistics;multimedia;sociology;communication;pedagogy;computer-mediated communication	HCI	-74.19798278774701	-42.87794723442267	152876

EG designers not only have to deal with the inherent technical complexity of game design, but also have to be able to interweave learning activities in a way that is enjoyable and educationally effective at the same time. In order to make available the benefits of game based learning to a wider audience, it is necessary to provide means to alleviate the cost of envisioning new EG by providing tools that might contribute to make the design process easier and quicker. As a first step towards this goal, in this paper we introduce a conceptual model that organizes in a modular way and in different design perspectives the game features. In order to help EG designers, the features that are most often regarded in the literature as significant in producing engaging, fun and educational game experiences, have been included in the model through a set of design entities. Furthermore, the organization of the elements of the model facilitates reusing pieces of the EG designs to quickly produce variants of the same game which can be used to match different learning purposes. The opinions gathered from the educators and game designers that participated of an EG design workshop confirmed that the model can help multidisciplinary EG design teams. Moreover, the model successfully contributed to the process of designing a collection of EGs aimed at raising children ́s awareness of emergencies and domestic risks, whose educational and ludic value was assessed in an experience conducted with students and educators at a primary school in Madrid.	entity;eurographics;experience;ludic interface;modeling language;requirement;samegame;socialization	Telmo Zarraonandia;Paloma Díaz;Ignacio Aedo;Mario Rafael Ruiz Vargas	2013	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-013-1821-1	first playable demo;game design;simulation;computer science;win-win game;knowledge management;game mechanics;machine learning;game art design;game developer;multimedia;simulations and games in economics education;algorithmic game theory;game design document;world wide web;computer security;game testing	HCI	-72.14488470451407	-39.16024039328591	153011

However, the approach of doing science endorsed by VLs has not been carefully examined. A survey of 233 online VLs revealed that hypothetico-deductive (HD) logic prevails in VL design. Most VLs convey an oversimplified view of scientific inquiry, which might handicap science education in terms of cultivating the ability to conduct authentic scientific inquiry and to solve everyday problems, or promoting students' scientific literacy. Ever since Duhem and Kuhn, philosophers of science have learned that the relationship between hypotheses and evidence is holistic rather than deductive; however the pedagogical value of this point has not received enough attention in science education. Many science educators and VL-designers still uncritically adhere to the HD method. This article comments on the HD method and how VLs can avoid embracing it.	simulation	Sufen Chen	2010	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2010.05.009	psychology;computer simulation;social science;simulation;science education;computer science;inquiry;evaluation;teaching method;mathematics;multimedia;sociology;scientific literacy;communication;world wide web;pedagogy	HPC	-71.80996533102736	-40.60366435642708	153300

This paper introduces Heuristic Evaluation for Child E-learning applications (HECE), a comprehensive set of heuristics for child e-learning along with a detailed explanation for the usability experts on how to apply them. These sets of heuristics are based on Nielsen's original ten heuristic developed for software. Nielson heuristics are basically generic, and might not encompass usability attributes specific to children or e-learning. The new HECE set would overcome these shortcomings. The validity and effectiveness of these heuristics were evaluated against two developed e-learning programs designed by ReDSOFT for KG-2 and special need students. The results indicated that HECE identified qualitative similarities and differences with user testing, and that HECE is best suited for evaluating general and child usability. Combined with user testing, HECE offers a new track that can assist in guiding the child e-learning industry to design applications that are both educational and pleasurable for children.	heuristic (computer science);heuristic evaluation;software development;usability testing	Asmaa Alsumait;Asma Al-Osaimi	2009	JSW	10.1145/1806338.1806417	usability goals;component-based usability testing;cognitive walkthrough;simulation;usability;human–computer interaction;computer science;systems engineering;usability engineering;heuristic evaluation;usability lab;usability inspection	HCI	-64.83038355476278	-47.1807966796769	153310

In one approach ConcurTaskTrees are applied to accomplish a hierarchical task analysis including temporal relations. In the other approach, based on the Cognitive Task Analysis method CPM-GOMS (Cognitive Perceptual Motor - Goals Operators Methods Selection Rules), a new technique for detecting potential contradictions and conflicts in the use of concurrent cognitive resources is generated. Within this model-based approach, extrinsic and intrinsic performance shaping factors are comprised, taking into account the specific context of modern surgical work systems. Additionally, a computer assisted usability analysis tool including the above-mentioned methods is developed to provide support for small and medium-sized enterprises in early stages of the design development process of risk sensitive Human-Machine-Interfaces in medical systems.	prospective search;task analysis;usability	Armin Janß;Wolfgang Lauer;Klaus Radermacher	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-76805-0_29	usability goals;cognitive walkthrough;simulation;usability;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;task analysis	NLP	-62.97934219165306	-51.72320327926341	153336

After the 2016 challenge held in November in our country (Italy), we interviewed some participants on the difficulties they had faced and we modified some of the tasks accordingly. We then proposed the whole set of tasks, with some of them modified, to pupils who had not participated to the challenge in November and compared performances in the two sessions. Using Item Response Theory, we measured the change in the distribution of difficulty and discrimination of the modified tasks. On the basis of the obtained results, we tried to better understand the many factors which influenced the difference in performances, both in the conceptual and cognitive task content and in its presentation (text, images, layout).	a/b testing;cognition;computation;computational thinking;item response theory;performance;population;randomized algorithm;requirements analysis	Violetta Lonati;Mattia Monga;Dario Malchiodi;Anna Morpurgo	2017		10.1145/3141880.3141900	item response theory;pedagogy;computer science;informal education;computational thinking;cognition	HCI	-74.54679618595824	-45.55273544870702	153378

065bfa05a2288b39d6865fe1c925e3f35dd28828	use case diagrams for mobile and multi-channel information systems: experimental comparison of colour and icon annotations		In mobile information systems, it may be more important to capture where a user is supposed to perform an activity, as well as what type of device is going to be used, than what is the case for traditional, stationary information systems. Yet, mainstream diagram notations like use case diagrams seldom capture such information. In previous papers we have proposed some adaptations to use case diagrams to be able to include location and equipment requirements, but these adaptations have not been evaluated experimentally. This paper reports on a student experiment comparing two different notations, one using colour and the other using symbolic icons. The experiment also includes a task where the models contained both location and equipment information at the same time. In that case, one alternative used colour for locations and icons for equipment, while the other used icons both for colour and equipment. The results showed no significant difference between the two treatment groups, neither in the quality of answers to the experimental tasks, the time needed to perform the tasks, nor in their opinions given in post-task questionnaires about the notations they were exposed to.	diagram;experiment;industrial engineering;information system;requirement;stationary process	Sundar Gopalakrishnan;Guttorm Sindre	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-39429-9_30	natural language processing;computer science;theoretical computer science;world wide web	SE	-63.56830394093692	-49.06057874571668	153477

Children with learning disabilities can have normal range intellectual quotient (IQ) but they may still have teachers and parents concerned about their capacity to assimilate new material and to develop skills. Often, these children may try very hard to follow instructions and to concentrate to reach good results. Yet, despite this effort, they fall behind. Therefore, it is very important to spread awareness in the society of the importance of the early intervention to help children with learning disabilities in their early stages in order to improve and enhance their learning capabilities. This can be done through adaptive, intelligent and informative ways. This paper contributes an intelligent web-based adaptive serious games system that helps children with learning disabilities at the kindergarten stage and through the early stages of primary education. The system targets children with normal IQ and relies on two valid tests; one for the IQ and one for diagnosis purposes. The latter is used to diagnose developmental disabilities for preschool age. This test serves as a basis for knowledge engineering for the developed rule-based inference engine.	awareness;inference engine;information;knowledge engineering;logic programming;web application	Ghada A.

Ninety-four 10th grade (ages 16-17) girl students, in two Earth Science classes in Taiwan, were assigned to two settings: collaborative teamsand individuals. The students’ scientific process skill development, attitude toward school science and attitude toward using and learning about computers were compared. It was found that both groups showed significant improvements in skills and attitudes. However, the students in the team situation did not demonstrate significantly better skills or attitudes than the students in the individual situation.	computer;network science	C. H. Chiu	2002	J.

However, considerably less is known about the relationship between student’s metacognition related to non-cognitive dimensions, such as their affect or lifestyles, and academic performance. This paper presents a preliminary analysis of data gathered by Performance Learning Education (PL), with respect to students’ self-reports on non-cognitive dimensions as possible predictors of their academic outcomes. The results point to the predictive potential of such self-reports, to the importance of students exercising their self-understanding during learning, and to the potentially critical role of incorporating such student’s self-reports in learner modelling.

This technology is often criticized, however, for hampering personalized interaction with students. This paper introduces a unique approach for analyzing student characteristics influencing their adoption and use of computer-based educational technology so that instructors can better meet student learning needs. Using visual, selforganizing mapping, our data mining approach clustered students based on input data from thirty-six survey questions posed to over 400 students with experience using computer based training and assessment. The data mining technique provided clear descriptions of four different student clusters. Based on the unique characteristics of the four clusters, instructors could optimize classroom resources as well as provide individualized support once specific students are matched to their respective cluster group. In this manner, continual computer-based assessments of students can be used to maximize computer-based learning and evaluation.	data mining;personalization	Antonina Durfee;Scott L.

22521fc388dbdd849cb96708c2de3bbe1d9f3ff3	interactive football-training based on rebounders with hit position sensing and audio-visual feedback		The last decade’s advancements in computer technology have facilitated a growing interest in the development of interactive sports-training equipment. This development has provided athletes and coaches with measurement and training tools, with performance analysis or skill improvement as purpose. However, most of these tools are created with a single goal, either to measure or train, and are often used and tested in very controlled settings. In this paper, we present an interactive football-training platform, called Football Lab, featuring sensormounted rebounders as well as audio-visual feedback. Football Lab enables the creation of novel training games, which aim to improve players’ technical skills, and simultaneously function as a tool for measuring player performance and development over time. A logging of the Football Lab was conducted through 92 weeks, where the platform was available for the general public, analysis of a subset of the 20.000 games played in the period are discussed. Moreover, the paper contains a discussion covering challenges in data collection, transferability issues for interactive training equipment, as well as examples of experiments conducted with the platform. Finally, directions for future research within the area of interactive training equipment are proposed.	computer;experiment;profiling (computer programming)	Mads Møller Jensen;Kaj Grønbæk;Nikolaj Thomassen;Jacob Andersen;Jesper Nielsen	2014	Int.

Our technique involves using game analytics to create an abstracted game analytic space to make the problem tractable. We then model player retention in this space and move through this space in accordance to a target distribution of game states in order to influence player behavior. Experiments performed show that the adaptive version of SQ:TG is able to better fit a target distribution of game states while also significantly reducing the quitting rate compared to the non-adaptive version of the game.	adaptive system;cobham's thesis;experience;n-gram;sound quality;video game developer	Brent E.

9d42f47c12e5dc740fda2b77d7bfbb0586d7819d	strategic game moves mediate implicit science learning		Educational games have the potential to be innovative forms of learning assessment, by allowing us to not just study their knowledge but the process that takes students to that knowledge. This paper examines the mediating role of players’ moves in digital games on changes in their pre-post classroom measures of implicit science learning. We applied automated detectors of strategic moves, built and validated from game log data combined with coded videos of gameplay of 69 students, to a new and larger sample of gameplay data. These data were collected as part of national implementation study of the physical science game, Impulse. This study compared 213 students in 21 classrooms that only played the game and 180 students in 18 classrooms in where the players’ teacher used game examples to bridge the implicit science learning in the game with explicit science content covered in class. We analyzed how learning outcomes between conditions were associated with six strategic moves students made during gameplay. Three of the strategic moves observed are consistent with an implicit understanding of Newton’s First Law, the other three strategic moves were not. Path analyses suggest the mediating role of strategic moves on students’ implicit science learning is different between the two conditions.	newton;sensor	Elizabeth Rowe;Ryan Shaun Joazeiro de Baker;Jodi Asbell-Clarke	2015			computer science;physical science;simulation;coding (social sciences);multilevel model;educational technology;protocol analysis;path analysis (statistics)	AI	-73.1989307251311	-41.79776567917836	154254

However, there are few studies discussing effective web-mediated teaching methods for both students and teachers. To help students learn and develop their academic involvement in a blended course, and improve their thoughts regarding this course, the author in this study re-designed and re-developed a combined teaching method for the course. The author conducted a quasi-experimental study to explore the effects of different combinations of web-mediated CL with/without initiation and SRL with/without feedback on involving students and enhancing their thoughts regarding this blended course. This research involved 227 second-year university students from four class sections, including three experimental groups (CISF, CIS, and CI groups), and a control group (C group), who received different combined interventions. In this research, students in CISF group (web-mediated instruction that integrated CL with initiation and SRL with feedback) significantly improved their involvement by the end of the course. In addition, students in CISF group had positive thoughts regarding web-mediated CL with initiation and SRL with feedback. The implications and discussion for teachers who plan to design teaching methods for online courses are also provided in this paper.	experiment;teaching method	Chia-Wen Tsai	2014	Interactive Learning Environments	10.1080/10494820.2012.745422	psychology;questionnaire;cooperative learning;blended learning;knowledge management;initiation;teaching method;intervention;instructional design;feedback;mathematics;multimedia;tourism;law;independent study;pedagogy	HCI	-75.53084130567206	-40.93859527406516	154853

The goal of the present research is to draw from these separate lines of research to ask how changes in basic cognitive capacities and formal learning gains may be related. The present study employed a game in which a ship moves through different environments using forces. The game teaches the basic relationships between objects and forces in Newton’s Laws of Motion. Students played one of two versions of the game. The predictive version encouraged planning and reflection, by allowing students unlimited time to place forces along a path. In the real-time version, forces immediately affected the player when selected. The results suggest that learning was equivalent across the versions, but changes in attentional capacities may differentially contribute to learning between versions.	automated planning and scheduling;newton;real-time computing;real-time locating system;three laws of robotics	Stephen S.

Some studies have shown that intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) can be superior to traditional classroom instruction. In this study, we compare problem solving with little or no feedback in the classroom to problem solving using a web-based ITS for homework. The system provides students with coached practice that is meant to scaffold “learning by doing” while students practice their problem solving skills. We found evidence that using the web-based ITS to practice problem solving at home was better than the classroom problem solving with an effect size of 0.5.	problem solving;web application	Leena M.

We present a case study comparing three such methods on the same data set, logged by Project LISTEN’s Reading Tutor from usage by 174 children in grades 2-4 (typically 710 years) over the course of the 2005-2006 school year. The Reading Tutor chooses randomly between two different types of reading practice. In assisted oral reading, the child reads aloud and the tutor helps. In “Word Swap,” the tutor reads aloud and the child identifies misread words. One method we use here to evaluate reading practice is conventional analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), where the outcome is performance on the same words when encountered again later. The second method is learning decomposition, which estimates the impact of each practice type as a parameter in an exponential learning curve. The third method is knowledge tracing, which estimates the impact of practice as a probability in a dynamic Bayes net.

To measure these styles, EHS are generally based on the questionnaires provided by the used LS model, and that learners should answer before the first session. This approach has a major drawback: learners' LS are defined only once. To overcome this limitation, recent researches are currently being done on the detection of LS based on learner's interaction traces. Their general criticism is related to the use of a specific environment, and therefore specific traces and indicators. Therefore, we aim to identify the learner's LS automatically, based on simple navigation traces. In this paper, we present experimental results of identification of sequential/global and active/reflective LS, for 45 students, using supervised classification. The findings provide initial evidence that LS can be automatically identified based on learners' navigation behaviours.	machine learning;web application	Nabila Bousbia;Jean-Marc Labat;Amar Balla;Issam Rebaï	2011	IJLT	10.1504/IJLT.2011.040148	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;multimedia	ML	-74.67080691223377	-48.57289926068094	156020

Mathematics is one of the primary components of school education. Word problem in mathematics resembles a daily life situation. In general understanding the word problem is one of the prerequisites in solving the problem. Students with learning problem find difficulty in understanding the situational word problems in mathematics. The learning problem cannot be cured but can be reduced by giving proper training in the required domain. Training can be given with similar type of questions generated by automatic question generation techniques.

Recent stud ie show that navigation styles can content much of the information related to cogn itive learning styles and preferences. These navigation styles can be defined by means of different parameters. In this work, we focus on the parameter that defines if the navigation style is either local or global. Local refers to a navigation style where the student prefers to learn one aspect of the topic in depth b efore going on. This type of student does not want to be distracted with irrelev ant information, whereas students with Global navigation style want to have broad idea before starting with details. To measure these navigation styles, d viations over a proposed initial learning route are taken into account. The more Loc al properties found in the navigation, the smaller the number of deviations. I f the number of deviations is high, students are supposed to have a Global Naviga tion style, where the proposed route is exceeded. This parameter (Local/Global) is then analyzed against a more complete student learning profile.	apache ant (another neat tool);cluster analysis;personalization;statistical classification;virtual reality	Rosa Basagoiti;Asier Aztiria;Igor Ordoñez;Ion Padilla	2012		10.3233/978-1-61499-080-2-267	multimedia;knowledge management;computer science	ML	-68.4257457472239	-41.49729440995385	156335

Pervasive game (PG) is among one of the mobile games. It has been identified that all computer games have some functions facilitating learning, so as PG. However, it has also been identified that for low prior knowledge and/or less enthusiastic learners, educational games had no more effective than traditional media due to heavy cognitive load. This study intended to examine the effects of prior computer literacy and enthusiasm for cultural exploration on cognitive load. An instructional PG was conducted and a cognitive load inventory was given after the game. Results indicated that both computer literacy and enthusiasm had no effect on cognitive load, only gender, a demographic variable, had an effect.

Online communities, educational forums, and crowd-based feedback platforms all support feedback exchange among a more diverse set of sources than ever before, with greater control over how to moderate this exchange. In this work, we study how the power relationship between the source and receiver and the tone of language influence the recep-tivity, effort, and work performance resulting from online feedback exchange. We conducted an online experiment manipulating affective language and source of feedback on a writing task. We found that critiques with positive affec-tive language increased positive emotions and reduced participants' annoyance and frustration, which led to an increase in work quality, compared to critiques without positive language. Feedback without positive affective language led to more edits, but not better work outcomes. Participants reacted more positively to feedback from an anonymous source than from a peer or an authority. Our findings provide design implications for platforms to support more fruitful feedback exchange.	feedback	Duyen T. Nguyen;Thomas Garncarz;Felicia Ng;Laura A.

We employed a methodology that followed the learning study method, while we also introduced experimental and control groups in order to allow for more direct comparison. In this study we did not have control over the employed serious game (vLeader) and thus had to implement our experiment through its supplementary materials. The study explores a systematic approach towards serious games design. This study provides weak evidence of greater stakeholder awareness by the group that has experienced variation. Its exploratory findings provide a valuable contribution that could inform design of future serious games.

a99d0035a82e7a3fda9abd1dc13d9d93925dca8d	fostering geospatial thinking in science education through a customisable smartphone application		Abstract#R##N##R##N#Enhanced capabilities of modern smartphones offer the potential to design tools that support new forms of teaching and learning. Increased access to mobile-networked environments and geospatial systems provide opportunities for developing new educational experiences that support a geospatial approach to science, fostering new ways of thinking about science. However, designing effective innovative educational mobile applications remains a challenge. Applications need to be accessible to teachers that are not tech-savvy as well as those that are, foster active learning pedagogies, enable flexible and creative use, as well as fit within the curriculum. This paper describes a smartphone application developed together with pre-service science teachers, designed to be customisable by teachers while supporting a geospatial approach to science education. The design process and trial illustrate application use, how it supports a geospatial approach to science education and raises issues around mobile technologies, teacher pedagogies and adoption.	mobile app;smartphone	Sara Price;Paul Davies;William Farr;Carey Jewitt;George Roussos;George Sin	2014	BJET	10.1111/bjet.12000	simulation;knowledge management;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-68.64207258258223	-38.83835774278814	157482

Although there were a few projects in place, we were eager to offer a more attractive gaming experience compared to the preceding projects, especially as the effects of drunk driving should be communicated to a young audience. Drink & Drive implements a competitive third-person racing game relying on well-known game mechanics. The goal of Drink & Drive is the motivation of a safe arrival by systematically avoiding any alcoholic beverages if driving. Accordingly, collectibles on the track can influence the driver's state of perception, for the better and for the worse. The delicate balance between serious contents and gaming fun is established by placing great emphasis on a clear, playful design and the introduction of effective gamification elements that support an immersive, intrinsically motivating experience. In this paper, we motivate and present the design of Drink & Drive, we embed it into the context of related works and we provide preliminary results based on its presentation to forty students and faculty.	ampersand;game mechanics;gamification;operational amplifier	Frank Gaibler;Simon Faber;Sarah Edenhofer;Sebastian von Mammen	2015	2015 7th International Conference on Games and Virtual Worlds for Serious Applications (VS-Games)	10.1109/VS-GAMES.2015.7295771	simulation;engineering;game mechanics;multimedia;advertising	HCI	-67.77453669271802	-45.457593966873276	157966

To investigate the determinants of spontaneous analogical transfer, the present study systematically compared the effect of augmenting verbal descriptions of the source with animations or static diagrams. Solution rates to Duncker’s radiation problem were measured across varying source presentation conditions, and participants’ understanding of the relevant source material was assessed. Supplemental animations increased both comprehension of the source analog and spontaneous transfer to the radiation problem. Supplemental diagrams yielded lesser improvement in participants’ understanding of source material and did not increase solution rates to the target problem. To investigate individual differences in spontaneous transfer, fluid intelligence was measured for each participant using an abridged version of the Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM) test. Animated source depictions were most beneficial in facilitating spontaneous transfer for those participants with low scores on the fluid intelligence measure.	flash animation;mike lesser;problem solving;relevance;spontaneous order;state diagram	James Kubricht;Hongjing Lu;Keith J.

Female only groups were more likely to engage in a pattern that emphasized self-disclosure, statements of personal opinion, ‘‘I’’ statements and coalition language. This ‘‘High Communication Style’’(HCS) was linked to high group satisfaction, and high group development. The present study attempts to train small task groups in the use of HCS. Experimental groups (Female Only, Male Only, and Mixed) were actively trained in computer-mediated communication and the use of the HCS style. The Control Groups of similar composition were actively trained in the use of e-mail etiquette guidelines that focused on using or avoiding specific formats in their messages. Results indicated that the Experimental Groups had significantly higher levels of self-disclosure and of opinion. Male Only groups showed significantly lower participation than did either Mixed or Female Only groups. Female Only groups scored higher in Group Development than either Mixed or Male Only groups. Contrary to previous studies, however, there were no significant relationships between group development or satisfaction and language content variables. The authors call for further research in the area of communication training for on-line task groups. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We describe iterative design process for this teaching tool, including mock-up prototypes, focus group discussions with teachers and the first complete prototype together with two example applications. Teachers were eager to innovate applications for the Activity Pad, and the feedback indicates the potential of this kind of teaching tool in diverse learning environments.	digital artifact;focus group;iterative design;iterative method;mock object;near field communication;printing;prototype;tangible user interface	Mikko Pyykkönen;Jukka Riekki;Marko Jurmu;Iván Sánchez	2013		10.1145/2512349.2512810	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-65.14959779328854	-40.18247900356782	158562

This paper aims to understand the importance of early work analysis in a real context during the design of such a simulator. More specifically, the aim of this re- search was to learn whether there were differences between the types of feed- back given to the learner in an already planned design and a real-life training exercise. Therefore, a comparison between feedback given to trainees in a real- life training exercise and feedback planned for a virtual environment supporting training of crisis management was made. The results showed that there were several significant differences.

72d0b4b8b88c7e6c0b24bd90e971f8fb21a2f846	resource usage analysis from a different perspective on mooc dropout		We present a novel learning analytics approach, for analyzing the usage of resources in MOOCs. Our target stakeholders are the course designers who aim to evaluate their learning materials. In order to gain insight into the way educational resources are used, we view dropout behaviour in an atypical manner: Instead of using it as an indicator of failure, we use it as a mean to compute other features. For this purpose, we developed a prototype, called RUAF, that can be applied to the data format provided by FutureLearn. As a proof of concept, we perform a study by applying this tool to the interaction data of learners from four MOOCs. We also study the quality of our computations, by comparing them to existing process mining approaches. We present results that highlight patterns showing how learners use resources. We also show examples of practical conclusions a course designer may benefit from.	computation;dropout (neural networks);futurelearn;massive open online course;prototype	Rémi Brochenin;Joos C. A. M.

However, since the methodology was first presented, the User Experience (UX) has become more popular but the heuristics have remained the same. In this paper, we analyse the current state of heuristic evaluation in terms of heuristics for measuring the UX. To do so, we carried out a literature review. In addition, we had a look at different heuristics and mapped them with the UX dimensions of the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). Moreover, we proposed a quality model for heuristic evaluation and a list of quality criteria for heuristics.	a/ux;heuristic (computer science);software quality	Frederik Bader;Eva-Maria Schön;Jörg Thomaschewski	2017	IJIMAI	10.9781/ijimai.2017.05.001	data mining;heuristic evaluation;usability;user experience design;management science;heuristics;computer science	NLP	-63.76770744482887	-46.99778198294491	158885

Therefore, teachers and students rarely understand how to improve their future learning progress. The limitations of conventional testing methods indicate the importance of accurately assessing and representing student knowledge structures. The personalized diagnosis and remedial learning system (PDRLS) proposed in this study enhances the effectiveness of the Pathfinder network by providing remedial learning paths for individual learners based on their knowledge structure. The sample was 145 students enrolled in introductory JAVA programming language courses at a Central Taiwan technology university. The experimental results demonstrate that learners who received personalized remedial learning guidance via PDRLS achieved improved learning performance, self-efficacy, and PDRLS use intention. The experimental results also indicated that students with lower knowledge level gain more benefits from the PDRLS than those with higher level of knowledge and that field dependence (FD) students obtain a greater benefit from PDRLS than field independence (FI) students do. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Also, they appear to be especially responsive to analogies and metaphors. We seek to exploit these effects by requiring students to transform problems into alternative forms before solving them. Three examples are given of domains where the student has to convert the formulation into an equivalent diagram. Arguably, the process of performing this transformation increases their understanding of the subject area.	ct scan;causal filter;diagram;experiment;nl (complexity);nos/ve;problem solving environment;simulation;π-calculus	Ray H.

The adaptive dimension of these systems mainly supports knowledge communication between the system and the learner by adapting the content or the appearance of hypermedia to the knowledge level, goals and other characteristics of each learner. The main objectives are to protect learners from cognitive overload and disorientation by supporting them to find the most relevant content and path in the hyperspace. In the approach presented in this paper, learners’ knowledge level and individual traits are used as valuable information to represent learners’ current state and personalise the educational system accordingly, in order to facilitate learners to achieve their personal learning goals and objectives. Learners’ knowledge level is approached through a qualitative model of the level of performance that learners exhibit with respect to the concepts they study and is used to adapt the lesson contents and the navigation support. Learners’ individual traits and especially their learning style represent the way learners perceive and process information, and are exploited to adapt the presentation of the educational material of a lesson. The proposed approach has been implemented through various adaptation technologies and incorporated into a prototype hypermedia system. Finally, a pilot study has been conducted to investigate system’s educational effectiveness. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To create an efficient AR environment, we used Microsoft HoloLens, which is the next generation of a see-through holographic computer. We developed the AR learning module: ergonomic guidelines for manual material handling (MMH). We hypothesize that AR changes the way students understand the concepts of MMH. Our analysis includes a careful evaluation of student experimental skills during the learning activities. This new AR environment could allow students to engage hands-on training of MMH and strengthen their understanding. Student test score was used as metrics for performance assessment. We found a significant improvement on student understanding of MMH lecture after they used the AR module. The findings of this study indicated the potential benefits of using AR environment interfaces in engineering education and training.	augmented reality	Wenbin Guo	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-91743-6_18	engineering education;human factors and ergonomics;human–computer interaction;augmented reality;computer science	HCI	-69.14685759716617	-43.335873995555126	159385

By analyzing logfiles and considering students' initial perception of competence, we contribute to micro- as well as macro-adaption. We describe and visualize task processing data of 159 students, considering performance as well as attempts to solve a task. Taking preceeding behavior into account, it was possible to identify (maladaptive) behavioral patterns. Furthermore we compare the behavior of students with low vs. high perceptions of competence subsequent to a failure. In line with research regarding the influence of self-concept on performance and motivation, our findings suggest that students with a low perception of competence perform poorer and tend to skip trials more often after a failure, indicating motivational losses. Further research should build upon this study to enhance technology-based learning by designing learning environments and adaption strategies that take student behavior and prerequisites into account.

It has been argued that conceptual models can serve to enhance learners' conceptual understanding of programming. The methods used to enhance the development of accurate mental models include: designing the interface so that users can interact actively with it; using metaphors and analogies to explain concepts; and using spatial relationships so that users can develop capabilities for mental simulations. With the insights afforded by looking more closely at conceptual understanding, we describe how visualization techniques may effectively be used in the learning and teaching of programming.	computer science;mental model;simulation	Lynne P.

In this study, the potential of Google Analytics GA to collect usage data from an educational app was evaluated, aiming to both improve the app interface and empower its educational usage. Thus, the statistics tools available in GA were used to answer the following questions: who are the app users? How long the users stay on the app? How do users interact with the application? What content do users view more frequently? What are the critical dropout points? The obtained results demonstrate, among other things, that the users were spread through all continents, 58.7% of the sessions lasted between 2 and 17 minutes and there is no critical dropout point. GA was able to answer all these questions and it can be an effective tool to evaluate the usage of educational apps.

It is being developed as a platform for student collaborative exploratory learning using problemspecific affordances. COMPS will support computer-aided monitoring and assessment of these dialogues. In this paper we report on the first use of COMPS in the classroom, supporting an exercise in quantitative problem-solving. We have identified a number of categories of dialogue contribution that will be useful for monitoring and assessing the dialogue and built classifiers for recognizing these contributions. Regarding the usability of the interface for problem-solving exercises, the primary unexpected behavior is an increase (compared to in-person exercises) in off-task activity and concomitant decrease in shared construction of the answer. Its first large deployment will be for Math 110, a quantitative literacy class at Valparaiso University.	computer-mediated communication;problem solving environment;social affordance;software deployment;usability	Melissa A.

My research focuses on extending usability inspection techniques for evaluating collaborative systems, using an iterative empirical approach. I am also looking for patterns in characteristics of collaborative systems that could provide guidance regarding the type of evaluation method that would be best applied to a given system. This project will add techniques, as well as guidance for using them, to the interactive software designer's toolkit, to help ensure that usable collaborative systems are delivered to the customer.	collaborative software;iterative method;newton's method;software design;usability inspection	Jill L.

This study develops an evolution model that integrates triangular fuzzy numbers and analytic hierarchy process to develop a fuzzy evaluation model which prioritized the relative weights of course website quality factors. Firstly, this study conducts a review of the literature on course website quality to generate 16 sub-criteria along with four criteria used to measure course website quality. Secondly, a fuzzy AHP approach is adopted to determine the relative weights linking the above criteria between high and low online learning experience groups. The results indicated that there are some similarities and differences between high- and low-experience groups with regard to the evaluation of course website quality. The evaluation model and results can provide a valuable reference for system designers seeking to enhance course website effectiveness.

A main goal of Scratch is to enable young people to engage in construction-oriented acts of personal expression. From community narratives to role-playing games to mathematical simulations to consciousness-raising presentations, the potential for creative production with Scratch is boundless. However, for those who are primarily concerned with assisting others’ Scratch learning, there is a disconnect between what individuals want to do and the resources that are presently available. In response, we have developed Scratch-Ed, an online environment for educators. Using the lens of situated learning, Scratch-Ed has been designed to enable users to organize a community of practice for Scratch around the processes of mutual engagement, joint enterprise, and shared repertoire by sharing stories, exchanging resources, facilitating discussions, and establishing relationships.	computer simulation;consciousness;integrated development environment;online community;situated	Karen Brennan	2009			simulation;human–computer interaction;multimedia;communication	HCI	-64.55261686648733	-38.35278427718089	160077

Data were obtained from 1,869 junior high school students and 1,365 parents in Taiwan in 2013. Multivariate analysis results showed that higher levels of parental Internet skill and eHealth literacy were associated with an increase in parental online health information seeking. Parental eHealth literacy, parental active use Internet mediation, adolescent Internet literacy, and health information literacy were all related to adolescent eHealth literacy. Similarly, adolescent Internet/health information literacy, eHealth literacy, and parental active use Internet mediation, and parental online health information seeking were associated with an increase in adolescent online health information seeking. The incorporation of eHealth literacy courses into parenting programs and school education curricula is crucial to promote the eHealth literacy of parents and adolescents.	educational curriculum;information literacy;information seeking	Fong-Ching Chang;Chiung-Hui Chiu;Ping-Hung Chen;Nae-Fang Miao;Ching-Mei Lee;Jengtung Chiang;Ying-Chun Pan	2015	Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking	10.1089/cyber.2015.0110	medicine;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-76.06848423989345	-40.80622601123805	160280

This researcher utilized questionnaires and behavioral observation as methods of investigation. The use of questionnaires was mainly to understand the operational habits of digital device users and the kinds of writing they read, and the behavior observation entailed asking 40 subjects to read on a given device or paper medium for an experiment on reading comprehension to gather data on user reading speed, comprehension, fatigue and other parameters. The results from this study will be used as a basis to formulate a more comprehensive research framework for a future study that more accurately measures the difference between digital devices of various sizes and paper medium.

For example, labeling objects or features of problems can support categorization and relational thinking. Less is known about their role in making inferences about the structure of mathematics problems. We test the impact of labeling decimals such as 0.25 using formal place value labels (“two tenths and five hundredths”) compared to informal labels (“point two five”) or no labels on children’s problem-solving performance. Thirdand fourthgraders (N = 104) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (formal labels, informal labels, or no labels) and labeled decimals while playing a magnitude comparison game and number line estimation task. Formal labels facilitated performance on comparison problems that required understanding the role of zero, which highlighted place value structure. However, formal labels hindered performance when explicit understanding of place value magnitudes was required. Findings highlight how the language teachers and students use can impact problem-solving success.	categorization;cognition;problem solving;randomness	Abbey Loehr;Bethany Rittle-Johnson	2016			cognitive psychology;decimal;psychology	AI	-72.00140829138057	-47.88500436439428	160406

To achieve the objectives of this study, the total of 92 children were assigned to either experimental group (n 1⁄4 48) and control group (n 1⁄4 44). The preand post-test data was collected on print awareness, vocabulary, alphabetic knowledge and phonological awareness skills to determine the effectiveness of e-books. The results indicated that children in experimental group performed significantly better than the children in control group. Moreover, significant differences were found according to gender, as the female children exhibited superior emergent literacy skills to the male children. Regarding the different emergent literacy skills, children in the experimental group achieved better improvement in the areas of print awareness and vocabulary. Based on these findings, it is recommended that pre-school institutions incorporate e-books activities into their classrooms. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

There may be an impact directly on the results of the analysis of this data if, for some reason, this data input is not accurate. This paper will focus on a specific phenomenon, known as the Conjunction Fallacy, which may lead users to commit errors of judgment that would impact directly in the accuracy of their evaluation of alternatives. In order to exemplify this issue, this paper presents experiments where, during the evaluation phase of the design of a product, it was verified the presence of the conjunction fallacy. It also presents a possible strategy to minimize the errors of judgment caused by the fallacy.	data acquisition;exemplification;experiment;requirement;requirements elicitation	Fábio Campos;Dino Lincoln;Maria Neves;Walter Correia;Marcelo Márcio Soares	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39229-0_23	reliability engineering;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining	HCI	-64.34892250138488	-48.399038386273666	160733
106b4af68c39b929a78c5949f3cfdb5b5addb8f7	exploring the importance of “making” in an educational game design		Educational games have been employed in many settings as a means to engage young students. Different genres and applications of games have been used to improve learning experience. The design or making of games in learning activities has been linked to teaching of new skills. Within this paper we explore and discuss the differences of involving young students into the game design and development process compared to just playing an educational game. In particular, we designed an educational math-game and an activity that involves children in playing or modifying the game, and we performed a between groups experiment with sixty students of the second grade of middle school (12 to 13 years old). Students formed three equivalent groups of twenty. The first group played the game, the second engaged with re-designing and modifying the game and the third (control) group solved the same exercises (with the educational game) on paper. The results showed that the making group exhibits certain attitudinal benefits. Hence, our findings suggest that learning through games should include more than just playing a well-designed game, it should also consider the involvement of students with various “making” affordances.

8ff7c0822a2cd6052a519bc4766ddc9f35a7880a	scope of manipulability sharing: a case study for sports training		Recently, advanced information communication technology and robotic technology have been used for developing a sports-like game application and low-cost interface devices, such as wii-sports, to encourage performing exercises in a room. Such an application can provide an easy-to-understand visual feedback for players by using a virtual reality head-mount display. However, those do not provide quantitative information about the body forms required for training during sports to improve the performance and skill of players. The purpose of this study is to develop an intelligent scope of manipulability sharing considering the dynamic change in the human body form (structure) in sports motion, thus providing an evaluation result based on the manipulability theory for both the player and the instructor in real time. Evaluation tests using a prototype system using a smart glasses and a Kinect sensor are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scope of manipulability sharing in pitching and batting motions.	assistive technology;kinect;prototype;robot;smartglasses;virtual reality;wii	Yoshiyuki Tanaka;Tadayoshi Shiokawa;Mitsuhisa Shiokawa	2018	2018 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR)	10.1109/VR.2018.8446350	simulation;computer science;virtual reality;user interface;information and communications technology	Visualization	-66.9465357332878	-46.217130396715625	160788

They are normally influenced by a specific learning strategy. For example, they may not want a student to visit nodes on multiplication before visiting nodes related to addition. In traditional systems those restrictions are established by limiting the existence of the elements that make the relationship between concepts effective: links. In this paper we propose a simple way of limiting access, by avoiding the creation of incorrect mental maps of hyperspace by the student.	hypermedia;pedagogical agent	Tomás A.

In this study, we enhance the technology acceptance model to explain the factors that influence the acceptance of Google Applications for collaborative learning. The enhanced model was empirically evaluated using survey data collected from 136 students enrolled in a full-time degree program that used Google Applications to support project work. According to the research results, determinants of the technology acceptance model are the major factors influencing the adoption of the technology. In addition, the subjective norm represented by peers is found to significantly moderate the relationship between attitude and intention toward the technology. However, our results do not show a significant effect of subjective norms represented by instructors and mass media on students’ intentions to use the technology. The ability to share information in the collaborative learning environment is found to influence intention and behavior toward the Google Applications platform. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper was designed to research about the different factors and drivers that could influence students’ behaviour into the usage of mobile technologies for learning. The methodology was based on a quantitative survey grounded on the Technology Acceptance Model and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Data were collected from medical students in University of Coimbra. This model pointed to a behaviour pattern based on the experience and application by medical students, correlating with a strong attitude towards using mobile technology for learning (57%) and willingness to recommend it (40.5%). In line with previous studies, Social Influence raised to be an important factor towards the Attitude and Behavioural Intention of using Mobile Learning. In addition, according to the results, the student’s ease of perception seems to be the main factor affecting the Social Influence (31.9%) and the reliability for recommending this technology for learning was the main factor that affected the Behavioural Intention. Findings provide support for Technology Acceptance Model and the implications of these findings are discussed within the context of Innovation in Education. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

15ea85b08f475cc86d89f48dc657fa5a7ff1ff40	mobile phones in the classroom: if you can't beat them, join them	mobile phone	"""Classroom interaCtivity has a number of significant benefits: it promotes an active learning environment, provides valuable feedback for lecturers, increases student motivation, and enables a learning community. 6 On the other hand, interactive activities for large classes (over 100 students) have proven to be quite difficult and, often, inefficient. 3 During the past six years the rapid proliferation of mobile devices, particularly cellular phones, has presented an opportunity to develop new interactive classroom systems which have the potential to enhance students' learning experience. The present challenge for researchers is to go beyond anecdotal perceptions and obtain empirical evidence about the impact of these technologies in the classroom. This paper describes a novel application of short-message-services (SMS) for large-class interactivity, and assesses its impact on the learning experiences of 1200 students in a large undergraduate class. The traditional lecture theatre environment has provided universities with a cost effective and scaleable means of teaching students. However, this has come at the price of making interaction difficult and inefficient, leading to reduced student engagement, motivation and learning. 3 Classroom Feedback Systems (CFS) provide one possible technological mechanism that can efficiently enable interaction in large classes. Known by various names (e.g., """" clickers """") and produced commercially by a range of vendors , CFS technologies have been used since the sixties to allow students to respond to questions and have the results processed and displayed for use by the lecturer and the class as a whole. The more sophisticated CFSs provide the ability to answer a range of question types, from simple yes/no through to detailed responses, free-form questions and role-playing. Current platforms range from small infra-red units, through radio units, to the use of Web systems accessed by wireless personal digital assistants (PDAs) or laptops. These systems are generally well regarded by students when they are used. Numerous case studies have described the use of CFS technologies in disciplines ranging from the physical sciences through mathematics, accountancy and literature. A variety of positive outcomes from the use of CFS technologies have been reported including improved understanding of important concepts, 6, 7 increased student engagement and participation, 3, 7 improved quality of discussion in the classroom 7 and improved teacher awareness of student difficulties. 7 A clearer perception of their students' current level of understanding allows instructors to adjust their teaching appropriately. However, CFSs are not a panacea.

The context of learning activities implies to take great care that the protocol of evaluation does not interfere with the learning process; for instance, it becomes impossible to evaluate the same subject on the same task several times in a row.  Among the most popular methods, capturing the interactions between the learner and the system allow to analyse how he/she realised the prescribed exercise. However, this method cannot capture how the user interprets and evaluates of the information displayed by the environment. For this purpose, the eye-trackers, which measure the ocular movements and fixations, can be very useful. However, they show limitations when the evaluated environment is not static.  In this paper, we explain how the combined usage of these two approaches has allowed us to evaluate in a dynamic context the usability of the different components of a software designed to aid the learning of programming [9], and to analyse how learners appropriate these different components. We detail the pros and cons of each method, and discuss their possible connections.	cal;council for educational technology;eye tracking;interaction;large eddy simulation;linear algebra;reactions to the november 2015 paris attacks;redo log;search engine indexing;tracing (software);usability	Nicolas Guibert;Patrick Girard;Laurent Guittet	2007		10.1145/1541436.1541466	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia	HCI	-66.85974334288903	-47.29181906748082	161863
92342fafea70ae66f0bf705d65e8ad534832c46d	gen_mat: a matlab-based map generalization algorithm toolbox		Assistive tools are important for improving teaching and learning quality in courses that involve practical work. This article presents an overview of GEN_MAT, the first MATLAB-based map generalization algorithm toolbox. The toolbox provides 42 map generalization algorithms for aggregation, selective omission, simplification, smoothing, collapse, agglomeration, merging, dissolving, displacement, and typification. A beta test of the application of GEN_MAT in teaching and learning was conducted. Evaluations showed that GEN_MAT has positive effects on teaching and learning. Comparing tool-based and non-tool-based courses indicated that the experimental group performed better than the control group, and the two groups exhibited significant discrepancy (p u003c 0.05) in confidence, awareness, skills and attitudes or behaviors.	algorithm;cartographic generalization;matlab	Yiheng Wang;Jing Tian;Mengting Yu;Chang Ren;Xiaohuan Wu	2017	Trans.

Serious or applied games are created and used to serve a specific purpose rather than for pure entertainment. The relationship between mood and task efficiency has been investigated in psychology with contrasting results, and it also appears that there is a relationship between mood and learning. Players' mood and learning efficiency as a consequence of playing two serious games involving navigation in a virtual environment as the main action of gameplay, but with different learning objectives, have been investigated. The first game taught the route to a real world destination, while the second trained players to perform a religious ritual. The pre- and post-gameplay mood of 52 players were noted. It was found that both serious games helped the players developing a pleasant overall mood and significantly increased the self-reported happiness score in the post-questionnaire. It was also discovered that players who felt happier spent more time learning and that women performed better when they were happier. Besides, younger learners tend to obtain a higher learning performance score than other age categories.		N. Nazrina M.

It becomes one of the educational research focus through learning behavior analysis to promote deep learning. In order to help learners overcome possible disadvantages in e-learning environment such as prone inattention and delayed response, one video analysis algorithm is designed to detect attention decrease situation, then feedback in time or warn early. The algorithm uses head posture, gaze, eye closure and mouth opening, facial expression features as attention observation attributes. Next machine learning classifiers are applied to code behavior features. Finally the time sequential statistics of behavior features evaluate the attention level and emotional pleasure degree. Experiments show that the algorithm is effective to find out the inattention cases to give desirable feedback. It may be applicable in adaptive learning and human computer interaction fields.

Availability of advanced mobile technologies provides several benefits to e-learning by creating an additional channel of access with mobile devices such as PDAs and mobile phones. This paper describes the design issues that were considered for the development and the implementation of a CAT on mobile devices, the CAT-MD (Computerized Adaptive Test on Mobile Devices). Throughout the development of the system, formative evaluation was an integral part of the design methodology. The recommendations, suggestions and the results of the formative evaluation were used to improve the system in order to make the assessment procedure more effective and efficient.

The analysis is based around the introduction and use of digital libraries in four different settings, three clinical and one academic. Across the four settings, in-depth interview and focus group data was collected from 144 users and analyzed with reference to “communities of practice”. The four settings represent three different approaches to digital library implementation: making digital library resources available from existing computer systems in people's offices and the library (a traditional approach); making computer systems, and hence digital libraries, available in shared spaces (in this case, hospital wards); and employing information intermediaries to work with staff and library resources. These different approaches engendered different perceptions of the technology. The traditional approach produced perceptions of technology as being irrelevant for current needs and community practices. Making technology available within shared physical space but with poor design, support, and implementation procedures was widely perceived as a threat to current organizational structures. In contrast, technology implemented within the community which could adapt and change practices according to individual and group needs, supported by an information intermediary, was seen as empowering to both the community and the individual. We relate the findings to a discussion of evolutionary and revolutionary approaches to design and to the concept of communities of practice.	digital library;focus group;interaction;library (computing);relevance;systems design	Anne Adams;Ann Blandford;Peter Lunt	2005	ACM Trans.

This study thus applies both qualitative (e.g., content analyses, interviews) and quantitative methods in an attempt to investigate the role of interaction behaviors (i.e., cooperative processes, cognitive involvement) in group motivation (i.e., collective efficacy) and group performance in CSCL. A total of 35 college students generated 387 cooperative processes and 421 cognitive ideas during the collaborative process over six weeks. The results indicated that the quality of interaction behaviors was positively related to CSCL performance. High performance groups were more involved in complex cooperative processes, and expressed more cognitive ideas at both high and low cognitive levels than low performance groups. For the role of interaction in collective efficacy, the quantity rather than quality of interaction behaviors played a more critical role in constructing collective efficacy. High efficacy groups had more cooperative processes and cognitive ideas than low collective efficacy groups. The interviews also revealed that group interaction played a mediating role in constructing collective efficacy. For the role of collective efficacy in group performance, the results also show that the high efficacy groups performed better than the low efficacy groups. Implications and suggestions for future research are also provided.		Shu-Ling Wang;Hsien-Yuan Hsu;Sunny S. J.

Accessibility is the design of systems that can be perceived, understood and used by people with varying abilities. Although accessibility concerns are aimed at making systems usable for people with disabilities, support for direct accessibility, the built-in redundancies in an application that enable as many people as possible to utilize it without system modifications, is beneficial to people with or without disabilities. Different usability evaluation methods (UEMs) are available. Selecting between the various methods can be influenced by the type of system being evaluated. The Digital Doorway (DD), a non-standard computer system deployed to promote computer literacy amongst underprivileged communities in South Africa, was evaluated using the heuristic evaluation method and a field usability study. The heuristic evaluation method revealed a large number of usability and direct accessibility-related problems, some of which could be classified as low-severity problems. The field study showed additional problems that affected the successful completion of user tasks. Since a number of these were a direct consequence of the context of use, they were not recognized as problems by expert evaluators. The study showed that the heuristic evaluation method can be optimized by complementing it with another method that involves user participation and is, preferably, carried out in the intended context of use.	accessibility;computer;field research;heuristic evaluation;human–computer interaction;usability testing	Funmi Adebesin;Paula Kotzé;Helene Gelderblom	2010		10.1145/1899503.1899504	usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;web usability;component-based usability testing;cognitive walkthrough;simulation;usability;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia;heuristic evaluation;usability inspection	HCI	-64.71774892711947	-45.286426319227964	162419

This article presents a cross-case analysis of blended synchronous learning environmentsdcontexts where remote students participated in face-to-face classes through the use of richmedia synchronous technologies such as video conferencing, web conferencing, and virtual worlds. The study examined how design and implementation factors influenced student learning activity and perceived learning outcomes, drawing on a synthesis of student, teacher, and researcher observations collected before, during, and after blended synchronous learning lessons. Key findings include the importance of designing for active learning, the need to select and utilise technologies appropriately to meet communicative requirements, varying degrees of co-presence depending on technological and human factors, and heightened cognitive load. Pedagogical, technological, and logistical implications are presented in the form of a Blended Synchronous Learning Design Framework that is grounded in the results of the study. © 2015 The Authors.

6857fcc8fefcc0438a3468fd9604fd85170b44f7	using serious games for promoting blended learning for people with intellectual disabilities and autism: literature vs reality		Educating people with intellectual disabilities (ID) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a non-trivial process and differs from the learning methods of typically developed people. Recently, serious games (SGs) have been used to enhance the learning process of these groups and address different skills. On the other hand, blended learning (BL) is applied to formal and informal educational contexts and combines face-to-face and online learning. In this study, we examine if SGs can provide the necessary means for applying BL, especially for people with ID or ASD that could be benefited by personalized learning opportunities. In addition, we examine 43 existing SGs for people with ID or ASD, as well as the perceptions of 93 special education professionals (SEP) and teachers (SET) working in schools and institutions for people with ID or ASD regarding the role of technology and SGs in their education. We concluded that SGs could enhance the learning process of people with ID or ASD in many skills. In addition, the opinions of SEP and SET regarding the importance of technology in the learning process of people with ID or ASD and the familiarity with SGs, indicate that BL could be effectively promoted through SGs.

Effective teaching, on the other hand, is itself an advanced skill. It is likely to involve the implementation of a balance of techniques and practices, applied within the environment of a one-to-one, or a one-to-many teacher learner relationship.

We collected data from 803 high school freshmen in China after they had used mobile devices for over five months. A fixed‐effects model was employed to control the undetected variances. Results indicated that the students frequently used their mobile devices for physics learning in class and after school. Students also perceived the mobile devices as very useful for their physics learning, and their perception of usefulness was positively correlated with their frequency of use. Both the in‐class and after‐school duration and frequency of mobile technology use positively influenced studentsu0027 physics learning achievement and interest. However, we also found that mobile technology was mainly used to augment rather than to transform instructional practices in physics classrooms. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications and limitations of these results for research and practice.

There is currently no consistent advice on which methods are appropriate in which circumstances, so the selection of methods relies on individual experience and expertise. Considerable effort is required to collate information from various sources and to understand the applicability of each method in a particular situation. Usability Planner is a tool aimed to support the selection of the most appropriate methods depending on project and organizational constraints. Many of the rules employed are derived from ISO standards, complemented with rules from the authors' experience.	usability;user-centered design	Xavier Ferré;Nigel Bevan	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23768-3_105	usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;web usability;cognitive walkthrough;usability;human–computer interaction;knowledge management;usability engineering;heuristic evaluation;software development process;usability inspection	HCI	-63.618643304598436	-47.49400912126497	163906

Since the 1980s, academics began using virtual worlds as an exciting and innovative new technology to provide their students with new learning experiences that were difficult to provide any other way. But since that time, virtual worlds have failed to maintain their popularity as learning spaces; many builds falling into disuse and many disappearing altogether. The aim of this article is not only to determine why virtual worlds have not become a mainstream teaching tool, but to ascertain why they have even failed to maintain their popularity. In order to do this, the research team surveyed over 200 academics about the barriers and enablers to the use and perceived affordances of virtual worlds in teaching and learning. These responses are examined in relation to academics’ past, present and future use, experience and knowledge of virtual world environments.	experience;virtual world	Sue Gregory;Sheila Scutter;Lisa Jacka;Marcus McDonald;Helen Farley;Chris Newman	2015	Educational Technology & Society		educational technology;interaction;simulation;reflection;usability;content analysis;computer science;mobile device;multimedia;formative assessment;pedagogy	HCI	-72.85468706692781	-39.54555924271339	164102

Aside from completing CHI's primary goal of creating a voting device, we found that audience members need a knowledge base and a feeling of empowerment in order to feel secure with their vote. Based on fieldwork with past and potential Olympic attendees, we focused on wearable technology that senses pre-existing methods of showing appreciation and translates audience enthusiasm into an opportunity for learning and empowerment. Building from previous research, we implemented a unique method of creating a system for audience participation that requires no training or learning curve on behalf of its user. These methods were then tested and refined until they were well received by a large majority of users regardless of age, gender and nationality. In our paper we describe our process through an explanation of our immersion in the project, its early ideation, testing and refinement, and our final solution.	chi;experience;field research;immersion (virtual reality);knowledge base;refinement (computing);wearable technology	Christopher Thomas;Greg Fogel;Sonia Wendorf;Kristen Jones	2004		10.1145/985921.986189	design;knowledge base;simulation;design research;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;interaction design;multimedia;learning curve;management;wearable technology;world wide web	HCI	-64.53344740946966	-40.100572608437695	164247
d44b01a2852590d8a94edcd890d718de4bf1a64e	a learning analytics approach to career readiness development in higher education		There are increasing demands to improve the quality of higher education to facilitate the development of 21st Century professional competencies such as lifelong learning, critical thinking and creativity. Learning analytics is an emerging approach that can provide educators with the necessary information to understand learners then assist them to develop such skills. In this paper, we introduce career dispositions as a 6-dimesional model comprises core skills that engender professional actions, and influence the ability to manage career growth. We then present the process to develop and validate a new scale to evaluate career readiness along these dimensions. The developed scale is a self-report instrument that consists of 22 items and six subscales was validated using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). EFA results demonstrated discreet item loadings into the six factors ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 representing an acceptable level of convergent validity. The developed instrument can be integrated into a career readiness platform and used as analytical tool to identify and analyze the complexity and diversity of student’s learning behaviors and skills that may impact their future career readiness and professional performance.

Findings reveal similar patterns in the information seeking behaviour between students studying to become professionals and information seeking patterns of these groups identified in the Leckie et al. model. Students learned their information seeking strategies, including effective and less effective approaches, from educators. Mis-perceptions of the role and value of libraries and information professionals in their studies were common, and as a result, students often adopted information seeking strategies that excluded libraries and library staff. The two studies suggest that engineering and law students in Ireland could benefit from greater information literacy training and awareness, enabling them to acquire the information skills they need to function effectively and efficiently in their future professional work lives.	information literacy;information seeking behavior;library (computing)	Gillian Kerins;Ronan Madden;Crystal Fulton	2004	Inf.

Forty-five non-English major students in a technology university were surveyed. Comparisons of reading confidence, motivation, and self efficiency between high and low achievement learners were made. The use of adventure games can improve the capability of reading teaching. The results shows that: (1) adventure games can improve the students' learning motivation of reading; (2) adventure games can improve readers' English reading confidence, especially for male students; (3) adventure games can improve students' English reading self efficacy.

Analogies between examples and exercises (a form of case-based reasoning) consisted of two distinct types of events. During an initialization event, the solver retrieved an example, set up a mapping between it and the problem, and decided whether the example was useful. During a transfer event, the solver inferred something about the problem’s solution. Many different types of initialization and transfer events were observed. Poor solvers tended to follow the example verbatim, copying each solution line over to the problem. Good solvers tried to solve the problem themselves, but referred to the example when they got stuck, or wanted to check a step, or wanted to avoid a detailed calculation. Rather than learn from analogies, both Good and Poor solvers tended to repeat analogies at subsequent similar situations. A revised version of the model is proposed (but not yet implemented) that appears to be consistent with all the findings observed in this and other studies of the same subjects.	case-based reasoning;problem solving;solver	Kurt VanLehn	1998	Cognitive Science	10.1207/s15516709cog2203_4	psychology;case-based reasoning;cognition;developmental psychology;analogy;artificial intelligence;mathematics;algorithm	AI	-73.34185232008561	-50.038097767940215	164450

One potential method involves the use of simulations, including online simulations. In this exploratory study, researchers examined the pretest and posttest written products of 30 preservice social studies teachers to determine the amount and depth of knowledge before and after taking part in an online simulation. Results indicated that gains in knowledge from the pretest to the posttest were statistically significant, but that the depth of knowledge gained was rather limited in scope. Findings have implications for those considering using or designing online or other simulations as content learning tools in the social sciences and other educational fields.

54a85f5e6c62e828318ca1afc8a1600857ea50b6	study motivation and academic emotions in engineering students: a case study in german higher education		Student dropout is an important topic, with dropout rates around 36 % being particularly relevant for engineering students. Universities need more knowledge about the determinants of finishing a study program without a degree. The paper assumes that motivation to study and current emotional states are highly important for achievement as well as for student retention. In a first attempt to investigate these aspects with engineering students, the paper investigates relations between motivations to study, emotions, and the self-reported achievement. The results indicate that emotions, self-efficacy and subscales of motivation explain variance in student achievement, supporting the importance of these aspects.	degree (graph theory);dropout (neural networks)	Eva Susanne Fritzsche;Jorn Schlingensiepen;Robert Kordts-Freudinger	2018	2018 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)	10.1109/EDUCON.2018.8363280	student dropout;knowledge management;mathematics education;engineering;higher education;german	SE	-76.55869621497747	-40.73274023170851	164530

In an elementary school in northern Taiwan, two fifth grade classes on an ecology project were randomly selected: The experimental group could access the ecological learning system on handheld devices while the control group was guided by a human guide. Flow Learning was adopted as the teaching scheme for this study. We seek to arouse students’ motivation to study first, have them focus next, create opportunities for acquiring knowledge by directly observing the phenomenon to be studied, and finally encourage students to share what they have learned. The results showed that the experimental group outperformed the control group on the ecological knowledge test. Furthermore, the students in the experimental group felt satisfied with the ecological learning system supported by positioning systems. The pedagogical implication of this study is that students need direct experience to gain an understanding of a certain topic.	ecology;experiment;location-based service;mobile device;positioning system;randomness	Hsien-Sheng Hsiao;Chih-Cheng Lin;Ruei-Ting Feng;Kun-Jing Li	2010	Educational Technology & Society		cooperative learning;simulation;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;asynchronous communication;location-based service;multimedia;location;synchronous learning;pedagogy;environmental education	HCI	-73.34980754360144	-40.12475759267129	164559

Design/methodology/approach – The evidence-based scenario design framework is presented and demonstrated by using BELLA, a new assessment-based gaming environment aimed at supporting student learning of vocabulary and math. BELLA integrates assessment and learning into an interactive gaming system that includes written conversations, math activities, oral and written feedback in both English and Spanish, and a visible psychometric model that is used to adaptively select activities as well as feedback levels. This paper also reports on a usability study carried out in a public middle school in New York City. Findings – The evidence-based, scenario design framework proves to be instrumental in helping combine game and assessment requirements. BELLA demonstrates how advances in artificial intelligence in education, cognitive science, educational measurement, and video games can be harnessed and integrated into valid instructional tools for the classroom. Research limitations/implications – This paper provides initial evidence of the potential of these kinds of assessment-based gaming tools to enhance teaching and learning. Future work involves exploring student learning effects in randomized controlled studies and comparing the internal assessment models to more traditional assessment instruments. Originality/value – BELLA is the first step toward achieving engaging, assessment-based, gaming environments for a variety of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM)-related areas with explicit support for English language learners.	artificial intelligence;cognitive science;feedback;inference engine;pc game;randomized algorithm;requirement;storyboard;usability testing;vocabulary	Juan-Diego Zapata-Rivera;Waverely Vanwinkle;Bryan Doyle;Alyssa Buteux;Malcolm I.

5e6f297dcb9b89be19763e26465562037d0be61e	usability and user experience evaluation of learning management systems - a systematic mapping study.		Background: Advances in technology made possible the development of powerful platforms called Learning Management Systems (LMSs), designed to help the teaching and learning process. Studies show that usability and User Experience (UX) of such platforms may influence in this process. Although several studies had been conducted in this area, most of them are at initial stages and need improvements or deeper empirical studies. Aim: This work aims to analyze scientific publications in order to characterize the usability and UX evaluation techniques in the context of LMSs. Method: We performed a systematic mapping study regarding the usability and UX evaluation techniques in the context of LMSs. Results: A total of 62 publications were accepted in this mapping, which helped identifying the techniques used to evaluate the usability and UX of LMSs and their characteristics such as its origin, type, performing method, learning factors, restriction and availability. Conclusion: Several studies were conducted regarding the evaluation of LMSs. However, there are still some gaps such as the lack of techniques with some features, e.g., feedback with suggestions to correct the identified problems. Besides, there is no sufficient evidence of which of them is best suited for this context.	a/ux;amazon web services;feedback;management system;scientific literature;software engineering;usability;user experience evaluation	Walter Takashi Nakamura;Elaine Harada Teixeira de Oliveira;Tayana Conte	2017		10.5220/0006363100970108	usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;web usability;component-based usability testing;cognitive walkthrough;user experience design;interactive systems engineering;usability;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;system usability scale;usability engineering;heuristic evaluation;usability lab;usability inspection	HCI	-64.49444714206464	-46.835197800604895	165445

Multilevel analyses were applied to uncover the influence of student, group, and task variables and the specific impact of the assignment of roles. Results indicate that students' attitude towards the learning environment and their engagement in the discussion group are significant predictors. No significant overall differences in students' mean levels of knowledge construction between the role and no role condition were observed. However, additional analyses revealed (1) that students in the role condition more often reached the highest level; and (2) that assigning students the role of summarizer resulted in significantly higher levels of knowledge construction.	focus group	Tammy Schellens;Hilde van Keer;Martin Valcke;Bram de Wever	2005			psychology;collaborative learning;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;role;scripting language;social psychology;pedagogy	AI	-73.81341212972522	-43.082180347151485	165489

Unlike the Western dances where dance notation have been widely used for recording the dance body movement, students in Thai dance classes have to memorize a series of body movements by observation from their teachers. In Thai dance communities, dance notation is very new, and few of professional people in Thai dance understand and use it to record the Thai dance body movement. In this paper, we demonstrate the adaption of a notation system to describe Thai dance and introduce a learning tool for facilitate students to understand the notation. Our presented tool for teaching and learning Thai dance is as a result from a collaboration research between researchers from performing arts and computer science. We measure the desirability of our tool with four Thai dance schools dispersedly located in the north and middle of Thailand, and we receive a promising feedback from them.

And there were many evidences demonstrate that students' attention plays a significant role in teaching. Therefore, this study aims to probe into working memory of elementary school students by administering three different courses, including math, physical education (PE), and athletics training courses, to three experimental groups. It compares the impact of the three courses on students' attention. In this study, purposive sampling was implemented to select 36 fifth graders from an elementary school in Taichung City, who were divided into three experimental groups. The data were analyzed based on the correctness of students' responses to attention tasks. The experimental test was employed using display duration of 0.3 and 0.4 seconds, respectively. A Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test and Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks were conducted to identify the significance of the difference between the experimental groups (α=.05). When a substantial difference existed between experimental groups, the researcher implemented a post hoc comparison using a Mann-Whitney U test. The experimental results show that all three groups scored strikingly higher on the post-tests than on the pretests, reaching a significant different (p .05). The conclusions of this study were as follows: (1) the implementation of different courses has a significant and impact on the working memory of higher-grade elementary school students; (2) different course contents may influence working memory of students; (3) regular athletic training is helpful in enhancing student attention.

430b6cfb83e4406f9e5bfd5fa107e67e64ae7cf6	instant messenger-based online discourse platform and its impacts on students' academic performances: an exploratory study in art and design education	interactive learning environments;computer mediated communication;evaluation of cal system	As an alternative approach to traditional classroom-based learning environment, an online platform based on instant messenger (IM) is developed for subgroup discourses of Principles of Art Pattern Design (PAPD), one of the basic courses in art and design education. To quantify its effects on students' academic performances, the unified final test, including a standardized exam and an artwork rating, was administered to students enrolled in this study. The exam score, rating score, and their association were used as indicators to measure students' knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA) of art pattern design, respectively. Because this study adopted multilevel hierarchical study design, linear mixed models were employed to evaluate the effects of IM-based online discourse on students' KSA at three levels - TEACHER-, CLASS- and STUDENT-level. Compared with classroom-based face-to-face discourse, IM-based online discourse slightly lowered students' performances on average. However, the effects of IM-based online discourse on students' KSA varied with different levels, and were inconsistently inferior to those of classroom-based face-to-face discourse. Considered the complex processes of teaching and learning involved, therefore, IM-based discourse platform should learn from the strengths of traditional classroom-based learning environment to further upgrade, and be thoroughly examined under different conditions. We designed an instant messenger (IM)-based platform for Art Pattern Design (PAPD).We quantify the effects of this platform at TEACHER-, CLASS- and STUDENT-level.The effects of IM-based discourse on students' KSA varied with different levels.IM-based discourse was inconsistently inferior to classroom-based discourse.	computer-mediated communication;instant messaging;performance	Yajun Cheng;Hongwei Jiang	2015	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2015.07.007	psychology;social science;simulation;computer science;multimedia;communication;world wide web;pedagogy;computer-mediated communication	HCI	-75.23068132156573	-41.9346521768167	165791

The architecture of a SaCI has been proposed in a previous work, based on the paradigm of multi-agent systems. In this paper, we propose an agent that provides services of AR to display and design, among other things, augmented scenarios. In addition, we define an experimental real environment in SaCI to evaluate the utilization and impact of AR in it. The results are promising, since the criteria of motivation, learning curve, and memorization of the students are substantially improved in the experimental group.	augmented reality;experiment;interaction;multi-agent system;programming paradigm;sequence read archive;smart tv	Luis Chamba-Eras;José Aguilar	2017	IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje	10.1109/RITA.2017.2776419	computer science;simulation;multimedia;human–computer interaction;architecture;memorization;augmented reality;multi-agent system;middleware	Visualization	-68.02600235471694	-44.460775518147166	165799

However, inherent privacy problems in social networks have become a concern for organizations deploying them. So companies have started investing in systems for evaluating employees’ behaviors on SNSs. In evaluating employees’ behaviors on SNSs, this study aims at developing a mechanism for learning users’ behaviors on SNS and predicting their control of privacy on SNS. Privacy prediction is based on the revelation of actual privacy characteristics of users through the analysis of their SNS usage patterns. Using the Design Science research methodology, this study presents the design and instantiation of a prediction model that is trained using survey data and SNS data of graduate students from a prominent Northeastern University in the United States, which is used to generate class labels associated with their privacy control. The prediction model provides a data analytics component for reliable predictions of users’ privacy control using Machine Learning algorithm SVM and a randomized ensemble of decision trees. The results suggest that the prediction model represents a reliable method for predicting privacy control based on user actions on SNS.		Rohit Valecha;Rajarshi Chakraborty;H. Raghav Rao;Shambhu J.

a980263bf126907deea9e654988248144264248e	exploring real-time student models based on natural-language tutoring sessions		Natural language tutoring systems generate significant data during their tutoring sessions, which is often not used to inform real-time, persistent student models. The current research explores the feasibility of mapping concept-focused tutoring sessions to knowledge components, by breaking sessions down into features that are integrated into a session score. Three classes of tutoring conversation features were studied: semantic match of student contributions to domain content, tutor support (e.g., hints and prompts), and student verbosity (i.e., word counts). Analysis of the relative importance of these features and the ability of these features to predict later task performance on similar topics was conducted. Reinforcing prior work, semantic match scores were a key predictor for later test performance. Tutor help features (hints, prompts) were also useful secondary predictors. Unlike some related work, verbosity was a key predictor even after accounting for the semantic match.	kerrison predictor;natural language;real-time locating system;real-time transcription	Benjamin Nye;Mustafa H.

There is a growing need for effective leadership in these settings. Research shows that cultural values influence both role expectations and perceptions of role expectations and correlate to poor performance evaluations. We hypothesize that leaders with a better understanding of cultural values would lead their teams to higher task performance. A study was conducted with a sample of 19 students, all team leaders working in a project-based class for one semester in a disciplinary and culturally diverse graduate program. Cultural intelligence or cultural quotient (CQ) was measured by the Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS) and experts evaluated team task performance. Results indicate that Cognitive CQ and Motivational CQ positively correlate to task performance. The outcomes of this study can be used in the selection, training, and development of leaders of culturally diverse teams.	cognitive science;conjunctive query;energy (psychological);value (ethics)	Dulce Pacheco;Scott Stevens	2018		10.18420/ecscw2018_p2		HCI	-70.00311483347362	-47.26994677683994	166052

The instructor writes material on the whiteboard, via the Mimio Capture system, using standard whiteboard markers. The lecture material is sent as written strokes that the iOS app displays for the student in real-time. Students can adjust the size and contrast of the material, as well as write notes on the lecture itself for later viewing. The access to lecture provided by the system provides students the ability to follow an active lecture that can facilitate more class participation. In order to support student needs, students, instructors and the classroom environment itself were studied.	mimio;real-time computing;real-time transcription;ios	Stephanie Ludi	2014	ACM SIGACCESS	10.1145/2637487.2637490	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-66.653998470292	-43.36347677275254	166355

Learning outcomes have seldom been evaluated in IR instruction. The particular focus of this study is the assessment of learning outcomes in an experimental, but naturalistic, learning environment compared to more traditional instruction. The 57 participants of an introductory course on IR were selected for this study, and the analysis illustrates their learning outcomes regarding both conceptual change and development of IR skill. Concept mapping of student essays was used to analyze conceptual change and log files of search exercises provided data for performance assessment. Students in the experimental learning environment changed their conceptions more regarding linguistic aspects of IR and paid more emphasis on planning and management of search process. Performance assessment indicates that anchored instruction and scaffolding with an instructional tool, the IR Game, with performance feedback enables students to construct queries with fewer semantic knowledge errors also in operational IR systems.	concept map;data logger;information retrieval	Kai Halttunen;Kalervo Järvelin	2005	Inf.

Many studies consider the importance of social presence in relationships, ignoring how to make such relationships meaningful. Most studies in HCI that discuss technology-supported communication in fostering intergenerational relationships examine relations between grandparents and child or adult grandchildren. This paper investigates the emotions expressed by grandparents and adolescent grandchildren in online and offline interaction by examining the expression of emotions in their actual interactions. This approach provides insight into which emotions are commonly expressed and how they are expressed using Computer Mediated Communication (CMC). Such insights can inform the design of new, affective tools to foster communication and connectedness in these specific intergenerational dyads. Our method covers focus group, cultural probe and interview. In particular, we discuss the use of a Show & Tell game as an instrument to investigate emotions in actual interaction. Our findings show that care, happiness and also negative perceptions were commonly communicated within the participating dyads and that CMC can assist in the transmission of feelings that were unspoken in face-to-face interaction, fostering connectedness between dyads.	computer-mediated communication;focus group;human–computer interaction;online and offline;social presence theory	Angeline Mayasari;Sonja Pedell;Carolyn Barnes	2016		10.1145/3010915.3010937	social connectedness;computer science;grandparent	HCI	-63.15029489983702	-42.03256138226669	166586

That is, learning is passive. In active learning, students are much more actively engaged in their own learning while educators take a more guiding role. This approach is thought to promote processing of skills and knowledge to a much deeper level than passive learning. In this paper, a research using supporting materials for active e-learning in computational models and related fields is presented. The contributions of this paper are supporting active tools to improve learning and an evaluation of its use in context.	computation;computational model	Mohamed Hamada	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-69387-1_79	computer simulation;robot learning;proactive learning;multi-task learning;collaborative learning;cooperative learning;error-driven learning;simulation;computer science;teaching method;inductive transfer;multimedia;active learning;action learning;synchronous learning	Vision	-77.2265932597778	-45.27623233718091	166727

2d4489dcff8c83a835ee5439a502370a34a0a7c0	illustrating principled design: the early evolution of a cognitive tutor for algebra symbolization	cognitive tutor	This paper provides an illustration of the principled design of an interactive learning environment. It provides a view of the early stages of this process where design, testing, and redesign are most critical. The long term goals of principled design are twofold: (1) to create a system that can be convincingly demonstrated as an effective and practical learning aid and (2) to provide a replicable account of how and why the system is effective. A principled design is one that is both theoretically guided and empirically supported. A principled design is guided by a set of theoretical principles and specific pedagogical hypotheses (Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger & Pelletier, 1995: Koedinger & Anderson, 1993). It is informed by user testing early and often. The design process is iterative: theory, design, test, redesign. Tests that fail lead first to redesign and then. if principled redesigns fail. to changes in the theory. It should be the natural expectation of the field that no Interactive Learning Environment will be fully effective in its initial implementations and that early demonstrations of limitations have a positive. not a negative, bearing on the value of the final system. The only systems immune to some failure are ones that ure never tested. Unfortunately, these are all too common. (For example. Corbett. Koedinger and Anderson (in press) report that only 25% of the papers at recent ITS conferences include any kind of empirical evaluation.) We describe the design of a particular kind of intelligent tutoring system called a cognitive tutor (Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger & Pelletier. 1995). In addition to employing artificial intelligence techniques, cognitive tutors have the defining feature of containing a psychological model of the cognitive processes behind successful and near-successful student performance. This cognitive model provides the core functionality. The cognitive model is used by a	artificial intelligence;cognitive model;cognitive tutor;iteration;usability testing	Kenneth R. Koedinger;John R.

This work outlines a novel approach for analyzing behavioral learner data through the application of process mining techniques specifically targeting a complex problem solving process. We realize this in the context of one particular learning case, namely, domain modeling. This work extends our previous research on process-mining analysis of domain modeling behavior of novices by elaborating with new insights from a replication study enhanced with an extra observation on how novices verify/validate models. The findings include a set of typical modeling and validation patterns that can be used to improve teaching guidance for domain modeling courses. From a scientific viewpoint, the results contribute to improving our knowledge on the cognitive aspects of problem-solving behavior of novices in the area of domain modeling, specifically regarding process-oriented feedback as opposed to traditional outcome feedback (is a solution correct?

Experiment 1 provides empirical support in biomechanics, a contentdominated domain; Experiment 2 extends the construct to bioengineering design, a processdominated domain. Factual knowledge is a lesser predictor than conceptual knowledge, which is a lesser predictor than transfer in determining level of expertise. This study instantiates a view of expertise that held broad appeal but lacked empirical evidence. A Model of Expertise The development of expertise has been framed as requiring: (a) a deep foundation of factual knowledge, (b) a conceptual framework, and (c) organization to support retrieval and use (Bransford, Brown, & Cocking, 2000). This view is modeled in the context of biomechanics (Pandy, Petrosino, Austin, & Barr, 2004). The control group received a lecture and worked problems and the experimental group completed challenge-based instruction modules (Schwartz, Lin, Brophy, & Bransford, 1999). Changes in student achievement were quantified using pretest and posttest questionnaires designed to measure changes in three facets of expertise (a) factual knowledge, operationalized as use of key facts and principles; (b) conceptual knowledge, operationalized as use of underlying principles and equations; and (c) transfer, operationalized as application of knowledge to new situations. A model was posited as a weighted, linear combination of factual knowledge, conceptual knowledge, and transfer. Transfer was weighted most heavily (50%), with the remainder divided between conceptual knowledge (40%) and factual knowledge (10%). The weightings were chosen to reflect one of the main tenets of this synthetic view: The ability to grasp key concepts (conceptual knowledge) and to apply those concepts in solving novel problems (transfer) is much more important to the development of expertise than is the ability to recall facts. Thus, expertise in biomechanics was hypothesized as Model 1: E= 0.10F + 0.40C + 0.50T, where E = expertise, F = factual knowledge, C = conceptual knowledge, and T = Transfer. Experiment 1: Empirical Derivation of the Model The model is an expression of theoretical beliefs that, while compelling, are not supported empirically. The data for the empirical derivation are those collected during the theoretical derivation. These data are changes from pre to posttest along three facets of expertise: (a) factual knowledge; (b) conceptual knowledge; and (c) transfer. The groups’ scores were compared using two-group multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).	domain model;emoticon;experiment;kerrison predictor;list of sega arcade system boards;mike lesser;synthetic intelligence;zero-knowledge proof	Anthony J.

Because of the increasing amount of technology integration in the learning environment, more and more studies focus on examining “how people learn with technology” This study was conducted to find out how computer assisted language learning contributes to learners’ ability to develop listening comprehension. The results revealed that learner computer anxiety, instructor attitude toward e-Learning, e-Learning course flexibility, e-Learning course quality, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and diversity in assessments are the critical factors affecting learners’ perceived satisfaction.	programming paradigm;usability	Cem Isik;Sümeyra Yilmaz	2009	Education and Information Technologies	10.1007/s10639-009-9117-9	psychology;design;educational technology;knowledge management;experiential learning;multimedia;active learning;lifelong learning;management;open learning;pedagogy;technology	HCI	-73.3313732647594	-40.19797857041374	167318

This is expected to affect medical students' experienced cognitive load, while learning image interpretation skills. With two studies this explorative research investigated whether measures inherent to image interpretation, i.e. human-computer interaction and eye tracking, relate to cognitive load. Subsequently, it investigated effects of volumetric image interpretation on second-year medical students' cognitive load. Study 1 measured human-computer interactions of participants during two volumetric image interpretation tasks. Using structural equation modelling, the latent variable ‘volumetric image information’ was identified from the data, which significantly predicted self-reported mental effort as a measure of cognitive load. Study 2 measured participants' eye movements during multiple 2D and volumetric image interpretation tasks. Multilevel analysis showed that time to locate a relevant structure in an image was significantly related to pupil dilation, as a proxy for cognitive load. It is discussed how combining human-computer interaction and eye tracking allows for comprehensive measurement of cognitive load. Combining such measures in a single model would allow for disentangling unique sources of cognitive load, leading to recommendations for implementation of volumetric image interpretation in the medical education curriculum. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Students have to choose elective and voluntary courses for successful graduation. Searching for suitable and interesting courses is time-consuming and the main aim is to recommend students such courses. Two beneficial approaches are thoroughly discussed in this paper. The results were achieved by analysis of study-related data and structural attributes computed from the social network. To validate the proposed method based on data mining and social network analysis, we evaluate data extracted from the information system of Masaryk University. However, the method is quite general and can be used at other universities.	data mining;information system;social network analysis	Hana Bydzovská;Lubomír Popelínský	2013	2013 24th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications	10.1109/DEXA.2013.22	social network analysis;further education;computer science;knowledge management;data science;data mining;database;data analysis;world wide web;recommender system	DB	-77.24867263618435	-50.65547152666545	167673

However, there has been limited investigation of the relationship between individual differences and attitudes towards online and offline learning. This study aimed to investigate for the first time how social anxiety and extraversion influence student attitudes to online and offline learning, specifically in relation to tertiary level practical activities. Based on the social compensation hypothesis, it was predicted that students with higher levels of extraversion and lower levels of social anxiety would report more favourable attitudes to face-to-face learning activities. It was further predicted that less extraverted and more socially anxious students would have more favourable attitudes to online learning activities. Undergraduate students (N 1⁄4 322, 67% female) completed the HEXACO-60 personality inventory, the Mini Social Phobia Inventory, and measures of attitudes towards online and offline activities. Two hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted. The first revealed that neither extraversion nor social anxiety contributed significantly to preference for online practical activities. The second regression revealed that greater emotionality, greater extraversion, greater conscientiousness, and lower levels of social anxiety were associated with more favourable attitudes towards face-to-face practical activities. In contrast to predictions, extraversion and social anxiety did not significantly contribute to attitudes to online learning activities. However, in line with predictions, greater extraversion and lower levels of social anxiety were associated with more favourable attitudes towards face-to-face practical activities. These findings indicate that online learning activities have limited compensatory effects for students who experience social discomfort, and that the social compensation hypothesis may apply within an educational framework, but in unexpected ways. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Perhaps the most significant development that led to JavaScript’s ubiquitous use was the emergence of the jQuery library. In many development shops, jQuery is the core library upon which all other application code is developed. I spoke with jQuery creator John Resig, currently of Khan Academy, which offers instructional videos and learning tools for math, science, computer programming, history, and more. You can see the entire interview with John at www.computer.org/computingconversations. BUILDING AN ELEGANT LIBRARY John started developing what would become jQuery in 2005 as an undergraduate student in computer science at Rochester Institute of Technology.

Design/methodology/approach – This research study utilized six design science research methodology steps. Two case studies were conducted to understand how a MediaWiki with additional extensions potentially facilitates collaborative writing. Questionnaires were used to collect answers to questions about perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Findings – The findings from this research led to the innovative design of a set of MediaWiki mechanisms to improve collaborative writing in the classroom setting. The findings of the second round of the build-and-evaluate loop illustrate some potential impacts of MediaWiki when used in the classroom. Research limitations/implications – These mechanisms would increase the students’ sense of awareness, clarify management, increase discussion, and clarify students’ roles. The implications of this study can be useful for researchers and developers. They can make use of what the study articulates the benefits and the needs of MediaWiki extensions. Practical implications – The results of this study potentially offer new mechanisms that can be used to teach graduate students involved in collaborative writing. Originality/value – The creation of the newly developed extensions is the original and innovative component of this study. These extensions are designed to increase project control and accountability.

The creative, hands-on design work, as well as a mix of both individual and collaborative processes, provide options for developing multiple skills. But these multilevel learning processes are difficult to capture. This study explores how a mobile application, the Talking Tools (TT), are used for documenting students own reflections during sloyd class. The study targets what, why, and when a group of teacher students (N=11) use TT for microblogging about their work. Their subjective reflections from a questionnaire using open-ended questions are used for validating earlier analysis of their blogs created using TT. As TT is still under development, the objective of exploring students’ documentation behaviour with the application, is to understand what the added value of TT could be for capturing various areas of learning. Suggestions for teacher guidelines for implementing TT are discussed based on the findings. The article also describes the development of the application in terms of the inter-disciplinary cooperation and collaboration. The TPACK framework is used for illustrating the know-how transcendence between collaborators in the TT application development.

04eced3f77901619649c7bc46e0e684a1ad180d0	development of diagrammatic procedural instructions for performing complex one-time tasks		This article provides evidence that diagrams in procedural instructions can help as well as hinder performance depending on how the diagrams are designed. Results suggest that diagrammatic instructions for performing one-time mechanical manipulation tasks that are designed according to specific rules are superior to equivalent instructions presented as a combination of text and diagrams. Tasks were completed quicker with fewer errors. One important factor is that these types of tasks do not require learning or memorization. The goal for the instruction designer is to create diagrammatic instructions in accordance with Carroll's (1990) minimalist principles as well as verifying that each step occurs in either an internal or external representation (Zhang, 1997). Contrary to what is presented in the literature, this series of experiments provides evidence that if the diagrams are well designed they can be perceived, understood, and performed quicker than the same information in a text and diagram format.	diagram	Michael A.

We designed a task in which learners actively engage with text and pictures in a lesson about mitosis, followed by a test of knowledge gained from the task. During the task, think-aloud protocols were collected. Preliminary results show that learners actively engage in cognitive processes that are thought to be essential to learning from text and pictures: selecting, organizing, and integrating (Mayer, 2001). The verbal protocol allows for a more detailed task analysis of these processes, as well as a correlational analysis between engagement in these steps and test performance, to be presented at the conference. Furthermore, while individuals and collaborating learners scored similarly on the knowledge test, their metacognitive strategies differed drastically. These results are important in understanding how students learn from popular interactive media involving text and pictures.	cognition;image;interactive media;organizing (structure);task analysis;think aloud protocol	Krista DeLeeuw;Katharina Scheiter;Friedrich W.

The case study explored participants’ perceptions, attitudes and beliefs regarding the ESL reading enhancement program, Reading ExcellenceTM. The study found that participants experienced the program in a positive light. They experienced improved ESL reading as well as listening and writing proficiency. In addition, they experienced improved affective well-being in the sense that they generally felt more comfortable using ESL. This included feeling more selfconfident in their experience of their academic environment. Interviews as well as document review resulted in dissonance, however: data pointed towards poor class attendance as well as a perturbing lack of progress in terms of reading comprehension and speed.	game programming	Jaak Henno;Hannu Jaakkola	2008	iJET		video game design;game design;game development tool;games;simulation;level design;human–computer interaction;computer science;game mechanics;game art design;game developer;multimedia;game design document;video game development;game programming;game testing	Robotics	-71.35737712111545	-43.12979585505363	168636

Traditional approaches to the mapping and designing of the emerging social dynamics in a joyful, social education setting have fallen short of producing desirable results due to the lack of joint consideration of social processes occurring in several dimensions and their intrinsic interconnectedness. This paper suggests writing down gaming procedures by means of musical score. Such a mapping strategy allows for heuristic analysis of the social dynamics occurring at the following four levels: logical information conveyed (S), team building (A), debate & discourse (T), and integration with others’ experience (B). This paper then concludes by identifying a dynamic structure of learning frameworks that may be capable of delivering an optimal learning effect for both individual and collective learning endeavors.

Due to specifics of portals as web sites, mainly referring to their structure and media specificities along with diversity of users, tasks and workflows, distinct assessment approaches should be employed. Methodology brings together laboratory-based testing along with experts’ inspection and produces valuable results for users and developers at a low cost. Compared to our first study, user assessment applied a faster and less expensive procedure, providing stability of measures with reduced sample size, while inspection employed fewer specialists with higher expertize and a simpler evaluation form. Directions of future work are identified.

With the use of SL as a virtual reality platform, students are able to choose which resources are used to train them in basic navigation and which communities, representing a wide variety of cultural practices of interest to them, they would choose to study. In a two-year study, student attitudes of engagement and desire to learn cultural competencies through this media are compared, using two methods of course design introducing students to SL. Student surveys show significant improvement in SL navigation when entry into SL include interviews with key informants and a central teleportation hub for exploration to key sites. Student surveys show significant increase in student involvement and appreciation for the use of SL regarding the EPAS core competencies as published by the Council on Social Work Education in 2008 for cultural diversity and application to client assessment.	epas;population;rating scale;sl (complexity);second life;self-awareness;simulation;usb hub;virtual machine;virtual reality;virtual world	Scott P.

e95ee925865c9d999513b7a647b31c4f008ff532	imaginary versus virtual loci: evaluating the memorization accuracy in a virtual memory palace		The Method of Loci (MOL) is a mnemonic strategy to memorize declarative knowledge. In the late 90s researchers started to experimentally analyze the MOL by providing their participants a virtual world. This digital environment was meant to serve the users as a template for their personal memory palace. Past studies differed in central aspects of their experimental design. One difference is that earlier studies integrated the learning content in multiple and different ways. The design of the learning content is an essential aspect and should make a difference based on cognitive theories. This study analyzes if participants perform better with virtually presented learning content or if the MOL works better when users have to imagine the content. Results encourage future concepts of the virtual MOL to implement the learning content in the environment.	declarative programming;design of experiments;digital environment;experiment;imaginary time;theory;virtual world	Jan-Paul Huttner;David Pfeiffer;Susanne Robra-Bissantz	2018			knowledge management;computer science;the imaginary;human–computer interaction;mnemonic;virtual reality;memorization;virtual memory;method of loci	HCI	-63.37212606035594	-40.6006812862897	169217

This study adopts AR technology to enrich learning environment and students' learning experience at the same time. Furthermore, to passively avoid students being lost while they were learning in a real environment and to actively channel students into ideal learning topic, this study proposes an indoor positioning algorithm which is able to calculate the current position of the learner and further enables learners to find out where he/she is and which learning subjects he/she will learn. The experiment is carried out to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed indoor positioning algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm has a higher accuracy and lower error. Meanwhile, the algorithm is able to eliminate the anomalous RSSI signals, which is the main reason for improving the positioning accuracy. The maximum error is improved by 51.22%. From the application aspect, we elaborate the implications of this study which present the substantial contributions and educational values of the system. We expect that the smart learning can be made via the system establishment in near future.

Players who enjoy being a winner, but dislike hard challenges (“Self-Validators”) are a heretofore ignored but commonly occurring player type. Self-Validators worry about and are distressed by failing. They can simply avoid playing overly difficult games for entertainment. But in a required learning game, Self-Validators’ excessive worry about failing can interfere with learning. The authors consider whether and how eight very different modern games accommodate Explorers, Achievers, and Self-Validators and discuss implications for entertainment and learning game design and research. Seven of eight diverse games analyzed primarily served either the Explorer or Achiever player type. Self-Validators were partially accommodated in some Achiever-oriented games, through user-selectable difficulty. Design with all three types in mind would encourage inclusion of features that enable players to optimize their preferred style of play.

Users who are physically disabled require a variety of access technology and learning depending on the nature of their disability. The intention of modern technology policy is to enable users with intellectual disabilities to have as much choice and control as possible over their lives, be involved in their communities, and make a valued contribution to the world at work. However, in order to achieve these aims, more effective educational and training media are needed as well as an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) for improving their skills and removing the barriers that turn cognitive impairments into intellectual disability. This paper proposes an (ITS) framework dedicated to users who are deaf as a solution for such a challenge. The proposed system help to meet these needs solves accessibility problem and enables access to information technologies by users with disabilities in a simple and reliable way.	accessibility;assistive technology;environment variable;freedom of information laws by country;usability;watershed (image processing)	Hussein Karam Hussein Abd El-Sattar	2008	2008 Fifth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualisation	10.1109/CGIV.2008.49	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-68.89416224610545	-44.51263851756227	169919

The increased people mobility and the reduction of educational costs push to develop ad hoc solutions enabling to access to knowledge regardless to geographical situation and economical capabilities. These parameters should not be limits for good training: learning material’s pertinence and efficiency have to remain the core of educational activities. In this paper we address the problem through SyTroN: a tele-learning system. This system combines virtual reality and teleoperation techniques to offer an open platform with two main objectives. The first one is to propose intuitive virtual classrooms/desks, including a real teacher supervision and supporting collaborative and individual distant learning. The second goal is to place learners in real conditions with remote connections to real devices allowing distant experimentations. Both goals participate to increase learning impacts and to reduce costs, that is, sharing costly real devices from anywhere at any time. After 5 years of development, our work has been validated by an extensive use at a high engineering school. In situ tests and learning impact studies have been done. They show some advantages and some drawbacks of our global solution.	automatic control;closing (morphology);cognitive science;experiment;hoc (programming language);internet;open platform;operational system;personalization;relevance;television;virtual reality	Ryad Chellali;Cédric Dumas;Nicolas Mollet;Geoffrey Subileau	2009	Int.

Students’ expectations on how and when they learn are creating increasingly heavier demands upon all aspects of their learning. Young people in particular have made mobile devices fundamental to their daily lives. However, educators and developers are faced with the dilemma: do you develop applications for the mobile or the wired environment? In this paper we argue that learning environments will remain combinations of wired and wireless for the foreseeable future. However, not all affordances offered by wired environments are transferable to small mobile devices. In fact, some tasks are better served by applications that are designed to be entirely mobile. The paper will present initial results and evaluations of five of learning tools with the properties mobility, flexibility and either instructoror student-generated content.	mobile device;serial experiments lain	David M.

As it has been argued in mathematics education research, not only the content, but also the form in which students learn is important for mathematics learning. Particularly, an inquiry approach permeates through the mathematics curriculum of several countries around the world. Additionally, the use of technology to learn mathematics has been increasing in the last decades, requiring teachers and professionals in education to constantly explore and learn new possibilities or affordances in the classroom. The purpose of this paper is to initiate a discussion about the possible and complex forms of interaction among students, teacher, mathematical tasks, and the electronic tablet (iPad) in an inquiry learning environment. An experience from a grade 10 classroom is used as a context to exemplify these interactions.	ipad	A. P.

ecf7cdc6608e63797e51671e40cf731122bbe49c	who will pass? analyzing learner behaviors in moocs	learning instruction;educational technology	Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have recently gained worldwide attention from educational institutes. MOOCs provide a new option for learning, yet measurable learning benefits of MOOCs still need to be investigated. Collecting data of three MOOCs at Yuan Ze University (YZU), this paper intended to classify learning behaviors among 1489 students on the MOOC platform at YZU. This study further examined learning outcomes in MOOCs by different types of learners. The Ward's hierarchical and k-means non-hierarchical clustering methods were employed to classify types of learners' behavior while they engaged in learning activities on the MOOC platform. Three types of MOOC learners were classified-active learner, passive learner, and bystander. Active learners who submitted assignments on time and frequently watched lecture videos showed a higher completion rate and a better grade in the course. MOOC learners who participated in online discussion forum reported a higher rate of passing the course and a better score than those inactive classmates. The finding of this study suggested that the first 2 weeks was a critical point of time to retain students in MOOCs. MOOC instructors need to carefully design course and detect risk behaviors of students in early of the classes to prevent students from dropping out of the course. The feature design of discussion forum is to provide peer interaction and facilitate online learning. Our results suggested that timely feedback by instructors or facilitators on discussion forum could enhance students' engagement in MOOCs.	cluster analysis;critical point (network science);hierarchical clustering;k-means clustering;massive open online course;online machine learning	Shu-Fen Tseng;Y.

In this study, the navigational behaviour of students in an online course within a learning management system was investigated, looking at how students with different learning styles prefer to use and learn in such a course. As a result, several differences in the students’ navigation patterns were identified. These findings have several implications for improving adaptivity. First, they showed that students with different learning styles use different strategies to learn and navigate through the course, which can be seen as another argument for providing adaptivity. Second, the findings provided information for extending the adaptive functionality in typical learning management systems. Third, the information about differences in navigational behaviour can contribute towards automatic detection of learning styles, helping in making student modeling approaches more accurate.	personalization	Sabine Graf;Tzu-Chien Liu;Kinshuk	2010	J.

Despite positive anecdotal reports, there is currently little empirical evidence to support their efficacy in particular domains. With the recent rapid growth of tools for online learning, an interesting open question for educators is the extent to which badges can positively impact student participation.  In this paper, we report on a large-scale (n > 1000) randomized, controlled experiment measuring the impact of incorporating a badge-based achievement system within an online learning tool. We discover a highly significant positive effect on the quantity of students' contributions, without a corresponding reduction in their quality, as well as on the period of time over which students engaged with the tool. Students enjoyed being able to earn badges, and indicated a strong preference for having them available in the user interface.	online machine learning;randomized algorithm;user interface	Paul Denny	2013		10.1145/2470654.2470763	simulation;multimedia	HCI	-72.48455113692184	-43.447132180532535	170477

In this paper we propose a method for evaluating pedagogical activity in Web-based comments using a pedagogical framework, and present a preliminary study that assigns a Pedagogical Value (PV) to comments. This has value as it categorises discussion in terms of pedagogical activity rather than Web interaction. Results show that PV is distinct from typical interactional measures, there are negative or insignificant correlations with established Learning Analytics methods, but strong correlations with relevant linguistic indicators of learning, suggesting that the use of pedagogical frameworks may produce more accurate indicators than interaction analysis, and that linguistic rather than interaction analysis has the potential to automatically identify learning behaviour.	norm (social);pedagogical agent;value (computer science)	Tim O'Riordan;David E.

7f2a86470c11ef19abc804a50b8d0bb143317e43	is immersion of any value? whether, and to what extent, game immersion experience during serious gaming affects science learning		Many studies have shown the positive impact of serious gaming on learning outcomes, but few have explored the relationships between game immersion and science learning. Accordingly, this study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of learning by playing, as well as the dynamic process of game immersion experiences, and to further identify whether, and to what extent, immersion affects science learning through serious gaming by using the techniques of cluster analysis. A total of 63 seventh-grade students participated in the study, and a quasi-experimental research design was employed. The results demonstrated that the students gained a holistic understanding of the relevant scientific concepts because their performances on the scenario-based science assessment were significantly improved across serious gameplaying occasions, and the effect of learning was retained long term. Moreover, serious gaming provided students with the experience of immersion insofar as the students indicated a greater degree of immersion in the game over time. Furthermore, two core clusters presenting meaningful patterns, high gaming performance/high immersion and high science learning/low immersion, were revealed. Finally, various interpretations and implications of the obtained data are discussed. Introduction The development of computers and other technological innovations have resulted in new ways of thinking about how the goal of involving students in the learning process can be achieved (Jonassen & Land, 2012). Video games, which synthesize a variety of these technological advances and boast attractive features that have made them increasingly popular with fans all over the world, possess the potential to successfully transform education and provide a more comprehensive record of learning than conventional lectures (Annetta & Cheng, 2008; Arora, Kaur, Gupta & Bhardawaj, 2014). Over the past decade, many studies have shown that, if properly used, video games do have a positive effect on education and can enhance student learning by providing a learner-centered context (Connolly, Boyle, MacArthur, Hainey & Boyle, 2012). This kind of serious gaming, which harnesses the power of fun and enjoyment, presents an especially unique opportunity for science learning, since the subject of science is often considered abstruse and challenging (Cheng & Annetta, 2012; Cheng, Su, Huang & Chen, 2014). The experience of game immersion is generally considered the driving force behind the success of British Journal of Educational Technology (2016) doi:10.1111/bjet.12386 © 2016 British Educational Research Association serious gaming. Brown and Cairns (2004) provided evidence showing that game immersion experience actually consists of three different stages, namely, engagement, engrossment and total immersion. The experience of immersion moves along the path of time, and different barriers should be overcome in order to proceed into the next stage. Empirically, research by Cheng, She and Annetta (2015) has confirmed the hierarchical structure of game immersion. Although we may now have a better understanding of game immersion experiences, it remains unclear how such immersion actually affects student science learning and gaming performance through serious play. If game immersion is really a progressive, sub-optimal experience as proposed (Cheng, She & Annetta, 2015; Brown & Cairns, 2004; Jennett et al, 2008), will students become increasingly immersed over time through serious gaming? Moreover, even though serious gaming can provide learners with the experience of game immersion, the evidence remains lacking regarding the issues of whether learners are required to be fully immersed in the gaming process to generate science learning outcomes, or what levels of immersion are necessary for game-based science learning. The intricate relationships between immersion and science Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic • Serious gaming, harnessing the power of fun and enjoyment, has positive impact on student learning outcomes. • Game immersion experience has a hierarchical structure consisting of three stages: engagement, engrossment and total immersion. • Gaming performance is the variable that partially mediates the effect of the first stage of immersion, engagement, on game-based science learning. What this paper adds • Serious gaming facilitated student science learning, especially in terms of higher-order cognition, as student performances on scenario-based science assessment significantly improved through playing Virtual Age. • Serious gaming provided individuals with a progressive process of game immersion, a gameplay experience that is dynamic, moving along the path of time. • When it comes to the issue of how game immersion experience affects science learning through serious gaming, there were actually two different cohorts of learners presenting meaningful patterns, high gaming performance/high immersion and high science learning/low immersion. Implications for practice and/or policy • The obtained results imply that learning by gaming can be effective for student science learning, especially in terms of their higher-order cognition, and the impact can be long term. Researchers and educators can take into accounts while developing new curriculum and designing new learning tools. • The study offers further evidence to researchers and educators with respect to whether, and to what extent, immersion affects science learning and gaming performance through serious play. This is the question that researchers who deal with serious gaming were eager to know, but has not been thoroughly answered before. • Traditional methods used by most of previous studies that take all participants as a whole to run statistical analyses without considering individual differences might obscure the actual effect of game immersion experience on science learning. 2 British Journal of Educational Technology © 2016 British Educational Research Association learning through serious gaming are of increasing interest to researchers; however, they have so far yet to be fully revealed. Therefore, by using the techniques of cluster analysis, the present study sought to examine the effectiveness of learning by playing and the dynamic process of immersion experiences through serious gaming, in addition to further investigating whether, and to what extent, game immersion experiences affect student science learning and gaming performance in a well-developed serious educational game called Virtual Age. Literature review: science learning through serious gaming Traditional science classes, which generally involve the teacher lecturing, place most of the burden of communicating learning materials on the instructors. However, a growing number of studies on learning sciences have offered evidence that teaching and learning are never as simple as merely transmitting ideas in the same form from one person to another. Teachers have to be committed to student learning and realize that teaching must be more than telling (Crosby & Harden, 2000). Learners should be put in the center of the science learning process, and instructors should serve as facilitators who help the learners make sense of ideas and construct their own knowledge in science classrooms. In such learner-centered learning environments, students are encouraged to become active and self-regulated learners, and meaningful learning is more likely to take place (Hassard & Dias, 2008). Although the paradigm shift from traditional approaches focusing on how teachers teach to the learner-centered perspective emphasizing how students learn has become a trend in science education today (Anderson, 2002), some teachers and students remain resistant to change because of their anxieties about losing focus without content-driven lectures. Moreover, many practical constraints, such as time limitation for instruction or issues such as teachers often emphasize one-way lectures and easily ignore individual differences, affecting conventional science learning environments, usually doom learner-centered designs to failure and demotivate students in their efforts to learn science. Recently, however, the emergence of using video games in science education has made learnercentered science learning more efficient and effective. Serious gaming can facilitate student science learning through transformational play by situating the learner within a rich interactive context in which the scientific content is embedded in a series of authentic problems (Barab et al, 2009). Learning simultaneously occurs through the continuous solving of problems and overcoming of challenges in the game. Student motivation and engagement can be potentially increased because pleasure and instructional materials are combined into a whole in the virtual world, which allows the learner to engage in a recursive game cycle so that deeper learning is fostered (Squire, Barnett, Grant & Higginbotham, 2004). Complex and abstract scientific concepts are visualized through tangible representations in the simulated game world, wherein one can generate hypotheses and test strategies iteratively without any need to worry about real-life consequences (Spires, Rowe, Mott & Lester, 2011). Many natural phenomena that cannot be produced in real-world situations, as well as many experiments and human behaviors that cannot be easily investigated, are allowed to be harmlessly simulated and evaluated in the game (Farrington, 2011; Kobes, Helsloot, de Vries & Post, 2010). Appropriate scaffoldings are offered by the provision of cues and partial solutions which keep the learners progressing and controlling their own learning through serious gaming (Federation of American Scientists, 2006). In brief, such gaming provides great opportunities for science education, as what cannot be done in traditional science learning settings might now be realized in the virtual contexts of games. 	cluster analysis;code talker;cognition;computer;design of experiments;doom;embedded system;emergence;entity–relationship model;experience;experiment;holism;immersion (virtual reality);lester the unlikely;one-way function;pac-land;performance;phelim boyle;programming paradigm;real life;recursion;stanford physics information retrieval system;transmitter;virtual world;word lists by frequency	Meng-Tzu Cheng;Yu-Wen Lin;Hsiao-Ching She;Po-Chih Kuo	2017	BJET	10.1111/bjet.12386	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia	AI	-72.0486675140366	-42.019666935906145	170892

Hybrid crafting approaches that integrate crafts with digital components can extend game making beyond the screen and provide new opportunities for learning about computational concepts, skills, and perspectives. In this paper, we report on a series of workshops with middle school students (ages 11-14 years) who used Makey Makey, Play Doh, textiles and other materials to craft touchpads, augmented board games, and wearable controllers for their Scratch games. We examined students' approaches to computing and crafting in their onscreen and off screen designs. We discuss in which ways constructionist gaming can benefit from extending their designs into the physical world and what moving constructionist gaming beyond the screen has to offer for K-12 programming instruction.	touchpad;wearable computer	Yasmin B.

A prototype advisory support tool was developed to address the problems related to documentbased advising. The tool supports two interactive advice approaches – a top-down backward-chaining style and a bottom-up forward-chaining style. An experiment with 20 participants compared these two different interaction approaches within a natural curriculum-planning context. The results show important design tradeoffs for supporting people in curriculum planning. This paper presents the results of the experiment. We discuss the cognitive aspects and implications for each interaction approach and how some UI design guidelines are supported and then draw conclusions about how best to structure user interaction in an advisory support tool based on the results.	backward chaining;forward chaining;prototype;top-down and bottom-up design;user interface design	Judy van Biljon;Karen Renaud	2003			interactive systems engineering;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;interaction design;top-down and bottom-up design;data mining	HCI	-72.38201846706819	-45.52262058180747	171187
b2ea736fcff9c91c5556b4ff37e4cf3d049e483c	a framework for evaluating and selecting learning technologies.	learning technology	This paper considers some of the major issues in the field of learning technology selection. It presents a framework towards the development of selection criteria that aim at improving technology selection process to avoid the technological problems. The variables like gender, age, and race of the participants are not examined. To find out the criteria, which have high impact on learning technology selection, three groups (faculties, IT specialists & students) and two control groups (faculties working as IT specialists & students working as IT specialists) are selected from three Gulf universities (Arabian Gulf University, Bahrain University and Kuwait University). Initially, 19 criteria are used; the groups’ independent opinion is collected for analysis and organized according to the weighted average. The top criteria (over mean) are retained and the others are canceled. Seven criteria show high impact on learning technology selection process in general. These criteria are feedback capability, student/instructor satisfaction, student motivation and self-learning, ease of access, use and revision, professional development, usability and reliability and instructional time.

Training is probably the best response to the constant need for the acquisition of bioinformatics skills. It is interesting to assess the effects of training in the different sets of researchers that make use of it. While training bench experimentalists in the life sciences, we have observed instances of changes in their attitudes in research that, if well exploited, can have beneficial impacts in the dialogue with professional bioinformaticians and influence the conduction of the research itself.	attitude;bioinformatics;biological science disciplines	Pedro Fernandes;Pooja Jain;Catarina Moita	2012		10.1155/2012/672749	biology;medical research;medicine;computer science;bioinformatics;data science	NLP	-67.15392052083075	-50.471540818508004	171603
3f85da890e30f7d5729674bd1adc2a6efeee1648	a new learning platform using e-textbooks for socially networked online learners		Conventional learning management systems that focus on traditional classrooms do not fit many-participant online courses such as massive open online courses (MOOCs). A learning platform, Creative Higher Education with Learning Objects (CHiLO) based on e-textbooks aims to develop a flexible learning environment for large-scale online courses. CHiLO essentially has high portability in electronic publication 3.0 (EPUB3) format as well as a comprehensive open network learning system using various existing technologies and learning resources, including open educational resources on open network communities, such as social networking service. We produced a series of CHiLO Books called “Nihongo Starter A1” in cooperation with the Open University of Japan (OUJ) and the Japan Foundation, and delivered them as a learning course of OUJ MOOC in Japan MOOC. Our set of experimental outcomes shows that CHiLO using not Web services but e-textbooks is available for large-scale online courses. The result reveals a positive completion rate of 22% and active participants posting at 25%.	book;epub;embedded system;gnu nano;graphics;massive open online course;nsb/appstudio;video clip;web service	Masumi Hori;Seishi Ono;Kazutsuna Yamaji;Shinzo Kobayashi;Toshihiro Kita;Tsuneo Yamada	2015			educational technology;simulation;artificial intelligence;software engineering;multimedia;world wide web;open learning;synchronous learning;pedagogy	AI	-75.86645906471757	-38.78489864490891	171629

Design/methodology/approach – Cronbach’s alpha, item analysis and item discrimination indices, principal component analysis, varimax rotation, and discriminant validity were used to measure reliability and validity of the scale. A 28-item refined version of the scale was found highly reliable and of reasonable length. Findings – Further refinement based on principal component analysis indicated three major components, which allow approaching information literacy skills regarding to their complexity levels. Originality/value – The information literacy self-efficacy scale is recommended to identify individuals with low self-efficacy beliefs, which may be a significantly limiting factor for them to explore their information literacy skills.	discriminant;information literacy;item response theory;principal component analysis;refinement (computing);varimax rotation	Serap Kurbanoglu;Buket Akkoyunlu;Aysun Umay	2006	Journal of Documentation	10.1108/00220410610714949	self-efficacy;library science;econometrics;limiting factor;design methods;computer science;information literacy;social psychology;measurement;statistics;principal component analysis	HCI	-76.2739305093751	-40.8918722761152	171725

A GUI dialog script editor is implemented in order to facilitate the teachers to design such scripts easily. The application of this system in English class and the formal evaluation results demonstrate this script approach has great pedagogical promise in language education.	computer simulation;dialog system;graphical user interface;knowledge representation and reasoning;natural language processing	Jiyou Jia;Weichao Chen	2008	2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies	10.1109/ICALT.2008.97	natural language processing;knowledge representation and reasoning;speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;dialog system;multimedia;natural language;programming language	Robotics	-77.1287589531016	-47.27045899786594	171875

We present a new organization of MOOC learner activity data at a resolution that is in between the fine granularity of the clickstream and coarse organizations that count activities, aggregate students or use long duration time units. A detailed access trajectory (DAT) consists of binary values and is two dimensional with one axis that is a time series, e.g. days and the other that is a chronologically ordered list of a MOOC component type’s instances, e.g. videos in instructional order. Most popular MOOC platforms generate data that can be organized as detailed access trajectories (DATs). We explore the value of DATs by conducting four empirical mini-studies. Our studies suggest DATs contain rich information about students’ learning behaviors and facilitate MOOC learning analyses.

Previous work showed that having students complete multiple choice questions that were intended to verify that they had done the preparation work did not have a statistically significant impact on outcomes as measured through written quizzes and exams. In an attempt to engage higher-level processing of learned information, this work builds on top of that by adding questions that require students to write short segments of code for most of the quizzes in addition to doing some multiple choice questions. We found that students who were given these coding video quizzes performed better on written assessments, especially for the final exam.	final exam	Lisa L. Lacher;Albert Jiang;Yu Zhang;Mark C.

The rationale to conduct this study was to explore the effects of our model on children's engagement and learning in a real-life scenario and also to further emphasise the value of our model. We conducted an exploratory long-term CRI study, where the robot used the personalisation mechanism based on our emotion and memory model to understand its effects in terms of improving children's learning and sustaining social engagement on the Mathematics task in a long-term interaction. Our results showed that in a condition, where our model was implemented on the social robot, children showed the higher level of social engagement. Additionally, their learning performance based on calculating area and perimeter of regular and irregular shapes was also better in terms of their test scores.

Design/methodology/approach – A multi-faceted methodological approach was taken utilising two questionnaires (preand post-immersion), non-participant overt observation, structured interviews, and online diary keeping. Data was then analysed to identify barriers and attractors. Findings – More negative experiences were recorded than positive, with the costs, time commitment, stigma of using, the lack of structure, social interaction, and the complexity of the control interface all provoking negative responses. Avatar creation, and the creativity and quality of graphical presentation produced positive responses. Research limitations/implications – Due to the investment in time required to participate in the research, the sample size is smaller than ideal thus limiting the conclusions that can be generalised. The research also did not directly include interaction with online library or information services. Practical implications – For librarians using SL the research demonstrates that the response from new users is less than enthusiastic and that when designing virtual library services care should be taken to avoid the barriers identified here and to focus on the features found attractive by participants. Originality/value – Previous studies have examined the implementation of in-world information services without examining the experience of new users. Those studies that have looked directly at the user’s interaction with virtual worlds are more focused on MMORPGs and on current users.	digital library;experience;faceted classification;graphical user interface;immersion (virtual reality);information security;librarian;massively multiplayer online role-playing game;online diary;sl (complexity);second life;virtual world	Christopher Peter Clarke	2012	Program	10.1108/00330331211221864	computer simulation;structured interview;questionnaire;interpersonal relationship;interaction;the internet;simulation;interview;human–computer interaction;computer science;social system;database;multimedia;world wide web;information system	HCI	-70.26848025694687	-45.56741338497459	172247

New technologies fundamentally changed the way they interact with knowledge so the traditional approach to learning and teaching is no longer sufficient. In order to make the learning environment more interactive and enable students to learn easier and faster, modern teaching techniques need to be applied. There are many different teaching techniques that have emerged from the integration of technology in education such as: flipped teaching, whole brain teaching, gamification, social media, etc. Flipped teaching encourages students to study the course material before class by using readings, pre-recorded video lectures or research assignments. Class time is reserved for active learning strategies. Whole brain teaching helps stimulate both sides of the brain and emphasizes active learning in which students repeat core information and practice basic skills through humor and games. Gamification is a game-based learning technique that allows students learning through the use of games. Nowadays students are always connected to some social network. These students are easily motivated to engage with social media in the classroom. Experience from the School of Electrical Engineering in Zagreb shows that the use of different modern teaching techniques is making learning interesting and teaching more effective.	active learning (machine learning);computer;electrical engineering;gamification;mobile phone;social media;social network	M.

a0cf45537b2500470a7f3df4aedf15cb86808027	the design and usability testing of a mobile application to aid in child-to-adult-care transition		As mobile devices become more central in our lives, accessibility and utility for users becomes essential. The widespread availability of mobile devices introduces a number of challenges to traditional software engineering including: 1. mobile user interfaces differ from traditional interfaces; and, 2. the diversity of mobile platforms. As part of a larger research effort, this poster presents the design, implementation and initial testing of a mobile application aimed at helping the child-to-adult-care transition process for children with chronic disease. Based on recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the application will help guide patients through four main components of transition: 1. assess transition readiness; 2. plan the transition; 3. implement the transition; and, 4. help document the transition. The design, implementation and testing of a mobile application may ease the transition process. By leveraging modern cross-compilation tools, this application can be implemented on multiple mobile platforms. This will lead to a variety of users, including those who may be differently-abled, to have a more fluid transition to their new health care providers.	academy;accessibility;cross compiler;mobile app;mobile device;software engineering;usability testing;user interface	Jeremy Dixon;Josh Dehlinger;Shannan DeLany Dixon	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39473-7_21	usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;component-based usability testing;cognitive walkthrough;usability;human–computer interaction;agile usability engineering;usability engineering;heuristic evaluation;usability lab;usability inspection	HCI	-63.41645662492165	-45.15723858746224	172636

Recently, game researchers have highlighted the need for paying more attention to identifying the game design choices that can strengthen learning. This paper reviews recent studies in the field of games that aim at supporting people with difficulties in learning, particularly in basic reading and maths skills. We identify the major characteristics and learning outcomes of the reviewed studies, as well as key design principles that have been used in games for enhancing basic reading and maths skills. The results show that people with specific learning difficulties have positive improvements in the quality of learning. We also found specific gamification elements that have been used to promote the learning of basic reading and maths skills. However, we call for research, which would explicitly examine the effects of game design choices on learning. Currently, the studies that address learning disabilities do not specifically define which kind of games and game design the results refer to, while game design studies do not clarify how these games influence learning. Thus, there is a need to rethink previous empirical studies on game settings for people with learning difficulties via advancing the role of game design in empirical intervention studies.

The proposed workshop is aimed at participants interested in having a first contact with """"learning design practices"""" for teaching planning. Such practices advocate the use of reflection, conceptualization and authoring scaffolds (that also include purpose-specific ICT tools) for making explicit the goals, the activities and the resources of pedagogical plans (also called """"learning designs""""). Making learning designs explicit facilitates their sharing, reuse and co-creation, as well as their interpretation by systems capable of setting up the enacting runtime in a technology-enhanced learning context (composed by, e.g., Virtual Learning Environments or VLEs, web 2.0 learning tools, etc.). The workshop introduces the concept and practices of learning design, illustrating them by means of hands-on activities with the Integrated Learning Design Environment (ILDE). The ILDE is a learning design platform, being developed within the METIS EU-funded research project, which provides a single and uniform entry point to a variety of existing learning design tools. The ILDE tools provide the means for going from the """"idea"""" of a learning design to its enactment in an ICT learning platform (e.g. a VLE such as Moodle) without requiring technical expertise, and with a reduced workload."""	conceptualization (information science);entry point;hands-on computing;metis;pedagogical agent;reflection (computer programming);star trek: first contact;web 2.0	Juan I.

Usability means quality and puts the users and their real needs in the center. Therefore investigation of usability and its integration or contribution to learning process is worthwhile. In this article several questions, regarding usability definition and usability evaluation techniques for e-learning, are raised. In addition several relevant research works are briefly reviewed and the need for more focused research efforts and empirical validation is stressed. In conclusion it is proposed that a usability evaluation technique for elearning has to satisfy three basic prerequisites/characteristics in order to be easily adopted and used.	cross-validation (statistics);high-level programming language;usability	Panagiotis Zaharias	2004	eLearn Magazine	10.1145/998337.998345	usability;usability engineering	HCI	-64.60514308582404	-46.88297805368171	173187

To support the development of individual competency in visualization processing, it is important to ascertain if we can track users’ progress or difficulties they might have while working with a given visualization. In this paper, we extend previous work on predicting in real time a user’s learning curve—a mathematical model that can represent a user’s skill acquisition ability—when working with a visualization. First, we investigate whether results we previously obtained in predicting users’ learning curves during visualization processing generalize to a different visualization. Second, we study to what extent we can make predictions on a user’s learning curve without information on the visualization being used. Our models leverage various data sources, including a user’s gaze behavior, pupil dilation, and cognitive abilities. We show that these models outperform a baseline that leverages knowledge on user task performance so far. Our best performing model achieves good accuracies in predicting users’ learning curves even after observing users’ performance on a few tasks only. These results represent an important step toward understanding how to support users in learning a new visualization.	baseline (configuration management);cognition;dilation (morphology);information;mathematical model	Sébastien Lallé;Cristina Conati;Giuseppe Carenini	2016	User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction	10.1007/s11257-016-9179-5	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-71.4517177560036	-45.663578256942	173369

Fully useful records of learning behaviors must contain their expended time and corresponding contents. Therefore, the LBPN extends the colored tokens of colored Petri nets to identify learners and learning contents, and raises the time variable to represent diverse learning times for individual learners. To verify the viability of the LBPN, this paper also proposes a LBPN-based learning behavioral model to simulate a situation in which many learners participate in an e-learning course, and then to generate their behavioral patterns. The experimental results illustrated in this paper confirm that (1) the generated behavioral pattern based on the LBPN-based model is very close to actual data, (2) the time and cost spent to verify the effectiveness of an ITS is substantially reduced, (3) adequate testing data for estimating the performance and accuracy of an ITS is easily acquired, and (4) the LBPN-based model can be built to recommend appropriate learning contents and to accomplish adaptive learning. 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The sailing knowledge of the subjects was tested before they started to learn with the hypermedia program (pre-test), immediately after (acquisition) and four days after the learning session(retention). Each test was made up of two parts: – a multiple-choice test (33 questions; MC-test) and a test under time pressure (TP-test), where the subjects saw 19 dynamic situations and had to decide within 5 seconds whether or not one of the two boats had to get out of the way.	experience;hypermedia;race condition;test case	Ulrike Rockmann;Stefan Thielke;Miriam Seyda	2002	Int.

The study context was a second-year undergraduate course in psychology for social work in which the teacher had designed discussion tasks to begin in F2F mode and to continue online. A combination of open-ended questionnaires and semi-structured interviews was used to investigate students’ conceptions of what they were learning, their intentions and their approaches to learning through discussion. Analysis of the interview and open-ended questionnaire data identified a number of qualitatively different conceptions, intentions and approaches to learning through discussion. Associations were found between what students thought they were learning through discussions, their approaches to learning through discussion and their course grade. Students with a cohesive conception and students adopting a deep approach (to learning through online discussion) got better course grades. There was no significant difference between deep and surface approaches to F2F discussion and course grade. The outcomes of this study have implications for the design of online and F2F discussion tasks and in particular for helping students adopt richer conceptions of what they stand to gain through discussion.	experience;nonlinear gameplay;semiconductor industry	Robert A.

Moreover, combining narration with the visual presence of an animated pedagogical agent may also encourage students to process information deeper than narration or on-screen text alone. The current study was designed to evaluate three effects among students learning about the human cardiovascular system: the modality effect (narration vs. on-screen text), the embodied agent effect (narration+agent vs. on-screen text), and the image effect (narration+agent vs. narration). The results of this study document large and significant embodied agent and image effects on the posttest (particularly retention items) but surprisingly no modality effect was found. Overall, the results suggest that incorporating an animated pedagogical agent - programmed to coordinate narration with gaze and pointing - into a science-focused multimedia learning environment can foster learning.

A discussion forum consisting of 281 posts on an online collaborative learning environment was investigated. A text-mining tool was used to discover keywords from the discourse, and through social network analysis based on these keywords, a significant presence of relevant and promising ideas within discourse was revealed. However, uncovering the key ideas alone is insufficient to clearly explain students' level of understanding regarding the discussed topics. A more thorough analysis was thus performed by using temporal analytics with step-wise discourse analysis to trace the ideas and determine their impact on communal discourse. The results indicated that most ideas within the discourse could be traced to the origin of a set of improvable ideas, which impacted and also increased the community's level of interest in sharing and discussing ideas through discourse.	social network analysis;text mining	Vwen Yen Lee;Seng Chee Tan	2017		10.1145/3027385.3027386	humanities;social science;political science;multimedia	NLP	-73.03427485845893	-41.530240133799865	173586

In both experiments, a statistical interaction of spatial ability and type of visualization was obtained: Low-spatial ability students showed poor learning outcome when learning from pictures while high-spatial students did not; when learning from animation, however, learning outcome was independent from spatial ability. The results are in line with an ability-as-compensator hypothesis which states that constructing mental animations from non-dynamic materials needs spatial ability; with animated learning materials, however, spatial ability is not required. No overall differences between static pictures and animation were found.		Tim N.

The use of technology not only increases the effectiveness of personal computer as an educational tool, it also helps in engaging a learner. In this paper we attempt to create a computerized version of the popular beer program albeit with the use of 3D animation using an off-shelf simulation tool namely Flexsim TM Simulation System. The approach has expanded the usage of an industrial simulation tool from just a simulation and modelling tool to be used as a platform for interactive game development for educational purpose. With the built-in feature in 3D graphic animation it also shorten the time required to develop the game model.	simulation	David Chan;Poey Ching Neo	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-45037-2_36	simulation;computer science;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-67.6564446741752	-42.50865193519627	173780

The single-player design involves a player and an AIML chat bot in a 2D web-based virtual environment. Building on this, a group reflection tool was designed, which is supposed be used in a training center environment. It features a dashboard design which includes different visualizations of player performance based on automated individual analyses of players’ communicative behavior, as well as enriched replays of their conversations, and the ability to make annotations. The separation of the application into the actual role-playing game and the group reflection tool is assumed to support the learning process of responding to customer complaints by changing perspective, receiving feedback, and recognizing different ways of problem solving.

To fulfill this objective, we defined five research questions and conducted a literature survey based on snowballing technique. To gather the studies in our survey, we defined a start set of works to serve as ground for the review and performed searches using references and citations of these studies. We found a set of accessibility evaluation methods focused on game accessibility and how they can be classified according to ISO standards. We also found that methods focused on mobile game context still need to be better explored because only a few evidences were retrieved regarding such a domain. Besides traditional accessibility aspects as barriers and users’ satisfaction, results show that distinct game aspects are considered during game accessibility evaluations. In addition, the most part of works refers to evaluation of exergames or games related to users’ mobility. Studies also refer to evaluations regarding more than one category of impairment, especially motor and visual impairments. Future researches in the field should focus on inspection-based methods, because traditional user-based methods have been largely referred as applicable to game accessibility context.	game accessibility	Renata Pontin de Mattos Fortes;André de Lima Salgado;Flávia de Souza Santos;Leandro Agostini do Amaral;Elias Adriano Nogueira da Silva	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-58706-6_15	usability;management science;computer science	HCI	-64.59631603763938	-45.5305753713437	174022

They offer unique opportunities for Learning Analytics (LA) by facilitating multi-user sensemaking of automatically captured digital footprints of students' f2f interactions. This paper presents an analysis of current research exploring learning analytics associated with the use of surface devices. We use a framework to analyse our first-hand experiences, and the small number of related deployments according to four dimensions: the orchestration aspects involved; the phases of the pedagogical practice that are supported; the target actors; and the levels of iteration of the LA process. The contribution of the paper is twofold: 1) a synthesis of conclusions that identify the degree of maturity, challenges and pedagogical opportunities of the existing applications of learning analytics and interactive surfaces; and 2) an analysis framework that can be used to characterise the design space of similar areas and LA applications.	capability maturity model;digital footprint;interaction;iteration;multi-user;sensemaking	Roberto Martínez Maldonado;Bertrand Schneider;Sven Charleer;Simon Buckingham Shum;Joris Klerkx;Erik Duval	2016		10.1145/2883851.2883873	analytics;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-63.896727072369515	-38.4490357694449	174175

However, prior research has not addressed how such users react to the unique challenges represented by interactive medical forms on health sites, such as interactive health quizzes, questionnaires, and registration forms. The goal of this four-month study was twofold: 1) to identify reading, writing, and navigational strategies of users with lower literacy skills when interacting with web-based forms in a medical context; 2) to develop design principles for making such web-based medical forms usable and accessible for lower-literacy adults. Eyetracking was used to gather data about how users interacted with a variety of web-based forms. Analysis of sessions with 26 low-literacy users (REALM score < 60) identified a variety of challenges users faced in completing forms. Based on these observations, proposed principles of effective form design were developed. Revised prototype forms were designed in accordance with these principles and iteratively tested with 14 users to verify improved usability.

To bridge the gap between theory and application, representations need to satisfy requirements for broad scope, a unified theoretical basis, and abstraction. Interacting Cognitive Subsystems (ICS) is proposed as a unified cognitive theory that can be used as the basis for such representations, and two approaches based upon the theory are described. One entails the description of Cognitive Task Models, which are a relatively complete representation of the cognitive activity required of a user in the course of an interaction. The other entails the production of less complete diagrammatic notations that are intended to provide support in small scale problem identification and resolution, and which can be applied across tasks, visual interface and sound interface issues, and can handle static and dynamic situations. While the former can be implemented in a production-rule expert system (ICSpert) and so does not require detailed modelling knowledge on the part of the analyst, the latter is a pencil and paper technique that does require theoretical knowledge, but which is intended to facilitate the acquisition of such knowledge in the interest of educating its users about the human aspects of HCI. The representations differ in the knowledge required for their use, in the support that they offer, and in the situations for which they are appropriate. They have been used to represent problems from experimental situations, core HCI scenarios, and ‘real world’ design projects. They share breadth of scope and abstraction, and their parent theory supports transfer of knowledge across domains of application and from older to newer technologies, and supports feedback between the domain of application and the domain of theory.

However, empirical research about learning paths is scarce. Previous studies showed that the low adoption of learning paths can be linked to the lack of knowledge on the part of teachers about learning path design and its implementation. In the present study, which was undertaken in the context of a biology course in secondary education, 496 14to 15-years old secondary school students in Flanders were assigned to either learning path based or conventional instruction during classroom activities. The aim was to analyze the differential impact of the instructional formats on learning outcomes, considering variations in group setting and group composition. Given the focus on science learning, gender was also considered. Multilevel analysis was applied, and the results show empirical evidence for superior performance for both boys and girls in the learning path condition as compared with that in the conventional condition. In addition, when girls collaborate, they perform best within same-sex groups, whereas boys achieve better results in mixed-gender groups. The implications of the findings are important for tackling the gender gap in science learning. The findings can lead to guidelines for teachers who want to implement learning paths within an optimal learning environment design. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

d8753803db039efc88b995377984eea5cd58cf31	gamify your teaching - using location-based games for educational purposes		Gamification has become a hot topic for today’s educators. Many tools and methods have been developed and students have got used to Foursquare or Barcoo. This paper introduces an easy and cost-effective method that educators can use to develop custom-made Scavenger Hunts which meet the needs and expectations of their various fields. In fact, the method can be used for multiple purposes, topics and audiences: elementary school children can be addressed as well as adult workers. The only devices needed to deploy the method are a QR-code-scanning device (such as a smartphone) and a GPS device. It must also be considered that almost 50 per cent of the U.S. population owns a smartphone. As a consequence our method – called “QuizeRo” – can be considered easy to use. It is also expected to make teaching more fun. The paper will offer a toolkit for individual use and a howto guide based on the presenter’s own research and experience. A best practice case will also be presented to illustrate the impact on education. Moreover the paper will address advantages of learning in a playful setting and will outline further steps to quantify the outcome of this specific method.	best practice;effective method;gamification;global positioning system;qr code;smartphone	Kai Erenli	2013	iJAC		simulation;human–computer interaction;multimedia	HCI	-64.57597353393226	-43.55647496502252	174684

We constructed the system for improving speaking proficiency based on Web-Speech API. Usually, text-to-speech is available on the net or by using TTS applications in education. However, these sounds produced are not generally customized to the diversity of learners' learning strategies. The system constructed in the study makes it possible for learners to choose the words, phrases sentences or the passage they like to listen to for their speaking practice. Major findings that came out from this study are: (i) As to the easier materials, accuracy improvement was observed regardless of their proficiency, (ii) On the contrary, as to the difficult materials, such an improvement was not observed in the experiment, and (iii) there is diversity of how they worked on the system, and there are some patterns in their learning behaviors, Bottom-uppers and Top-downers. These findings suggest the usefulness of the current system for various types of learners in terms of learning strategies and a future possibility from a learning analytic point of view to modify the system.	application programming interface;enlightenment foundation libraries;microsoft speech api;speech synthesis;speech technology	Fu Suro;Yuichi Ono	2016	2016 5th IIAI International Congress on Advanced Applied Informatics (IIAI-AAI)	10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2016.193	natural language processing;speech recognition;computer science;linguistics	HCI	-70.595407487513	-45.02719767689041	174699

However, the use of mobile technology has not been extensively explored in the context of collaborative learning. New projection and display technologies for mobile devices raise the important question of whether to use single or multiple displays in these environments. In this paper, we explore two mobile-based techniques for using co-located collaborative game-play to supplement ESL (English as a Second Language) education in a developing region: (1) Mobile Single Display Groupware: a pico-projector connected to a cell phone, with a handheld controller for each child to interact, and (2) Mobile Multiple Display Groupware: a phone for each child. We explore the types of interaction that occur in both of these conditions and the impact on learning outcomes.	collaborative software;dvd region code;display device;handheld game console;handheld projector;microsoft lumia;mobile device;mobile phone;video projector	Mohit Jain;Jeremy P.

They have difficulty visualizing a chemical equation (e.g., 2H2+O2→2H2O) as a chemical reaction that involves atom rearrangement and bond breaking and formation (Krajcik, 1991). As a result, they cannot form deep understanding of chemical concepts by linking ideas at the molecular, symbolic, and observable levels. Dynamic visualizations have potential to meet this challenge by demonstrating changes at the molecular level. Nevertheless, many visualizations are confusing (Tversky, Morrison, & Betrancourt, 2002), and often students are beguiled by their deceptive clarity (Chiu & Linn, in press). They need support to add ideas at the molecular level and connect with ideas at other levels. My previous research (Zhang & Linn, 2008) has suggested that creating drawings is an effective approach to promote student learning. Yet it requires more instructional time and may not be efficient. Critique may be another candidate to effectively support students' learning. In this study we explore this two ways.		Helen Z.

c5e2596ade1949affa9c025217a6b232120996e3	understanding student collaboration in interdisciplinary computing activities		Many students are introduced to computing through its infusion into other school subjects. Advocates argue this approach can deepen learning and broaden who is exposed to computing. In many cases, such interdisciplinary activities are student-driven and collaborative. This requires students to balance multiple learning goals and leverage knowledge across subjects. When working in groups, students must also negotiate this balance with peers based on their collective expertise. Balance and negotiation, however, are not always easy. This paper presents data from a project to infuse computing into high school statistics using the R programming language. We analyze multiple episodes of video data from two pairs of students as they negotiated (1) the statistics and computing goals of an activity, (2) the knowledge needed to meet those goals, and (3) whose expertise can help achieve those goals. One pair consistently reached agreement along these dimensions, and engaged productively with both subject matter and computing.

We show that this detector predicts transfer better than Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, a measure of student learning in intelligent tutors that has been shown to predict performance on paper posttests of the same skills studied in the intelligent tutor. We also find that this detector only needs limited amounts of student data (the first 20% of a student’s data from a tutor lesson) in order to reach near-asymptotic predictive power.

Set within an educational design research approach and building on cognitive apprenticeship and socio cultures cognition theories, we have collected empirical, mainly qualitative observational data focusing on studentsu0027 activities with Coq in an introductory course specifically created for that matter. Our results strengthen the assumption that a theorem prover like Coq, indeed, can be beneficial in mediating undergraduate studentsu0027 activities in learning formal proofing. In comparison to pen u0026 paper proofs, students were profiting strongly from the systemu0027s immediate feedback and scaffolding. These results encourage the idea to extend the scientifically dominated use of theorem provers like Coq to pedagogical use cases in undergraduate CS education.	automated theorem proving;cognition;computer science;coq (software);proof assistant;theory of computation	Maria Knobelsdorf;Christiane Frede;Sebastian Böhne;Christoph Kreitz	2017		10.1145/3105726.3106184	applied mathematics;knowledge management;computer science;automated theorem proving;mathematical proof;theoretical computer science;theory of computation;qualitative research;cognition;use case;proof assistant;cognitive apprenticeship	AI	-72.18416610363512	-39.35432472906367	175840

It can be conceived as comprising two complementary concepts, that is, usability and user experience, which accounts for the employment of more user-centred evaluations. Nevertheless, in the context of Web 2.0 applications, this topic has still not attracted sufficient attention from the HCI community. This paper addresses the quality in use of Web 2.0 applications on the case of mind mapping services. The evaluation methodology brings together three complementary methods. The estimated quality in use is measured by means of the logging actual use method, while the perceived quality in use is evaluated by means of the retrospective thinking aloud (RTA) method and a questionnaire. The contribution of our work is twofold. Firstly, we provide empirical evidence that the proposed methodology in conjunction with the model, set of attributes, and measuring instruments is appropriate for evaluating quality in use of Web 2.0 applications. Secondly, the analysis of qualitative data reveals that performance and effort based attributes considerably contribute to mind mapping services success.	human–computer interaction;mind map;partial concurrent thinking aloud;usability;user experience;web 2.0	Tihomir Orehovacki;Andrina Granic;Dragutin Kermek	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27997-3_26	web modeling;computer science;knowledge management;data mining;web engineering;web 2.0;world wide web	Web+IR	-64.62651738498298	-46.89775960261513	175856

As Web 2.0 is becoming an important and central topic in our information world, the research reported here explores whether LIS students are familiar with technological changes and innovations, and whether they make use of the different Web 2.0 applications. The research examined whether personality characteristics (learning strategies, resistance to change and cognitive appraisal), as well as learning facilitators such as motivation, capacity and importance of studying and integrating different applications of Web 2.0 in the future, influenced LIS students' perceptions towards Web 2.0 use. Different questionnaires were distributed to 160 randomly selected Israeli students from three different LIS programmes. The research revealed a moderate tendency of LIS students to use Web 2.0 applications. It was found that personality characteristics as well as learning facilitators influenced LIS students' perceptions towards Web 2.0 use.	web 2.0	Noa Aharony	2009	JOLIS	10.1177/0961000609345088	psychology;library science;questionnaire;social science;simulation;information science;computer science;knowledge management;sociology;management;social psychology;world wide web;statistics	Web+IR	-75.72107706608291	-39.211584286885774	175957

The game consists in choosing 3 numbers out of 6, whose sum is a given target number. The robot moves on a game board have been implemented to provide pupils with a tangible feedback about their answer. We have studied strategies of pupils to solve the problem and their evolution. Our methodology included interviews, aloud verbalization and video observations of 28 pupils in grade 1 and 2 while they are playing. The pursuit of a mastery goal encourages a trial and error strategy for only some of the pupils. We conclude that some aspects of the moves of the robot, like its position, are perceived as a form of help and not as a threat, even if they are only partially understood.

We use log files and questionnaire data from 116 participants who interacted with MetaTutor, an advanced multi-agent learning environment that helps learners to develop their self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, in 3 conditions: one without adaptive prompting (NP), one with fading prompts based on learners’ deployment SRL processes (FP), and one where prompts can also increase if learners fail to deploy SRL processes adequately (FQP). Results indicated that an initially more frequent but progressively fading prompting strategy is beneficial to learners’ deployment of SRL processes once the scaffolding is faded, and has no negative impact on learners’ perception of the system’s usefulness. We also found that increasing the frequency of prompting was not sufficient to have a positive impact on the use of SRL processes, when compared to FP. These results provide insights on parameters relevant to prompting adaptation strategies to ensure transfer of metacognitive skills beyond the learning session.	data logger;multi-agent system;pedagogical agent;software deployment	François Bouchet;Jason M.

3de6bde79ab8095e3cd5d3a61835ef56f793c168	neural educational recommendation engine (nere)		Quizlet is the most popular online learning tool in the United States, and is used by over 2/3 of high school students, and 1/2 of college students. With more than 95% of Quizlet users reporting improved grades as a result, the platform has become the de-facto tool used in millions of classrooms. In this paper, we explore the task of recommending suitable content for a student to study, given their prior interests, as well as what their peers are studying. We propose a novel approach, i.e. Neural Educational Recommendation Engine (NERE), to recommend educational content by leveraging student behaviors rather than ratings. We have found that this approach better captures social factors that are more aligned with learning. NERE is based on a recurrent neural network that includes collaborative and content-based approaches for recommendation, and takes into account any particular studentu0027s speed, mastery, and experience to recommend the appropriate task. We train NERE by jointly learning the user embeddings and content embeddings, and attempt to predict the content embedding for the final timestamp. We also develop a confidence estimator for our neural network, which is a crucial requirement for productionizing this model. We apply NERE to Quizletu0027s proprietary dataset, and present our results. We achieved an R^2 score of 0.81 in the content embedding space, and a recall score of 54% on our 100 nearest neighbors. This vastly exceeds the recall@100 score of 12% that a standard matrix-factorization approach provides. We conclude with a discussion on how NERE will be deployed, and position our work as one of the first educational recommender systems for the K-12 space.	artificial neural network;recommender system;recurrent neural network	Moin Nadeem;Dustin Stansbury;Shane Mooney	2018	CoRR		machine learning;recommender system;information retrieval;task analysis;timestamp;sparse matrix;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;metadata;computer science;recurrent neural network;embedding	ML	-75.61818339006766	-50.79368162706248	176297
dc88b8ea92abbe7fac059e6caf2260e7798ebb8a	predicting students’ decisions in a training simulation: a novel application of trueskill		Can TrueSkill predict student choices in graph-based training scenarios? We examine this question using data collected from students who engaged with a dozen branching scenarios using a browser-based training application. Students played through the graph-based scenarios to learn effective interaction skills in unfamiliar situations, during which their performance was measured against predefined learning objectives. Branching points in the scenario graph were annotated by experts as correct or incorrect with respect to one or more learning objectives. The application allowed students to re-run scenarios and presented tutoring information to guide learning. In this paper, we model student performance by giving each student multiple skill ratings, one for each learning objective. Unlike most applications of TrueSkill, students never play directly against each other; instead, each time the student makes a decision at a branch in the scenario graph, we treat this action as if the student played a game with the skill rating of the decision point. Using this model, we are able to predict student choices to a high degree of accuracy. Additionally, we show that training using the browser-based application results in a significant increase in average student skill rating for a subset of the learning objectives.	choice behavior;graph - visual representation;learning disorders;simulation;subgroup;web application	Christopher Kawatsu;Robert Hubal;Robert P.

cf7898ab68cea3df36431bbc7bcf3358ca757f48	the meeting of gestalt and cognitive load theories in instructional screen design	cognitive load theory	Without doubt Gestalt Theory has formed an important basis for many aspects of educational visual screen design. Despite the familiarity many computer screen designers claim with it, Gestalt Theory is not a single small set of visual principles uniformly applied to by all designers. In fact, it appears that instructional visual design literature often deals with only a small set of Gestalt laws. Recently Gestalt literature was consulted to distil the most relevant Gestalt laws for educational visual screen design, resulting in eleven laws being identified. In this paper these laws are discussed in terms of the Cognitive Load Theory, (CLT), which has been used with considerable success to improve instructional design. The usefulness of the combined perspectives drawn from the Gestalt Theory and CLT for educational visual screen design were applied to the redesign of an instructional multimedia application, WoundCare, designed to teach nursing students wound management. The evaluation results were encouraging. Both the new design and the value of applying the eleven Gestalt laws and CLT principles to improve learning were strongly supported. However, many aspects of applying this combination of theories to educational interface design remain unclear and this forms a useful direction for future research.	computer monitor;embodied cognition;gestalt psychology;theory	Dempsey Chang;Juhani Tuovinen	2004			computer science;cognitive load;cognitive science	HCI	-65.15521265001362	-45.12301425239035	176754

Our innovative NSF-funded IC2Think project blends computational thinking with creative thinking so that students leverage their creative thinking skills to “unlock” their understanding of computational thinking. In Fall 2012, we deployed creative exercises designed to engage Epstein's creative competencies (Surrounding, Capturing, Challenging and Broadening) in introductory level CS courses targeting four different groups (CS, engineering, combined CS/physical sciences, and humanities majors). Students combined hands-on problem solving with guided analysis and reflection to connect their creative activities to CS topics such as conditionals and arrays and to real-world CS applications. Evaluation results (approximately 150 students) found that creative thinking exercise completion had a linear “dosage” effect. As students completed more exercises [0/1 - 4], they increased their long-term retention [a computational thinking test], F(3, 98) = 4.76, p =.004, partial Eta2 = .127 and course grades, F(3, 109) = 4.32, p =.006, partial Eta2 = .106. These findings support our belief that the addition of creative thinking exercises to CSCE courses improves the learning of computational knowledge and skills.	array data structure;computation;computational thinking;computer science;hands-on computing;ibm notes;problem solving;unlockable game	Lee Dee Miller;Leen-Kiat Soh;Vlad Chiriacescu;Elizabeth Ingraham;Duane F.

This approach is divided into four parts: First we will define the criterions to be used in the evaluation of the quality of software products. After these criterions have been chosen, an approach will be developed to classify them by their level of importance related to a selected area of application. The level of importance of a usability criterion will vary depending on the area of application. As a next step, a second approach will be introduced to classify usability criterions by the quality level presented by a certain software product utilized in a selected area. This classification is based on the users’ opinion about the quality level a certain usability criterion related to the above software product would have. Finally a third and final approach will be set up to evaluate the usability of software products according to users’ judgment. It combines the first method with the second method in such a way as to define a usability factor that will be used to evaluate the quality of the selected software product. This proposed methodology can be applied to a finished software product to evaluate its usability according to users’ judgment, and can be also applied during the development of the product to ensure it will have the desired usability attributes. In a future work, we will show an application of this methodology in the evaluation of the usability of software	usability	Simone Vasconçelos Silva;Daniel I.

Collaborative learning networks emphasize the distributed nature of learning and community-based sharing of knowledge, where people connect and collectively contribute knowledge to a learning community. However, the value realized through collaborative learning depends on social interaction processes that take place among members of a learning network. The aim of this paper is to present our ongoing research on social interaction processes, their determinants, and their effects on individual and group learning performance. We investigate the role of different social interaction processes in collaborative learning networks, where students’ learning is derived from (instead of with) the learning community. As a result, we aim to offer theoretical insights into how collaborative learning networks enhance the learning outcomes of both the individual and group.	information systems;interdependence	Christian Sorgenfrei;Stefan Smolnik	2014			social learning;team learning;knowledge management;cooperative learning;social relation;management science;collaborative learning;computer science	AI	-72.8995146633447	-40.87960583373906	177474

However, student satisfaction and perceived effectiveness of blended learning courses are linked to their previous learning experience, personal preferences and other student and teacher variables. This study examines student satisfaction and perceived effectiveness of a blended learning course and key factors related their satisfaction and perceived effectiveness in a Belgian university. In total 117 students enrolled for this course participated in an online survey and a random sample of 22 students participated in the interviews. The results indicate that student background and situational variables (international or local students, full-time or part-time students) perceived the effectiveness of the blended learning course differently. Part-time students had a higher perception of the effectiveness of the blended learning course. International students were more in favour of the blended learning mode than local students...

Digitala skollyftet aimed to raise the digital competence amongst teachers in Swedish schools. The participants in Digitala skollyftet could apply to be awarded a badge for their participation. The awarding process, as well as the participation, of a small group of people who were awarded badges is analysed. Blog-posts were taken as evidence when applying for badges and blogging thereby became an important way to participate. Blogs can be regarded as exhibition spaces where the blogger exhibits and reflects on their learning process. Results show that there is a difference in how the blogs are designed, depending on the level of experience from the blogger. To a large extent, forums, such as Facebook and Twitter, are used as performance spaces, which facilitate the interaction and discussion with other participants.

fdae50d9255e7aa223da79486f0f67cda68e2ce1	a longitudinal study of information exchange in computer-mediated and face-to-face groups		Recent research has suggested that groups do not exchange information effectively. This is particularly true of groups using computer-mediated communication systems (CMCS). However, generalizing the findings of these studies to real groups is difficult because they used ad hoc groups and/or the groups did not have experience with the CMCS and were working on novel tasks. In this study face-to-face groups and groups using two types of CMCS completed three information exchange tasks. Information exchange performance and relational links were collected for each task. The results suggest that CMCS groups are not able to exchange information as effectively as face-to-face groups, even as they become familiar with the task and CMCS. In addition, although relational links were slightly related to information exchange performance, they were not as important as communication mode in explaining differences in information exchange performance.	information exchange	Ross Hightower;Lutfus Sayeed;Merrill Warkentin	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-48137-1_6	communications system;information sharing;information exchange;longitudinal study;distributed computing;computer-mediated communication;business	HCI	-72.01954316238093	-42.88812852715753	178278

Two sets of in-depth interviews and field observations were designed and carried out at a US university with twenty busy knowledge workers. The preliminary study results indicate that users who used a mixture of mobile and desktop calendar tools reported much higher perceived satisfaction and effectiveness than those who relied on single electronic tools or paper calendars. Furthermore, a number of usability issues are identified and used to propose new features, which can be beneficial to the design of more intelligent electronic calendar systems. Thus, this research not only attempts to understand the current technology-based time management strategies, but to apply this understanding to the development and testing of better calendar tools to more effectively support users' time management tasks.

Accordingly, a number of these guidelines for single-tabletop settings need to be extended to take account of both the distinctive qualities of the classroom and the particular challenges of having various groups using the same application on multiple tables simultaneously. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the effectiveness of designs for small-group multi-tabletop collaborative learning activities in the wild. We use distributed cognition as a framework to analyze the small number of authentic multi-tabletop deployments and help characterize the technological and educational ecology of these classroom settings. Based on previous research on single-tabletop collaboration, the concept of orchestration, and both first-hand experience and second-hand accounts of the few existing multiple-tabletop deployments to date, we develop a three-dimensional framework of design recommendations for multi-tabletop learning settings.	distributed cognition;ecology	Ahmed Kharrufa;Roberto Martínez Maldonado;Judy Kay;Patrick Olivier	2013		10.1145/2512349.2512816	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-65.24957229887976	-38.57101611874673	178525

The evaluation looked at travel plans generated, search interaction logs, task perceptions, and dialogues between members. The results suggest that explicit division of roles can have significant effect son a group’s knowledge building during the collaborative search task. The paper also discusses experimental designs of task-based collaborative search studies.	collaborative information seeking;design of experiments;information seeking behavior;usability testing	Marika Imazu;Shin-ichi Nakayama;Hideo Joho	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-25631-8_19	simulation;task analysis;world wide web	HCI	-70.67154222184175	-48.33374426240247	178602

Members of organizations use different types of media to communicate information and to make decisions. In this paper, we completed an initial study that looked at how the type of media, specifically the level of synchronicity supported by the media, influenced individuals’ job satisfaction. We used two different levels of media synchronicity represented by two systems, virtual worlds and email. We predicted that individuals perceive greater job satisfaction when they use media higher in media synchronicity. We also predicted that presence and social presence would play a role this relationship. In a study consisting of 56 participants, we used vignettes to manipulate perceptions of using one of the two systems. We found support for our main hypothesis that when there is higher media synchronicity, individuals perceive greater job satisfaction.	email;expect;job stream;social presence theory;synchronicity;virtual world	Martin Hassell;Moez Limayem	2010			knowledge management;job attitude;computer science;synchronicity;social psychology;metaverse;job satisfaction	HCI	-63.951353626664385	-41.50168959146133	178793

f1cfba8dc007e5fc5f5b64ae5f1a3a18a8aabe3f	effective task training strategies for instructional robots		From teaching in labs to training for assembly, a key role that robots are expected to play is to instruct their users in completing physical tasks. While task instruction requires a wide range of capabilities, such as effective use of verbal and nonverbal language, a fundamental requirement for an instructional robot is to provide its students with task instructions in a way that maximizes their understanding of and performance in the task. In this paper, we present an autonomous instructional robot system and investigate how different instructional strategies affect user performance and experience. We collected data on human instructor-trainee interactions in a pipe-assembly task. Our analysis identified two key instructional strategies: (1) grouping instructions together and (2) summarizing the outcome of subsequent instructions. We implemented these strategies into a humanlike robot that autonomously instructed its users in the same pipe-assembly task. To achieve autonomous instruction, we also developed a repair mechanism that enabled the robot to correct mistakes and misunderstandings. An evaluation of the instructional strategies in a human-robot interaction study showed that employing the grouping strategy resulted in faster task completion and increased rapport with the robot, although it also increased the number of task breakdowns. Our model of instructional strategies and study findings offer strong implications for the design of instructional robots.	autonomous robot;human–robot interaction;xslt/muenchian grouping	Allison Sauppé;Bilge Mutlu	2014		10.15607/RSS.2014.X.002	simulation;knowledge management;multimedia	Robotics	-70.44380962208584	-47.41160635171243	178907

Previous research suggests that adaptive e-learning systems can effectively address such individual differences and, consequently, they enable more directed tutoring via computer-assisted instruction. In this paper, we explore this assertion, reflecting on the outcomes of two successive experiments that were performed to empirically demonstrate that learners’ personality traits might be significant in understanding differences in learning outcomes from using e-learning systems. One hundred and forty-five participants from Computer Science participated in this study. A two-by-two between-subjects factorial study was designed, where the personality traits derived from Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, and the two computerbased learning systems (adaptive vs. non-adaptive) are independent variables. The results suggested that the personality trait that could be indicative of preferred learning styles; in particular extraverted/introverted personal traits significantly influenced learning activity on adaptive e-learning system. A design guideline might be implicative of how the e-learning system suits the learner’s personality trait.	aqua teen hunger force zombie ninja pro-am;assertion (software development);computer science;experiment;systems design	Amal Al-Dujaily;Jieun Kim;Hokyoung Ryu	2013	Educational Technology & Society		differential psychology;psychology;simulation;developmental psychology;cognitive style;human factors and ergonomics;teaching method;personality;big five personality traits;social psychology;pedagogy	HCI	-74.08990517601238	-44.628184154789544	179120

Therefore web application design plays an important role as users will be accessing the applications to obtain information. This results in guidelines establishment to assist in web application design. Malaysian government had emphasized the importance of such guideline and highlighted the importance of web rating. The star ratings were given to the sites that fulfilled certain criteria based on the guideline. However despite of having the guideline, most Malaysian web portals failed to achieve one important aspect which is the acceptable page loading time. This leads to user's frustration as the page loading time exceeds their expectation. Based on literature analysis it was discovered that satisfying standard page loading time to attract user's interest is three seconds. As such failing to load within three seconds will cause frustration among users when they access the web page. This particular issue needs to be addressed as it may result in web abandonment if it's not resolved immediately. Hence work conducted will look at web page loading time and focused on government web portals that were given 5 stars rating using free online tools. The tools (WebSiteOptimization, WebPageTest and Pingdom Tools) used suggest possible causes of latency and what is lacked in related web portals in terms of page loading time performance. Result obtained were analyzed and grouped into main issues that contributed to slower page loading time. Solutions are proposed based on issues identified. Initial findings attained uncovered that web application design guideline had failed to include customers' values. Therefore the second phase of work conducted had emphasized on customers values, focusing on value co-creation. Based on the values identified and issues discovered, new features which emphasized loading time aspects will be established through a web portal prototype. To further prove the established enhance guideline, Malaysian Examination Syndicate web portal is used as a case study. Results derived proved that the prototype developed differs from current web portal as it is developed to minimize page loading time in mind, and include users' co-creation values and simultaneously fulfilling necessary criteria established in the guideline. This highlights the uniqueness of the work compared to previous approach used in designing web applications.	failure;internet;portals;prototype;syndicate;venue (sound system);web application;web page	Padli Saed;Yazrina Yahya	2011	Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021664	web design;computer science;engineering;operating system;database;multimedia;world wide web;government;satisfiability	Web+IR	-64.77243754042946	-50.886643383190055	179244
f20d04f3857ed8738ff0dad7e6926ffb2991e5fb	the gameplay enjoyment model	serious games;video games;individual differences;game design;enjoyment	To date, reviews of the games literature have noted a lack of empirical studies examining the relationships between games and their purported benefits (Huizenga, Admiraal, & Dam, 2011; Vandercruysse, Vanderwaetere, & Clarebout, 2012; Young et al., 2012). Furthermore, researchers have called for a better understanding of the specific game features that may lead to beneficial outcomes (Hartmann & Klimmt, 2006; Klimmt, Schmid, & Orthmann, 2009; McNamara, Jackson, & Graesser, 2010; Vorderer, Bryant, Pieper, & Weber, 2006; Wilson et al., 2009). In this survey study, a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was employed to better understand the specific features that influence player enjoyment of video games. The resulting Gameplay Enjoyment Model (GEM) explains players’ overall Enjoyment of games, as well as their preferences for six specific types of enjoyment, including Challenge, Companionship, Competition, Exploration, Fantasy, and Fidelity. The implications of these model components are discussed in the context of educational game design and future directions for research are offered. GEM provides an empirical framework within which vital progress can be made in understanding the enjoyment of games and the role that games play in education.

McNamara, Jackson, Graesser, & Baek (2010) called for research on which game features are most important to the motivational and learning benefits of games. Most recently, Vandercruysse et al. (2012) and Young et al. (2012) cited a lack of specificity, abundant overgeneralization, and insufficient consideration of individual differences as hampering empirical progress towards understanding the learning effects associated with educational games. From these recommendations, there is a clear need to identify the specific game features that influence player perception and hold potential benefits for educational gaming. A few prior studies have shown positive relationships between educational games and learning performance. In a series of three studies, undergraduate business, economics, and management students who played educational games as a part of their respective courses showed statistically significantly higher test scores than students who did not play the games (Blunt, 2007). Likewise, pre-post academic performance increases have been demonstrated in K-12 social studies using an off-the-shelf commercial game (Foster, 2011) and in undergraduate history education using a modified commercial game (Moshirnia & Israel, 2010). Similarly, the use of games has lead to pre-post learning gains in K-12 math education (Cordova & Lepper, 1996; Ke & Grabowski, 2007; Parker & Lepper, 1992). So too have learning performance improvements been demonstrated through the use of science games at the K-12 (Clark et al., 2011) and undergraduate levels (Barab et al., 2009). Although empirical research investigating the relationships between games, enjoyment, and learning, is limited, promising evidence from related fields suggests that these relationships warrant further exploration. In the field of information systems, enjoyment has shown several positive benefits for the adoption of internet and computer systems. Enjoyment has been associated with increased perceptions of usability (Venkatesh, 2000; Venkatesh, Speier, & Morris, 2002; Yi & Hwang, 2003) and usefulness (Mitchell, Chen, & Macredie, 2005; Venkatesh, et al., 2002; Yi & Hwang, 2003). In addition, users who enjoy systems have shown increased future intention to use those systems (Lee, Cheung, & Chen, 2005; Moon & Kim, 2001), as well as more positive attitudes towards them (Lee, et al., 2005; Moon & Kim, 2001; Van der Heijden, 2003). In some cases, enjoyment has even lead to higher actual use of computers and the internet (Igbaria, Parasuraman, & Baroudi, 1996; Teo, Lim, & Lai, 1999). Meanwhile, in the field of education, enjoyment has been similarly linked to beneficial outcomes. In studies of university students in online and face to face learning environments, enjoyment was associated with increases in perceived learning and transfer (Blunsdon, Reed, McNeil, & McEachern, 2003; Gomez, Wu, & Passerini, 2010; Mitchell, et al., 2005). In another study, students who enjoyed online learning reported barriers, such as lacking social interaction, instructor issues, and low personal motivation, to be substantially lower than students with neutral or negative attitudes towards online learning (Muilenburg & Berge, 2005). Moreover, in a series of studies on academic emotions, Pekrun, Goetz, Titz, & Perry (2002) found that enjoyment lead to increased perceptions of self-regulated learning and predicted high academic achievement. Although other experiences may be associated with playing games, enjoyment can be considered the primary experience derived from gameplay. Enjoyment has been characterized as the core experience of all entertainment media, including games (Ritterfeld & Weber, 2006; Vorderer, Klimmt, & Ritterfeld, 2004). In addition, the enjoyment of games has been related to several preceding media theories, including uses and gratifications (John L Sherry, Lucas, Greenberg, & Lachlan, 2006), selective exposure (Bryant & Davies, 2006), and mood management (Vorderer, et al., 2006). Further, Garris, Ahlers, & Driskell (2002, p. 453) explained that “A central characteristic of games is that they are fun and a source of enjoyment.” Since enjoyment is the primary experience derived from gameplay, and enjoyment has shown positive effects in prior learning and 66 International Journal of Gaming and Computer-Mediated Simulations, 4(4), 64-80, October-December 2012 Copyright © 2012, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited. technology research, it is worthwhile to consider how educational games can be designed to accrue similar benefits. A potentially useful tool for the creators of serious games, particularly in education, is an empirical model of the game features that lead to player enjoyment. While many taxonomies of games and players have been introduced in the past, they have tended to be theoretical in nature and/or wanting for empirical validation (see Quick, Atkinson, & Lin, 2012b for an extended discussion of game taxonomies). Preliminary empirical efforts have begun to identify the game features that influence player enjoyment (Quick & Atkinson, 2011; Quick, et al., 2012b). Exploratory analyses of survey responses from an 18-feature questionnaire have identified Challenge, Companionship, Competition, Exploration, Fantasy, and Fidelity as factors that influence player enjoyment. To date, each of these factors has been defined by two to four specific game features, such as realistic graphics or online play. Although this research has established an initial understanding of gameplay enjoyment, additional work is needed to refine, expand, and validate these findings. Overview of Present Study This survey study aims to build upon the research of Quick et al. (2012b) and transition from an exploratory approach to a confirmatory one. The instrument used by Quick et al. 2012b) is adapted and expanded to explore gameplay enjoyment and player preferences in greater detail. The purpose of this study is to establish a refined and expanded empirical model of gameplay enjoyment, the Gameplay Enjoyment Model (GEM). An examination of the literature reveals that GEM holds promising implications for the design and research of educational games. The applications of GEM to the design of educational games are discussed. In addition, the directions for future research on the benefits of educational games that are enabled by GEM are presented.

An obstacle to atscale deployment is that ITS architectures tend to be complex, not easily deployed in browsers without significant server-side processing, and not easily embedded in a learning management system (LMS). We present a case study in which a widely used ITS authoring tool suite, CTAT/TutorShop, was modified so that tutors can be embedded in MOOCs. Specifically, the inner loop (the example-tracing tutor engine) was moved to the client by reimplementing it in JavaScript, and the tutors were made compatible with the LTI e-learning standard. The feasibility of this general approach to ITS/MOOC integration was demonstrated with simple tutors in an edX MOOC “Data Analytics and Learning.”	embedded system;inner loop;javascript;massive open online course;server (computing);server-side;software deployment;edx	Vincent Aleven;Jonathan Sewall;Octav Popescu;Franceska Xhakaj;Dhruv Chand;Ryan Shaun Joazeiro de Baker;Yuan Wang;George Siemens;Carolyn Penstein Rosé;Dragan Gasevic	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-19773-9_53	the internet;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia	HCI	-68.8814986885836	-39.259399890747346	179557

Recently schools have started integrating recent technology into the educational process in order to attract students and increase their engagement in the process. This paper will demonstrate how an augmented immersive reality mobile application can work to enrich the learning environment and attract the students to learn and explore subjects such as sciences, more specifically Chemistry. Augmented immersive reality allows students to learn in their own way and pace while encouraging them to explore and be creative as their `trial-and-error' mistakes will not impose any major consequences in the virtual world. A field study was conducted on grade 11 students to verify the benefits of using the developed application in education.	augmented reality;field research;mobile app;virtual world	Lamees Mahmoud Mohd Said Al Qassem;Hessa Al Hawai;Shayma Al Shehhi;Mohamed Jamal Zemerly;Jason W.

The intelligent tutoring systems community has begun actively exploring computational models of affect, and game-based learning environments present a significant opportunity for investigating student affect in interactive learning. One family of game-based learning environments, narrative-centered learning environments, offer a particularly compelling laboratory for investigating student affect. In narrativecentered environments, learning activities play out in dynamically generated interactive narratives and training scenarios. These afford significant opportunities for investigating computational models of student emotion. In this talk, we explore the role that affective computing can play in next-generation interactive learning environments, with a particular focus on affect recognition, affect understanding, and affect synthesis in game-based learning.	3delight;affective computing;computational model;reinforcement learning	James C.

But some knowledge-in-use is required to respond adequately to these complex situations, thus virtual training seems to be the obvious choice. In order to develop a virtual training environment, we need an understanding of the underlying learning processes. This paper explicates a theory-driven design process of a virtual training environment and its application in a German state police department. We conceptualize how the acquisition of knowledge-in-use in virtual training environments takes place and focus on what is possible in virtual training.

Students learned about resource recycling and classification through an instructional website based on the teaching tool of WebQuest. There were 103 sixth-grade students participating in this study and broken down into three groups: traditional instruction, traditional instruction with WebQuest and WebQuest instruction with outdoors. The major contribution of this study is the introduction of WebQuest into the outdoor instruction. The results of this study show that using WebQuest in outdoor instruction influences students’ learning performance positively. Two other interesting results are: (1) when WebQuest was used in real situations, students could acquire more knowledge and experiences, and (2) in the learning activity of the experiment, the students accomplished different learning tasks and expressed their own opinions and perspectives, which could foster their critical thinking skills. On the other hands, the students in outdoor situation could be positive to participate in learning activity; furthermore, they could ponder the learning contents by observing the real context and then they began to classify/categorize the resources. These findings will contribute to the development of teaching and learning for government, schools and teachers; for instance, teachers act as assistants or tutors and provide students with others public network resources, including PDAs, smartphones, tablet personal computers or the Internet, to improve their learning in outdoor learning environments, such as campus, museums or zoos. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Do these strategies differ in learning effectiveness? In the present study, a hypermedia learning environment about cell biology was investigated. The graphical properties of a content module were created in two different ways, either depicting close-up views of the cell organelles or with connecting lines between the cell organelles and their respective technical terms within the graphic of the whole cell. Students' post test performance indicate that connecting lines fostered auditory recall, that is remembering and understanding of narrative information, more efficiently than close-up views. In the case of visual recall, that is identification of electron microscopic pictures depicting cell structures, there was no difference in performance between these two visualization techniques. Transfer performance depended on an interaction between visualization technique and students' spatial ability: Only students with high spatial ability benefited from the connecting lines variant. With respect to auditory recall and transfer performance, the present study supports the structure mapping effect as proposed by the integrated model of text and picture comprehension. Especially students with low spatial ability seem to be prone to an illusion of knowing.

We analyze examples of these tensions from our own research in an after-school, design research program and relate them to findings from other research that explored using collaborative learning systems in classrooms. We apply dialogism to describe factors that contribute to students’ perception of these classroom experiences as ones that do or do not foster collaboration, including the culture of the classroom, the affordances of the technologies used to mediate collaboration, and the role of multivocality in the classroom. Students are using, reusing, and appropriating media in creative ways outside of their school settings while teachers are increasingly incorporating related emerging technologies such as wikis, blogs, and chat rooms into their classrooms. By understanding the factors that contribute to dialogism, educators will be better equipped to create classroom cultures and design environments to encourage collaboration among students.	blog;chat room;computation;computer science;experience;interdependence;new media;pseudonymity;second life;theory;virtual world;wiki	Sarita Yardi Schoenebeck;Dan Perkel	2007			knowledge management;multimedia;communication;pedagogy	HCI	-64.3427972056174	-38.05307943807247	180389

f9e2899381eb51f063fc124a3faaf5dfdb172591	mycalendar: supporting children on the autism spectrum to learn language and appropriate behaviour		This paper 1 presents a study in which a mobile visual calendar application, `MyCalendaru0027 was used to try to support communication and interaction of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. This paper reports findings on how the App was used in school classrooms. MyCalendar was evaluated with 11 children in an Australian Autism Special Education Unit over six months and was found to stimulate excitement with video and photo sharing as well as interaction in specific classroom activities. Our previous work examined interactions between home and school, and interactions at home supported by MyCalendar. This analysis focuses entirely on interactions at school by examining data from classroom activities. Three findings revealed: (1) the MyCalendar application supports learning activities in the classroom and facilitates the inclusion of children with ASD who have limited verbal skills. The sharing of each childu0027s personal experience enabled the teachers and children to form a common basis for communication and adding vocabulary, as well as allowing the teacher to model language so as to identify childrenu0027s emotions; (2) MyCalendar allowed children with limited verbal skills to better communicate their real interests through photos and videos. This enabled the teacher to better identify each childu0027s interest and thereby scaffold more relevant and meaningful learning; (3) Understanding interests enabled teachers to successfully motivate children to interact more in formal learning activities. While it was initially expected the activities would better support communication between teacher and children, the larger and unanticipated effect has been to create opportunities for structuring and scaffolding communication and social interaction in the classroom.	calendaring software;experience;human computer;human–computer interaction;vocabulary	Muhammad Haziq Lim Abdullah;Margot Brereton	2017		10.1145/3152771.3152793	multimedia;computer science;pedagogy;autism;social relation;meaningful learning;autism spectrum disorder;formal learning;special education;socialization;vocabulary	HCI	-71.43383584888932	-42.27016503485259	180877
2d44a806ed4ae8e5bb53caf502696d57d530a1d1	transforming the educational settings: innovative designs and applications of learning technologies and learning environments		In recent years, technology-enhanced learning (TEL) has become a popular and important trend of educational settings. Researchers have designed and developed many extensive computerized learning environments and technologies, which not only enable learners to access rich information, but also situate them in learning contexts for solving problems via collecting data, analyzing data, interpreting findings, and making inferences (Wu & Tsai, 2007; Yang, Newby, & Bill, 2008). The objective of this special issue is to provide an opportunity for researchers to share their studies and exchange their research experiences and findings of developing and employing innovative learning environments and learning technologies. The scope of this special issue includes mobile and TEL, digital game-based learning, innovative applications of TEL, and innovative e-learning strategies or tools. The environments and strategies as well as the research issues presented in the submitted papers had to be thoroughly evaluated via collecting data from practical applications. To ensure the quality of the special issue, all of the submissions have gone through a double-blind review. After three rounds of review, a total of seven papers were accepted. The topics of these accepted papers include mobile learning, digital game-based learning, Mindtools, and epistemic beliefs regarding web information searching. As indicated by several previous studies, these topics are important trends of TEL (Hsu et al., 2012; Hwang, 2014; Hwang & Wu, 2012). Owing to the rapid advancement of mobile and wireless communication technologies, mobile TEL has been recognized as an important research topic for both formal and informal learning (Hwang & Wu, 2014). Several terms, such as seamless learning (Wong & Looi, 2011), mobile learning (Sharples, 2000), ubiquitous learning, and context-aware ubiquitous learning (Hwang, Tsai, & Yang, 2008), are related to this topic. In this special issue, three papers studied the use of mobile technology in learning. In the paper entitled “Enculturating seamless language learning through artifact creation and social interaction processes,” Wong, Chai, Aw and King present a study that employed mobile and wireless communication technologies to support language learning through artifact creation and social interactions. Another paper entitled “Learning English through action: a study of mobile-assisted language learning” focuses on the use of mobile technology in language learning, while the third study entitled “The benefits of a challenge: student motivation and flow experience in tablet-PC-game-based learning” aimed to bring in the gaming issue to investigate the students’ learning motivation and flow experience using mobile devices. From these studies, several new aspects or applications of employing mobile technologies in educational settings are observed, that is, the artifact creation-based mobile learning strategy, English phrase learning using mobile devices, and mobile gaming approaches. Digital game-based learning is also becoming a popular research trend of educational technology (Hwang & Wu, 2012).

In the study a course for Basic Life Support training has been evaluated and two game design patterns have been applied to the course. The hypotheses evaluated in this paper relate to game design patterns that have been used for learning functions, expected to enhance the learning outcome and user experience. An experimental design has been carried out in order to get insight about effects of individual and combined game patterns in a Basic Life Support course. Based on the according educational objectives, the effects of two different game design patterns relevant for learning (a timer pattern and a score pattern) have been evaluated. This game was prototypically developed targeting the application on the healthcare domain (basic life support). The results show a significant interaction effect of the two patterns on the learning gain, as well as a strong covariate influence of the learners’ age.	design of experiments;design pattern;experiment;game theory;timer;user experience	Sebastian Kelle;Roland Klemke;Marcus Specht	2013	Educational Technology & Society		computer simulation;computer literacy;design;simulation;computer science;multimedia;pedagogy;anxiety	HCI	-75.26350111586139	-42.50834122295098	181556
0fbf830ef6502706ade5ec2d3eeb4421c2bc2485	automatic detection of reflective thinking in mathematical problem solving based on unconstrained bodily exploration		For technology (like serious games) that aims to deliver interactive learning, it is important to address relevant mental experiences such as reflective thinking during problem solving. To facilitate research in this direction, we present the weDraw-1 Movement Dataset of body movement sensor data and reflective thinking labels for 26 children solving mathematical problems in unconstrained settings where the body (full or parts) was required to explore these problems. Further, we provide qualitative analysis of behaviours that observers used in identifying reflective thinking moments in these sessions. The body movement cues from our compilation informed features that lead to average F1 score of 0.73 for automatic detection of reflective thinking based on Long Short-Term Memory neural networks. We further obtained 0.79 average F1 score for end-to-end detection of reflective thinking periods, i.e. based on raw sensor data. Finally, the algorithms resulted in 0.64 average F1 score for period subsegments as short as 4 seconds. Overall, our results show the possibility of detecting reflective thinking moments from body movement behaviours of a child exploring mathematical concepts bodily, such as within serious game play.

Additionally, new trends within the current usage of e.g. the Internet can be observed which show interesting approaches. These approaches might be reasonable and beneficial to further improve lectures and interaction with students by enabling these processes themselves to be community-oriented and based on Web X.0 principles. This paper shows how to integrate new recent trends from Internet technologies into the campus. We propose a system where students are able to use their mobile devices to do some kind of visual twittering (e.g. capture short video sequences and enhance these with additional data like GPS position, time, etc.). A campus-wide community will be developed, which provides access to these files, allows for following fellow students and friends and automatically generates an overview of the most important distinct events during the course of day for a given sub-community (e.g. students from the department of Computer Science). Based upon the introduction of the general scenario, the paper presents basic algorithms and technology needed for the realisation and a first evaluation.	algorithm;computer science;global positioning system;internet;mobile device;mobile phone;pervasive informatics;video clip	Michael Wittke;Sven Tomforde;Yaser Chaaban;Jürgen Brehm	2009			mobile search;mobile web;mobile computing	HCI	-67.82453114211215	-41.168172799519304	181912

By combining available research on the design of small interfaces with existing guidelines for developing learner-centered desktop software, we describe some of the design considerations and tradeoffs of developing learner-centered handheld software. We present initial design guidelines for balancing these constraints, describe their application to the development of Pocket PiCoMap, and discuss ongoing classroom tests of this software.	concept map;desktop computer;handheld game console;mobile device;pocket pc	Kathleen Luchini;William Bobrowsky;Michael Curtis;Chris Quintana;Elliot Soloway	2002		10.1109/WMTE.2002.1039230	human–computer interaction;computer science;software design;software construction;multimedia;computer engineering	HCI	-69.69218228434815	-40.6533142603575	181939

This paper describes the design of the MobileGame prototype, exploring the opportunities to support learning through an orientation game in a university setting. The paper first introduces the scenario and then describes the general architecture of the prototype. The main part of the paper focuses on the evaluation of design issues and the effects observed in two trials. Design issues include: Supporting work on the move poses difficult interface questions, the accuracy of current outdoor, and indoor positioning systems is still problematic and the game requires near real-time response time. The evaluation of the effects shows that features such as ‘map-navigation’ and ‘hunting and hiding’ lead to excitement and fun. The participants immerse into a mixed reality that augments both physical and social space. The game success is based on the motivating design of the game itself. The paper concludes with open issues for future research, especially with the need to thoroughly evaluate the learning benefits.	blackwell (series);diploma;dirk helbing;immersion (virtual reality);indoor positioning system;microsoft outlook for mac;mixed reality;mobile game;prototype;real-time clock;real-time computing;response time (technology);switzerland;user interface	Gerhard Schwabe;Christoph Göth	2005	J.

Ultimately, we hope that our work can motivate future research efforts and bring to light opportunities to be considered in the development of mobile-based education solutions.	digital electronics;focus group;iterative design;iterative method	Rodrigo Laiola Guimarães;Andréa Britto Mattos;Carlos Henrique Cardonha	2017		10.1145/3160504.3160585	educational technology;focus group;human–computer interaction;knowledge management;computer science;intellectual disability	HCI	-73.11456696972147	-38.334953571771415	182290
0edf5516d73f98998c7e7569af11e18ad9669ba8	student usage predicts treatment effect heterogeneity in the cognitive tutor algebra i program		ABSTRACT The Cognitive Tutor Algebra I (CTAI) curriculum, which includes both textbook and online components, has been shown to boost student learning by about 0.2 standard deviations in a randomized effectiveness trial. Students who were assigned to the experimental condition varied substantially in how, and how much, the used the online component of CTAI, but original analyses of the experimental data focused on estimating average effects, and did not examine whether the CTAI treatment effect varied by the amount of style of usage. This study leverages log data from the experiment to present a more nuanced analysis. It uses the framework of Principal Stratification, which estimates the varying CTAI treatment effect as a function of “potential” usage—either how students used the program, or how they would have used it had they been assigned to the treatment condition. With experimental data, Principal Stratification does not require that we assume that all relevant variables have been measured. With this framework, we find that students who receive a medium amount of assistance from the software (in the form of hints and error feedback) experience the largest effects, with lower effects for students who receive a lot or a little; and evidence that students who do not follow the curriculum order experience smaller treatment effects.	cognitive tutor;principal stratification;randomized algorithm	Adam Sales;Asa Wilks;John Pane	2016			computer science;machine learning;artificial intelligence;educational technology;mathematics education;algebra i;cognitive tutor	HCI	-75.23470991873057	-46.48715541321793	182537

While use evaluation is discussed in the literature, there are no standard criteria and methods for how to perform assessment on use effectively. This paper asserts that use statistics have complexities that prohibit meaningful interpretation and assessment. The authors aim to discover the problems inherent in the assessment of digital collection use statistics and propose solutions to address such issues.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Design/methodology/approach#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#This paper identifies and demonstrates five inherent problems with use statistics that need to be addressed when doing assessment for digital collections using the statistics of assessment tools on local digital repositories. The authors then propose solutions to resolve the problems that present themselves upon such analysis.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Findings#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#The authors identified five problems with digital collection use statistics. Problem one is the difficulty of distinguishing different kinds of internet traffic. Problem two is the lack of direct correlation of a digital item to its multiple URLs, so statistics from external web analytics tools are not ideal. Problem three is the analytics tools’ inherent bias in statistics that are counted only in the positive way. Problem four is the different interaction between digital collections with search engine indexing. Problem five is the evaluator’s bias toward simple growing statistics over time for surmising a positive use assessment. Because of these problems, statistics on digital collections do not properly measure a digital library’s value.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Practical implications#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Findings highlight problems with current use measures and offer improvements.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Originality/value#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#This paper identifies five problems that need to be addressed before a meaningful assessment of digital collection use statistics can take place. The paper ends with a call for evaluators to try to solve or mitigate the stated problems for their digital collections in their own evaluations.	digital library;library (computing)	Joy M.

In addition to providing students with additional agency and narrative prompts, we also used badges, or achievements, to promote specific types of student behaviors. This study provides data collected from approximately 200 students enrolled in this online digital media course in which badges were used to incentivize targeted student behaviors, such as taking an exam within a certain timeframe or responding to student work with especially helpful feedback. In addition to a brief analysis of relevant achievement assessment data, we also describe our approach to the mechanics of achievement design and show some of the elements of design and layout used to incorporate the achievements into a learning management system.	digital media;interaction;noise shaping	Rudy McDaniel;Robb Lindgren;Jon Friskics	2012	2012 IEEE International Professional Communication Conference	10.1109/IPCC.2012.6408619	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia	Visualization	-73.17285259230515	-42.011397579892844	183052

Sixty-eight undergraduate students were randomly assigned to treatments (linear vs. nonlinear navigation mode) and received four criterion tests designed to measure different educational objectives immediately after interacting with the instructional material about human heart. The results suggested that matching or mismatching navigation mode of the learning environment with learners’ preference did not lead to significant differences in learning outcomes. However, there were significant differences in achievement between groups with different navigation mode preferences. Our findings indicated that students preferring nonlinear navigation had significantly higher achievement scores on higher levels of learning outcomes. Based on the results of the study, we discussed specific recommendations for instructional designers and the issue concerning matching/mismatching navigation modes with learning preferences.	automotive navigation system;gps navigation software;interaction;nonlinear system;randomness;web application	Yu-Chang Hsu;Huifen Lin;Yu-Hui Ching;Francis M.

In this workshop participants will learn from practitioners who have introduced computing and programming to young people with disabilities. They will also learn first-hand from students with disabilities about their needs in learning programming. There will be breakout sessions for participants to apply what they have learned to improve existing enrichment programs such as Alice, Arduino, Scratch, Kodu, App Inventor, Greenfoot, Lego Mindstorms, Processing, and Computer Science Unplugged.	accessibility;alice;app inventor for android;arduino;breakout box;computer science;gene ontology term enrichment;greenfoot;kodu;lego mindstorms;scratch (programming language)	Richard E.

Designing and conducting usability tests and revising documents based on user feedback sharpen students' sense of audience and the other elements of rhetorical situations throughout the different stages of the writing process. To meet the challenge of incorporating a usability project that will take just a few weeks, we have taken two alternative approaches: 1) students created and tested paper prototypes of mobile applications; and 2) students modified and tested existing products using documentation/instruction sets rather than starting from scratch. The first approach led to stronger student investment, while the second approach led to more polished final writing products. Both approaches successfully achieved desired instructor and student outcomes, and could be easily adopted and adapted.	documentation;mobile app;paper prototyping;usability testing	Sarah Summers;Anneliese Watt	2015	2015 IEEE International Professional Communication Conference (IPCC)	10.1109/IPCC.2015.7235831	usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;think aloud protocol;web usability;component-based usability testing;cognitive walkthrough;simulation;usability;rhetoric;human–computer interaction;agile usability engineering;computer science;system usability scale;usability engineering;universal usability;linguistics;multimedia;heuristic evaluation;usability lab;usability inspection	HCI	-64.86998698305152	-44.934127285988396	183543

The subjects consisted of 103 fourth graders from an elementary school in central Taiwan. They were divided into three groups: multidimensional concept map (MCM) instruction group, Novak concept map (NCM) instruction group, and traditional textbook (TT) instruction group. Four weeks of experimental instructions were given to the three groups, respectively. Students’ progresses were examined by pre-test and post-test measurements. The experimental results suggested that subjects in the MCM group performed significantly better than those in the NCM group which in turn performed significantly better than those in the TT group. Pedagogical implications were addressed, and conclusion and some suggestions were given. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
